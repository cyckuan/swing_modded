STROHMEYER PROMPTS LOS ANGELES COUNTY ADOPTION STUDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; After hearing dramatic testimony from the adoptive parents of
convicted killer Jeremy Strohmeyer, the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday ordered a review of county policies about
disclosing the biological history of children up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer was sentenced to life in prison for sexually
assaulting and murdering 7-year-old Sherrice Iverson in the
bathroom of a Nevada casino in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Beach couple who adopted him are suing the county,
alleging social workers deliberately withheld information that
their son's biological mother had a history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe we are an isolated case,'' Winnie Strohmeyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national issue,'' John Strohmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Winnie Strohmeyer testified she learned six weeks ago that her
son's birth mother had been hospitalized 60 times in state mental
institutions before his birth, and in 1976 was diagnosed a chronic
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   She said they were only told the woman used alcohol and drugs
before dropping out of high school and later ``appeared mentally
ill'' and was hospitalized at the time she gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to adopting their son, the Strohmeyers indicated in
adoption paperwork they would not accept a child for adoption whose
parents had a history of mental illness or retardation. Social
workers assured them Jeremy did not have that kind of history in
his background, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Winnie Strohmeyer testified she learned county
officials met together to ``plan the lies and deceit they would
perpetrate against our family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, we came face-to-face with our son's adoption
records,'' she said. ``We found out how we were manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael Antonovich said it is vital to parents who
adopt children to receive information about the child's biological
history so the parents can seek health care for the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having children receive early treatment will ensure the child
is properly treated and prevent a time-bomb effect on the
community,'' Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors voted unanimously to have county officials study
the policies on disclosure and report their findings and
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Smith, the attorney for the Strohmeyers, said he has
received calls from couples considering adoption, who are concerned
about how the county handles the disclosure of the biological
background of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information is commonly denied by the county,'' Smith
said. ``The adoptive system as it stands right now provides less
information for a lifelong decision than what is provided to a
car-buyer making a decision to purchase a car.''

 &HT;    Braves lose Game 3 to Yankees 6-5 in 10th
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chad Curtis hit a solo home run in the bottom of the
10th inning Tuesday night, lifting the New York Yankees to an
improbable 6-5 victory over the Braves and a 3-0 lead in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' will try to close out their second straight Series
sweep tonight at Yankee Stadium, with Roger Clemens opposing the
Braves' John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves started Tuesday night by jumping to a 5-1 lead and
ripping into the notion that this World Series was over. Trouble
for them was, the Yankees didn't stop fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees saw the Braves offensive uprising and upped the
ante. After Atlanta's 12 hits produced a 5-1 lead, the Yankees
answered with their first four home runs of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The New York hitters took aim at the shallow right-field fence
at Yankee Stadium on homers by Chad Curtis, Tino Martinez and the
game-tying two-run shot from Chuck Knoblauch in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 10th, Curtis homered to left field off Mike
Remlinger to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Tom Glavine pitched valiantly despite feeling
weak from the after-effects of the flu. He gave manager Bobby Cox
the seven innings he had requested. The Braves led 5-3 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox sent him back out for the eighth inning and watched him
surrender a first-pitch single to Joe Girardi and fall behind
Knoblauch 2-0. Knoblauch then hit a drive to right that sent Brian
Jordan sprinting for wall. Jordan got a glove on the ball at the
top of the fence but it bounced out and over for the game-tying 5-5
home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who'd scored five runs off Yankee starter Andy
Pettitte, were stifled the rest of the way by the Yankee bullpen.
They managed only three hits off Jason Grimsley, Jeff Nelson and
Mariano Rivera and failed to score from the sixth through the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Their most painful failure was in the ninth after Bret Boone led
off with a single, his fourth hit of the game. But pinch runner
Otis Nixon was thrown out trying to steal second, Chipper Jones
struck out and Brian Jordan grounded out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, not too happy about being benched in Game 2, doubled his
first three times up, giving him for in a row counting a pinch-hit
double in the ninth inning of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   He set the tone for a rejuvenated Braves offense, which had had
seven hits in 58 at-bats (.121) in the first two games. They came
back with seven hits in their first 15 trips to the plate on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Their two hits off Pettitte in the first inning equalled their
hit total against Yankees starters Orlando Hernandez and David Cone
in each of the first two games. Seven of the nine hitters in the
Braves lineup were hitless coming into Tuesday night's game. By the
time Walt Weiss singled to right field in the fifth inning, all
seven of those batters had collected hits.
</P>
<P>
   And this was against Pettitte, who was the Yankees best pitcher
in the second half of the season with a 3.84 ERA to go along with a
9-4 record. He had won both starts of this postseason, allowing
only three earned runs in 14 2/3 innings in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine was trying to use the eighth start of his World Series
career for a little payback for his seventh. His last World Series
start had come in Game 3 of the 1996 series against the Yankees,
the first of four consecutive losses by the Braves that saw their
2-0 disintegrate in the third World Series loss of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   He was cruising toward doing just that when Curtis, hitless in a
dozen career at-bats against Glavine, stepped to the plate in the
fifth inning. Glavine had retired 13 of the last 14 Yankee batters,
but grooved a fastball come over the heart of the plate, and
watched Curtis turn on it to cut into the Braves lead 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez got in on the act with a homer to right field two
innings later.

COMMENTARY: THE WAR OVER PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS 6th graf (bgng `The second school...') to add comparison with
less moderate Republicans.) (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to make sense of the current foreign policy debate
in America, think of it like this: The key to the 20th century is
not the three world wars (I, II and the Cold War) that punctuated
it, but rather how we designed the peace that followed these wars.
The peace of Versailles was mishandled. The peace after World War
II was well managed. Remarkably, what Republicans and Democrats are
still debating today is how, and how much, America should shape the
post-Cold War peace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1919 and 1945, notes Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of
Foreign Affairs, ``America wanted to change the world, and the
world was reluctant. But in 1999, the world is eager to change _
along the lines being defined by America _ but now America is
reluctant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if you look at the world that has developed since the
end of the Cold War, ``it is based in many ways on our ideas, our
values and our products _ yet we are ambivalent about recognizing
this world as our child, so we behave at times like deadbeat
dads,'' argues the political scientist Robert Pastor, whose new
volume, ``A Century's Journey: How the Great Powers Shape the
World,'' is an extremely thoughtful examination of great-power
politics.
</P>
<P>
   This U.S. ambivalence derives from the fact that while America's
victory in the Cold War was decisive _ it eliminated any
ideological alternative to free-market capitalism and any
superpower alternative to U.S. power _ it was not complete. America
did not occupy the countries it defeated in the Cold War, a la
Germany and Japan. Therefore our ability to reshape Russia or China
is limited, and their ability to obstruct us _ either by their
weakness or their strength _ still exists.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, you can see three schools forming in the U.S.
debate. First are the ``Nutty and Energetic Republicans.'' This is
an unholy alliance of old Cold Warriors, extreme isolationists and
unilateralists, and outright fools. What binds them is a belief
that America today is overwhelmingly powerful, therefore it can
preserve a post-Cold War peace either by ignoring the world or
acting unilaterally upon it. Because they are so focused inward,
these people spurn the United Nations, even though it is ready to
do our bidding and share our burdens.
</P>
<P>
   The second school is the ``Serious but Timid Republicans,'' who
actually offer an intelligent critique of the Clinton approach to
post-Cold War peace but are often outshouted by the GOP nuts. They
agree the United States should spread free-markets, engage China
and confront tyrants like Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic.
But this group's critique of the Clinton team is that it has relied
too heavily on multilateral approaches and treaties rather than on
hard-headed U.S. power, and that it has focused far too much on
smaller problems _ Haiti, Ireland and the Balkans _ and mismanaged
the big ones _ Russia, China and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The third school is the ``Serious but Lazy Democrats.'' These
are the Clintonites. They have the right instinct _ that the
post-Cold War peace should be focused on sustainable globalization.
They understand that today's system of globalization greatly
benefits the United States, because it is our ideas, products and
people that are being most globalized. Therefore, the way to build
a post-Cold War peace is by using U.S. power to keep this system
stable, by using U.S. leverage to widen the circle of democracies,
and by using U.S. prosperity to widen the group of people who
benefit from globalization. They also understand that we can't
manage such an integrated system alone, and if we try we will
stimulate a coalition against us.
</P>
<P>
   But while they have all the right convictions, the Lazy
Democrats have the courage of those convictions only about half the
time. In Kosovo, they stuck to their guns; they did the same with
Nafta. But in April, when a deal to bring China into the WTO was
possible, they walked away because they didn't want to fight with
congressional Democrats and had not prepared the ground in advance.
Same with the Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Test Ban Treaty, WTO, U.N. dues, all failed,'' said
Pastor, ``because the nutty Republicans and the serious ones came
together. Unless the President forms a new coalition between the
serious Republicans and serious Democrats, America will not be able
to forge a post-Cold War peace.''

HACKETT SAYS HE'LL SHOULDER THE BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett said Tuesday there has been
a misconception he was not taking responsibility for the Trojans'
recent slump and placing blame solely on the team's seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the head coach is point man in the entire program,''
Hackett said. ``I think it was a misinterpretation when I said the
seniors need to step up at a time when things are not going very
well. The last thing I was doing was saying that's where the blame
should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am responsible for everything that happens, both good and
bad. I want to be brutally honest with everyone, starting with the
team, in saying here is what I think are the issues that need to be
addressed. I take that conversation very candidly to you guys. I
don't say one thing to the team and one thing to (the reporters).''
</P>
<P>
   For emphasis, Hackett repeated that he was more than willing to
assume the burden of USC's 3-4 start, and he became sensitive over
the weekend to the notion that he had escaped taking any of the
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible for the whole program, both good and bad,''
Hackett said. ``That's why they hired me.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example that he has not made excuses during USC's
three-game losing streak, Hackett said he never cited injuries,
especially quarterback Carson Palmer's broken collarbone in the
third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start pinning it on those things, you're not taking
responsibility,'' Hackett said. ``I don't believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, Hackett even criticized himself for some of
the play-calling at the end of the 35-31 loss to Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have called some better plays down the home stretch,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said everything that has happened is part of a slow
process to rebuild the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some tough things happen to us,'' he said. ``No
one would have thought, at this point, we would be 3-4. I said from
day one, this would be a process of building, learning and finding
out, as we try to build the program.''

postseason shoulder operation will require six months of
rehabilitation and he will miss spring practice.

   Steele has torn tissue in his left shoulder and he is wearing a
brace to keep the shoulder in its socket. He said the injury
occurred last season at Long Beach City College.

<P>
   ``The shoulder's real loose,'' Steele said. ``I really can't
sleep on my left side because it hurts so bad. I'm at the point
where I'm hurting, but I don't want to let the coaches know it's
hurting. I don't want it to be a cause for me not to play.''
</P>

   Steele went 34 plays against Stanford, the same as his
replacement, Darryl Knight. Linebackers coach Shawn Slocum said
Steele and Knight would continue to split time to keep Steele
fresh.

it,'' Hackett said. ``But you know R. Jay, it's a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward, who tried to avoid talking after practice, said: ``I'm
playing. It doesn't feel OK, but I'm playing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre was not sure whether he would play Chad
Curtis in Game 3 of the World Series on Tuesday night. Maybe it was
a better idea to start Ricky Ledee instead; Curtis, after all, had
not had a hit in 13 career at-bats against the Atlanta starter Tom
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis started, however, slugged a home run off Glavine in the
fifth inning, and when he led off the 10th _ two innings after
Chuck Knoblauch had tied the game with a two-run home run off
Glavine _ Curtis slammed a game-winning home run off Mike
Remlinger, to give the Yankees a 6-5 victory and a commanding lead
of three games to none in the four-of-seven-game World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will now have four chances to clinch their 25th
championship and their third title in four years. No team has ever
rebounded from a 3-0 deficit in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Yankees' 11th consecutive World Series victory, one
shy of the record.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' John Smoltz will pitch Game 4 on Wednesday night
against the Yankees' Roger Clemens, who lasted two innings in his
last start, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series.
Clemens was injured in that game, teammates say, most likely
hurting his back, and only Clemens _ who approaches baseball and
pain the way a middle linebacker might _ knows how that might
effect him on Wednesday night; he would not discuss the injury on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger relieved for the Braves to start the bottom of the
10th. Curtis fouled off a pitch, took a ball high, then ripped a
pitch over the wall in left field. Curtis threw up his arms as soon
as he made contact, and his teammates burst from the dugout to
greet him, while Remlinger and the other Braves walked off the
field disconsolately.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had been scratched from his Game 1 start because of a
stomach virus that ultimately robbed him of about five pounds.
Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said before the game that he hoped to get
``seven good innings'' from Glavine, and Glavine delivered that,
allowing only five hits; the Braves led, 5-3, after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   There had been signs that Glavine was losing his stuff _ Curtis
homered in the fifth inning, after 14 hitless at-bats in his career
against him, and Tino Martinez homered in the seventh _ and both
Remlinger and John Rocker were warming up as the eighth inning
began. But Glavine had averaged about 10 pitches an inning and Cox
stuck with him, who with Smoltz and Greg Maddux has been the heart
of the team for the last decade. The Braves needed to win on
Tuesday night and Cox entrusted the lead to Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Girardi lined a single to the opposite field _ a hitting
adjustment made by both teams _ and Knoblauch came to the plate as
the potential tying run. He had hit the ball hard twice in three
previous at-bats. Cox stuck with Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   And Knoblauch bashed a high drive to right field, where the
Braves' Brian Jordan ran back toward the wall. The 56,794 fans at
Yankee Stadium stood, many Yankees leaped out of their dugout to
follow the flight of the ball into the right-field corner. Jordan
jumped, reached back over the fence, the ball went into his glove _
and then dropped out, bouncing into the stands. Home run. Knoblauch
soared around the bases, the game tied.
</P>
<P>
   Cox then called on Rocker, who was jeered heavily by fans, and
Derek Jeter blooped a single to center. Paul O'Neill, who had not
executed a bunt in his seven-year tenure with the Yankees, tried to
drop a bunt, popped up and stood at home plate momentarily, angry
at himself. Seeing this, the Braves' Brian Hunter allowed the ball
to fall, then threw to second to start a double play; because of
his failure to run out the play, O'Neill was thrown out at first.
The game was tied into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera relieved, Bret Boone singled and Otis Nixon
pinch-ran. He tried to steal second, but Girardi threw him out,
celebrating with a pump of his fist, and justifiably so. The last
time a runner had been thrown out stealing with Rivera pitching was
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took extra batting practice Monday, each hitter
getting about 50 swings and a chance to linger in the cage and
focus on specific adjustments. Cox watched them swing and said he
thought his hitters gained confidence from the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   But practicing and applying are two different matters entirely,
and hitters from both teams were faced with similar adjustments on
Tuesday night. Both Glavine and Andy Pettitte pitch in the same
manner, attacking the outside corner when facing right-handed
batters, throwing low and outside time after time. Hitters often
stubbornly try to pull those pitches to left field and wind up
chopping ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment that right-handed hitters from both teams tried
was to punch or drive the ball to the opposite field, and the
Braves _ whose aggressiveness often overcomes them _ executed this
adjustment exceptionally.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams reached out and dumped a single to right field
leading off the game, before Bret Boone ripped a line drive to
right field; Boone's drive created a divot in the padding of the
right-field fence, only a foot or so from the top of the wall, and
Boone had a double, with Williams stopping at third. The Braves
mustered three hits in the first 17 innings of the World Series,
and they had two right away on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones grounded to third, and as Williams started home,
Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third baseman, reached out to field the
ball, intending to throw to the plate. It appeared as if he would
have nailed Williams easily. But Brosius dropped the ball, and from
his knees his only play was to throw to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte labored to keep Atlanta from scoring more runs in the
inning, at a cost of 26 pitches, and it was as if the early Braves'
hits made him tentative, which happened to him often in the first
four months of the season. Of the first 19 batters Pettitte faced
in this game, he threw a ball on the first pitch to 11, falling
behind in the count right away. Pettitte twice faced Walt Weiss,
the Braves' weak-hitting No. 9 batter, and both times Pettitte fell
behind in the count, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the score in the bottom of the first, using the
adjustment, driving the ball to the opposite field: Jordan failed
to catch Knoblauch's line smash, the ball dropping out of his
glove, and O'Neill punched a game-tying single to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Boone again drove a double to the wall in right-center field
leading off the third inning, advanced to third base on a ground
ball and scored when Jordan slapped a single to right. Andruw Jones
blooped a single to left, and when Jose Hernandez pulled a double
into the left-field corner, Jordan and Jones both scored. Braves 4,
Yankees 1.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte took off his hat and wiped the sweat from his brow, and
Jason Grimsley was throwing in the Yankees' bullpen. Pettitte
didn't seem long for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   After Gerald Williams hammered a triple off the center-field
wall _ it appeared Bernie Williams misplayed the ball at the fence
and probably should have caught the ball _ Boone hit his third
double, into the left-field corner. &QL;

<P>
   In his first foreign policy announcement as president-elect,
Fernando de la Rua advised former Gen. Lino Oviedo of Paraguay,
exiled in Argentina since March when he was accused of
masterminding the assassination of his country's vice president,
that he will no longer be welcome. Oviedo's presence has caused

   A criminal court judge has ordered President Jamil Mahuad to
testify in an investigation into allegations that contributions to
his election campaign last year were diverted and has also issued a
writ for the arrest of Ramon Yulee, who was Mahuad's campaign
treasurer. The actions were taken after a prominent banker, jailed
since July on charges that he had misused bank funds, said a
donation of $3.1 million that he made to Mahuad's run was never
declared.

</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, now a fugitive from justice

   German leaders have reached a compromise on the delivery of a

who say the delivery breaks coalition agreements not to send
weapons to countries with questionable human rights records, the
Krauss Maffei Wegmann company will be allowed to deliver one tank
with a special precision cannon to Turkey for a year's test run.
Turkey is seeking to buy around 1,000 tanks worth about $8 billion.

COMPAQ REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS OF $140 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer &UR;  &LR; reported Tuesday that it earned $140 million in
the third quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations despite
sluggish sales. The company, which has been plagued by bloated
costs and management turmoil, took a charge of $868 million to
cover severance pay and other cutbacks, which was offset by a gain
of $1.2 billion on the sale of most of Altavista, the Internet
search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding those one-time events, Compaq earned 7 cents a share.
Analysts had expected 5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   It posted sales of $9.2 billion, up 5 percent from a year
earlier. But revenue was down by 2 percent from the second quarter
and below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter was the first under the command of Michael Capellas,
who became chief executive in July. In April, Capellas'
predecessor, Eckhard Pfeiffer, was forced out as chief executive
after the company warned that earnings would fall short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's shares closed at $19.50, up 56.25 cents. They had hit a
52-week low of $18.25 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, Capellas said his top priorities were to
stabilize the company's business, cut costs and simplify its
product line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may sacrifice market share in order to return to profitable
growth,'' Capellas said. The company plans to cut $2 billion in
annual expenses, largely by eliminating 7,000 jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Capellas' plan sounded sensible but that it
was too soon to say whether it would return Compaq to vibrant
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are making progress,'' said Andrew J. Neff, an analyst
with Bear Stearns. ``But you have one dot on a graph. It's too soon
to draw a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's turmoil comes as its Texas rival, Dell Computer,
continues to post solid gains in sales, profits and market share.
Indeed, in the third quarter, Dell edged past Compaq for the first
time to become the No. 1 seller of personal computers in the United
States. Compaq remained the worldwide leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq is in a tough position,'' said Neff. ``The market they
are in is getting much more competitive even as they are taking
steps to downsize their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq for the first time broke down its sales and earnings
according to its three major product lines: consumer PCs,
Commercial PCs, and bigger computers and services.
</P>
<P>
   This disclosure showed that Compaq's commercial PC unit is the
most troubled. Its sales dropped by 12 percent from a year ago to
$2.7 billion, and it lost $169 million, compared with a profit of
$116 million a year earlier. The company said the loss stemmed from
competitive pricing, a reduction in the inventory of its dealers,
and the impact of the Taiwan earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have to address our commercial PC business,''
Capellas said. He added that the company hoped to profit from new
Internet-oriented products and a move to more direct sales to
customers, bypassing dealers.
</P>
<P>
   For consumer PCs, Compaq's sales increased 15 percent to $1.5
billion, despite a sharp decline in the average price of a
computer. It earned 65 million in that category, up 51 percent from
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And in its enterprise unit, which incorporates its acquisitions
of Digital Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers along with its
other server computers, revenue grew 12 percent to $4.9 billion. It
earned $599 million, up 87 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not knocking my socks off in high-end systems,'' said
Richard Schutte, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``This is an area
where Dell is growing at 85 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Capellas said the company had not seen any slowdown yet related
to year 2000 problems. International Business Machines Corp. said
last week that it expected a sharp drop in sales of mainframe
computers over the next six months as big companies hold off
installing new systems until they are sure they can handle dates in
the new millennium. But Capellas said he expected some slowdown in
the last two months of this year.

 MSGR. JEREMIAH MONAHAN, 65, NEW YORK ARCHDIOCESE'S CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Msgr. Jeremiah P. Monahan, who as chancellor of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York served as steward of the
church's secular affairs, including financial matters, construction
projects and administration, died Monday at a hospital in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor, who was 65, entered the New York Weill Cornell
Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital on Monday complaining of
chest pain. Results of an autopsy were not available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, who is
recuperating from treatment for a brain tumor, issued a statement
saying, ``At 7 o'clock in the morning he shared breakfast with
those of us of the archbishop's residence in which he lived; at
about 10 o'clock at night we learned of his death.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan had been chancellor since 1997, working in a post
O'Connor described Tuesday as bearing ``the enormous
responsibilities of guiding the financial and administrative
support of this vast archdiocese, one of the largest and most
complex in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said, ``He
oversaw the nearly 1,000 people who work in the Terrence Cardinal
Cooke Catholic Center, the administrative headquarters of the
archdiocese, and had the final say on any human resources policies
affecting employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the 413 individual parishes control their budgets, ``he
oversaw every departmental budget and set policies to make sure
that the money was administered properly and efficiently,''
Zwilling said. Annual revenues are about $545 million; expenditures
about $527 million.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Manhattan, Monahan was educated at Cardinal Hayes High
School in the Bronx, Cathedral College Seminary in Manhattan and
St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He was ordained by Cardinal
Francis Spellman in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Though he served as pastor of several churches in the city and
suburbs early in his career, he spent most of it as an educator,
first as an English teacher at Cardinal Hayes High School in the
Bronx and then as its dean of discipline. He was revered for
opening up the world to students who knew only their tough
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he became principal of Cardinal Spellman High School,
also in the Bronx, where he made his mark as a fund-raiser, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
   He became a monsignor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor is survived by three sisters, Patricia Paoli of
Manhattan, Agnes O'Donohue of Burbank, Calif., and Catherine
Lessuck of Port Reading, N.J., and a brother, Andrew Monahan of
Yonkers.

EDITORIAL: CLEMENTE AND THE WEIGHT OF GESTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, October
27:
</P>
<P>
   There is always something disembodying about the hours spent in
an art museum. The substantive world rises up around you in bronze,
marble, porcelain and wood, in the interlaced texture of paper, the
rough surface of paint. And yet it is all held at a distance,
intangible except to the eye. Even abstract painting makes a
gestural appeal to the body, which nearly always goes unanswered by
the viewer. Deep taboo is what keeps you from fondling a Brancusi
or running your fingers over the strands of pigment that wind
through a Pollock. If you like, you may face Ingres' portrait of
Ferdinand-Philippe-Louis-Charles-Henri, Duc d'Orleans, now visiting
the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and try to capture in your own
posture the hauteur of that regal left arm. But you may not even
think about rubbing the frame.
</P>
<P>
   The place where a sense of disembodiment strikes hardest right
now is the Guggenheim Museum and its retrospective of Francesco
Clemente's work, which will hang until Jan. 9, 2000. It is always
tempting to impute a feeling of disequilibrium to the works being
exhibited at the Guggenheim. Usually it is just the architecture
talking, the viewer's feet and legs grappling as they ramp uphill
or down while the eye, with the paintings for reference, tries to
sort out the true geometry of the place from its inherent spiral.
</P>
<P>
   But something else is going on too. From the ancient global
archive of figural representations, Clemente draws on a vision of
the body in which its mass, so to speak, is its momentum, the
weight of the flesh reduced to gesture. He rarely suggests the
dimensionality _ the rotund worldliness _ that is so much a part of
Ingres' work. Space is not the context in which Clemente imagines
the human figure. The body no longer stands apart from its world,
towering into the foreground like the subject of one of Ingres'
remarkable portrait-drawings _ Charles-Francois Mallet, for
instance, who seems to loom halfway out of the frame. Instead,
Clemente's paintings invoke the body's apertures, the places where
we are ported into the world or the world into us. The eye is still
foremost among those apertures, but not as singly graced as it once
was.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the viewer is admitted to Clemente's sensory, mythic
dance only by eye. We stand there, gazing, resolved in our own
foreground, more like Ingres' Mallet than like the entwined,
gold-leaf figures in ``Usary of Love'' or the synoptic, caged beast
in ``Unborn.'' But the strength of Clemente's work is not only its
material prodigiousness and the near-surfeit of symbolic relations.
It is also its ability to make the viewer feel naked and clothed,
feral and aloof at the same time, poised on weary bones before
another painting and yet caught somehow in an elemental embrace.

BROCK THINKS BIG
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Avengers, the only pro football team in Los
Angeles, took two important steps in franchise history Tuesday,
introducing Stan Brock as head coach and revealing their
cutting-edge uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Brock is a former NFL offensive lineman with the
New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers. He became a natural
choice for the Arena Football League club after resurrecting the
AFL's Portland franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have one opportunity to hire the first head coach in
our history,'' owner Casey Wasserman said. ``Stan turned around the
arena team in Portland that had been in disarray, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman said he received positive recommendations about Brock
from San Diego Chargers general manager Bobby Beathard, Detroit
Lions coach Bobby Ross and Indianapolis Colts coach Jim Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out and talked to some name guys,'' Wasserman said.
``But the more we got into the process, we saw we needed a guy who
could start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock didn't sound like a typical expansion-franchise football
coach Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to say we'll win five or six games. If
something good happens, maybe eight wins,'' Brock said. ``I need to
put a winner out on the field. That's the biggest thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really appeals to me about starting over. The nice
thing is I consider myself a builder. I don't think it will be as
hard as in Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the Avengers would hold tryouts in Los Angeles, San
Diego and Las Vegas, as well as adding players through the Arena
League's dispersal draft.
</P>
<P>
   The uniforms will certainly make the Avengers unique: red
helmets, red home and white road jerseys, and white home and blue
road pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do black and teal, those are kind of also-ran
colors,'' Wasserman said. ``We're the only team with a red helmet.
Our quarterback can't made an excuse about throwing an interception
because he couldn't see the helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers are already off to a fast start with the fans, with
2,000 season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pleased with the response. In (the Staples Center),
we are the most affordable team,'' Wasserman said. ``I promise
people it will be the most exciting sport in the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will cost $7 to $38. And as Wasserman pointed out, ``If
the ball goes in the stands, you keep it.''

ROBITAILLE BACK ON SCORING TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After going without a point for four games, Luc
Robitaille appears to have regained his scoring touch.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, whose drought came after being named the first NHL
Player of Week of the young season, has goals in two consecutive
games and nine for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Against San Jose on Sunday, Robitaille scored his fifth power
play goal, tying him with the Sharks' Owen Nolan for the league
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period Tuesday against Washington, Robitaille
redirected a blast from the point from Aki Berg to cut the Capitals
lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was classic Robitaille, positioning himself in front of the
net and poking it past goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I've ever seen Luc score a goal beyond two
feet,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said with a grin. ``He is a scorer.
Period. He can smell them.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in close to the opposing net can take its toll
physically. After several off years, Robitaille has improved his
conditioning the past few seasons and responded with 39 goals in
1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be pretty grinding in there,'' Robitaille said. ``It
became clear that if I was going to stay in there, I had to do
something. The other teams are getting bigger all the time. But the
work has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille's goal was the 526th of his 14-year NHL career.
Sunday, he passed Bryan Trottier for 21st place all-time. He did
not score his ninth goal last season until Nov. 10, the Kings 15th
game.
</P>
<P>
   __ What's in Storr: Goaltender Jamie Storr made his first start
in nearly three weeks and gave up a short-handed goal in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings defense stiffened in the second and Storr didn't
face a shot for the first 11 minutes of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Watching closely was the Kings goaltending consultant Don
Edwards, who worked extensively with Storr during the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very helpful for me,'' Storr said. ``He is not
only a good guy and a good coach, he is a friend who is very good
at making adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' role with the team has changed dramatically since last
season, when he was a full-time assistant for former coach Larry
Robinson. Edwards said the adjustment often has been difficult but
said he does not regret turning down assistant offers last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is in high school and I didn't feel like I wanted
to do that to the family,'' said Edwards, who lives in El Segundo.
``I like working with these guys. They like to hard work.''

JESSIE FOVEAUX, 100, DIES; SOLD HER FIRST BOOK AT 98 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million
when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn.,
where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a
snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale
when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior
citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ``Any
Given Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to
publish the book.
</P>
<P>
   In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a
woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to
an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to
support her eight children before and after the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, never intended for publication, ``just poured out,''
said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing
class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ``She had bottled it
up for many, many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was
clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her
decision to divorce, she wrote, ``I made up my mind to live my life
so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to
write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in
1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, which had
received a copy that Kempthorne had sent. The article set off a
frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.
</P>
<P>
   The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing
``very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only
insignificantly for publication. ``We in New York try to sit here
and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ``This is
Kansas talking.''
</P>
<P>
   The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported
her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took
limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was
written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of
salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess
like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not
a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it
received.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when
the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood
was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved
frequently, to Arkansas and Washington state, among other places.
As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with
a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died,
and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her
book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder,
Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion,
of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24
great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if
she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back,
``They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family
members bursting into nervous laughter.

EDITORIAL: THE PRO-GUN CONGRESS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 27:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's approval in May of several common-sense gun control
measures raised hopes that Congress would respond to the massacre
at Columbine High School by making it harder for juveniles, felons
and those with a record of mental illness to obtain deadly
firepower. But as President Clinton sadly acknowledged this week,
the House-Senate committee addressing the issue remains deadlocked,
which means that Congress is likely to go home without doing
anything on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Sadder still, Republican leaders are quite content with this
dismal denouement. ``This is a pro-gun House,'' proclaimed the
House majority whip, Tom DeLay, recently, explaining the
Republicans' refusal to accept the reasonable Senate provision
extending the Brady law's background check requirement to all
gun-show sales _ the major sticking point in the negotiations.
Indeed, DeLay has been using gun control as a fund-raising tool.
``Clinton and the anti-gun lobby are using the tragedies at
Columbine High School and Georgia to stop you exercising your right
to own a gun and protect your family!'' he said in a recent letter.
</P>
<P>
   Unless congressional Republicans with the gumption to buck the
National Rifle Association suddenly emerge to shove their party in
the right direction, gun control will die, and a historic
opportunity for progress will have been missed.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, MELVIN MORA? 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Watching the 1999 Atlanta Braves morph into the 1998
San Diego Padres in this World Series, I cannot help but think
about Melvin Mora, the overnight sensation, after nine years in the
bushes, who became the Mets' surprise weapon in the last weeks of
their season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves were blowing their lead on Tuesday night, and
losing to the Yankees, 6-5, on Chad Curtis' homer in the 10th
inning to fall three games down in this now terminal World Series,
my thoughts meandered to what the World Series might have been like
if Senor Mora were roaming the outfield, wherever Bobby Valentine
needed him.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't Mora and the other Mets have done as well the Braves
have done? On Tuesday night the Braves had a 5-1 lead with a
pitcher, Tom Glavine, just getting over a debilitating flu. Bobby
Cox let Glavine pitch into the eighth, by which time the Yankees
had tied the score on three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Since being leveled Friday night, Glavine had barely begun to
eat. Soup and crackers may not be the right diet to face the Bronx
Brutes. Then there is the question of whether Glavine's illness
threw off Greg Maddux and Kevin Millwood, both of whom had to move
up their starts by a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're logging a lot of innings by this time of year,'' Cox
said on Tuesday night. ``You're not getting much sleep. But you're
not tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night, there was still the possibility that
the Braves would bounce back. After all, the Yankees had lost the
first two games of the 1996 World Series at home _ and have now won
11 straight World Series games. No team has ever come back from a
3-0 deficit in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have never got untracked. Watching balls whisk past
and under and through the double-play combination of Ozzie Guillen
and Keith Lockhart Sunday evening, I felt the Mets' middle
infielders would not have given the Yankees a seven-run head start.
</P>
<P>
   The manager needed some runs Sunday, so he benched Walt Weiss to
get Guillen's bat in the lineup. But with all due respect, I came
down with a serious flashback to the mid-80s when Davey Johnson
would stick Howard Johnson at shortstop instead of Rafael Santana,
thereby throwing off the entire Mets defense. Ever since, I have
taken the position that shortstop is too important a position to
tinker with.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was back on Tuesday night, and so was the regular second
baseman, Bret Boone, contributing three doubles and a single, but
it is quite possible that the Yankees are simply too good, what
with their patience, their key hits, their base running, their
resourceful starters, their fine tandem of catchers. Just
everything.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not perfect _ as the movie said, there's no
perfection in baseball _ but they do enough things right that it
has been a pleasure to watch them. Then again, the Braves were
comatose at home, and there's no excuse for that. Maybe the series
with the Mets took something out of them, although that is not
supposed to happen in a sport of technique rather than a sport of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night there was the scenario of Yankee fans meeting
John Rocker, a marriage made in heaven or some otherworldly place.
The Yankee fans began chanting at him the moment he went to the
bullpen. He never responded, and got the Braves out of trouble in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees going ahead by three games, I can't help but
think the Mets would have given the Yankees a better fight in those
first two games in a pumped-up Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   I was originally concerned about a Subway Series (in our New
York grandiosity, we capitalize it), but maybe it would not have
been so bad, after all.
</P>
<P>
   I had been afraid of fighting in the aisles of the stadiums,
given the thuggish behavior of New York fans toward Boston and
Atlanta visitors in the first round. But even an 80-20 split in the
two New York stadiums would have neutralized the tough guys who
preyed on lone Braves and Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night I didn't happen to see anybody beating up on
Braves fans. But then again, I didn't see anybody brave enough to
wear Braves garb. It's not worth dragging out the regalia on
Wednesday night. The Yankees and their fans can smell victory.
They've got their Chad Curtis. Baseball fans can only dream of the
better series that might have taken place with Melvin Mora _ that
reincarnation of Mickey, Willie and the Duke roaming the outfield
in a Subway Series. &QL;

YANKEES GO DEEP, NEAR REPEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Braves manager Bobby Cox expected Tom Glavine to
pitch seven strong innings last night.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that twice before the game, and he was right.
Glavine was sufficiently recovered from the flu to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cox got greedy, and it will likely cost him the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine gave up a game-tying two-run homer to Chuck Knoblauch in
the eighth inning, and Chad Curtis smacked a 10th-inning home run
off Braves reliever Mike Remlinger, lifting the New York Yankees to
a 6-5 victory in Game 3 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' Curtis said. ``I don't think I've ever
hit a walk-off \Rgame-ending\S home run in the regular season.
Somewhere between second and third, electricity was running through
my legs. Rounding third, seeing my teammates at home plate in a
World Series, it was special.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis hit two of the four home runs that allowed the Yankees to
erase the Braves' 5-1 lead and go up 3-0 in the Series and close in
on repeating as world champions. As the Braves remember from the
National League Championship Series, no team in major-league
history has ever lost the first three games of best-of-seven series
and came back to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big one to lose,'' Cox said. ``We were on our way
to getting right back into this. We lost a tough one in Game 1,
too. We could have been up 2-1 rather than down 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, threatening to pump some life in the Series, led 5-1
through four innings. But the Yankees stayed close, getting solo
home runs from Curtis in the fifth and Tino Martinez in the seventh
to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, working with economy of effort, had thrown only 72
pitches through seven innings, a low number for starting pitchers,
and given up five hits. But he was also coming back from the flu,
which forced the Braves to scratch him from his Game 1 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Glavine was throwing great,'' Cox said. ``I know
everybody is going to ask me why I left him, but he didn't want to
come out. I asked him, and he said no. \RPitching coach\S Leo
Mazzone said he was throwing great, Tommy said he was throwing
great and I thought he was throwing great. We thought he would
breeze through the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Joe Girardi led off the eighth with a single to
right, but Cox, even with closer John Rocker ready in the bullpen,
stayed with Glavine. Knoblauch took two balls, then hit a high fly
ball down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Braves right fielder Brian Jordan got back to the wall near the
314-foot sign and made a leaping attempt. He did get his glove on
it as he reached over the wall but he couldn't hold it. The ball
popped loose for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pop-up,'' Glavine said. ``It wouldn't have gone out of any
other park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I hit it in Yankee Stadium,'' Knoblauch retorted. ``I
was just trying to hit it hard. I got good wood on it and hit it
far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker got the Braves out of the eighth and through the ninth
inning. But Yankees closer Mariano Rivera also pitched two
scoreless innings, giving Curtis his chance against Remlinger in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He made good by blasting a 1-1 pitch over the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge what he did tonight,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``We're not home run hitters, but sometimes those things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, perhaps helped by extra batting practice on Monday's
off-day workout, went to work early on Yankees starter Andy
Pettitte, hammering him for five runs in 3 2/3 innings. Bret Boone
had a three doubles and Jose Hernandez also had a two-run double,
giving the Braves a 5-1 lead
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down 5-1, and it was a little quiet in our dugout,''
Torre said. ``Then Chad hit one out and things picked up. We don't
quit. We're grinders. We play nine innings. The highest compliment
I can give this team is they play nine innings. When you do that,
good things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine looked sharp enough to keep that from happening. He did
it for seven innings. The eighth inning did him in. The Braves will
have a whole winter to ponder that.

SPROTS COLUMN: FOR YANKS, A CLOSER WHO IS TAKEN FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before he warms up in the Yankee bullpen, Mariano
Rivera picks up a lead ball that weighs between two and three
pounds. Holding it in his right hand, he swings it around and
around, across his body, up and down for a few minutes. It makes a
real baseball seem lighter and smaller. And to the hitters he faces
after arriving at the mound, it's as if he were throwing that lead
ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves discovered that on Tuesday night when Rivera spun the
last two innings as the Yankees won, 6-5, in the 10th inning on
Chad Curtis' second homer for a 3-0 bulge in a World Series that
could end on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian right-hander known as Mo has posted numbing
numbers in this post-season: 7 appearances, 11 innings, 9 hits, 0
runs, 9 strikeouts, 1 walk, 0.00 earned run average, 5 saves, 2-0
record.
</P>
<P>
   Counting his last 28 appearances in a regular season in which he
had 45 saves and a 1.83 era, he has not allowed a run in his last
412/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the various positions a baseball team must fill in
assembling a winning team, a bullpen ``closer'' is the most
coveted. Without a quality closer, no team can expect to preserve
enough victories to win a division, a pennant or a World Series.
And of all the current closers, Rivera is so good now that he seems
to be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How hard he throws, how much command he has of his stuff is
probably the thing that makes me feel good about him,'' Manager Joe
Torre said when asked about Rivera's attributes. ``I've had Lee
Smith, John Wetteland and Tom Henke, sometimes ball one, ball two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so different from that type of reliever, and yet he has
the ability to strike you out,'' Torre continued. ``From last year
to this year, he has learned to get people out without worrying
about striking them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is what Goose Gossage was to the Yankees of two decades
ago with his flaming fastball, what Joe Page was to the Yankees of
half a century ago, what Bruce Sutter was to the Cubs and the
Cardinals with his split-fingered fastball, what Dennis Eckersley
was to the Athletics with his virtually perfect control.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tributes to Derek Jeter and Orlando Hernandez
lately, Mariano Rivera is arguably the most indispensable Yankee,
the closer who slams the door on even the thought of a ninth-inning
uprising. And at a slenderly muscled 6 feet 2 inches and 170
pounds, he does it with such seemingly effortless consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is the one who gives me the strength and power,'' he said
when asked to explain his success. ``Then I just throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded that dozens of other major league pitchers have
similar strength and power but don't use it nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have to have something special,'' he said. ``I think
I do. Maybe I do, but I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's coaches and teammates know what it is, what they call
great mechanics: his being able to not only get maximum speed and
control out of his windup, release and follow-through, but also
being able to repeat those mechanics game after game, week after
week, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's got a loose wrist,'' Tony Cloninger, the Yankees'
bullpen coach, said. ``He gets a lot of his speed and movement at
the last minute with that wrist snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who doesn't throw a curveball, has three different
fastballs in his arsenal: a two-seam fastball that moves in on
right-handed batters, and two cut fastballs to left-handed batters,
one that moves in, one that moves in and down. He throws an
occasional slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He remembers what I told him the first time I ever saw him in
the Instructional League,'' Cloninger said. ``That the most
important pitch is strike one.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rivera walked the first Red Sox batter to face him Sept. 11
in Fenway Park, it was the first time he had walked his first
batter in more than a year, since July 9, 1998, at Tampa Bay. In 69
innings during the recent season, he walked only 18 while fanning
52.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's warming up,'' Cloninger said, ``he wants to know who
the hitter is and what the count is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera usually doesn't arrive in the bullpen until the fifth or
sixth inning. Until then, he stays in the clubhouse and watches the
game on television, especially how the opposing batters are
reacting to pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how I get ready mentally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the bullpen, Rivera begins exercising with the lead ball
and enjoying the byplay of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just sits there and laughs at me and Allen Watson getting
on each other,'' Jason Grimsley said. ``But when it's time, he's
ready. He's turned his arm into a thunderbolt. He's as consistent a
pitcher as you'll find. No matter how he feels, he's the same
pitcher every time.''
</P>
<P>
   And being the same pitcher is all the Yankees ask.  &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DEATH, warmed over, in many ways can be more painful, even less
acceptable, than during the initial shock wave. At Champions Golf
Club, there was no relief from the news that Payne Stewart had lost
his life in a plane that flew itself for four hours, then spiraled
out of the sky from 40,000 feet and crashed in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was on his way to Houston, via Dallas, to compete in a
field of 30 for the PGA's Tour Championship. When someone dies,
even someone famous and well-liked, the world can't retreat to an
attic. Several of the players showed up at Champions for their tee
times Tuesday, some dutifully facing the TV cameras and tape
recorders, still groping for the right words, trying to share what
they felt.
</P>
<P>
   They were still lost in disbelief on this, the day after the
long, eerie, tragic flight to nowhere. They were trapped in that
empty, interior place where thoughts go to hide.
</P>
<P>
   John Huston had just left the driving range. The bill of his cap
was low enough that it almost touched his sunglasses. ``It's a dark
day,'' he said, unmindful of the brilliant sunlight and cloudless
sky, ``a tragic day. Playing today (in the pro-am), that would have
been difficult. Payne will be in our thoughts all week, but when we
get on the golf course, second nature will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   People grieve in their own way. The death of one of the world's
great golfers, at 42, was unspeakably sad. But speaking is part of
the grieving process. Phil Mickelson recalled late Monday how
Stewart had beaten him in this year's U.S. Open with a 15-foot putt
that was historic. Mickelson's wife was expecting their first child
at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pulled me aside,'' said Phil, ``and put his hands on my
face and said, `You're about to become a father, and it's the
greatest thing you can imagine.' For him to think about me at a
time when he just won the biggest event in golf is amazing and says
a lot about the person he was. He just had a lot of class.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mickelson appeared at the club early Tuesday morning, he
strolled out the back of the clubhouse, and his eyes swept the
scene in front of him: a few players taking practice swings at the
driving range, a small contingent of curious, early-arriving fans
milling around. Then he did an about-face, walked back to his car
and drove off. Sometimes nonverbal communication says more than
words.
</P>
<P>
   The players expressed their concern and sent their prayers to
Stewart's family _ his wife, Tracey, and his two children, Aaron
and Chelsea. Davis Love III issued a statement. Jim Furyk could not
be consoled, could not get his mouth to work.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the readers and viewers who are not necessarily
addicted to golf may be troubled by the constant references to
Payne and the ``five others who were killed.'' The other passengers
_ Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, Bruce Borland and the pilot and
co-pilot, Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue _ were friends
of his. They, too, left families and friends and futures.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that we cherish our heroes, especially those
who have that precious blend of talent and style. What was there
not to like about Payne Stewart, the only player on the tour who
honored the game's past by wearing knickers, or plus-fours, and a
cap whose heyday was in the Roaring Twenties?
</P>
<P>
   A classy name, classy attire, classy guy.
</P>
<P>
   We knew him, or felt as if we did. Born in Missouri, he was an
SMU graduate and therefore a product of the Texas golfing pipeline.
We noted his victories _ 11 PGA tournament titles, including three
majors _ and his five Ryder Cups. His fans suffered with him as he
went eight years with only one win, in the 1995 Shell Houston Open.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were arrangements to change, schedules to keep.
</P>
<P>
   In the half-light of the Champions dining room, Jackie Burke,
one of the club's founders and the winner of the 1957 Masters, sat
at a table that had become his command post. He barked orders to
his assistants: Call the University of Houston; see if their band
can be here Thursday morning at 7:15 for a memorial service. See if
they have bagpipes or know where to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was trying to organize a ceremony on the putting green as
an alternative to having the players fly to Orlando, Fla., and back
to pay tribute to Stewart. I asked Burke if he had ever gone
through a calamity of this sort before or during a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. ``In 1966,'' he said, ``when Tony Lema and his wife
died in a crash. Tony had left the PGA Championship in Detroit for
a private outing (in Indiana). There was a cocktail party on the
patio, and the pilot wanted to show the guests she had Tony Lema in
her plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``She banked the plane and never came out of it, went into a
dive and crashed right on the golf course. Have I been through it
before? Yeah. But it doesn't get easier with experience.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ You see a first-inning fly ball sail into the gap in
right-center field and somehow bounce off the right fielder's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Any other team, and you're thinking, ``Lucky bounce.'' But with
the Yankees, that's just the way it always seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   You see the starting pitcher, Andy Pettitte, struggle mightily.
The lefty from Deer Park has nothing on this night, absolutely
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He gives up 10 hits in barely more than three innings, putting
his team in a 5-1 hole and making it look as if the Atlanta Braves
will get a free pass back into the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Any other team, and you're thinking, ``Not tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had it,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Yankees, there is only a collective shrug in the
face of such long odds. And then there is a parade of Yankees
relievers stepping up to the rubber and looking practically
All-Century. That's just the way it always seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   You see nothing offensively from them against Braves starter Tom
Glavine _ not so much as a hint of a rally against an ace pitcher
who clearly has his ace stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in trouble,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But you see them keep coming. You see them swinging the bats
until somehow they scratch out a solo home run in the fifth inning
and another in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Any other team, and you're thinking, ``Too little, too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But then in the bottom of the eighth with Glavine still painting
the corners, Chuck Knoblauch gets another fly ball to sail deep
into right field _ the same player bouncing the ball off the same
fielder's glove and this time bouncing it over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Cox called it ``a Yankee Stadium home run.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know that's exactly what it was. The ball needed to
travel 314 feet to tie the game and make Knoblauch a hero. It went
314{, and Jordan's glove did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it had a chance,'' Jordan said. ``It kept
going. I thought I had it, and then I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other team, and the impossible bounces, the impossible
comeback, would seem too unreal. But with the Yankees, that's just
the way it always seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch's tying home run, the 56,794 fans at Yankee
Stadium had to know what would come in extra innings. A hero.
Somewhere, there would be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cox said he felt the game slipping away and felt nervous in
the 10th inning. And why not? Cox was himself a Yankee in the
1960s. He knows how it always seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always somebody you don't expect,'' Cox said. ``You never
know where it's going to come from with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it came from the tiniest Yankee, left fielder Chad
Curtis, who stands 5-10 going on 5-8 and hit only five home runs
all year.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally. That's just the way it always seems to be.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis smashed the ball off Braves reliever Mike Remlinger,
flicking his bat into the air when he felt the ball blast off it
and into the New York sky. The crowd roared. Braves left fielder
Gerald Williams didn't even turn to give chase.
</P>
<P>
   Gone. Players flooded out of the Yankees' dugout and onto the
field. A stream of New York's finest sprinted onto the field even
before Curtis finished rounding the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed over the left-field fence, then over the
original brick fence Babe Ruth built all those years ago that is
now some 430 feet away from home plate. Naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get a base hit,'' Curtis said. ``It just
went. I don't even remember going around the bases. I've heard
people talk about tingling at Yankee Stadium, but I've never felt
it before. When I was running between first and second base, I felt
electric.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed over the hallowed monument park behind left
field, bouncing between shrines dedicated to Mickey Mantle and Yogi
Berra. Naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone stood. Everyone cheered. The booming sounds of Frank
Sinatra singing New York, New York began echoing off the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a night that you're going to be able to look back on
someday and think, `Wow,''' Torre said. ``Sometimes these kinds of
things just happen. I'm amazed, and yet I'm not amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. It's October. It's Yankee Stadium. It's the World
Series. It's just the way it always seems to be.

BRAVES SEEM RESIGNED AS BALLOON DEFLATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Remlinger slumped back into his chair and
cursed. It was his changeup that Chad Curtis blasted into the
left-field bullpen in the 10th inning on Tuesday night, sending the
Yankees skipping onto the field and the Braves plummeting into an
enormous hole that threatens to swallow them in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Down three games to none, the Braves are in the same precarious
position from which the Mets tried to claw back last week in the
National League Championship Series. The Mets managed to win two
thrilling games before finally succumbing to what seemed to be the
inevitable denouement: no team in baseball history has come back
from three games down.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Braves won two games after losing the first three
to the San Diego Padres in the League Championship Series, but now
all the magic and momentum in the world may not be enough to
overcome Atlanta's tremendous deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to who wants it worse,'' Remlinger said. ``Us or
them? So far it's been them. I don't know if it's a test or a gut
check. Guys need to ask themselves how badly they want to win. It's
how much heart do you have and what can you do with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``From the way we pulled together and all the people we lost and
people waiting for us to make excuses and we kept going. Do we want
to go home tomorrow or do we want to fight? People have to answer
that question by the game tomorrow. How many teams came back from
three games down? I'd like to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Braves, the situation is ominous. Although the
players in the clubhouse remained even-keeled _ there were no angry
outbursts, only a slow leaking of soft words _ the Braves clearly
knew they had wasted what had been a superb chance to get back into
the Series.
</P>
<P>
   After two games of offensive futility, and one compounded by
defensive blunders, the Braves finally got to a Yankees starter,
knocking out Andy Pettitte in the fourth inning. It was the fact
that they had finally performed well for much of the game,
including a gritty pitching effort by the ailing Tom Glavine, that
made this loss all the more crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We swung the bats well, we played good defense, we pitched
well and we still lost,'' Chipper Jones said. ``It's a little
demoralizing. It just seems like they have a great aura about them.
You've got to think their luck is going to run out eventually and
we're going to get a break. We've done it before. We had the Mets
do it to us this year. But we're having to do it on the road.
That's awfully tough. But it's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just barely. The Braves have lost early leads in two of the
three games. When Curtis' home run reached the stands, the Braves
visibly slumped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big one to lose,'' Manager Bobby Cox said. ``We
were going to get back in this thing. We played a first tough
inning and we lost them both. We could easily be up, 2-1, instead
of down, 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   For Glavine, the loss was especially disheartening because he
had pitched so well. The Braves had taken a risk by starting the
weakened Glavine just three days after he missed his Game 1 start
with a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   But he pitched heroically until he gave up a third home run _ to
Chuck Knoblauch _ that tied the game 5-5 in the eighth inning.
Glavine could not recall the last time he had given up three home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do any good to analyze where we are or why,'' he
said. ``It's probably more frustrating if I could say we had a
five-run lead and I pitched terribly. Nobody has ever done this for
a reason _ it's hard to do. It's going to happen sooner or later.
We've got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment sounded awfully familiar. Eleven days ago, the
Mets' general manager Steve Phillips, asked why his team couldn't
be the first to recover from a 3-0 deficit. The Mets will be
remembered for making their series with the Braves compelling _ and
perhaps for having taken so much out of the Braves that they will
not be able to make the World Series competitive.  &QL;

BULL RIDER CODY HART RANKS AMONG SPORT'S BEST _ AT 21
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Texas _ On a spring day earlier this year at his
wooded ranch, Cody Hart saddled an unbroken colt.
</P>
<P>
   That move brought a sharp rebuke from his petite wife, Shawna.
``I told him that it was stupid, that those colts were idiots and
they can be as bad as a riding a bull,'' she said. ``I told him
that it wasn't worth getting hurt over a $300 colt.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't want him to risk a needless injury that might spoil
her husband's commanding lead in the world bull riding title race.
After she put her boot down, Cody Hart wisely decided to postpone
his bronco busting until after the 1999 Professional Bull Riders
Bud Light Cup Series season.
</P>
<P>
   For Hart, that intense focus has proven to be the right choice.
He will enter the organization's $1.5 million World Finals,
scheduled tomorrow through Sunday at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in
Las Vegas, with the world title clinched.
</P>
<P>
   Hart has a 1,805.5-point lead over seven-time world all-around
champion Ty Murray of Stephenville. The most points that can be
earned at the championship are 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   As Hart competes in four preliminary rounds and a potential
final, Shawna will be cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the world that motives me any more than my
wife and bull riding,'' Hart said. ``My wife is one of the main
reasons that I'm where I am as a bull rider. If I need someone to
lean on or a shoulder to cry on, she's there. She's like the
American Express card, I don't leave home without her. And bull
riding: I've loved it since I was knee high to a grasshopper.'' A
prodigy Hart, a spunky 5-foot-7, 145-pound cowboy, has $238,048 in
season earnings. If he fares well at the finals, he could finish
the year with more than $500,000, an unheard of sum for rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   The record earnings for any rodeo association is $300,213, a
milestone Chris Shivers reached last year. Hart will break the
record even if he is disqualified in every round at the
championships. For starters, he will receive $85,000 for winning
the cup series after finishing with the most points from 28
regular-season shows and the Las Vegas finals.
</P>
<P>
   At 21, Hart has dominated the 1999 tour, winning a record six
regular-season cup series shows. The feat is comparable to Tiger
Woods winning pro golf's 1997 Masters Tournament in his first full
year, then dominating most fields each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a Bud Light Cup show is like playing the 18th hole at
the Masters and you have to birdie to win,'' Hart said. ``Riding in
the final round is like having a 12-foot putt to win and you sink
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, who began golfing at a young age, Hart has prepared
to be bull riding's kingpin since he mounted his first calf at age
3. From there, he ascended to 700-pound steers in elementary school
and onto 1,000-pound bulls in junior high. When he entered high
school, Hart made the transition to entering bull riding shows that
featured world-class athletes, including Murray and four-time world
champion Tuff Hedeman.
</P>
<P>
   Hart and older brother, J.W., 24, also a high-profile bull
rider, competed on a tour dubbed as Super Bull. As the two brothers
slapped down their entry fees at the bull pens, Cody Hart craved
taking on the maddest bulls on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, Hart mounted the feared world champion bull
Bodacious, in Wichita, Kan. ``You really had to be 18 to enter, and
when I told them I was 17, they said it was close enough. But when
I drew Bodacious they said it would be too dangerous. Then, J.W.
got in the office \Rwith officials\S and threw a fit. And we
convinced them that I could handle the situation.'' Hart stayed on
for several jumps and walked away unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hart finished high school, he had mounted more than
his share of horrific bulls. At 18 in Alexandria, La., Hart
conquered the world champion bull, Red Wolf, a beast that had
fatally stomped Brent Thurman at the 1994 National Finals Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   As Hart lowers himself onto a raging bull in the coffin-shaped
bucking chutes, he knows he's asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you nod your head, you'd better mean business,'' he
said. ``All it takes is getting a hair off of your timing and
you're in trouble.'' A bullish competitor Bull riding has been a
highly profitable business for Hart, who has qualified for the past
four PBR world championships and has accumulated almost $500,000 in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two years on the circuit, Hart grabbed attention by
qualifying for the PBR world championships' final round at 18 and
pocketing $145,541 at 19. Last year, he earned $73,108 after being
sidelined with nagging injures.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, Hart has dominated, winning the season opener
in Salt Lake City in December and never looking back. The defining
moments of the season were Hart's three showdowns with Moody Blues,
last year's top bull in the PBR. Hart topped Moody Blues three
times on three tries (Columbus, Fort Worth and Houston). In Fort
Worth in March, Hart received $10,000 for mastering the rapid-fire
spinner in a winner-take-all match. Had the bull won, the money
would have been handed to owner Terry Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's only setback was missing three weeks after suffering
clavicle injuries after a September wreck in Laughlin, Nev. But he
missed only one cup series show (Calgary, Alberta). Hart clinched
the title 1 1/2 weeks ago after finishing in the money at the last
regular-season show in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the finals, Hart has outpointed Murray, 9,845.5 to
8,040.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cody realizes the significance of what he's
done,'' Murray said. ``Just to win one of these shows is a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Dunn, the 1998 world bull riding champion, said Hart exudes
confidence: ``Ever since I first saw Cody ride, I knew that he
would be one of the great ones. He's cocky, and every great bull
rider that I've seen is cocky, at a young age. He's not afraid to
get out over the front of a bull and take him on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart said mental preparation is a key to success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning in bull riding is about 90 percent mental. Your mind
has to be right. You can't be hung up on having trouble at home.
You can't be thinking about some good-looking girl in the stands
and you can't be thinking about going to the bar after the rodeo
when you're about to ride.'' d nn

COWBOYS' IRVIN HAS GENETIC SPINAL CONDITION THAT CLOUDS RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Michael Irvin's already uncertain return to the
Cowboys from an Oct. 10 spinal injury has been clouded by a genetic
condition called ``cervical stenosis,'' or a narrow spinal canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was born with a different-looking spine,'' Cowboys owner
Jerry Jones said yesterday. ``How does that impact any decision he
might make? To me, I've heard more discussed about what he was born
with than I have about any damage'' incurred from the spinal
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has played his entire career with a narrow spinal canal,
but the condition puts his spinal cord at risk because one hit can
jar it. In 1986, Green Bay cornerback Tim Lewis and Houston Oilers
linebacker Frank Bush retired finding out they had narrow spinal
canals.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Irvin's condition, Jones said, ``Yes, I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility that there is not going to be a
definitive conclusion,'' Jones said. ``They're addressing
everything. I don't see this as necessarily totally decided by
whether or not the swelling goes down. Right now, I don't know if
that's the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's cervical stenosis was initially revealed along with
swelling in his cervix when Irvin had a magnetic resonance imaging
exam after being knocked out of the game Oct. 10 in Philadelphia.
Irvin, 33, now faces something more than a healing process from a 2
1/2-week-old spinal contusion. He faces a career decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has a narrow spinal canal. ... Some people have it,
some don't,'' Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said. ``This obviously is
part of the concern. There are still more questions that need to be
answered over the next several weeks. The only thing that has
changed for him, really, is the time that has gone by since the
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Cowboys has talked about a timetable or even if the
Cowboys' all-time leading receiver will return. Jones said he
couldn't answer that. Irvin was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin is scheduled for another MRI tomorrow at the Dallas office
of spine specialist Dr. Drew Dossett. X-rays taken at Dossett's
office Monday showed nothing that wasn't already known in terms of
his genetic condition.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is not an option, Jones said. He also pointed out that a
second medical opinion is available to Irvin, if he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   No one has advised the 12-year veteran to retire, Irvin said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's injury occurred when he awkwardly fell headfirst into
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf as he was being tackled on
what appeared to be a routine slant pass over the middle. He
immediately lost feeling in his extremities and couldn't move his
hands or legs for more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was taken by ambulance to a downtown Philadelphia trauma
center where an MRI showed swelling in two places of the spinal
cord, along with the narrow spinal canal. Roster moves Fullback Tim
Lester, who was signed the second week of the season, and
linebacker Nate Hemsley were cut yesterday. Robert Thomas is
expected to be the starter at fullback, and linebacker Lemanski
Hall was signed to replace Hemsley. The Cowboys also activated
fullback Ryan Neufeld from the practice squad. The moves were
related to trying to improve the special teams. Former Cowboys
linebacker Jim Schwantz worked out but was not signed. Schwantz
made the Pro Bowl as a special-teams player with the Cowboys in
1996. \Nsubheds:Teague doubtful Free safety George Teague's neck
sprain is more extensive than first thought when it occurred Oct.
18 against the New York Giants. Teague is expected to practice this
week for the first time since the injury but isn't expected to play
Sunday in Indianapolis.

AN UNLIKELY YANKEE SMASHES A GAME ENDING HOME RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chad Curtis knew the ball was leaving Yankee Stadium,
which would turn him into a World Series hero and put the Yankees
within one victory of winning their second straight championship.
Curtis knew it was gone. Everyone knew.
</P>
<P>
   So Curtis coolly flipped the bat to the ground, raised his two
fists high like Rocky Balboa and trotted and floated around the
bases. When Curtis crossed home plate with the winning run in a
6-5, 10-inning victory over the Atlanta Braves, there were two
dozen Yankees waiting to smother him. They lifted him in the air
and Curtis felt he never wanted to come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you get one,'' Curtis said. ``That hit the sweet
spot of the bat. It was a rush. I can't say I ever felt that
before. Rounding the bases, I was kind of tingling. I've heard
people talk about that, but I've never felt it before. I was
tingling.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre hustled over to find Curtis after his second
homer in the game, leaned in close to his reserve outfielder and
told him that he had given himself the sort of baseball memory that
he would never forget. Curtis made his first World Series start on
Tuesday night, and Torre wanted to remind him about what he had
just accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional thing,'' Torre said. ``I told him, `You
had a heck of a first World Series game, young man.' That's a game
he'll look back on. That's a game he'll always remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis was an unlikely hero, but in some ways, he was a likely
hero, too, because the Yankees are a very deep team. Still, Curtis
did not even play during the four-game Series sweep against the San
Diego Padres last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I felt like I was more of a congratulator than a
celebrator,'' Curtis said. ``I came into this year telling myself:
last year I played the whole regular season and didn't play in the
post-season much. I told myself that if it totally turned around
this season and I contributed in the post-season, I would be more
happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Curtis' homer showed why the Yankees are so special.
Someone will do it. If it is not Paul O'Neill or Derek Jeter, it
can be Curtis. On Tuesday night, it was Curtis who drilled a 1-1
changeup from Mike Remlinger into the dark night and helped
continue a dissemination of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says a lot about our team,'' O'Neill said. ``There are so
many people in here who are happy for Chad. We know what he's been
through. Those hits could make Chad Curtis' whole year. When you
hit a walk-off homer in the World Series, that's something he's
going to remember for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Chuck Knoblauch. When Knoblauch's fly ball
drifted toward the right-field fence in the eighth, any ardent
Yankee fan had to think about Jeffrey Maier, for Knoblauch's ball
looked a lot like the shot Jeter stroked during the 1996
post-season, the one a 12-year-old Maier interfered with to help
the Yankees prevail against Baltimore
</P>
<P>
   But there was no fan interference in the cozy right-field corner
at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night. Brian Jordan had enough
difficulty trying to corral Knoblauch's shot without any fans
involved. Jordan retreated to the fence, lined up the ball, leaped
and thought he had the ball. But as Jordan stretched his glove over
the fence, the ball tipped off the webbing of his glove, somehow
popped out and tumbled free for a dramatic two-run homer that
evened the score, 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it was going to get further in the seats, but I
know Jordan is a tremendous athlete and a great outfielder,''
Knoblauch said. ``I was hoping it would get far enough; luckily it
bounced the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The score remained tied until Curtis opened the 10th off
Remlinger, Atlanta's third pitcher. Curtis started the game despite
being 0 for 13 in his career against Tom Glavine. But he homered
off Glavine in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger moved the count to 1-1 against Curtis, and then he
tried to throw a changeup. Curtis destroyed it. ``I don't think
I've ever done that in a regular-season game,'' Curtis said,
referring to a game-ending homer. ``To do that in a World Series
game, it felt great. It just felt great to hit that and to come
home and see my teammates waiting there to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   After Curtis' homer, NBC asked him to do an on-field interview
with Jim Gray, who had angered several players because of the
forceful manner in which they felt he interviewed Pete Rose after
the all-century team ceremony before Game 2 in Atlanta on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis let Gray ask him a question, then told him the Yankees
were unhappy with his treatment of Rose, waved to the camera and
jogged away. He did other television interviews on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something the team decided to do,'' Curtis said. ``The
team said we needed to do something after the way he talked to
Pete. It was a pretty special night for Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday night was a very special night for Curtis. &QL;

PAYNE STEWART'S RELATIVES, FRIENDS RECALL HIS YOUNGER YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 MEMORIES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD,Mo. _ The simple one-story house where pro golfer
Payne Stewart spent his boyhood radiated with sunshine and laughter
and stories Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and friends stopped by to tell Stewart's mother and
sisters how sorry they were that he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But the long hugs and the hand-holding were overshadowed by
tales of fun and the vibrant memories of the boy, the teen-ager and
the man who loved to joke and pull pranks, have a good time and
just be nice to people.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and five others were killed Monday when the private jet
in which they were flying crashed in a field near Mina, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, Stewart's family and friends sat outside on the
backyard deck, a beautiful blue sky above them, as Bee
Payne-Stewart and her daughters, Susan Daniel and Lora Thomas,
reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel remembered how one time little Payne and a neighbor girl
stayed home while Mom ran to the grocery store. Spaghetti was
planned for dinner, and the noodles were cooked. Payne and the girl
grabbed the noodles and threw them all over the kitchen wall. When
Payne's mother got home, she asked them what they thought they were
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Payne told her that the best way to tell whether spaghetti
noodles were really done was to see whether they stuck to the wall
when you threw them.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas remembered the day the telephone company workers were in
the neighborhood installing telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   They had dug some deep holes, and the neighborhood children
decided to put little Payne, the youngest of the bunch, into a
hole. He was too little to climb back out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so mad at those boys for putting him in there,'' Thomas
recalled, gripping her hand into a fist, but laughing too at the
memory of little Payne, stuck with no way out.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about how Payne would have friends over and always
challenge them to golf-putting contests in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever wanted to do it, because Payne always won,''
Thomas said, and the three laughed, their hearty laughs echoing off
the other houses in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Stories. Laughter. Memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just loved the outdoors, and he cooks everything,'' Thomas
said, speaking of her brother as if he were there, sitting outside
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to hunt and fish and canoe,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Their energetic brother even loved to snorkel and scuba dive and
watch movies, any kind of movie, and listen to music, any kind of
music. He was constantly busy, never slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   It had been like that when they were growing up in this
middle-class section of Springfield. Dozens of rambunctious kids
lived nearby, and they spent their time playing outside _
basketball, football, baseball and the made-up game of just
throwing a ball over the house to whoever was standing in the front
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke so many windows,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered Payne the teen-ager, driving around in the
army-green Volkswagen Beetle he got as a hand-me-down from his
sister, Lora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell him the floorboard was all rusted out and it
didn't have a heater,'' Thomas said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel jumped in: ``And he went driving through a mud puddle,
and the water splashed up and got all over him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More than once,'' Thomas added, sending them into laughing
spells again.
</P>
<P>
   Then he took that awful car to college at Southern Methodist
University in Texas on a partial golf scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He roomed with a millionaire, and he started acting like he
was a millionaire,'' his mom recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we weren't millionaires,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go down there and straighten him out,'' his mother
recalled, nodding knowingly and wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't making the grades,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made him go to summer school,'' Payne-Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   As they reminisced, Larry Edgar, who grew up with the Stewart
children in the neighborhood, came out on the deck to talk to the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, were you one of those boys who put Payne in that post
hole?'' Thomas asked him in mock anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying,'' Edgar said, shaking his head and looking at
the ground, yet with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed as he told the story of how the neighborhood boys got
little Payne in big trouble with his mother once: ``We had a club,
and for Payne to be in the club we made him wait till Bee called
him three times before he went home.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter. More smiles. More memories.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's mom and two sisters went to Boston last month to watch
him play in the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   They had a wonderful time, bonding with each other and
witnessing the grace and determination that was Payne Stewart on
the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to kiss him every morning before he went out to play,''
his mother recalled, her eyes misting behind blue eyeliner and
gold-framed glasses. ``We were good kissers.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll always remember the last time she spoke to her son.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sunday night. Stewart had missed the cut for last
weekend's National Car Rental Classic in Orlando, Fla., so he had
been able to see his son, Aaron, play football. Aaron had made a
great catch, and Stewart was proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `See, everything works out for the best,' ''
Payne-Stewart recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She paused. She looked at her daughter Lora, her eyes pleading,
her lips pursed together so she wouldn't cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then he boarded that plane. So everything doesn't always
work out for the best, does it?''
</P>
<P>
   (A memorial service for Payne Stewart will be held Friday at
First Baptist Church of Orlando, Fla., where Stewart attended
services and where his children go to day school.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, a memorial service is scheduled for noon Monday
at Second Baptist Church.)

FOX VIABLE OPTION AT POWER FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ From aging A.C. Green and John Salley to injured
Travis Knight and sometimes-gimpy Robert Horry, the Lakers' options
at power forward are multiple, if somewhat lacking in reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, coach Phil Jackson might throw another free agent
into the mix, but until then, he'll take a look at a less
conventional alternative: Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7 Fox is a natural small forward, but he played admirably
in spot duty against San Antonio's Tim Duncan in the playoffs and
has the weight (242 pounds) and muscle to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think playing Rick Fox at the four (power forward)
is better than any of the alternatives that I've had so far,''
Jackson said Tuesday, prior to the Lakers' exhibition game against
the Phoenix Suns at Thomas and Mack Center. ``Even though we give
up a lot of (height) defending the basket, he is a body that can
keep himself between the basket and the player, will box out and do
some things that we need done. We still need to look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did, using Fox at power forward for the first eight
minutes of the second quarter and most of the fourth. Horry, out
the prior two games because of knee problems, started the game and
played 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson likes Fox's work at the position, it could save a
roster spot. It also will ensure the Lakers don't rely too heavily
on the 36-year-old Green, whom Jackson would prefer to use off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use A.C. for 30 minutes a game and burn him
out early in the year,'' Jackson said. ``I think he's a big
advantage for us coming off the bench, and his infusion of energy
is good for us. From that standpoint, I'd like to use him to
stabilize the second unit. He has good knowledge of our offense.
And then use a little more speed and size perhaps (in the starting
lineup) in Robert Horry, if it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also ready to take on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a position that I'm afraid of or suspect that I'll
live there the whole season. But I welcome it,'' he said. ``Just
getting on the floor I'm OK with regardless of where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Warming Rice: Glen Rice played his best game of the
exhibition season, scoring 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting through
the first three quarters. The timing was perfect; Jackson was
outwardly concerned about his sharpshooter's slow start,
particularly with Kobe Bryant expected to miss the first month of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggling mightily to find a comfort space out there,''
Jackson said before tipoff. ``We need scoring from Glen. We need a
couple guys to help Shaq (O'Neal) out in scoring . . . because
we're not going to get 100 points too often right now with the
lineup we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Exhibitionists: O'Neal, who hadn't made consecutive free
throws in any game this exhibition season, did it three times
Tuesday and hit 7 of his first 8 foul shots in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson held out veteran Ron Harper to give him a day off. Derek
Fisher played despite suffering from cold symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   __ Housewarming: The Lakers will practice at Staples Center for
the first time today. Jackson wants his players to get accustomed
to the new arena before the their home opener next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staples Center is a massive cavern,'' Jackson said, ``and
to play inside of a place like that is a big change for players
that are used to compact courts. There's going to be some things
that are great homecourt advantages, but it's going to take us
awhile to get used to it, too. And the fact that we're sharing it
with another team in town is significant. It's not really our
homecourt. It's going to have to be something we make our
homecourt.''

USING BUDGET SURPLUSES TO PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT IS JUST ANOTHER
SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
 DEBT-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news is Washington apparently will use future budget
surpluses to pay down the national debt. The bad news is the
process isn't likely to reduce the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans equate lowering federal debt with
responsible government, what's shaping up here is just another
accounting scam. What seems to be evolving is a situation in which
political gridlock will result in budget surpluses going to pay
down the publicly held portion of the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by The New York Times characterized the portion of
the Treasury debt held by the public as ``the most important
component,'' but the process isn't likely to reduce the Treasury's
actual overall indebtedness. The debt won't shrink because most of
the anticipated budget surpluses will be the result of excess
Social Security payroll tax receipts.
</P>
<P>
   The scam part has to do with the fact that there are two kinds
of national debt. Nearly 60 percent of the $5.6 trillion national
debt is composed of marketable securities held by individuals,
financial institutions and foreign governments. This is marketable
debt, traded just like corporate and municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is mostly debt owed to trust funds. The trust funds
were created as parking places for surplus revenue from taxes
levied for specific purposes such as Social Security, highway
construction, airport improvements and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting device used is an interest-bearing nonmarketable
security to be redeemed by a budget appropriation when the money
needs to be spent for its intended purpose. What the trust fund has
is basically an IOU representing a claim on the Treasury. There's
no real money involved; the cash has been spent and an unfunded
liability was created in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if Social Security surpluses are used to pay down
publicly held debt, this debt component indeed declines. On the
other hand, the debt owed to future Social Security beneficiaries
will rise by a like amount.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement wouldn't even be a new policy. This is exactly
what has been happening since Washington began enjoying budget
surpluses thanks to excess Social Security revenue. It happens well
out of public view, but the Treasury has been rolling over maturing
issues regularly in amounts less than the securities being
redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a modest shrinkage of publicly held debt. At
the same time, however, the nonmarketable debt owed the trust funds
has been growing even faster than the public debt is shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Some may pretend this isn't spending, but what else do you call
debt service? Some may even applaud because government is replacing
debt owed to others with debt ``we owe ourselves.'' This isn't
quite true. We're replacing it with debt we owe our children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any doubt as to whether this arrangement improves
the debt situation, you can track progress most days by monitoring
the small type in this business section under the headline,
``Government finances.'' Make a notation of the total public debt
on the first of each month for the next year. The first and last
numbers on the list will tell you all you need to know about
Washington's latest fiscal dodge.

   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre was not sure whether he would start Chad
Curtis in Game 3 of the World Series on Tuesday night. Maybe it was
a better idea to start Ricky Ledee in left field instead; Curtis,
after all, had not had a hit in 13 career at-bats against the
Atlanta starter, Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis started, and slugged a home run off Glavine in the
fifth inning, the first blow in the Yankees' comeback from a 5-1
deficit. And after Chuck Knoblauch tied the game in the eighth
inning with a two-run home run, Curtis ended the game in the 10th
inning with his second home run, off the Braves' Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' 6-5 victory over Atlanta at Yankee Stadium gave
them a commanding 3-0 edge in the four-of-seven-game World Series;
no team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit to win in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won 11 consecutive World Series games,
need one more victory to clinch their 25th championship. The
Braves' John Smoltz will pitch Game 4 against the Yankees' Roger
Clemens on Wednesday night, with the Yankees seeking their second
consecutive World Series sweep and their third title in four years.
``Every time we've had a chance to close it out, we've always
closed it out the next game,'' reliever Jeff Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves seemingly had full control of the game after four
innings. The Atlanta hitters had made a terrific adjustment against
the left-hander Andy Pettitte, driving his outside pitches to the
opposite field and knocking him out of the game after only three
and two-thirds innings; Pettitte had allowed 10 hits and 5 runs
and, Torre said later, the Yankees' dugout was very quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had not been able to pitch Game 1 on Saturday, as
scheduled, because of a stomach virus, and he had lost a few pounds
and felt weak. Before Tuesday night's game, Braves manager Bobby
Cox had said that he hoped to get ``seven good innings'' from
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   But the veteran left-hander gave him much more than that,
needing just 40 pitches to get through the first four innings. The
Yankees, too, were trying to drive the ball the other way against
Glavine, but his fastball was sinking and they were not getting
many good swings and everything seemed to be going along so
smoothly for the Braves. Win Game 3 and then Smoltz would have a
chance to tie the series for Atlanta in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre came out to relieve Pettitte and hand the ball to
Jason Grimsley, Torre said _ as he always does to a reliever when
the Yankees are trailing _ ``Hold them here and get yourself a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And on the field, Knoblauch and shortstop Derek Jeter kept
repeating these words to each other. Hold them. Hold them here.
We'll come back. Curtis led off the bottom of the fifth inning and
drove a pitch into the right-field seats, and there was life in the
Yankees; the lead was down to three runs. Glavine rolled along,
into the seventh, and then Tino Martinez smashed a home run. Braves
5, Yankees 3.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees batted in the eighth, Remlinger and the
Braves' closer, John Rocker, were throwing in the Atlanta bullpen.
Glavine had given Atlanta seven good innings, as Cox had hoped. But
Glavine, who along with John Smoltz and Greg Maddux have been the
heart of this team for the better part of the decade, wanted to
continue. His pitch count was low; he assured Cox he felt fine.
``He was throwing great,'' Cox said later. ``He didn't want to come
out of the game. I asked him if he was tired and he said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi led off the inning and lined a single to left field.
Knoblauch was next, having hit a line drive off the glove of right
fielder Brian Jordan in the first inning _ an error, according to
the official scorer _ and later hit a double. He was comfortable
against Glavine, that was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Cox stuck with Glavine, who threw a pitch down and in to
Knoblauch, Knoblauch's favorite hitting zone. And Knoblauch bashed
a high drive to right field, where Jordan ran back toward the wall.
The 56,794 fans at Yankee Stadium stood; many Yankees leaped out of
their dugout to follow the flight of the ball into the right-field
corner. Jordan jumped and reached back over the fence, and the ball
went into his glove. And then it dropped out, bouncing into the
stands. Home run. Knoblauch soared around the bases, the game tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so happy, I wanted to lift him up and carry him,''
Bernie Williams said later. ``But I realized we still had to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cox spoke of the home run bitterly. The Braves' manager
always will believe the Yankees won the 1996 World Series because
an umpire prevented one of his outfielders from reaching a crucial
pop fly, and he spoke of Knoblauch's home run with only slightly
less disdain. ``We basically got beat with the pop-up,'' Cox said,
referring to Knoblauch's home run. ``It was a Yankee home run. We
got beat with a 315-foot home run. You get a 315-foot fly ball and
it's an out in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's good luck, Knoblauch said later, ``We'll take it every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   There was good feeling in the Yankees' dugout after that, David
Cone said later. The game was tied, Mariano Rivera was pitching.
They just needed a run. Bret Boone led off the ninth inning with a
single and Otis Nixon entered the game as a pinch-runner for the
Braves, to steal second. But Girardi threw out Nixon, pumping his
fist, for this was no small feat. It was the first time since 1996
that an opposing runner had been thrown out trying to steal against
Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker shut out the Yankees through the ninth inning, and as the
Yankees came to bat for the 10th inning, Remlinger relieved for the
Braves. Curtis was to lead off, and in his mind, he went through
his game plan: Just try to hit the ball up the middle. Don't try to
do too much with the pitch. Do something small and start the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   All night, some of the Yankees' reserves had been predicting
home runs, Ledee and Luis Sojo and Jorge Posada all calling shots
for their teammates. Posada had predicted that Knoblauch would hit
his home run, and had been right.
</P>
<P>
   As Curtis stepped in, nobody said anything. Before this game
began, after all, Curtis had not hit a home run since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis fouled off a pitch. Remlinger threw a high fastball, and
Curtis stepped out. Nelson was in the trainer's room, his arm in an
ice pack, watching on television, and in the opposite corner of the
clubhouse, Jason Grimsley was watching on television.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger threw a changeup, and Curtis swung and hit the ball on
the air and flipped his bat away, and in the clubhouse, Nelson and
Grimsley knew what those in the dugout realized when they heard the
contact. Home run. Unbelievable. A home run. Curtis threw up his
arms at first, then ran around the bases, his face devoid of
expression, his mind apparently overcome by thoughts. ``I don't
remember anything,'' he said later, when asked about his trip
around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   He reached home plate and descended into a sea of happy
teammates, all of them one victory away from one more World Series
title, the last in a century covered with pinstriped championships.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the things the Atlanta Braves expected to
encounter in New York, this had to be the strangest.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know better, you'd almost say it was Southern
hospitality, at least until well after dark, when this city _ and
the Yankees _ turned rude again, just when the Braves thought they
might settle in for a nice stay.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Chad Curtis, a part-timer who hit just five home
runs all season and made his biggest noise when he complained about
teammate Derek Jeter laughing during a brawl with Seattle, all but
doomed the Braves to another long winter when he hit his second
home run of the night in the bottom of the 10th, giving the Yankees
a 6-5 win over the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was between second and third that I felt like there
was electricity going through my legs,'' said Curtis, who couldn't
recall ever hitting a game-ending home run in the regular season.
``Coming around third base, seeing my teammates waiting at home
plate in a World Series game, was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, winning their 11th straight World Series game, one
short of the record set by the Ruth-Gehrig Yanks, have a
three-games-to-none lead, with Roger Clemens in place to finish off
the Braves, who are in danger of losing the World Series for the
fourth time in five tries this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me at the start who would be the star of the
Series, and it's always somebody you don't expect,'' said Braves
manager Bobby Cox, who said he was surprised during introductions
to see how short Curtis was (generously listed at 5 feet 10 inches)
compared with his brawnier teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that last one was really crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis's blast was the second walkoff home run of the postseason
by the Yankees, who beat the Red Sox in Game 1 of the ALCS on
Bernie Williams's 10th-inning homer off Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still amazed, yet not amazed,'' manager Joe Torre said of
another Yankee comeback. ``We play nine innings.'' Or, in this
case, 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who had not homered in winning two games in
Atlanta, stole a page from their storied Bomber past with four home
runs to overcome a 5-1 deficit. Chuck Knoblauch tied the score with
a two-run homer in the eighth off lefthander Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, previously noticed for his wacky throws and wackier
penchant for being in the middle of the postseason's most
controversial plays, hit a fly ball that caressed the top of Brian
Jordan's glove before falling into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Cox called it a ``Yankee Stadium home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's response? ``I'm glad I hit it in Yankee Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, in his flu-weakened state, held the Yankees at bay
until the eighth, one more inning than Cox had projected him to
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis hit a first-pitch home run to make it 5-2 in the fifth,
and Tino Martinez hit another first-pitch homer to make it 5-3 in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's third pitcher, Mike Remlinger, started the 10th in
place of Public Enemy No. 1, John Rocker, the reliever who warmed
up to vulgar chants but threw two scoreless innings in relief of
Glavine. Curtis was the first batter faced by Remlinger, who joins
a couple other Braves relievers this decade who have given up
crushing World Series home runs: Charlie Leibrandt, beaten by the
Twins' Kirby Puckett in the 11th inning in a Game 6 triumph in
1991, and Mark Wohlers, who gave up Jim Leyritz's Series-turning
blast in Game 4 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the day had started out so pleasantly for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Cox, who spent the pregame hours walking the streets of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in New York so many times this year,'' Cox said,
``that some of the people I'm starting to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how many people, because we are on TBS and
national television, with the Yankees and all the playoffs, people
do recognize you and they're very nice. They're all very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes Yankee starter Andy Pettitte, who allowed Atlanta
hitters to save face.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, whose total of seven hits in the first two games was
the weakest output since the '66 Dodgers, slapped Pettitte around
for 10 hits and five runs in just 3 2/3 innings to seize their 5-1
lead. Two batters into the game, the Braves had as many hits as
they'd had in the first 15 innings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams singled, took third on Bret Boone's double, and
scored Atlanta's first run on Chipper Jones's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   Boone opened the third with another double and scored on a
single by Jordan, the cleanup man's first hit of the Series. Andruw
Jones followed with another single, his first Series hit, and both
came home on a double by Jose Hernandez, a shortstop by trade who
was making his first appearance as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Gerald Williams tripled over a leaping Bernie
Williams and scored on Boone's third double. The Braves' second
baseman became the first player since Brooklyn's Jim Gilliam to
double three times in one Series game. But Boone was erased
attempting to steal third, which may have cost the Braves a bigger
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to steal third all night on Pettitte,'' said
Cox, defending Boone's decision. ``I think he changed arms (as he
dived into third). I thought he'd be in there easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone had a fourth hit, a leadoff single in the ninth off closer
Mariano Rivera, then was replaced by pinch runner Otis Nixon. But
Nixon was erased attempting to steal on a strong throw by Joe
Girardi, Chipper Jones went down swinging on a full count, and
Jordan bounced to short.
</P>
<P>
   Three Yankees' relievers _ Jason Grimsley, Jeff Nelson, and
Rivera _ combined to shut out the Braves on three hits over the
last 6 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The win went to Rivera, who has five saves and a victory in
seven postseason appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrown 10 scoreless innings in this postseason, and
hasn't allowed a run in 41 2/3 innings dating back to July 21.

CLEMENS HAS CHANCE TO MAKE IT A CLEAN SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 BBO-SHAUGHNESSY COLUMN-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pitching in the theater of hatred that was Fenway
Park 11 days ago, that was tough. This should be relatively easy.
It's merely a chance to clinch the last World Series of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens will be working on 10 days rest, and 13 years of
restlessness, when he takes the mound against the Atlanta Braves in
Game 4 of the World Series Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It's said that there are no second acts in American life, and
nothing Clemens does can erase the haunting memory of a World
Series played in this same city 13 years ago when he was 24 years
old. Hardball historians, like Dealey Plaza buffs, still try to
reconstruct events of Game 6, the night Clemens left with a 3-2
lead after seven innings, about an hour before a seemingly harmless
grounder rolled between the feet of a onetime batting champ who
eventually would move his family to Idaho to escape infamy.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Bill Buckner, Clemens is dogged by what should
have been his finest moment. He was 24-4 in 1986, MVP of the
All-Star Game, MVP of the American League, the Cy Young Award
winner, and the winning pitcher in the seventh game of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken 13 years and two family moves to get back to this
stage, and Wednesday night he gets the ball for the fourth _ and
possibly final _ game of the World Series. He has the chance to be
the guy in the picture standing on the mound when the Series is
won.
</P>
<P>
   The ring is all that eludes him. He's got the five Cy Youngs,
the 3,000 strikeouts, the two 20-strikeout games. He's going to
land in Cooperstown and over the weekend he sat with Willie Mays,
Ted Williams, and the ghost of Babe Ruth, recognized as one of the
30 greatest ballplayers of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is still reeling from his poor performance and rude
reception at Fenway Park, where he was routed by the Red Sox in a
13-1 loss to Pedro Martinez. He lasted only two-plus innings and
was mercilessly hooted when he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to pitch well Wednesday night or his Hall of Fame
plaque could be eternally tarnished. He's in danger of being
remembered like the late, great Wilt Chamberlain _ as a dominating
numbers guy who could not win the big one. Clemens has two wins in
11 postseason starts, and none of the failures were more celebrated
than the embarrassing third-inning KO at Fenway this month. This is
the legacy he lugs to the Yankee Stadium mound. A Game 4 shutout
would change everything.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has been consistent only in his stubborn denials that
'86 is forgotten, and that the Saturday massacre in Boston was no
big deal. Baloney. He's too proud. He's still stung by his former
manager's accusation that he took himself out of Game 6 in '86. And
his family was deeply wounded when he was hooted out of the Hub 11
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about '86, he said, ``The controversy that's behind it. I
talked to Peter Gammons a week ago. Until he mentioned it, it
wasn't even a concern of mine. He said about John McNamara. So it
makes _ that was three years ago. So, again, this is here and now
it's a whole different situation. So that was the furthest thing
from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame your humble columnist for the syntax in that
paragraph. It's Rogerspeak, word for word, right off the
transcript. A bag of words, spilled onto paper as only Clemens can
do it. And it's more baloney.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling interview with the national media, he told a
couple of delightful stories about conversations he had with Ted
Williams when he was a young Soxer in Winter Haven (Ted told him,
``I know I can hit your fastball'') and took a not-so-veiled shot
at the Red Sox when he spoke of Yankee loyalty to ex-players:
``Great opportunities for me to talk to gentlemen and definitely
older players. You know, again, they welcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The Sox never did.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had a mediocre season for the Yankees (14-10, 4.60) in
1999. He was the No. 3 starter in the first two rounds of the
playoffs and pitched seven shutout innings in the Division Series
clincher against Texas. Then came the Boston disaster, and he's in
the Al Nipper No. 4 spot Wednesday night. Imagine a team so deep
that it plucks a pitcher from the All-Century team for the fourth
game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stage in Fenway was probably more than Roger could
handle,'' conceded Yankees manager Joe Torre. ``Unfortunately, he
couldn't pitch the way he'd like. Tomorrow will be a special day
for Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To finally be here in this situation is just really
exciting,'' said the Rocket. ``It's an awesome feeling to have this
chance again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why he got himself traded to a city he hates. He wanted
a ring. He wanted to pitch in the big games at least one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night he returns to the World Series. The biggest game
of them all. He can win the Fall Classic all by himself. It's a big
game. Almost as big as a playoff game against Pedro Martinez at
Fenway Park.

KINGS COME ALIVE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After plodding along for two periods Tuesday
night, the Kings scored twice within 33 seconds midway through the
third to defeat the Washington Capitals 5-2 in front of 13,169 at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette had two goals, including the Kings' final goal
that blew open a game that was close most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings now have won two straight since first-year coach Andy
Murray blasted the club after a 6-3 loss to Phoenix last Friday.
The team is 2-1-1 on the homestand, which ends Thursday against
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake brought his team and the crowd back to life when he
broke the tie with 11:44 left in the game. Blake, who leads all NHL
defensemen in scoring, took a slick pass from Ziggy Palffy at the
point and beat Caps goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later Bryan Smolinski slipped through the
Washington defense, took a pass from Audette and fired the puck
over Kolzig's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When Audette scored the third goal of the period three minutes
later, the Kings had a victory for goaltender Jamie Storr, who had
played only one period in the team's first ten games.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who allowed two goals in the first period, had an
otherwise quiet night. The Capitals had just three shots on goal in
the second period and just 17 for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But he showed no ill effects from a tender right groin that
forced him out of an Oct. 7 game in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stephane Fiset is expected to return to the net Friday,
the Kings now have two solid contributors in goal.
</P>
<P>
   They also got three goals and eight points from their second
line, which was benched for the final six minutes of Friday's game
against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   With one game left on the homestand, the team has only played
well in spurts. Unlike their season-opening seven-game road trip,
when they went 4-2-1, the Kings had not put together a sustained
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Murray knew his team did not play well in the third period of
Sunday's 4-3 victory over San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   But after Tuesday's pre-game morning workout was cancelled, the
Kings came out sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Although they lead the league on the power play, their man
advantage backfired with 8:31 left in the first period when
Washington scored a short-handed goal.
</P>
<P>
   With just 10 seconds remaining in a holding penalty by Ken Klee,
Kings defenseman Garry Galley lost the puck to Peter Bondra at the
blue line. Bondra, perhaps the league's fastest skater, swooped
down on Storr and fired it over his left shoulder to give the Caps
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Calle Johansson made it 2-0 less than three minutes later when
he scored a power play goal in front of Storr on a pass from Jan
Bulis. Although the Kings have been behind by two goals this
season, they have never trailed 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who passed Bryan Trottier on Sunday with his 525th
goal, cut the lead to 2-1 when he redirected a shot from the point
by Aki Berg. It was Robitaille's ninth goal, one behind
league-leader Brian Savage of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   It gave the Kings a spark, which carried over to the second
period. They held the Capitals without a shot for the first 11
minutes and tied the game at two on Audette's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings had just five shots in the period, Audette
made his count. With 12:14 left, Glen Murray took a shot from the
point that sailed wide but right to Audette. The second-line
right-winger had a wide open shot at the goal and easily beat
Kolzig.

NEW YORK _ A four-run lead with Tom Glavine on the mound is no
match for the mystique of the New York Yankees, and apparently
neither are the Atlanta Braves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nights like Tuesday can make even the most cynical among us
believe the Yankees are indeed a team of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That something special that makes the Yankees, well, the
Yankees, manifested itself in dramatic fashion in a 6-5
come-from-behind Game 3 victory over the Braves, who are a game
away from elimination in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, who took the mound on the heels of a bout with the flu,
made few mistakes in a gutsy effort. But when he did err, the
Yankees made him pay, clawing back into the game with three home
runs, then winning it with a fourth _ Chad Curtis' solo shot deep
to left field off Braves lefty Mike Remlinger in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special,'' said Curtis, who also homered in the fifth
inning. ``I've never hit a walk-off homer. I've heard people talk
about tingling, but I had never felt that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I certainly felt some electricity running through my body
as I rounded second base, and then seeing my teammates waiting for
me at home plate was a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch's game-tying two-run homer in the eighth
preceded Curtis' heroics.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Yankee mystique comes into play.
</P>
<P>
   On some nights and in some ballparks, Braves right fielder Brian
Jordan might have pulled Knoblauch's ball back into play. But as if
little Jeffrey Maher _ the unsuspecting hero of the 1996 American
League Championship Series _ were there to give it a helping hand,
the ball glanced off Jordan's glove and over the wall for a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got beat with a pop-up to right field,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said. ``It was a Yankee Stadium home run. The ball went
315 (feet), and it was a home run. That's the way it is here. The
last one was tagged, but I didn't even think (Knoblauch's homer)
was close to the wall. Three hundred and fifteen feet is an out in
my book, but that's not the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Knoblauch responded: ``I'm glad I hit in Yankee
Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees can clinch their second World Series title in as
many years with a victory tonight behind five-time Cy Young Award
winner Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly not your average pitcher,'' Cox said of
Clemens. ``This was a big one to lose. We were going to get right
back in this thing. We could easily be up 2-1 (in the best-of-seven
series) instead of down 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're down to where you really have to run the table. It
would have been nice to win tonight's ballgame. But we've still got
our rotation intact. We've swept teams before, just not in the
World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have; in fact, they did it last season, and they
have won 11 consecutive World Series games dating to 1996 when they
won Games 3, 4, 5 and 6 to close out the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves aren't going to just give up,'' Yankees manager Joe
Torre said. ``I expect them to come out fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' rally overshadowed a comeback of sorts for the
Braves' offense, which awoke from a deep sleep with 14 hits,
including 10 off New York starter Andy Pettitte, who allowed five
runs in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Braves only three innings against Pettitte to equal
their hit total for the first two games (seven). Gerald Williams
and Bret Boone opened the game with back-to-back hits, and Williams
scored on Chipper Jones' grounder to third. The Braves managed only
two hits in 14 innings off the Yankees' starters in the first two
games of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees halted the Braves' momentum, if only for a moment,
scoring a first-inning run of their own on Paul O'Neill's
opposite-field single. But Atlanta proved its first-inning
exhibition of actually putting runners on base was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Boone led off the third with the second of his three doubles and
scored on Jordan's single to right. Braves designated hitter Jose
Hernandez capped the third-inning spree with a two-run double.
Boone's third double drove home the Braves' fifth run in the fourth
and made him the first player to hit three doubles in a World
Series game since Brooklyn's Jim Gilliam did it in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went quiet for a while after O'Neill's first-inning
single, collecting just two hits in the next 14 at-bats, including
the first postseason homer of Curtis' career. Curtis, who was
almost left off the World Series roster, belted a solo homer over
the right-field wall with two out in the fifth to cut the Braves'
lead to 5-2. Tino Martinez's seventh-inning solo homer pulled the
Yankees within two.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were down 5-1, it was a little quiet in the dugout,''
Torre said. ``The highest compliment I can pay to our team is that
we don't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blow was Knoblauch's deja vu homer in the eighth.
The Bellaire High School product also hit a game-tying homer off
San Diego's Donne Wall in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a pattern, I hope it continues (tonight),'' Knoblauch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessers questioned whether Cox left Glavine in the game
too long, but the Braves manager defended his pitching choices,
which included two innings by closer John Rocker sandwiched between
Glavine and Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Glavine was throwing great,'' Cox said. ``He didn't want
to come out. I asked if he was tired, and he said he was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees' bullpen shut out the Braves on four hits
over 6 innings. Mariano Rivera worked the final two innings for the
victory.

   SCI-LUNG-TEST (Gaithersburg, Md.) _ A new lung cancer screening
test looks so exciting that patients are starting to demand it and

a problem: no one has shown that finding lung cancers early with
the test actually saves lives. So the National Cancer Institute is
bringing a group of experts together on Tuesday to ask whether the

test becomes so widespread that it is impossible to assess it, and
start a large study to see if it works. By Gina Kolata.

But women like her who left, staying at home with their children
for a few years, later found their Rolodexes out of date and their

YANKEES TAKE 3-0 SERIES LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time the New York Yankees extended a World
Series winning streak to 11 games, Babe Ruth stood at home plate,
gestured with his arm in front of him, and hit what history knows
as the ``Called Shot'' home run.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, 67 years later, the Yankees ran another Series
winning streak to 11. Their method was no less extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis led off the bottom of the 10th inning with his
second home run of the night, giving New York a 6-5 victory over
the Atlanta Braves and a 3-0 lead in the World Series. No team in
baseball history has overcome such a deficit to win a postseason
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hit a walk-off home run,'' said Curtis, a
journeyman who didn't even play in last year's World Series. ``And
I've heard people talk about tingling, (but) I've never felt that
before. I think somewhere between second and third I felt like
there was electricity running through my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer, off reliever Mike Remlinger, was Curtis' second of
the night, and he knew it was gone as soon as he connected. He
flipped the bat as the ball sailed over the fence in left-center,
raising both arms in the air. As the Yankees streamed from the
dugout to greet him, police officers _ some on horseback _ streamed
from the bullpen area to ring the field.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no trouble, only joy for the Yankees, who can
complete a sweep in Game 4 Wednesday night. A win would give them
12 Series victories in a row, tying a record they set with sweeps
in 1927, '28 and '32.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, the eighth-place hitter, bats right-handed and started
because the Braves pitched a left-hander, Tom Glavine, who was
mostly brilliant Tuesday night. Glavine was scheduled to start Game
1, but flu-like symptoms pushed him back. He lost seven pounds _
although he re-gained some of it _ and manager Bobby Cox expected
only ``seven good innings.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he got. But because the Yankees were aggressive,
Glavine had thrown just 73 pitches through seven and he told Cox he
was strong enough to start the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're typically a team that takes a lot of pitches and works
the count, so the pitcher gets deep into his pitch count,'' Glavine
said. ``Right from the get-go, they seemed to swing early in the
count. That's fine. I don't mind a team that's doing that, as long
as I'm making my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   He was from innings 2 through 7, when Glavine was so free of
trouble he worked from the stretch to just two batters. Curtis and
Tino Martinez hit solo homers to narrow the Braves' 5-1 lead, but
Glavine appeared in control as he began the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Joe Girardi smacked his first pitch for a leadoff single.
And on a 2-and-0 pitch, Chuck Knoblauch hit a game-tying two-run
homer off the glove of leaping right fielder Brian Jordan, near the
314-foot corner. As Cox put it, ``We got beat with a pop-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he hit it out at first,'' said Jordan. ``If I
did, I probably would have timed (the jump) better. Once I knew the
ball was over the fence, I thought I could knock it back. I thought
I had it. I thought it was a sno-cone catch.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, the New York scourge who was booed heartily in
pre-game warm-ups and serenaded with an expletive as he warmed up
in the bullpen, came on in relief. Derek Jeter led off with a
single _ extending his postseason hitting streak to 17 games _ and
Paul O'Neill followed by popping up a bunt that Brian Hunter let
drop. It turned into a double play because O'Neill didn't run,
grimacing and then sprinting for first, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker worked a scoreless ninth before Remlinger relieved him in
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees overcame a rough start by Andy Pettitte, who allowed
five runs on 10 hits in 32/3 innings. But the Yankees bullpen was
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley worked 21/3 scoreless innings. Ex-Mariner Jeff
Nelson followed with two more. Closer Mariano Rivera, whose 0.39
earned-run average is the best in postseason history, worked
another two.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera fell to his knees in celebration after Game 4 last year,
when the Yankees clinched the championship against San Diego. He
could repeat that scene Wednesday night unless the Braves can
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Said third baseman Chipper Jones in a somber Braves clubhouse,
``We have to try and save face.''

ALL-CENTURY ARM HAS SHOT TO SHOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now it's on the Rocket.
</P>
<P>
   A World Series that is all but locked up and in the books has
just a little juice left in it. It's all about the Yankees and
their daunting postseason win streak after their 6-5, 10-inning
victory over Atlanta Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, the 1999 Braves are the 1998 Padres _ a team the
Yankees swept out of October without mercy, without care. That is,
the Braves will be the Padres if Roger Clemens can handle it _ this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, for Game 4, Clemens will make his first World
Series appearance since 1986, opposing Atlanta's John Smoltz. It is
his latest, best chance to create a new postseason image of himself
_ one fitting a five-time Cy Young winner whose (OK, questionable)
selection to the All-Century Team this week all but mandates that
the Rocket deliver now, in October, when it matters.
</P>
<P>
   And now this: A chance for the Rocket to dump a bunch of that
baggage he has dragged around with him since leaving Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that baggage he has carried into this season with the
Yankees, when he struggled, didn't seem to fit in and went 14-10.
He didn't look like the Roger Clemens the Yanks thought they were
trading for back in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Clemens said of what awaits him
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting comment from a guy who has one postseason win in
nine career starts and, worse, whose last start during the American
League Championship Series was an unmitigated nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago at Fenway, there was the 13-year Boston star
Clemens, all alone on the mound he used to own, in the direct line
of fire of the rabid Red Sox fans whose loud, taunting chants of
``Roger, Roger'' might still be echoing between Harvard Square and
Boston's Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clemens the ex-Sox hero vs. Boston's new adopted son,
Pedro Martinez. It was the undeniable heart of the ALCS, and
Clemens, barraged by boos and jeers and Boston hits, just plain
crumbled _ as anyone with any shred of emotion would have, given
the weight of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the moment facing Clemens during Game 4 won't feel
like he's toting a Steinway grand piano out to the pitching rubber.
</P>
<P>
   It will only feel like a baby grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have complete confidence in Roger Clemens,'' Yankees
designated hitter Chili Davis said Tuesday night, when it was clear
the Yanks' 3-0 lead put the burden of an Atlanta clampdown on
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows we're leaning on him. He came here for this. He came
here to win a World Series. What better situation than this?''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   This is Yankee Stadium, a place Clemens used to love to play in
even as a Red Sox. Clemens has had a career-long habit of walking
by Babe Ruth's monument out behind center field and wiping a little
sweat on Ruth's brass replica each time he walked out from the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the newest Yankee has a chance to close down the Braves and
end a long, empty chapter of his own stellar career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tomorrow will be a special day for Roger,'' Yankees
manager Joe Torre said. ``Coming to Yankee Stadium in that Yankee
uniform, there will be a lot of emotion, but there won't be a lot
of baggage. I think that will help him probably focus a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Torre has to hope it helps Clemens focus.
</P>
<P>
   A power pitcher whose chronic ailment has been that he gets so
worked up, Clemens gets so overwrought before most starts that he
can't control his cannon arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (what he does on the mound) is emotion. That's why he
has five Cy Young awards. There's a lot of fire in his belly,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an interesting week for Clemens. After getting raked
in Boston in Game 3 of the ALCS, he has had to wait until Game 4 of
the Series to get his next start _ a situation that doesn't sit
well with his superhyped demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But at least he had a few things to keep himself occupied. While
killing time in Atlanta during Games 1 and 2, Clemens was part of
the All-Century Team ceremonies, having been voted one of the top
30 baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip, he said, being next to all the old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tremendous. I don't look at myself in that way by any
means. But it means a lot to be around the guys I watched and
really admired. Every time I see Ted Williams, I get choked up. And
the words Ted has for you, they always relate back to hitting in
some way,'' Clemens said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moment Clemens said he'll never forget. But Clemens has
had more than his share of unforgettable baseball moments, some
like his 20-strikeout wonders and others less pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was in 1986, when he started Game 6 of the World
Series, walked off the field with a lead and then sat in the dugout
and watched the infamous Bill Buckner play that allowed the Mets to
come back and beat the Sox in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was years ago. That was a whole different situation. This
is here and now, so that was the last thing on my mind,'' Clemens
said, trying to forget.
</P>
<P>
   But who would be surprised if some of those memories flashed
before Clemens' eyes this evening, with so much on the line?
</P>
<P>
   The last time Clemens started a World Series game was long ago,
with turmoil and a few failures taking place since.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in the Bronx, Clemens starts a game in the
World Series again. The Yanks up 3-0. They know what they want and
how to get it. It's just up to Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, his first ring hangs in the balance, riding on
his arm. What a chance.

TAYLOR TAKES DAY OFF AS PRECAUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Realizing the Los Angeles Clippers offense has
booked a six-month ride on his deltoids, Maurice Taylor decided to
spend Tuesday in the shop for minor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can practice now and play now,'' said Taylor, whose bruised
left shoulder prevented him from participating in the Clippers'
latest workout, ``or sit out this practice and be ready to play
Nov. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder injury occurred in Phoenix last week by an
inadvertent, returning -to-earth elbow from former teammate Rodney
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence that the injury isn't serious was gathered last
weekend, when Taylor scored 45 points and had 20 rebounds in
exhibition victories over Vancouver and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad,'' said Taylor, who plans to play in
tonight's exhibition home-opener against the Milwaukee Bucks at
Staples Center. ``I wanted to make sure it (the shoulder) was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Murdock-umentation: After missing the first four rehearsal
games with an ankle sprain, veteran point guard Eric Murdock made
his unofficial Clippers debut last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played well,'' coach Chris Ford said of Murdock, who
averaged 10 points in the two wins. ``He shot the ball well,
knocked down the open shots off the double-teams inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a steady, consistent player.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdock, who was acquired from New Jersey in a deal that sent
Johnny Newman to the Nets, has welcomed the opportunity to join a
team offering a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, everything was positive, basketball-wise,'' said
Murdock, who left Miami as a free agent for his home-state Nets
before last season. ``We've been playing well, working hard, and
that's the key. We dont' have a lot of experience, so we have to
work harder than the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Leg injuries limited Murdock's experience to 15 games last
season, one year after his gig as caddy to Tim Hardaway in Miami.
But Murdock, 31, did average 14 points and more than six assists
over three full seasons in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Because of a death in the family, Clippers sixth
man Tyrone Nesby will not be with the team for tonight's game. . .
. X-rays taken Monday on guard Eric Piatkowski's sore ribs (another
bit of pain gained in Phoenix) were negative. Piatkowski practiced
Tuesday and will play tonight.

FOX A POSSIBLE AT POWER FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ From aging A.C. Green and John Salley to injured
Travis Knight and sometimes-gimpy Robert Horry, the Lakers' options
at power forward are multiple, if somewhat lacking in reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, coach Phil Jackson might throw another free agent
into the mix, but until then he'll take a look at a less
conventional alternative: Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7 Fox is a natural small forward, but he has the weight
(242 pounds) and muscle to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think playing Rick Fox at the four (power forward)
is better than any of the alternatives that I've had so far,''
Jackson said Tuesday, prior to the Lakers' 95-73 exhibition loss to
the Phoenix Suns at Thomas and Mack Center. ``Even though we give
up a lot of (height) defending the basket, he is a body that can
keep himself between the basket and the player, will box out and do
some things that we need done. We still need to look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did, using Fox at power forward for the first eight
minutes of the second quarter and most of the fourth. Fox held up
defensively but struggled on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Horry, out the prior two games because of knee problems, started
the game and played 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson likes Fox's work at the position, it could save a
roster spot. It also will ensure the Lakers don't rely too heavily
on the 36-year-old Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to use A.C. for 30 minutes a game and burn him
out early in the year,'' Jackson said. ``I think he's a big
advantage for us coming off the bench and his infusion of energy is
good for us. From that standpoint, I'd like to use him to stabilize
the second unit. He has good knowledge of our offense. And then use
a little more speed and size perhaps (in the starting lineup) in
Robert Horry, if it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is also ready to take on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a position that I'm afraid of or suspect that I'll
live there the whole season. But I welcome it,'' he said. ``Just
getting on the floor, I'm OK with regardless of where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Warming Rice: Glen Rice played his best game of the
exhibition season, scoring 21 points on 6-of-13 shooting, with four
3-pointers. The timing was perfect; Jackson was outwardly concerned
about his sharpshooter's slow start, particularly with Kobe Bryant
expected to miss the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need scoring from Glen. We need a couple guys to help Shaq
(O'Neal) out in scoring . . . because we're not going to get 100
points too often right now with the lineup we've got,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tidbits: O'Neal, who hadn't made consecutive free throws in
any game this exhibition season, did it three times Tuesday and hit
7 of his first 8 foul shots in the game. He finished 12 of 17 from
the line but made just 7 of 22 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson decided to give veteran Ron Harper a day off and started
Brian Shaw in his place. Derek Fisher, suffering from flu-like
symptoms, was limited to 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Housewarming: The Lakers will practice at Staples Center for
the first time today. Jackson wants his players to get accustomed
to the new arena before their home opener next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Staples Center is a massive cavern,'' Jackson said, ``and
to play inside of a place like that is a big change for players
that are used to compact courts. There's going to be some things
that are great homecourt advantages, but it's going to take us a
while to get used to it too. And the fact that we're sharing it
with another team in town is significant. It's not really our
homecourt. It's going to have to be something we make our
homecourt.''

KINGS COME ALIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings knew what it was like to
have five straight goals dropped on them, so they wanted to stay
humble. But when they did it Tuesday night in a 5-2 victory over
the Washington Capitals, it was hard not to crack a collective
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Audette's grin was the biggest. His second line had been
benched for the final six minutes of last Friday's meltdown against
Phoenix. This time he had two goals, an assist and an all-around
game that helped inspire a Staples Center crowd of 13,169.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really showed what we can do,'' Audette said of the
Kings' second straight victory. ``We got down on the scoreboard,
but not on the ice. We were playing a good team tonight and we
played them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Audette's second goal provided the final margin of victory, but
the Kings really put it away when they scored twice within 33
seconds midway through the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake broke the tie with 11:44 left in the game. Blake, who
leads all NHL defensemen in scoring, took a slick pass from Ziggy
Palffy at the point and beat Caps goalie Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute later, Bryan Smolinski slipped through the
Washington defense, took a pass from Audette and fired the puck
over Kolzig's right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig smashed his stick on the ground and threw it.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't nearly as angry as Washington coach Ron Wilson,
who faces his former team, the Mighty Ducks, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for results here and a commitment to play for the
team,'' he said. ``If guys don't want to play the way that I ask
them to play, then I'll just leave. It's simple. If they want
someone else, fine. That no big deal to me. Trust me, I'll find
something else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty strong stuff for the eighth game of the season. Less than
three weeks ago, the Washington (2-4-2) rallied for a tie after
trailing the Kings by two goals in the third period. Six days ago,
the Kings had a 3-1 lead over Phoenix and a man advantage but
allowed a short-handed goal and four more after that.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kings, who play Pittsburgh on Thursday, have won two
straight after opening the homestand 0-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing after a bad loss is how you respond
to the adversity,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``We started a
little sluggish tonight, but I was very happy with the way everyone
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray was happiest with the performance of his defense, which
kept the Caps away from goalie Jamie Storr, who started Tuesday
after playing just one period in the first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who allowed goals to Peter Bondra and Calle Johansson in
the first period, had an otherwise quiet night. The Capitals had
just three shots on goal in the second period and just 17 for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But he showed none of the ill effects from a tender right groin
that forced him out of an Oct. 7 game in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was just incredible tonight,'' Storr said. ``I
can't even single one player out, they were all so good. After the
first period, they made it easy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings lead the league on the power play, their man
advantage backfired with 8:31 left in the first period when
Washington scored a shorthanded goal.
</P>
<P>
   With just 10 second remaining in the holding penalty by Ken
Klee, Kings defenseman Garry Galley lost the puck to Bondra at the
blue line. Bondra, perhaps the league's fastest skater, swooped
down on Storr and fired it over his left shoulder to give the Caps
a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Johansson made it 2-0 less than three minutes later when he
scored a power-play goal in front of Storr on a pass from Jan
Bulis. Although the Kings have been behind by two goals this
season, they have never trailed 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not where you want to put your goalie,'' Murray said. ``But we
responded.''

ANTI-GAY MARRIAGE INITIATIVE DROPS IN POLL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ELAINE HERSCHER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Support has declined for an initiative on the March ballot that
would prohibit the state from recognizing same-sex marriages,
according to a new Field Poll.
<P>
   Fifty percent of voters say they favor the measure, known as the
Definition of Marriage initiative; 41 percent would vote no. That
compares with 57 percent who said in August that they would vote
for it and 39 percent who were opposed.
</P>
<P>
   More voters are now undecided: 9 percent, compared with 4
percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one started ahead, and even though it's declined, it's
still ahead,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll. ``I
would certainly say, looking at the numbers, now it's in a weaker
position than it was two months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Also known as the Knight initiative after its sponsor, state
Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, the measure would add a
provision to the state's Family Code specifying that only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a pre-emptive move in the event another state
legalizes marriages between gay men or lesbians. Nowhere in the
United States can same-sex couples legally marry, and they will
still not be allowed to wed in California whether the measure wins
or loses.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage won by
big margins last year in Alaska and Hawaii, bringing to 31 the
number of states that outlaw same-sex unions. The Vermont Supreme
Court is expected to rule soon on the case of three same-sex
couples petitioning for the right to marry.
</P>
<P>
   The poll surveyed 1,001 Californians and was conducted from
October 8 to 17. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also oppose the Knight Initiative, while Republicans
are overwhelmingly in favor _ 68 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers indicate that the gay-marriage initiative would
benefit from a high Republican turnout for the state's March 7
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the poll found that the more someone
identifies with the lesbian and gay community, the less inclined he
or she is to vote for the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Only 17 percent of those who identified ``a lot'' with the gay
community would vote for the initiative, compared with 67 percent
of those who said they had no connection to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your identification with the community seems to be the
indicator of what you think about this initiative,'' said
DiCamillo.
</P>
<P>
   Religious affiliation also plays a role in people's opinions.
Protestants and Roman Catholics like the by nearly 2-to-1 margins,
but those who practice other religions or have no preference are
inclined against it.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage itself seems to have a bearing. Fifty-six percent of
people who are currently or formerly married said they would vote
yes.  &LR; for the ban. Among those who have always been single, only 31
percent think the ballot measure is a good idea.

 D.A. PLANNING TO REHASH WHOLE SLA HISTORY  &HT;     By MICHAEL TAYLOR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles prosecutors, possibly worried that they have a shaky
case against onetime radical fugitive Sara Jane Olson, plan to
dredge up the entire Patricia Hearst/Symbionese Liberation Army
saga of 25 years ago to use against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems they want to try her for conspiracy to commit a
revolution,'' her exasperated attorney, Stuart Hanlon, said
Tuesday. ``It really is the attempt of a desperate prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti
declined to discuss the case in detail, but did concede that it is
not an easy one to present, more than 20 years after the fact, and
she noted that the only witness to Olson's alleged crime died more
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The new assault on Olson comes in the form of an exhaustive
prosecution trial brief, which accuses Olson _ then known as
Kathleen Soliah _ of being a dedicated revolutionary who was just
as committed to violence and destruction as members of the SLA
itself. Most of the brief deals with the notorious acts of Patty
Hearst and the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, who is now a 52-year-old Minnesota housewife, was
indicted by a Los Angeles County grand jury in February 1976 on
murder conspiracy and explosives charges, stemming from an incident
in the fall of 1975 when Olson allegedly placed two pipe bombs
under Los Angeles police cars. The bombs never exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Olson later went underground and changed her name. She
eventually moved to St. Paul, Minn., marrying a doctor and raising
a family. She was arrested last June and is now free on $1 million
bail, awaiting trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, she was something of a hanger-on to the
SLA, a gang that had kidnapped newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst
and later converted her to their cause. If anything, Olson was kind
of an SLA understudy and in most of the historical writings about
that era was not considered a heavyweight, machine-gun-wielding
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, in his 26-page
trial brief, has reiterated almost the entire history of the
Hearst/SLA case, starting with the murder of Oakland schools
Superintendent Marcus Foster in November 1973, eight months before
Olson was connected to the SLA, and continuing through the arrests
of Hearst and SLA members Bill and Emily Harris in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has been subpoenaed as a prosecution witness against
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's ``role in the attempted Los Angeles bombings reflected
the extent of her dedication to the path of terrorism embraced by
the SLA `comrades,'` Garcetti's brief says. ``Her active
participation in other bombings, planned thefts, and two bank
robberies _ one in which a mother of four was killed _ demonstrates
her commitment, along with her co-conspirators, to effect
revolutionary changes through terrorist acts against innocent
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti also implicated Olson in the April 21, 1975, robbery of
a Crocker Bank branch in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael.
During the robbery, a 42-year-old woman was killed by a shotgun
blast. Hearst, who was driving the getaway car, says Emily Harris
pulled the trigger. Yet the only criminal prosecution ensuing from
the robbery was a federal a case against Olson's brother, Steven
Soliah, who was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's brief so outraged Hanlon Tuesday that he took
the unusual step of blasting it publicly, in contrast with his
earlier reticence to discuss the case in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indictment (against Olson) is really clear _ a conspiracy
to blow up two police cars,'' Hanlon said. ``That's the case, and I
think they've determined they have no evidence of that and so now
they are blackening her name.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the brief is devoted to the violent acts of others _
here's Hearst, machine gun in hand, robbing the Hibernia Bank in
San Francisco in April 1974; there's Hearst spraying the front of
Mel's Sporting Goods in Los Angeles with machine-gun fire a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was ultimately convicted in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco in connection with the Hibernia Bank robbery and served
two years in prison before President Jimmy Carter commuted her
sentence. Now, with the public support of Carter, she is trying to
get a presidential pardon.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 90 percent of that trial brief is based on Patty
Hearst and her book,'' Hanlon said, referring to Hearst's
autobiography and its oft-disputed version of events. ``All these
things are being connected by Patty Hearst. They're trying to retry
an entire conspiracy 25 years later and I don't know the point of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the point of it, Los Angeles district attorney
spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin declined to ``try this case in the
media,'' but added, ``We do recognize that, unlike wine, old cases
don't age gracefully, but a judge did sign an arrest warrant
(against Soliah) more than 20 years ago and there were facts
presented for that warrant.''

ANALYSIS: FEINSTEIN SUDDENLY FACES A FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep. Tom Campbell's entry
Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed
the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's experience, fund-raising ability and moderate
positions instantly make him the front-runner in a crowded field of
largely unknown GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein must now engage in a far more aggressive campaign,
while Democratic Party leaders no longer will be able to ignore the
California contest in favor of headline grabbers such as Hillary
Rodham Clinton's quest for a New York Senate seat. And the sudden
intensity diminishes the likelihood that Feinstein will be named to
the Democratic ticket as either Al Gore or Bill Bradley's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Campbell has won elections,'' said Jim Jordan, political
director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. ``He's a
serious person and not a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other
politician at her level, must now gird for another tough contest,
her fourth statewide battle of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell is a much smarter, more experienced and much more
adroit candidate'' than Feinstein's previous Senate opponents, said
Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who served as former Gov. Pete
Wilson's communications director. ``This will be her toughest race
since she lost to Pete Wilson (in 1990).''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Campbell entered the race, Feinstein's camp
maintained that they took nothing for granted. However, none of the
other candidates _ Ron Unz, Ray Haynes, Bill Horn or J.P. Gough _
has Campbell's electoral advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best candidate that Republicans have in the field,''
said Jennifer Duffy, an editor for the Cook Report, a nonpartisan
political newsletter that handicaps congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may not have to run a marathon,'' Duffy said of
Feinstein's race for re-election, ``but she's going to break a
sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Stanford Law professor who is regarded by colleagues
as perhaps the most cerebral member of Congress, said he will base
his Senate run on the intellectual notion of individual liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a person should have a personal life as free from
government intrusion as possible,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   It is from that belief that Campbell says he draws his support
for legal abortions, as well as his opposition to a personal income
tax (which he says should be replaced by a national sales tax).
</P>
<P>
   It will be a tough sell in a contest against a woman
whom &LR; Campbell has so far refused to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Feinstein has been a good senator,'' Campbell said
Tuesday. ``I believe I could be a better senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his moderation will be an asset in the contest with
Feinstein, he must first convince conservative Republican primary
voters that he is their best choice. At a news conference last
night in Washington, Campbell said no less than five times that he
was a ``fiscal conservative,'' touting his support of small
government and less taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as fiscally conservative as anyone in the field,''
Campbell said, ``and I'm someone who's got a chance to actually
win.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how eloquent Campbell gets &LR; may be on the stump, the
case against Feinstein will be hard to make. She is a respected
political moderate, as Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong _ who
lost to Barbara Boxer last year _ seemed to concede when he
repeatedly commended Feinstein in his stump speech, declaring that
Boxer ``is no Dianne Feinstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she is their opponent, Republicans have begun to
portray Feinstein as less accommodating, insisting the crowning
achievements of her Senate career _ the creation of a new national
park in the Mojave Desert and the enactment of a ban on assault
weapons _ are not so popular in the burgeoning suburbs and inland
cities far from the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer was far left, and Dianne Feinstein is moderate
left,'' said Fong, who is now a state co-chair of George W. Bush's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fong said Feinstein's GOP opponent in 1995, former Rep. Michael
Huffington, ``who was not exactly a first-tier candidate, showed
that Dianne Feinstein is vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what Huffington had in ample supply was money,
pumping $29 million of his own resources into the campaign. Fong,
who has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP race, said the best
candidate will be ``whomever can raise the most money.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are counting on the strong coattails of the GOP
presidential nominee to help whomever runs against Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political climate is going to be significantly better for
Tom Campbell in 2000 than it was for Matt Fong running in 1998,''
said Steve Schmidt, who was Fong's communication director.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will go after Feinstein for her strong political
connections to China _ she is on close terms with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin _ as well as her husband's business ties to the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time that we're looking into accusations of
Chinese spying, she's having dinner with Jiang Zemin,'' said Stuart
DeVeaux, a spokesman for the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the potential lines of attack, Feinstein enjoys a
broad base of support. A Field Poll released last week showed her
favorable ratings well above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feinstein has demonstrated she can be an independent voice for
the people of California,'' said her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata,
in what is likely to emerge as a campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's announcement puzzled many observers _ and not only
because it was made after sunset from the Republican Party
headquarters on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Why leave a safe House seat to take on an incumbent with great
poll numbers, proven fund-raising ability and a strong bipartisan
reputation?
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say Campbell has grown increasingly
frustrated in the House, where he has always been treated as an
outsider. Campbell has consistently voted against his GOP
colleagues on matters ranging from abortion to gun control, and he
was one of only seven Republicans to vote against Newt Gingrich's
bid to be re-elected as speaker in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with pressure from Stanford University to choose
between a career in politics or academia, pushed Campbell into
making the gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates it in the House,'' said a Democratic member who asked
not to be identified. ``I think he believes he has nothing to
lose.''

 HOUSE BACKS CLINTON PLAN TO BAN INTERNET TAXES  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Seldom do House Republicans and President
Clinton agree on anything these days.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the House voted 423 to 1 to endorse a key White
House objective heading into a new round of global trade talks next
month: a worldwide ban on Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has little substantive effect, merely voicing a ``sense
of the Congress.'' But it signals a GOP embrace of what could prove
the most far-reaching policy of the Clinton administration, which
has set out to make the Internet a ``global free-trade zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to me that we can have essentially a unanimous
vote on such a sturdy policy of no taxes in America or around the
world on e-commerce,'' said Chris Cox, the conservative Newport
Beach Republican who sponsored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious White House agenda, first outlined two years ago
as a ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,'' amounts to a
free-market manifesto calling on governments to forgo regulation
and taxation of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Internet has such explosive potential for
prosperity, it should be a global free-trade zone,'' Clinton
declared at the time, ``a place where government makes every effort
first ... to do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who also authored last year's Internet Tax Freedom Act that
imposed a three-year moratorium on domestic Internet taxes, said in
an interview that the idea is one area where he fully agrees with
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the administration's Internet policy was developed
by former White House policy guru Ira Magaziner, who devised the
complex health care plan that nearly sank Clinton's first term and
helped usher in the GOP congressional majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undoubtedly the case that Ira learned from the health
care task force how not to develop a legislative program,'' Cox
said, calling Magaziner's Internet framework ``an excellent
product.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Magaziner left the White House, Cox said, no one is
clearly in charge of Internet policy, and the administration has
not ``shown sufficient support for a permanent ban'' on e-commerce
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``However the administration thinking may be developing on this,
it is opaque,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky
sharply disagreed, saying top officials ``are strongly on record''
advocating ``duty-free cyberspace. It's one of our strongest
messages and one of our firm commitments for the new round of
negotiations. We would take issue with anyone who says that we
haven't made that abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's urging, the World Trade Organization, the group of
135 countries whose trade ministers will meet in Seattle, already
agreed in May 1998 to a moratorium on electronic transmission
taxes, such as the recent U.N. proposal for a so-called ``bit tax''
on e-mails and other electronic data sent over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. idea was quickly shot down, and it is widely expected
that that WTO moratorium will be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   But once talks get beyond simple transmission taxes, the issues
surrounding Internet trade become hotly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to handle the problem of digital products'' in the
Seattle talks, Barshevsky said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   These can include Internet-downloaded software, movies, stock
trading, banking and professional services such as law,
architecture and consulting _ areas where the United States has a
commanding export advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous field, and WTO rules with respect to
digitized content are not clear,'' Barshevsky said. Rules on
patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property
sent over the Internet also have to be clarified, she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, the undersecretary for international trade at the
Department of Commerce, warned last week that the European Union
has made its support for the tax moratorium contingent on nine
other items that ``could pave the way for duties in the future,''
including labeling all electronic deliveries as ``services,'' to
permit trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The area of Internet content is even murkier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French and Canadians are already arguing that cultural
industries should be exempt'' from any moratorium, including music,
television and movies, said Tim Bennett, vice president for trade
at the American Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Local Taxes Possible
</P>
<P>
   Even if national governments forgo e-commerce taxes, their own
localities may not. U.S. state governors continue to press hard for
the authority to impose sales taxes on interstate e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Cox issued a blunt warning to the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, which was established by his legislation.
``It's an advisory commission; it will only give us advice,'' Cox
said. ``So the real question is what would happen if they
recommended taxing the Internet, and I can tell you the answer: It
would die a horrible death in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While no country imposes taxes on e-commerce, Cox maintained
that governments will try. ``Birds fly, fish swim, and government
taxes and regulates,'' Cox said, adding that his domestic
moratorium demonstrated that it is easier to prevent taxes than to
roll them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has been to occupy the field with a policy
prescription that says this is off limits,'' he said. ``If we had
waited until this became pandemic, then the forces of the political
status quo would have overwhelmed us.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A hero for our times
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Rose, late of the Cincinnati Reds, is a hero for our
confused, disparate times. One of the finest ballplayers of all
time, Charlie Hustle was tossed out of baseball for gambling on the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the punishment, Pete was barred from the Baseball
Hall of Fame _ an honor he richly deserved. The Hall of Fame is no
crucible of character. Ty Cobb, by all accounts, was a miserable
human being. Babe Ruth was scarcely Mother Theresa.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of exile were vague. There was a muzzy promise that
some day, under unspecified conditions, the issue could be
reopened. Fans now sense the time has come. Pete recently appeared
in Atlanta as a member of a century's-best team. There, NBC's Jim
Gray subjected him to a caustic interview.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was deeply resented. Jim Gray, fans felt, had
ruined what might have been a nice, emotional moment. Nothing, in
our times, could be worse. Still, Gray was being a reporter, asking
questions that needed answers. Gray, nevertheless, seems to have
entered everybody's hall of infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose deserves his Hall of Fame. His fans deserve an
explanation.

 &HT;    STUDY: INTERNET ECONOMY TO TOP $500 BILLION IN 1999
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The booming Internet economy has grown ``at an
astounding rate'' of 68 percent since last year and is on track to
generate $507 billion in revenue this year, University of Texas
researchers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the overall economy grows at (an annual rate of) 4
percent, we'd say it's 'hot,' `` Anitesh Barua, associate director
of the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce at the
university's Graduate School of Business, noted Tuesday. He is the
co-author of the study along with the center's director, Andrew
Whinston.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet makes up only a small part of the nation's $8
trillion economy, the study suggests it has surpassed such
traditional sectors as automobiles telecommunications and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers,'' Barua said in an interview here, ``suggest
that we are finally seeing some of the payoffs from having built
out the Internet infrastructure _ and it's still going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rise was led by electronic commerce, whose revenues
rose 127 percent from $16.5 billion in the first quarter of 1998 to
$37.5 billion in the same quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the Internet accounted for 2.3 million
jobs in the first quarter of 1999, up from 1.5 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing these increases even though we do not as yet
have widespread use of broadband Internet technology,'' Barua said.
``Nevertheless, the commerce layer (of the Internet) is going
through the roof, and that's a very good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not suggesting that all of the security hurdles have
been overcome,'' he added. ``But the fear of the unknown is by and
large gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The next big online breakthrough may come through expanded use
of ``smart'' telephones, the Austin-based researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are familiar with wireless devices and will use them to
buy things on the Internet, schedule their flights and so forth,''
said Whinston. ``To many people, it's something that doesn't seem
to be a computer. It's more like a telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whinston and Barua compiled their results by observing 3,400
U.S. companies that generate all or part of their revenues from
Internet products or services. Some of their data was gleaned using
reports from research companies, financial reports and the Web
sites of 350 of the largest firms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's findings update an initial report issued in June and
paid for by Cisco Systems. That study found the Internet accounted
for $301 billion in revenue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, an undersecretary at the U.S. Commerce
Department, said the Internet is growing so fast because ``it is a
potentially incredibly efficient way to reach an enormous market.''
</P>
<P>
   He viewed University of Texas study as a useful, if broad,
measure of current trends. Both the Census Bureau and the Bureau of
Economic Analysis _ arms of the Commerce Department _ produce
measures of e-commerce activity that track closely with the Austin
results. The department plans to issue its first measure of
e-commerce retail trade early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers divided the Internet into four layers:
infrastructure, applications, intermediaries and commerce. They
view the interplay of these layers as the Internet ``ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   All four layers exhibited strong growth since early 1998. Total
revenue from the infrastructure and applications layers came to $63
billion in the first quarter of this year, while the intermediary
and commerce layers contributed $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After correcting for overlapping factors, the study pegged
Internet revenues in the first quarter at $108 billion, a 68
percent leap from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   As defined by the researchers, the Internet economy is made up
of companies that generate all or part of their revenues from
Internet-related products and services, such as Cisco, Dell
Computer Corp. and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To this group, they add both pure Internet sellers such as
Amazon.com and eToys.com and the cyberspace business of such
traditional companies as L.L. Bean and Wal-Mart.

 &HT;    Call this school Rockerville
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ In Jim Turner's worn leather wallet is a ticket
stub from John Rocker's first game in a Braves uniform, from spring
training on March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carry it around just to remind me that dreams can happen,''
says Turner, Rocker's old high school baseball coach at First
Presbyterian Day School.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, hand-lettered banners around the 746-student campus
heralded the school's most famous graduate, a former pitcher for
their very own Vikings: ``LET'S ROCK(ER) THE WORLD!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker attended the school from first grade, earning A's and B's
as well as respect as an athlete before graduating in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been real excited about watching John and thinking
that we've had a part in his life,'' principal Joe Childs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous every time he gets up there,'' said Lyn Wiggins,
Rocker's former English teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat,'' said Harris Lee, a senior and a Vikings shortstop
and pitcher. ``I go to the same school. He always comes down in the
offseason to give us tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashad Eldridge, also a senior ballplayer, once got into some
trouble he doesn't want to discuss. Rocker heard about it and
confronted the center fielder on one of his visits to Macon. ``He
got in my face yelling and letting me know I have potential to be a
high draft pick and don't let that go to waste. I took that to
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, dreams can happen. Turner, a high school baseball
coach for 17 years, once dreamed of playing professional ball
himself. He made it as far as Class A for the Cincinnati Reds. Now,
he admits to living a little through Rocker. On Saturday, he
traveled to Atlanta to watch Rocker in the first game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 ticket was a gift from Rocker to the coach, who stopped
by the Braves' dugout and flashed Rocker an encouraging hand signal
the two men understand as ``too legit to quit.'' ``See ya after the
game,'' Rocker called. But afterward reporters crushed around
Rocker, and Turner had to get back to Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's father coached Little League, and one of the fields in
Macon is named after him. So, little John Rocker played on that
Turner Field long before he stepped onto Atlanta's. ``The kids
didn't want to play catch with him because he threw so hard,''
Turner said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have much control,'' remembered Chris Wilson, a
friend who was in Rocker's graduating class and now teaches
physical education at the school. ``So you knew that if he hit you,
it was going to cause you some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in elementary PE, he was very intense,'' said Childs, who
taught that class to young Rocker. ``He was the type of kid who
would get upset if his team lost in kickball. He did not take
losing gently.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, in high school, Rocker's coaches told him to walk a
player. Rocker didn't want to; he wanted to strike him out. No,
they said. To which, Turner said, Rocker replied something like:
``Then let me just hit him, so he'll earn first base.'' He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching Rocker in high school had its rewards and trying
moments. Turner routinely disciplined him for throwing his helmet
and made Rocker do ``pickups,'' scrambling one way and then another
for the ball. ``He'd get up into the 300s probably by the end of
the season,'' Turner said. ``He probably holds that record, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Turner tried to set Rocker straight was after the
ballplayer made national news for cursing the Mets and their fans.
``I wasn't real pleased about it,'' Turner said. He met Rocker in
the Braves' locker room the night the team won the championship
series. ``We talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turner, a fatherly presence with his players who teaches
Bible classes, isn't all disciplinarian. He is profoundly proud of
Rocker and pointed out that the school has retired his No. 21
jersey _ and the mitt his teammates used to catch his pitches. They
are encased in glass in a busy corridor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Turner was wondering if he should travel to New York.
He's never been to New York, and the idea ``sort of scares me,'' he
said with another laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the man has a ticket to dream. ``John on the mound
getting a save for the seventh game _ that would be my dream,''
Turner said. ``I'm sure it's his dream, too.''

 &HT;    The nut gallery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maybe the squirrels have the right idea
stocking up on nuts and seeds during the fall. After all, we've got
holiday baking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But think outside the shell for a moment. Savories as well as
sweets benefit from a crunch, and a flavor that's unique. Where
better to get it than from a food that's good for you, as well as
tasty?
</P>
<P>
   Nut-crusted fish and shellfish star on many menus. Nuts
accentuate stir-fry dishes. Try them tossed in a pasta salad or hot
pasta dish, or sprinkle some on top of a cream soup for texture
(hazelnuts marry well with potato soup; pecans perk up pumpkin
bisque).
</P>
<P>
   Nuts sometimes get a bad rap for their high oil content, but
they're packed with protein and beneficial acids. They taste great
with no additives, so you're not munching on empty calories. And
what about that oil? Nutritionists agree it's healthy _
plant-based, with no processing _ and the amount normally used in
recipes is slight.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're stuck on the old favorites, such as walnuts, pecans
and almonds. Look at the variety the nut bin offers today: black
walnuts from Virginia, pine nuts from Italy, hazelnuts from Oregon
and pistachios from the Middle East. Move over to the seeds, and
discover sunflower and pumpkin seeds roasted in different oils for
additional flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is typically the nut harvest in America. Our holidays are
rich with nutty foods such as pecan and walnut pies for
Thanksgiving, cinnamon-nut filled rugalach for Hanukkah or nutty
fruitcakes at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   American cooks have long enjoyed a variety of nuts. Black
walnuts found their way into Colonial recipes; chestnuts were
abundant up until this century and pecans covered the Southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, the almond, walnut and hazelnut trees were
harvested by cooks during the gold mining era.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii is still the main producer of macadamias. America's
mainland cooks weren't so familiar with them until Debbie Fields
added them to chocolate chip cookies and popularity boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Pine nuts, or pignoli, joined our pantries during the Italian
food craze. A renewed interest in classic French dishes
reintroduced us to Europe's beloved hazelnut. Chestnuts also pop up
occasionally on haute menus. Look for them to be the nut darling of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Home cooks can learn from the chefs who not only chop nuts, but
grind them into nut flour or nut pastes, or toast, roast and fry
them to add to dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Use these tips when working with nuts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chop them fine when using as a coating, to keep them from
falling off during cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use care when chopping with a food processor _ the nuts can
quickly turn to flour or paste.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add a teaspoon or two of flavored oil to nuts when grinding to
make a nut butter that's delicious as a spread for cooked fish,
chicken or pork.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baking with nuts? Toss them with flour or cinnamon-sugar to
keep them suspended in a batter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Toasting nuts before chopping will bring out their best
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   _ All nuts contain oils. To preserve their flavor, they should
be kept refrigerated or frozen. Nuts can become rancid over time
and if exposed to heat.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list that can help you match dishes to nuts, but note
that any nut can be substituted for any other in a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Almonds: Toasting brings out their slight cherry-like flavor.
Makes a delicious nut butter. Classic dish: Green beans amandine.
</P>
<P>
   Cashews: The fruit of this nut is considered a delicacy in the
Caribbean islands, where they grow readily. Cashews are typically
served with stir-fried chicken, but also are delicious toasted,
ground and used as a coating for fish. Make a nut butter to spread
on asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts: The English are masters at this meaty nut's use; they
candy them, make them into sweet pastes and serve them roasted.
Delicious with cheese and served with port.
</P>
<P>
   Hazelnuts (also called filberts): Coffee drinkers and chocolate
connoisseurs know that hazelnuts mix with bitter, dark flavors.
Sprinkle them over mashed turnips and parsnips, or add them to
spiced carrots and cinnamon-flavored sweet potatoes. Top a pumpkin
pie with lightly toasted, coarsely chopped hazelnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Macadamias: These sweet nuts are so oily, they're sinful. It's
hard to find them without salt, but you can wash them off to toast
them and chop fine for a fish or chicken coating. Crush them well,
and coat shrimp with the nuts and coconut for a tropical flavor, or
make them into a nut butter.

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Pecans: The workhorse of the nut family.
Pecans are an oily nut, perfect for toasting. They go into any
cheese dish or any spicy Cajun mixture as well. Chicken or catfish
coated with these are becoming classics on Southern menus. Try a
pecan-cornmeal cake to serve under ham or shrimp at brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Pine nuts: These can go into salads or in hot pasta dishes right
out of the package. Toasted, they're a fine substitute for pecans.
Biscotti made with pine nuts is the perfect accompaniment to
espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Pistachios: The drier quality of this nut makes it ideal for
salads and in dishes where toasting isn't needed. Its green color
is a plus for presentation. Add them to a curried chicken salad
with apples or sprinkle them on top of hummus for a Middle Eastern
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Walnuts: Along with pecans, one of the most versatile nuts. To
some, however, walnuts have a slight bitter flavor. Pair them with
sweeter or saltier foods to overcome this. They toast and fry to
perfection, and their earthy flavor sets off greens, onions and
leeks. Walnut butter works on roast pork that's been cooked with
cranberries, or duck with oranges.

 &HT;    Guru: Shoppers will beat path to your adore
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ True story. Appliance dealer consults a
marketing guru.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparison shopping is killing my bottom line,'' he complains.
``After I give a customer my best price, how do I keep them from
going to another dealer to beat it?''
</P>
<P>
   The guru, Tom Feltenstein, founder of the Neighborhood Marketing
Institute of Palm Beach, thinks it over and gets back to the
client: ``Give your shopper two pints of Haagen-Dazs as they leave
the store. They'll have to get home before it melts in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Tom Feltenstein who advised a small furniture
dealer what to do when two larger furniture stores built next door
to him on either side: ``Put up a huge sign that says 'Enter Here.'
``
</P>
<P>
   Also the same Tom Feltenstein who keeps writing books chock full
of relentless good advice, advice so upbeat, life-affirming and
spiritual that you could just upchuck. No, I didn't say that. And
if I did, I didn't mean it. Look, I read every word of ``Life!
Making it Work for You,'' which Feltenstein published in 1990, and
recommended it at the time. And now that the author has come out
with ``Uncommon Wisdom'' (Lebhar-Fridman Books, $29.95 in
hardcover, available through www.amazon.com), I concur entirely
with Dr. Patch Adams, who wrote in a jacket blurb:
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not God, but the financial world surely projects that
message. (Feltenstein's) suggestion is that life's true wealth is
measured in things far more soulful than property.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are 500 ways of saying that goodness and mercy and the
joy of combat can coexist in the same bosom, Feltenstein has found
them. Indeed, when my review copy of ``Uncommon Wisdom'' fell open,
the first words I saw were:
</P>
<P>
   ``Make money. Have fun. Be ethical. These are the three keys to
a successful business career. They were given to me years ago when
I first took a job with a very large hamburger chain headquartered
in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The hamburger chain was McDonald's and Feltenstein was its head
of marketing in the 1970s, leaving to work for Burger King before
finally starting his own consulting company in Palm Beach in 1983.
Today he has 20 employees, hundreds of clients and speaks 100 times
a year.
</P>
<P>
   And he has a message: ``Be kind. In your personal life and your
business life, kindness is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   To cite one example: If you own a restaurant, give all your
employees business cards. Your dishwasher shops, gets his or her
hair cut, meets new people. Why shouldn't he or she enjoy the
pleasure of producing a business card and recommending the employer
when introductions are made?
</P>
<P>
   Kindness improves the bottom line. And if kindness alone doesn't
transport you to the next plateau, it does worlds for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in our upbringings, our schooling, our careers,''
laments Feltenstein, ``are we taught to appreciate, to value, to
enjoy, even to love the plateau.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, this is uncommon wisdom, and you can take only so
much of it before you drive to Tom Feltenstein's offices in the
Palm Beach Towers, corner the author in his office and ask him:
</P>
<P>
   Where do you get all this stuff? Do you have a real job or do
you just spend the live-long day jotting down grand thoughts as
fast as you can think them?
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the usual questions Feltenstein fields from
clients, so he smiles tightly and it's five seconds of mental
rummaging before he comes up with just the right morsel of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only teach what you need to learn,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   I reward him with the blank stare this answer deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Feltenstein, a trim 60, bespeaking 30 years of pre-dawn runs,
rocks back in his chair and attempts to explain a life spent in
search of enlightenment while knocking them dead in the Darwinian
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was very metaphysical, a Christian Scientist, and I
have been a searcher on the path my whole life. I read constantly,
but no fiction. Usually self-improvement books, philosophy and
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the McDonald's days, Feltenstein was already wedded to
his belief that nice guys can finish first, but there were times it
was a tough sell, even to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I discovered running in the '60s and meditation. I
had a sign on the door, 'I just need silence for 30 minutes.'
Nobody challenged me because I worked long hours in a heady,
exciting, hip business. I can honestly say I had no setbacks, no
serious illness, nothing to forge me.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his marketing savvy, even the right ad campaign was only
a foot in the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years ago I finally realized that I could bring in
millions of customers, I could put lines around the block. But I
couldn't get them to return unless the employees had self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   And with this epiphany, Feltenstein saw into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass marketing is dead. In the future, employers will discover
their internal customer, their own employees. If you treat your
employee as you treat your customer, invest some of your
advertising money in your employees, you will learn the secret of
building repeat business. Now you will have a chance if Wal-Mart
opens up next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Feltenstein said, quality is a given. Price is
important, and so is service, but the one thing customers are
looking for are businesses that make them feel adored. Saturn has
learned this. So has the Ritz-Carlton. So has the restaurant with
the sign that says ``Ask us for our worst table,'' and then rewards
the patron with a half-price meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kindness,'' repeats Feltenstein, ``is the answer. It begins
with the people who work within your four walls.''

 &HT;    That karma-hither look
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Has body glitter lost its luster? Do
henna-decorated hands make you want to suppress a yawn?
</P>
<P>
   Bindi may be the answer to your adornment doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   The art of decorating the face and body with colored paints,
powders and jewels, bindi is this year's mendhi, the practice of
henna painting that hit celebrity hands a few seasons back. Think
of bindi as a painless alternative to tattooing and piercing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to decorate their bodies, but they don't want to
do it permanently,'' says Deidra Lynch, an artist with
Orlando-based Henna People.
</P>
<P>
   Singer Gwen Stefani was one of the first performers to get
starry-eyed over bindi, which in its simplest form has been used in
India to signify marriage. Madonna was briefly stuck on the trend,
and Boy George sported bindi during September's fashion shows in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   And a sure sign that a fad has hit the mainstream: Women's
publications start policing it. October's Allure magazine takes
LeAnn Rimes to task for wearing bindis that are the same size as
her earrings. (The three most important rules about bindi:
Proportion, proportion, proportion.)
</P>
<P>
   Do you dare try the look yourself?
</P>
<P>
   First, a few definitions:
</P>

   Four Henna People artists traveled to 39 cities with Lilith Fair

with the Orlando-based Henna People. ``Americans have just started
wearing this, so who's to say what's wrong and what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't wear bindis below the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people try to wear them on their chest or arms, that's
when they lose them,'' Lynch says. ``You'll have a lot fewer
problems if you stick to wearing it above the neckline.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do match your makeup and clothing to the bindi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dark-colored bindis need dramatic makeup,'' writes Beth
Margetts in her Bindi book, part of Tuttle Publishing's Bindi Body
Art Kit. ``Glittery jewels need shimmer and shine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Do choose a bindi that complements your overall look,
``whether hippie chic, glamour puss, minimalist, party girl or
urban street,'' Margetts writes.

 &HT;    Big Dog unleashed: Grant erupts both ways
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athens, Ga. _ Georgia coach Jim Donnan could not resist a little
``I told you so'' after Charles Grant's performance Saturday
against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs freshman, who plays defensive end and running back,
had a big day on both sides of the ball against the Wildcats. On
offense, Grant carried the ball three times for 44 yards and scored
two touchdowns. On defense, he had seven tackles, five tackles for
loss and three sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The performance earned Grant SEC Defensive Player of the Week
honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most overrated players in the country,''
Donnan said sarcastically. ``At least, that's what everybody keeps
telling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan had recently encountered some criticism for over-hyping
Grant and placing unrealistic expectations on the 6-foot-4,
265-pound native of Colquitt. Despite Donnan's early lauding, Grant
didn't get his first start at defensive end until Saturday and saw
only limited playing time in the first five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been on my derriere ever since I made that little
comment about being excited about him,'' Donnan said. ``But anybody
who's seen him can tell you, that guy's special.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant showed against Kentucky what all the fuss is about,
proving himself both a dominating pass rusher and an explosive
runner. He made his presence known immediately with two
first-quarter sacks and a 1-yard touchdown run. In the fourth
quarter, he ignited the sellout crowd of 86,117 at Sanford Stadium
with a 42-yard TD run on which he leaped over two defenders at the
line of scrimmage, broke a tackle, then outran a defensive back for
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he ``had fun'' playing offense but was most proud of
his defensive performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting all those sacks, that's what I really liked,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were having trouble pressuring opposing
quarterbacks before Saturday. They came into the game with just 12,
last in the SEC, before getting 11 against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The question becomes, what took Georgia so long to start Grant?
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rushing the quarterback) is the basic talent, the basic skill
that you need. But, obviously, you have to play within the
system,'' said assistant head coach Joe Kines, who oversees
defensive ends. ``They call something in the huddle and it means
something to (Grant) now. You look back at Champ (Bailey), this was
about the time he started to start. . . . It was just a matter of
time. He's right where he needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant doesn't begrudge the coaches for the time it took him to
fulfill Donnan's prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in, I didn't know too much about
defense,''he said. ``The coaches made sure I knew everything I
needed to know before they turned me loose. I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kines has worked overtime to keep his star pupil humble, which
hasn't been easy considering he's as impressed as anyone with
Grant's unique abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's certainly given him a good set of tools,'' Kines said.
``But it's like I told him: `The only thing we can deal with is
today's practice. Let's concentrate 100 percent on getting better
today, and everything else will take care of itself.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for all the praise Donnan heaped on his early on, Grant just
shrugs and smiles
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider that hype,''Grant said. ``He was just telling
it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll get no argument from Kentucky.

 &HT;    For daughter of Gary Cooper, dad was half of incredible family
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was a few years ago that Maria Cooper
Janis began thinking seriously about her father again. Rocky
Cooper, her mother, had a stroke that had taken away her speech,
and one way for mother and daughter to be together was to go over
the family scrapbooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Scotch tape had dried out, and many of the photographs were
loose, so Maria and her mother resealed the photos and wrote
captions for them, with Rocky writing the names of all the people
Maria didn't recognize.
</P>
<P>
   But so many of them were obvious _ there was Hemingway and
Picasso and Ingrid Bergman and Robert Capa, in places such as Paris
and Brentwood and Sun Valley. And, reticently looming over them all
was Maria's father, Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was assembling all this material,'' says Janis, ``and it
started me thinking about the sweep of history and the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Gary Cooper Off Camera'' (Abrams), part
coffee-table book, part biography, part essay on the idea and the
reality of Gary Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be able to tell how it was from my point of view,
and what our family life was like. And the issue of who Gary Cooper
was in an era when fame and fortune makes people go so crazy. He
was the top man in his field until he died, he became an American
icon, and he never lost his sense of values. His sense of
proportion about life, and his priorities were always pretty darn
clear. I wanted to tell that story: that you can have all the
goodies of life and still maintain a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cooper was the most gravely beautiful of all male stars,
with a moral power that made him the supreme object of
contemplation for directors as varied as Frank Capra, Howard Hawks,
Cecil B. DeMille and Fred Zinnemann.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was the quiet American _ strong and resolute, capable of
doubt, incapable of cruelty. It was the gentleness that set him
apart from actors such as John Wayne and James Stewart, who could
be aggressively harsh. In contrast to them, Cooper was solitary and
shy, with a terrible anxiety at the heart of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was not a man who brought the office home with him. In
fact, he almost never talked about acting. ``To the extent that
rehearsing would have meant him pacing around his room muttering to
himself or emoting, that was not his style,'' his daughter said.
``He dropped that when he left the studio. Paradoxically, he was
still very much that person you saw on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The man his daughter describes had a pantheistic connection to
nature, deriving from his childhood in Montana, and would rather go
fishing or hunting than make a movie. At the same time, he was no
bumpkin; educated in England _ his father was a judge _ Cooper knew
art, knew fashion, knew and adored women.
</P>
<P>
   As described by his daughter and virtually everybody who ever
crossed his path, Cooper was an enchanting man, sweet, mild and
unpretentious. But he was also lugging something around with him,
something heavy _ he aged very quickly, was periodically troubled
by ulcers and other manifestations of a nervous disposition, and
died young, at 60.
</P>
<P>
   What was was eating him?
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd always get uptight when he was working. He smoked a lot,
tried to give it up, but never quite could. He was of the school,
if you had a personal problem, you went out alone and figured it
out for yourself. I'm sure he had things that bothered him, but he
felt that you ought to be able to handle it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper loved to read history, didn't care much for fiction, with
the exception of Don Quixote, which deeply appealed to him, and
which he occasionally circled around the idea of playing. His
daughter remembers that, just about the time he was overtaken by
cancer, he was searching for someone to do a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really terribly funny. He didn't tell jokes, but he had
a very wry, sharp sense of humor, and it filtered in and out of
everyday conversation. His take on things had a very humorous
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was only married once, but his marriage survived stresses
that would decimate most relationships. He was, of course, among
the most attractive men of any era, and was relentlessly pursued by
women. Usually, he allowed himself to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in the late '40s, he left his family for several
years while he lived with actress Patricia Neal. But after a couple
of years, he came home and never left again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my parents basically loved each other very much. And
they both respected each other a hell of a lot. When the going got
rough, she did not play the self-pity victim part. She got her act
together, and said, 'I'm gonna live my life for a while.' She did
not sit home and turn to the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At those times, you have a choice; you can go inside and pull
in, or discover yourself, and gain confidence. She was a great
starter of projects, tremendous imagination, always coming up with
a new project, a new group of people. She was a generator.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was diagnosed with cancer in 1960; after a period of
remission, it came roaring back. He looked at his options. The only
aggressive treatment was cobalt, with terrible side effects. Cooper
said the hell with it, and settled down to die.
</P>
<P>
   So many kids of famous people find it hard to make the
transition to some kind of reality when the light from a great star
fades away. How do you top an act that consists of Gary Cooper and
Ernest Hemingway, that makes everything else seem pallid?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Maria Cooper Janis has been married for nearly 35 years to
the pianist Byron Janis and is well-known in theatrical and
literary circles as one of the sanest, most delightful women
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that goes right to my parents. They put in my mind
from day one what the difference was between false values and the
real thing. They told me right up front, when I was 10 years old,
that life doesn't owe you a goddamn thing. And then they
embellished that by telling me that whatever you want, you have to
earn it, work for it, make your own choices. It's not going to come
to you by divine right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back on it, we had a very normal family life. I
had a nanny but I had a lot of time with them. We did a lot of
things together; when he wasn't working, we did things together;
sports, athletic things, museums, just hanging out. That was the
norm for me. A couple of times a week, my mother would take me to
the beach, we'd throw sticks into the ocean, walk with the dog. If
Poppa wasn't working, he'd be there. You don't have to go to
Disneyland and spend hundreds of dollars. It's a question of giving
yourself.''

 &HT;    Making a few celestial observations
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One of my most vivid memories is of sitting
under the stars in Big Bend National Park, more than 20 years ago,
miles away from light pollution, lying flat on my back and staring
goggle-eyed at a sky that one sees all too rarely when living near
a city. My college buddy and I got into this weird riff about how
maybe the whole cosmos was a celestial planetarium in God's
library/study, that what we were seeing wasn't really light years
away, and maybe we were all in miniature _ lots of little
Lilliputians running about with our self-importance and sense of
worth.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you had to be there_ young, foolish, under the
influence of cheap Mexican beer and unformed minds. Still, the
stars never fail to fascinate me, much like classical music does. I
rarely have a clue what I'm looking at or listening to, but most of
it engages the mind, though not enough for me to go to the effort
to learn more about it. One has to compartmentalize .
</P>
<P>
   So last week's trek to the Stephen F. Austin observatory was a
welcome field trip to a jewel hidden in these Piney Woods. I did a
story for the newspaper a couple of decades ago on the observatory,
the last time I visited. It was impressive then and even more so
now.
</P>
<P>
   The outing was planned by the Grand Poobah of our Nacogdoches
Tennis and Adult Beverage Porch and Deck Club (NTABPDC). He runs
the physics department at SFA. Our tennis group has been getting
together most every Thursday night for seven or eight years to play
what we call old men's doubles tennis. That's somewhat of a
misnomer since there are a few female members who generally try not
to humiliate us graybeards too often _ just enough to keep us
humble. We have a rigid schedule: 90 minutes of tennis that is not
intended to raise one's pulse rate any more than, say, trying to
dash to the car in the rain, followed by 90 minutes of socializing
at a member's house, done on a rotating basis, with the schedule
carefully organized by the above-mentioned Grand Poobah. The man is
a genius at organization, and likely will serve as Grand Poobah for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the observatory, we chowed down at a fish fry,
the fish coming from a recent non-tennis outing by some members to
the Gulf Coast. I am unwilling to fish, not liking hooks, cleaning
fish or getting seasick, but I'm powerfully fond of eating fish.
You catch it, I'll eat it. That's my motto.
</P>
<P>
   Just after dark, we headed north to the observatory, tucked in
behind the experimental beef farm for a tour conducted by Norm
Markworth, the observatory director, who got a free meal out of the
deal in exchange for conducting the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory boasts a 15-inch telescope, the largest between
McDonald Observatory in West Texas and the East Coast. Markworth
and associates helped build it. There are two other domed
observatories, and a concrete pad with stands for smaller
telescopes. Students had already set up the telescopes oriented
toward stellar attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Markworth first gave a fascinating tour of the sky above,
pointing out constellations with a flashlight that served
surprisingly well as a pointer. He admitted something I've always
wondered about. Hardly anybody sees a bull when they look at
Taurus, or a scorpion, or any of that stuff, save maybe the Big and
Little Dipper. Makes me wonder what those Greeks were smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Through the smaller scopes, one got an amazing glimpse of a
crescent moon, the craters crystal clear. For the first time I saw
Saturn and its rings outside of a photograph, and a hazy view of
Jupiter and one moon that I could pick out. On a computer screen
hooked to one of the big scopes, you could track an asteroid
discovered by an SFA astronomer.
</P>
<P>
   It was beautiful, eerie and fascinating all at once. That cosmos
I once watched while lying in the desert in Big Bend still may be
all one giant planetarium _ God's practical joke _ but that doesn't
make it any less interesting.
</P>
<P>
   I walked out the other night and stared at the sky, trying to
pick out the constellations Markworth pointed out with such
admirable ease. I live far enough out of town to have a decent view
of the sky, though nothing like at the observatory. I spotted the
Big Dipper after first finding the North Star. I'm still hunting
that danged scorpion.

 &HT;    Only good snakes are dead snakes
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I killed a snake in the yard the other day.
Guess that explains why the dogs were dancing around on their hind
legs and holding up their petticoats.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few days, they had been urgently trying to tell me
about the snake, but I thought they just wanted to come in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes, as you know, are all six feet long until they are killed
then they tend to shrink. This one shrank to about three feet.
</P>
<P>
   I follow the philosophy that the only good snake is a dead
snake. I probably ended up killing a snake that only eats fleas and
other snakes, but in the heat of the moment, I didn't take the time
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked later if it had a triangular-shaped head. If a
snake has a tringular-shaped head that means it is either poisonous
or non-poisonous, I forget which.
</P>
<P>
   When I got around to looking at it, its head was shaped more
like a pancake from where I had been hitting it with the flat side
of a hoe.
</P>
<P>
   Is it me or is it the snakes? We just don't seem to get along.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of summers ago, I decided to clean out a storage
cabinet at an old lake house, and get rid of all the busted fishing
tackle, cans of rusted bolts and nails and an old black garden hose
that was rolled up in the back corner.
</P>
<P>
   I was up to my elbows in the cabinet pulling out junk and was
just about to grab that black hose when it started moving.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I started moving.
</P>
<P>
   I got as far away as I could as quickly as I could and wiped a
cold sweat off my forehead. To this day I still shiver at the
thought of that snake lying in wait for me to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I had composed myself and found a lethal weapon, the
snake had disappeared. I had violated the most sacred law of the
lake: Don't let a snake get away alive.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't about to go looking for a snake I didn't want to see in
the first place, so I closed the cabinet and put thoughts of
cleaning it up out of my mind.
</P>
<P>
   As for that snake I killed the other day, I like to think it was
the same one at the lake. It took him two years to track me down
and now the score has been settled. Snake, 0. Hoe, 1.

 &HT;    Pastor-ized: Minister's skills yield heavenly results
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Ohio _ He's the genial pastor winemaker of Miami County,
but right now, he's standing in the middle of his back yard,
frowning, rain pelting his cap, his thumb and forefinger stroking
his chin.
</P>
<P>
   There's no deep, ecclesiastical debate going on in the mind of
this Episcopalian rector. Mel Schlachter is trying to decide
whether to put his newly crushed red wine blend into an oak barrel
or a 60-gallon plastic container. He's weighing the advantages and
disadvantages. The plastic wins. That decision behind him,
Schlachter moves on, directing a dozen friends in their various
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a year, Schlachter's back yard and basement near downtown
Troy turn into winemaking heaven. He and a group of wine-enthusiast
friends gather to help with the crush of the current year's grapes
and to bottle the fermented fruits of last year's labors. The
friends take home full bottles of wine for their troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter _ who with his wife, Barbara, is co-rector of Troy's
Trinity Episcopal Church _ has been doing this for nearly a quarter
century, first in the state of New York State and for the past
dozen years in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this because I love wine and I love social occasions,''
Schlachter said.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes immediately apparent early in the festivities, when
a couple arrives and stands for a moment empty-handed while others
are holding half-full glasses. ``Hello! You need some wine to
gladden the heart and strengthen the spirit,'' Schlachter says,
directing them to glasses and opened wine bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, the mood turns a bit more task-oriented, and
Schlachter starts giving orders, asking folks to retrieve buckets,
barrels and bags of sugar. Volunteers begin pouring containers of
fermenting grape ``must'' _ the juice, skins, stems and seeds of
crushed grapes _ into the top of a small wooden press. The
burgundy-colored liquid pours out the bottom into buckets and is
transferred to the 60-gallon plastic container for further
fermentation. The bucket brigade is halting at first, and there are
a few minor spills, but then the volunteers develop a choreographed
rhythm, and only a few drops find the garage floor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the helpers, Corie Schweser of Troy, looks at her
purple-stained hands still wet with wine and sneaks a finger into
her mouth. ``I've been doing this for six or seven years, and it's
a lot of fun,'' Schweser said. ``There's something about making
your own wine. And it makes for great conversation with the rest of
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, when she opens a bottle of wine that she played a part
in creating, the wine tastes just a little better, Schweser said,
noting how her cuticles were stained a bit darker than the rest of
her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter, overseeing others working the press, catches some of
the partially fermented juice in a glass, tastes it and nods his
head approvingly. Then he offers it around. The liquid _ a blend of
grape varietals Chancellor, Chelois and Leyon-Maillot _ tastes
sweet and tart at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Schlachter brings in most of his grapes and juice from New York
State, but has also made wine from Ohio grapes. Contest judges
think he's doing a pretty good job of it: Schlachter has won a slew
of awards for his wines, including a blue ribbon and a red
(second-place) ribbon for two wines he entered into the 1999 Ohio
State Fair, and a third-place finish in a national American Wine
Society wine judging last November.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the winemaker has decided against bottling last
year's cabernet sauvignon (''It needs more time in barrel to
soften'') and a Champagne-style sparkling wine (''I haven't been
able to get the yeast going . . . if we try to bottle it now, there
wouldn't be any bubbles'').
</P>
<P>
   But, he promises his volunteers, the sparkler should be ready by
New Year's Eve, in case anyone wants to ring in the new millennium
with a champagne toast.
</P>
<P>
   Several people smile and nod, as Schlachter turns his attention
to another vat of gently bubbling liquid.

 &HT;    What's wrong with a little celebrating?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hats off (perhaps I should say pants off) to
Matthew McConaughey for heeding most of coach Mack Brown's
suggestions to University of Texas football fans.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is fond of telling the Longhorn faithful to be loud, wear
orange and stay late.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the 29-year-old UT fan and movie star got two out of three
right early Monday morning when police busted him after finding him
dancing buck naked at home in Tarrytown, Texas, while playing the
bongos, according to a police affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   McConaughey was being loud. Police came to his house around 2:30
a.m. to check out a loud music complaint. He was staying late. I
suspect McConaughey, who hangs out on the sidelines at UT games,
was still celebrating UT's big Saturday win over previously
third-ranked Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   If he was nekkid, however, he couldn't have been wearing orange.
</P>
<P>
   But two out of three ain't bad. I think Brown should give
McConaughey a plaque. Better still, UT regents should light up the
tower orange in his honor _ especially when you consider the guy
had to spend the night in jail after being arrested for allegedly
resisting the officers when they stuffed him in the patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you can't play bongos naked in your own home, is
this really a free country? I spent two years in the Army so that
Americans would be free to play the bongos naked at home.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering why a man of McConaughey's stature
lets himself get in a position like this. I mean, why would a guy
dance nekkid in his house at 2:30 in the morning while another guy
is standing there clapping?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. It's Nebraska's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the victory, the crazier a serious football fan
becomes. If UT had beaten, say, Rice, McConaughey probably would
have had his pants on when the police arrived to take him to jail.
You just don't take your pants off for beating Rice. Heck, you
don't even play the bongos for Rice.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: If you beat Florida State, Tennessee or
Nebraska, it's acceptable to take off your pants. But a man of
dignity doesn't remove his pants after defeating SMU, Rutgers or
Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I have leg-wrestled anyone in the '90s was on the
floor at a party in Dallas after UT beat Oklahoma several years
ago. If UT had beaten Tulane, I wouldn't have gotten that drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another disturbing aspect of this case. Police said they
entered McConaughey's home after they saw a bong sitting on the
coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   What are the police doing going into somebody's house because
they see wacky tabacky equipment? If the cops barged into an Austin
home every time they saw the Zig-Zag man smiling at them, this town
would be like the final SWAT team raid scene from the movie ``The
Blues Brothers.'' It would be just ``hut hut hut hut hut'' all over
town.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, police came to McConaughey's Tarrytown house to
answer a complaint about loud music from a neighbor. If McConaughey
had the smarts to live in South Austin, instead of Tarrytown, this
might not have happened.
</P>
<P>
   In South Austin, the neighbors probably would have simply
hollered out the window for McConaughey to turn it down. Or they
would have brought their own bongos over and joined him.

 &HT;    Finding a home, and love
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When he was 8 years old, Tony's father dropped
him off at the doorstep of Montgomery County Children Services.
``You aren't wanted,'' he told his son.
</P>
<P>
   That was half a lifetime ago for Tony, who turned 16 Tuesday,
but he will never forget that day. ``I was mad,'' he recalled. And
hurt. And scared.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Tony has been in the custody of Children Services,
where he is among 60 children waiting to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   He recently appeared on Wednesday's Montel Williams Show about
young men and women who were abandoned by their parents. Another
Ohio youth, a 14-year-old from Trotwood, also appeared on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Caseworkers have prepared Tony for the possibility that the
publicity will spark interest in adoption.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in foster care, Tony has mixed feelings about
that. He is settled comfortably into a foster home, the
postcard-perfect 120-year-old Brookville farmhouse of Betty and Jim
Terrill. As a ninth-grader at Brookville High School, he loves
playing basketball for the Brookville Blue Devils _ an enthusiasm
that helps him to keep his grades up. He's active in the youth
group of the Brookville First Church of the Nazarene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony has fit right in,'' Mrs. Terrill said. ``But he's a good
kid. That's a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his peers, it's not a disadvantage not to come from a
traditional family. ``Nobody talks about their moms and dads,
anyway,'' he said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times it still hurts not to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   When Montel Williams interviewers asked, ``What's the hardest
day of your life?'' the answer was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birthday,'' he said. ``That's the day your mom had you, and
you're supposed to be with your mom, and not with somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony continued to visit his mother occasionally until two years
ago, when Children Services gained permanent custody. Two years
ago, Tony came to live with the Terrills.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Tony was very quiet, and didn't pay much attention to
the Terrills. ``He figured if he ignored us, maybe we'd just go
away,'' Mrs. Terrill said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. And Tony hung in there, improving his grades and
adjusting beautifully to his new life in Brookville.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising, given his history, that Tony came to the
family with protective armor, Mrs. Terrill said: ``I think he felt,
'If I just act like they're not there, I won't have to face moving
again. So let's just pretend there's nobody here but me.' That way,
he wouldn't have to face new rules, or fears about fitting in. It's
really scary for these kids, to be put in a new home all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Tony opened up. ``He's determined to do better with
his life; he doesn't want what he has left behind,'' Mrs. Terrill
said. ``He has shown people he has been able to come out of the
lifestyle he was brought up in and will contribute a lot to
society. He's very thoughtful of the feelings of others.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Terrills are concerned, Tony has a home with them
until he's an adult. The couple keeps in touch with some of the
many children they've fostered in the past 17 years. ``He'll be
welcome here just like our own children,'' Mrs. Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony is representative of many ``older'' children who enter the
system. After the age of 10 or so, it becomes increasingly
difficult to place children in adoptive homes, said Ann Stevens,
public information coordinator for Montgomery County Children
Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope for adoption no matter how old the child is,'' Stevens
said. ``They need a sense of belonging, a family to call their own.
Because once they're out of the foster care system, it becomes more
difficult to hold onto permanency for that child. Where do you go
for the holidays? Who do you call when you need help?''
</P>
<P>
   So Tony went to New York City last week, to talk about what it's
like to grow up without a family. It was his first trip to New York
_ ``It was big,'' was his pithy review _ and he seemed both pleased
and overwhelmed by the unaccustomed attention. During the Montel
Williams taping last week, Tony tried not to look at the four or
five cameras pointed his way.
</P>
<P>
   He was showered with gifts. Luggage. A new computer. A Chicago
Bulls jersey. Best of all, a one-day basketball camp with the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Brookville High School was abuzz with the news of his impending
stardom. How did that make him feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Special,'' he said. ``Usually, none of the upperclassmen
notice you. But older kids were coming up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   What resilience children have, you can't help thinking, when you
look at him, with his copper hair, freckles, shy manner and
disarming Huck Finn grin.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being 8 years old and being told by your father that
nobody wants you.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being 10, and ``too old'' to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it takes, then, to turn into a good kid. A normal
kid, who loves basketball and alternative music.
</P>
<P>
   What do kids need, I asked Tony, if they're put in the situation
you were in?
</P>
<P>
   ``Courage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. They'll need courage.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll need a home.

 &HT;    Getting to the bottom of the `cowboy mystique'
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The cowboy's life has been described in many
different, very different, ways. Movies probably more than any
other medium have shaped our images of how American cowboys looked,
acted, talked and worked. Generally, the movies, as well as most
popular fiction, drew ruggedly romantic pictures of cowboys and
cowboy life. Along the way, however, have been a few portraits that
were closer to the truth _ that cowboy life was hard, unrewarding
in the usual sense of the word, backbreaking hard work, sweatier
than romantic, and lonely. Very lonely.
</P>
<P>
   So, why have men over the years persisted in being cowboys?
</P>
<P>
   John R. Erickson, a real cowboy who attended Harvard and has
been known mainly as the creator of the ``Hank the Cowdog'' books
has written realistically about the cowboy's life and its allure.
One of his best on the subject is titled ``Panhandle Cowboy,''
first published in 1980 and now re-released in hardback by the
University of North Texas Press with a foreword by Larry McMurtry.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any interest in good writing and Texas history and
folklore, don't pass this one up.
</P>
<P>
   In his foreword, McMurtry compares the cowboy life, as described
by Erickson in his book ``Panhandle Cowboy,'' with the life of
desert Arabs. ``Their best qualities,'' McMurtry writes, ``are
forged in extreme conditions. Enrich or suburbanize a Bedouin or a
cowboy and taste, vigor and sense of art are soon lost. Keep them
out where the winds blow, the sands storm, and the animals resist
all reasonable effort and they remain superb workmen, alert,
humorous and subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson's book is regarded as a classic description of cowboy
life. His observations about the Crown Ranch in particular and the
cowboy lifestyle in general, are filled with humor as well as
pathos.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``Along about five o'clock in the afternoon, when we
were so sore and exhausted we wanted to drop in our tracks, we kept
ourselves going with nothing but pride and stubborness and will
power. We taunted each other. We teased. We invented and bellowed
lunatic songs at the top of our lungs. I offer the following as an
example of our doggerel. This verse, one of many which spring from
our fogged brains, celebrated the villain for whom we were working,
ranch owner and trail boss Lawrence. Ellzey:
</P>
<P>
   ``The trail boss's orders inspire us with fear.
</P>
<P>
   He don't pay no wages but he furnishes beer.
</P>
<P>
   Two six-packs a month and a kick in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Yippie-ti-yi-yo, what am I don' here?''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was raised in Perryton in far West Texas. After his
undergraduate work at the University of Texas in Austin he studied
at the Harvard Divinity School. Since returning to his native
state, he has made his living on horseback and writing. As
mentioned above, he is the author of the nationally popular Hank
the Cowdog series, books my teen age grandson has loved since he
was a mere tyke. He also has written a number of non-fiction books
about cowboy life and times and a book titled ``Cowboy Fiddler in
Bob Wills Band'' with Frankie McWhorter. He lives with his family
on his ranch in the Texas Panhandle.

 &HT;    Horses wearing strips win some, lose some
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A winner by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   That long-used racing term has taken on a new meaning, just in
time for the Nov. 6 Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park.
</P>
<P>
   The company that developed Breathe Right nasal strips for humans
has introduced similar strips to be worn by thoroughbred horses
when they train or race.
</P>
<P>
   After tests at Kansas State University, the manufacturer of the
strips claims they will reduce the amount of energy horses use in
breathing while racing or training.
</P>
<P>
   The Flair strips, placed across the horse's nose, will improve
the flow of air and cut back on bleeding in the lungs, a common
injury to horses, claims CNS Inc., the Minnesota manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   With nose strips, two horses racing as favorites won 10 days ago
at Remington Park in Oklahoma. But the novelty of the new equipment
got the attention of bettors at Keeneland last weekend when long
shots with the adhesive nose pieces won at odds of 33-1 and 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too early to tell if they are making any difference,''
said Dr. Al Smollin, veterinarian for trainer Ralph Ziadie at
Calder. Two horses from Ziadie's barn have raced wearing the
strips. Neither won. During the past 30 days, five Calder horses
have worn the strips in races. All five lost.
</P>
<P>
   The strips will be permitted in the Breeders' Cup, said Calder
steward Charles Camac. As horses are saddled, trainers must notify
track officials if their horses are equipped with Breathe-Right
strips.
</P>
<P>
   There are no indications in the track program or the Daily
Racing Form that horses are wearing the strips. To find out,
bettors must come to the walking ring before the race to see for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Thus is the hard-worker among handicappers better informed,
although it may not lead to a reward at the mutuel windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is always trying to find something new to make the
horses run faster,'' said Chuck Streva, Calder track oddsmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at Gulfstream, one trainer had a blanket over a
horse in the starting gate. For a while, everybody wanted
aerodynamic silks for the jockeys. There's always something going
on. And then you never hear from it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Breathe Right hires jockeys Pat Day and Corey Nakatani to wear
the strips. To introduce the innovation among horses, five-strip
packages were sent to 500 trainers, said Gus Fenton, the CNS Inc.
product development chief.
</P>
<P>
   The strips, 4 inches wide and 6 inches long, are designed to
last for one day and usually come off as the horses are washed.
</P>
<P>
   The strips are being allowed in Florida, Kentucky and Oklahoma.
It was announced that they would be permitted in New York races,
but that has been delayed. ``We need to find out more about their
effect,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the New York Racing
Association. California has withheld approval of the strips, too.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, strips are permitted during morning workouts.
Reports are scheduled to be made to the NYRA in December outlining
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they hold up in cold weather or hot weather or come off
in the rain or during the race?'' asked Meyocks. ``Will the horses
inhale more dirt deeper into their system? There is a lot we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to go crazy and think it's a panacea,''
Bernie Hettel of the Kentucky Racing Commission told the Lexington
Herald-Leader. ``I don't want people to think that it enhances a
horse's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this,'' said Smollin, the veterinarian. ``If a horse
wearing one of the nose strips wins a race early in the Breeders'
Cup, by the time the last races come around, every horse with a
saddle on will have a nose strip on too.''

 &HT;    Commercials on cutting edge of bad taste
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Never in the history of Madison Avenue has humor been
so over the top _ or under the bottom. Words and images that a few
years ago never would have seen the light of America's living rooms
are suddenly showing up in all manner of TV sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In a new ad for Amstel Light beer, three guys in lab coats stand
around a brewery, scratching their heads. One pipes up: ``We didn't
know light beer is supposed to suck.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ad extols the virtues of Brut deodorant: ``Brut has been
considered an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction. Side
effects could include being hit on by models, and increased sexual
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Georgia Department of Transportation has gotten in on
the bad act with an ad to promote car pooling. The commercial ends
with a car horn covering up a profanity in the last line: If the
driver weren't stuck in gridlock he ``wouldn't feel like ----.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies bankrolling these campaigns, and the agencies
producing them, say the ads are in tune with the times, and the
off-color humor makes ads memorable. After Clinton-Lewinsky, Jerry
Springer, shock radio, why shouldn't we have shock advertising?
</P>
<P>
   ``Things become more permissive,'' says Steve Davis, vice
president of marketing at Heineken USA, who signed off on Amstel's
campaign. ``I suppose we could have written the ad as, `We didn't
know light beer isn't supposed to taste very good.' But who would
have remembered that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is partially responsible for the new in-your-face
attitude. Cyber start-ups will do virtually anything to get
attention. That includes _ as one company's commercial did _
shooting a gerbil out of a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial for Beyond.com features a middle-aged guy who,
freed to work at home, walks around the house naked. He even grills
in the back yard _ naked.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot, for E-trade, features a hunky guy who is the kept
lover of an older, ghoulish woman. His face twisted in disgust, he
rubs her bunions. Then comes the pitch: ``E-trade. Be Your Own
Sugar Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Salzman, who follows trends for Young &AMP; Rubicam, says
it's no surprise that Internet companies are on the cutting edge of
bad taste. Since they're start-ups, they have no reputation to
tarnish, but they need to be heard in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very little to lose, except time,'' says Salzman.
</P>
<P>
   The raunch factor goes beyond dot-coms, however. There's the
phallic-themed Kia SUV ad, for instance, which talks of cars in
sexual terms _ a woman soothes the male driver of a competitor's
SUV as if he were impotent _ and ends with a ``size matters'' joke.
And there's the campaign urging car-pooling by the Georgia DOT.
</P>
<P>
   Dull directives had been ineffective in the past, so Atlanta
agency Turner Fernandez Turner came up with ``Johnny the lonely
commuter.'' He's stuck in traffic, fuming, while a hippie guitarist
sings his scatological song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the best way to get that message across was humor
like in the old-fashioned Warner Bros. cartoon, the character
Yosemite Sam,'' says Vicki Gavalas, director of communications for
the DOT. ``He gets angry and frustrated and wanting to say things
he can't say _ just like commuters do stuck in traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial has aired for three weeks. Gavalas says people
who like the commercial outnumber detractors almost two to one.
</P>
<P>
   If a child asks what that bleeped word is that almost rhymes
with ``grip,'' the DOT official suggests: ``Tell them `grit.'
That's what I told my children.''

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Pete Rose, late of the Cincinnati Reds,
is a hero for our confused, disparate times. (Rosenfeld, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MILNER-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ John R. Erickson, a real cowboy
who attended Harvard and has been known mainly as the creator of
the ``Hank the Cowdog'' books has written realistically about the
cowboy's life and its allure. One of his best on the subject is
titled ``Panhandle Cowboy,'' first published in 1980 and now
re-released in hardback by the University of North Texas Press with
a foreword by Larry McMurtry. If you have any interest in good
writing and Texas history and folklore, don't pass this one up.
(Milner, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ One of my most vivid
memories is of sitting under the stars in Big Bend National Park,
more than 20 years ago, miles away from light pollution, lying flat
on my back and staring goggle-eyed at a sky that one sees all too
rarely when living near a city. So last week's trek to the Stephen
F. Austin observatory was a welcome field trip to a jewel hidden in
these Piney Woods. (Borders, Daily Sentinel) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I killed a snake in the yard
the other day. Guess that explains why the dogs were dancing around
on their hind legs and holding up their petticoats. (Murray, Lufkin
Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ When he was 8 years old, Tony's
father dropped him off at the doorstep of Montgomery County
Children Services. ``You aren't wanted,'' he told his son. That was
half a lifetime ago for Tony, who turned 16 Tuesday, but he will
never forget that day. Ever since, Tony has been in the custody of
Children Services, where he is among 60 children waiting to be
adopted. He recently appeared on Wednesday's Montel Williams Show
about young men and women who were abandoned by their parents.
Caseworkers have prepared Tony for the possibility that the
publicity will spark interest in adoption. After eight years in
foster care, Tony has mixed feelings about that. (McCarty, Dayton
Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELS0-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Hats off (perhaps I should say
pants off) to Matthew McConaughey for heeding most of coach Mack
Brown's suggestions to University of Texas football fans. Brown is
fond of telling the Longhorn faithful to be loud, wear orange and
stay late. Well, the 29-year-old UT fan and movie star got two out
of three right early Monday morning when police busted him after
finding him dancing buck naked at home while playing the bongos,
according to a police affidavit. If you can't play bongos naked in
your own home, is this really a free country? (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If there are 500 ways
of saying that goodness and mercy and the joy of combat can coexist
in the same bosom, Tom Feltenstein has found them. And the
marketing guru has a message: ``Be kind. In your personal life and
your business life, kindness is the key.'' The one thing customers
are looking for are businesses that make them feel adored.

<P>
   GARY-COOPER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Gary Cooper was the most
gravely beautiful of all male stars, with a moral power that made
him the supreme object of contemplation for directors as varied as
Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, Cecil B. DeMille and Fred Zinnemann.
Cooper was the quiet American _ strong and resolute, capable of
doubt, incapable of cruelty. It was the gentleness that set him
apart from actors such as John Wayne and James Stewart, who could
be aggressively harsh. In contrast to them, Cooper was solitary and
shy, with a terrible anxiety at the heart of his personality. As
described by his daughter and virtually everybody who ever crossed
his path, Cooper was an enchanting man, sweet, mild and
unpretentious. But he was also lugging something around with him,
something heavy _ he aged very quickly, was periodically troubled
by ulcers and other manifestations of a nervous disposition, and
died young, at 60. What was was eating him? (Eyman, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GROSSADS _ Once taste was a word advertisers used to describe
their products, as in ``Tastes Great. Less Filling.'' But, these
days, taste _ or lack of it _ has taken on a broader meaning in the
TV ad biz. Words and images that a few years ago never would have
seen the light of America's living rooms are suddenly showing up in
sales pitches for all manner of products. (Scott, Atlanta

<P>
   WRESTLING-CHOCOLATE _ DAYTON, OHIO_ As rare sights go, this one
was as uncommon as seeing Halley's Comet pass overhead, Big Foot
standing out in the open or Montgomery County Recorder Joy Clark
sitting behind her desk. I saw Sexual Chocolate melt.Saw him shrink
from this mountainous masher right down into a ``yes ma'am'', ``no
ma'am'', ``please excuse me ma'am'' sweetheart. It happened in a
private dressing room just before a recent World Wrestling
Federation show in Dayton, Ohio. But to get the picture, you need
some history. Sexual Chocolate is the stage name of Mark Henry, the
380-pound former Olympic weightlifter turned WWF star. (Archdeacon,

stocking up on nuts and seeds during the fall. After all, we've got
holiday baking ahead. But think outside the shell for a moment.

   GARY-COOPER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Gary Cooper was the most
gravely beautiful of all male stars, with a moral power that made
him the supreme object of contemplation for directors as varied as
Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, Cecil B. DeMille and Fred Zinnemann.
Cooper was the quiet American _ strong and resolute, capable of
doubt, incapable of cruelty. It was the gentleness that set him
apart from actors such as John Wayne and James Stewart, who could
be aggressively harsh. In contrast to them, Cooper was solitary and
shy, with a terrible anxiety at the heart of his personality. As
described by his daughter and virtually everybody who ever crossed
his path, Cooper was an enchanting man, sweet, mild and
unpretentious. But he was also lugging something around with him,
something heavy _ he aged very quickly, was periodically troubled
by ulcers and other manifestations of a nervous disposition, and
died young, at 60. What was was eating him? (Eyman, Palm Beach

seen the light of America's living rooms are suddenly showing up in
sales pitches for all manner of products. (Scott, Atlanta

   BROOKVILLE, Ohio _ In the northwest corner of Montgomery County,
where corn and soybean fields seem to go on forever and driveways
are sometimes a half-mile long, the simple-seeming task of
collecting a little Halloween candy can be a major challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we'll do what we do every year _ we'll climb into
the car and take our daughters Kady, 9, and Kourtney, 12, to
Lewisburg so they can do their trick-or-treating,'' said Randy
Engle, of the nearly 20 mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   Engle's wife, Ieshsa, stocks up on candy every October, just in
case a few trick-or-treaters should happen to find their way to
their rural doorstep. ``But they never do, because we live in the
boondocks, so we end up eating the candy ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural areas around Dayton, it has become a Beggar's Night
tradition for kids from the country to travel to nearby towns to
get candy and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear stories all the time about parents who drive their
children (all around this area), so they can trick-or-treat,'' said
Debi Correll, location administrator for Land O' Lakes, a feed and
grain elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Correll didn't have to worry about Halloween candy when she was
growing up in North Dayton. ``We lived in a regular neighborhood,
so going trick-or-treating was just a matter of going
door-to-door,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In several small communities _ including Brookville and
Phillipsburg _ police and firefighters take to the streets to
dispense candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trick-or-treaters come into town from all over the area,''
former Phillipsburg Fire Chief Bob Woolf said. Woolf, 58, who grew
up on a nearby farm, said he didn't know what trick-or-treating was
until he got married and moved into town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never went out looking for candy on Halloween because I was
too darned busy working on the farm,'' he added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Trick-or-treating isn't a problem for members of the Daryl
Warner family. The Warners, who live on a 60-acre farm, don't
observe Halloween in the traditional manner. Their children,
Lindsay, 10, Landon, 8, and Derek, 6, don't mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of taking the kids trick-or-treating, we go to a
harvest festival party that's held at the home of one of the
members (of a local church),'' Kim Warner said. ``It includes a
hayride, games and a cookout. I took Lindsay trick-or-treating a
couple of times, but she didn't care for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Warner, who grew up just down the road from where she now
lives, remembers going trick-or-treating when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole bunch of us kids would pile in the car and our parents
would take us into Brookville to get candy,'' she recalled, adding:
``We always made it a point to go to the houses that gave out the
best stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Randy and Ieshsa Engle are looking forward to another
fun Beggar's Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dress up in costumes when we take the kids
trick-or-treating,'' he said. ``Last year I was Uncle Fester from
The Addams Family TV show, and she was a witch. We're still trying
to figure out what we're going to be this year.''

TV GUIDE JOINS EFFORTS TO LURE HISPANIC MARKET 

</HEADLINE>

and second i in Utilisima; a tilde is needed over n in Espanol.) 
 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Latino influence on U.S. business and culture gets
a significant boost this week with the introduction of a
Spanish-language insert in TV Guide. It follows by one week the
launch of a satellite TV system designed specifically for Spanish
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The insert, which began appearing Monday on newsstands in
specially marked TV Guides, includes Spanish-language interviews
and feature stories.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite system, DirecTV Para Todos, provides Hispanic
viewers access to more than 20 Spanish-language channels ranging
from the familiar (Univision, Telemundo, GEMS, Galavision) to the
exotic (TV Chile, Cine Latino, Canal Sur, Utilisima).
</P>
<P>
   That both developments deal with television should come as no
surprise, since the whiff of ``dinero'' follows large audiences,
and when it comes to television, Latinos love to watch.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Hispanics see an average of 15.3 hours of Spanish
programming and 10 hours of English programming a week, according
to a 1998 study by Market Segment Research and Consulting in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research says there are 8.67 million Hispanic TV
households in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Combine those statistics with a national Hispanic purchasing
power estimated at $375 billion annually, and it becomes clear why
there are campaigns for Latino eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos watch more television on average than the American
viewer, and they're brand-loyal,'' said Chiqui Cartagena, executive
editor of TV Guide en Espanol. ``These things factored in to the
executives of TV Guide saying, `Hey, this seems like a logical
thing to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 Hispanic TV markets in the United States are Los
Angeles, New York City, Miami, San Francisco-San Jose, Chicago,
Houston, San Antonio, Dallas-Fort Worth, Harlingen-McAllen area in
South Texas, and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide en Espanol is launching in 15 markets. DirecTV Para
Todos is available only in Miami, San Jose/San Francisco and
Houston. (DISH Network, a competing satellite service provider,
offers a less extensive Spanish-language lineup.)
</P>
<P>
   It is significant that both new services are bilingual, said
Cartagena, since three-quarters of the Spanish-speaking population
is bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between Spanish-dominant and
Spanish-preferred,'' said Cartagena, who was founding editor of
People en Espanol. ``My parents, who have been here 20 years, still
watch Spanish-language television because they feel more
comfortable. They're perfectly fluent in English. It's as if (an
English speaker) would move to Paris. (He'd) probably watch CNN in
English and not the local news.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who subscribe to DirecTV Para Todos get ``some of the
best'' Spanish-language networks from the United States, Latin
America and Spain, said Yolanda Macias, senior director of
programming for the service. Customers can choose between two
packages: a 38-channel lineup (14 in Spanish) for $19.99 a month,
and a 98-channel lineup (21 in Spanish) for $31.99. Both lineups
include seven Spanish music channels.
</P>
<P>
   The dish for the service is more oblong than the standard
18-inch-round dish used by DirecTV's 7.7 million customers. Its
shape enables it to pick up channels off more satellites than the
standard dish. Existing customers who want the Spanish service will
be able to upgrade their equipment, Macias said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which initially will be available through rack
sales only, may have a tougher go of it than the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Rodriguez, an associate professor of sociology at the
University of Houston, believes TV Guide en Espanol ``is going to
have to cultivate a market, because those who read English and
Spanish probably read English mainly. Those who read Spanish may be
hard to persuade to read something written primarily in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis O'Neill, vice president and publisher of Editor and
Publisher magazine, believes the magazine will be a regional trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pockets, the audience is great,'' said O'Neill, who
previously was president of TV Update, a service that provided TV
listings to newspapers. ``I don't see magazines or TV or major
communication outlets going automatically Hispanic in a major way.
TV Guide is just trying to be aggressive with their product.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's circulation has dropped dramatically during the
past decade. One source said subscriptions have dropped from a high
of about 20 million to 13 million now.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do a Spanish insert for a Spanish market is quite an
operational commitment on their part,'' O'Neill said, ``but the
returns are potentially enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   One early return: Cartagena said ad sales for the insert are
sold out for the fourth quarter of 1999.

ORCHID VARIETIES VARY IN THEIR NEEDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I have two orchids on my covered patio that were in
full bloom when I received them 18 months ago. I did all the things
the directions said to do but have had no blooms since.
</P>
<P>
   The two Norfolk pines at my front steps are growing beautifully
and are 4 feet tall. How can I keep them from freezing? Can they be
cut back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Orchids belong to a highly diverse family, and while they are
not difficult to grow, they do vary somewhat in their cultural
needs. Try to determine which genus and species yours are and you
can be more specific in giving them their requirements. You want to
try to give them an environment as similar to their native habitat
as possible. Perhaps yours do not receive quite enough light.
</P>
<P>
   Most orchids live in the tropics, where many are epiphytes that
use roots to hold onto trees and get nourishment from organic
matter collected along the branches. Each orchid lives at the
height where it gets the light it prefers. All orchids enjoy the
air circulation found in such lofty dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Terrestrial orchids, on the other hand, find nutrients in
organic matter on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   We can grow epiphytic orchids outdoors (except in cold weather),
on windowsills and in greenhouses. Orchids have fewer roots than
other plants, yet these are highly sensitive and do not like to be
restricted. Therefore, rather than than use soil, growers choose
porous mediums such as bark chips, tree fern fiber and stones.
</P>
<P>
   Watering, of course, is also important. Orchids like wet-dry
cycles _ going from being wet to almost dry. A waterlogged medium
will suffocate the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Watering is determined by the pot type, the medium and the
number of sunny days. Orchid type also is a factor. Orchids with
velamen, a layer of cells covering the roots that helps prevent
moisture loss, require a long, heavy drink.
</P>
<P>
   Cattleyas, the popular ``corsage'' orchids, do not need as much
water as phalaenopsis, the popular moth orchids, because they store
water in thick stems, or pseudobulbs. Therefore, a clay pot would
be more suitable for a cattleya, while a moisture-retentive plastic
container might work for a phalaenopsis. Vandas like their
velamen-coated roots to hang freely and are often grown in charcoal
_ or even in empty wooden baskets, therefore requiring watering
almost every day the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   There is some variation in light needs among the genera, but too
much light will sunburn any plant. Too little light results in dark
green but weak foliage and no flowers. Orchids can tolerate sun
before 10 a.m. and after 4 p.m., but between those hours the plants
should be in filtered light.
</P>
<P>
   Vandas are at the high end of the light scale and, except during
winter, like to be outside, where they receive good light.
Cattleyas and dendrobriums should also be grown in good light. They
like more light than phalaenopsis, loved for their long-lasting,
mothlike blooms, and paphiopedilums, the lady's slippers, which are
suitable for windowsills since these are on the low end of the
light-requirement scale.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a temperature-bloom relationship among some,
orchids basically are comfortable when we are. Try to avoid
temperatures much below 60 or higher than 90 degrees. Heat
tolerance rises with air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Some gardeners apply diluted amounts of fertilizer with almost
every watering. A weak application weekly is an easy schedule to
follow. Dilute a 20-20-20 fertilizer by one-half or one-third of
the manufacturer's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming your Norfolks are in containers, the best thing to
ensure winter survival is to move them to a protected area during a
hard freeze. If you can't do this, generously wrap the pots and
plants and hope for the best. Water the plants well before the
temperatures drop.
</P>
<P>
   You could prune your trees back, but you would ruin the natural
shape. When Norfolks become too tall for their locations, some
gardeners opt to take a foot or 1 1/2 feet off the top and root
this cutting to produce a new plant. While this still results in a
rather misshapen plant, it may not look quite as bad as removing
more than the top. The top cutting should include two tiers of
lateral branches. Remove the bottom branches before planting the
cutting.2\A)4}x &Cx1f;  |

COOL CHICAGO CHEF JAMS AT THE AMERICAN RESTAURANT'S 25TH
ANNIVERSARY DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   .MDNM/(something, but chefs do it and it's so fleeting and it's
gone.'')
</P>
<P>
   The next quick fix
</P>
<P>
   As Americans learn more about food but cook less, Trotter
predicts chefs will become the next quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February Trotter will open Trotter to Go, a mile from his
restaurant. The take-out concept will feature spit-roasted organic
birds, loins of meat, 35 types of grain, noodle and marinated
vegetable salads, a 100-bottle esoteric wine section, breads and
pastries plus a ``juice bar element.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have time to cook and maybe you've never really
learned to cook and here's a Wolfgang Puck frozen pizza, I've heard
of this guy and I've read a few articles about him in Bon Appetit,
this is probably going to be pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buy prepared foods a la Emeril Lagasse and you can expect
southern New Orleans flare. A la Alice Waters and it's going to be
organic and Provencal, clean and vegetable driven.
</P>
<P>
   ``These chefs have kind of carved out these niches, and their
reputation immediately signifies something. If you're not going to
have time to cook at home, wouldn't it be great to have these
products?''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter's first foray into the home kitchen was successful. His
Gourmet Cooking for Dummies (1997, IDG Books Worldwide) sold more
than 100,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``I'm not necessarily interested in the home cook,'' he
says. ``My job is to put together the most flavorful food I can.
I'm not trying to appeal to elite diners either. I'm just trying to
stay true to a point of view and produce food that I personally
would like to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if doing a certain dish at the restaurant involves rare,
esoteric ingredients that would preclude the home cook from doing
that dish, then I'm interested in taking that idea _ that
combination of flavors _ and doing it in a greatly simplified way.
But I'm not out there trying to rope in the mainstream. I can't
think in those terms.''

   Slow-roasted salmon with red miso-lemongrass broth Makes 4
servings
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 large turnip, peeled and cut into batons
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1 cup 1-inch-thick leek slices (white part only)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tamari soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red miso
</P>
<P>
   4 (4-ounce) pieces salmon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cups watercress, thick stems removed
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the broth: Place the chicken stock, 2 tablespoons of
butter and turnip in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook
3 to 4 minutes or until the turnip is about half cooked. Remove the
turnips from the liquid and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Add the lemongrass to the liquid, simmer 7 minutes, strain and
discard the lemongrass. Add the leek to the liquid and cook 7
minutes or until the leeks are soft. Add the rice wine vinegar,
tamari and red miso and cook 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the salmon: Season the salmon with salt and pepper
and rub with the olive oil. Place the turnip batons on a sheet pan
and place the salmon on top. Roast in the oven at 250 degrees 15 to
20 minutes or until the salmon is cooked medium.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the watercress: Wilt the watercress in a hot saute
pan with 2 tablespoons butter 2 minutes and season to taste with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Reheat the broth, if necessary. Place some of the wilted
watercress and turnip batons in the center of each shallow bowl and
top with a piece of the salmon. Ladle some of the warm broth in the
bowls and over the salmon. Top with freshly ground pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Wine note: An Austrian Riesling is a great match for the red
miso-lemongrass broth. The full-bodied, dry and intensely aromatic
style by producers like Prager and Knoll is a wonderful complement
to the haunting flavors in this dish. For the perfect pairing, try
a Prager ``Steinriegl'' Federspiel Riesling.

   The American Name Game.
</P>
<P>
   Big names. Big food. Big wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the recent 25th anniversary gala dinner at the American
Restaurant, co-executive chefs Debbie Gold and Michael Smith
invited two chefs: one to represent the American ingenuity of
American chefs, the other to pay homage to European culinary
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The food of Charlie Trotter of Chicago's world-renowned Charlie
Trotter's and Guenter Seeger of Seeger's in Atlanta was paired with
wines from Cakebread Cellars, a family-owned winery in Napa Valley.
The gala benefit raised money to benefit the Children's Center
Campus.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first time big names had a hand in shaping
cuisine at the American Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   - James Beard, the late-great culinarian and proponent of
American cuisine, was an early consultant to the restaurant, as was
New York restaurateur Joe Baum whose restaurant concepts included
the fabled Rainbow Room and Windows on the World.
</P>
<P>
   - Architect and interior designer Warren Platner designed the
space that offers breathtaking views of the Kansas City skyline.
Platner also designed Windows on the World in New York's World
Trade Center and Water Tower Place in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The American's first chef was Bradley Ogden, now at the Lark
Creek Inn in Larkspur, Calif. Ogden has been recognized as the chef
who first made the idea of American cuisine respectable.
</P>
<P>
   And what goes around comes around.
</P>
<P>
   - Current co-executive chefs Michael Smith and Debbie Gold met
while working at Charlie Trotter's. Earlier this year the chef duo
was named Best Chefs of the Midwest by the James Beard Foundation.

NEW BREED OF HORROR THRILLERS CARVING OUT BETTER STORYLINES,
GRAPHICS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TRICIA SERJU-HARRIS  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A new breed of vampires, assorted demons and even a
few zombie cows are carving a new image for the horror genre in
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a nightmarish afterthought in the multibillion-dollar
computer gaming industry, horror-themed games are capable of
creating the terrifying scenes once only found on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   A few highly anticipated titles this year include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nocturne ($49.99, Gathering of Developers and Terminal
Reality), which will hit stores by Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gabriel Knight III: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned
($49.95, Sierra Studios), arrives this fall.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vampire: The Masquerade _ Redemption (price not available,
Activision and Nihilistic Software) is expected this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Recent releases, such as System Shock 2 by Looking Glass
Studios, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver by Eidos Interactive, or the
darkly humored role-playing game Dungeon Keeper 2 by Bullfrog
Productions Ltd. also have pumped up the genre.
</P>
<P>
   The stale storylines, sluggish technology and lame characters
that held back horror games in the '80s and early '90s are gone. In
the best of these games, players can expect original characters,
breathtaking settings, and the advanced software that allows
boogeymen to jump out of your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHADOWS AND GHOULS
</P>
<P>
   This year, the game that shows how far technology and visuals
have come is Terminal Reality's Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline isn't complicated. Players are thrown into a world
where things that go bump in the night are horrifyingly real.
Werewolves, vampires, gargoyles and zombies threaten mankind. It's
up to the ``Stranger'' to keep chaos from reigning.
</P>
<P>
   But what has made Nocturne one of this year's most talked about
computer games is the technology that makes it seem like a horror
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturne's lights, shadows, and fog come close to mimicing real
life. The locations are lush, and nearly photo realistic. The
animation is fluid and natural. Characters, cloth and objects all
behave based on real physical rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these elements hasten the player's willing suspension of
disbelief,'' said Drew Haworth, an artist on the Nocturne
development team. ``So, when you introduce unnatural monsters into
such a realistic environment, you can't help but consider them
real, and therefore very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   All those effects were possible because of the game engine,
which took Terminal Reality President Mark Randel three years to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nocturne is made up of many different smaller engines, each
with a specific function,'' said Randel, who is lead programmer on
Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   Players are sent out by a government agency called the
Spookhouse to explore one of four global missions: cemeteries in
France; a ruined castle in Germany; the sinister evil of a small,
Texas town; or the creepy back alleys of Chicago. Each mission is
presented as a self-contained cinematic episode with its own story.
</P>
<P>
   Though the full version of the game is just now making its way
to retailers, two demo versions of the game were available through
magazines or from a free download online.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturne is a scary game, no bones about it. This is the one
game where you'll run from zombie cows in Redeye, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The second demo, set in Al Capone's Chicago, pushes fear to a
higher level. The game's engine makes you hear footsteps before you
see anything. You jump at shadows. And all around you are
Frankenmobsters _ Capone's goons brought back to life a la
Frankenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroic pulp is a curiously unexplored genre that Terminal
Reality recognized as perfect for gaming,'' Randel said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dark set designs that make Nocturne a future genre
classic came from films such as ``Batman'' and ``The Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually got the Crescent Theater design (in the Chicago
act) from an actual movie theater I used to work at during high
school. It had been around since the 1920s and had tons of hiding
places,'' said Den Johnson, senior digital artist at Terminal
Reality. ``It's a very scary place in real life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While most games out there will run on low-end machines, this
game demands screamingly powerful hardware.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to fully enjoy the game, a powerful graphics card
such as ATI Technologies' Rage Fury (at $299) is required. The
32-megabyte graphics card can handle the power and detail of games
like Nocturne.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BLOOD IS THE LIFE
</P>
<P>
   The creators of Gabriel Knight III used a different approach to
grab players by the throat.Writer Jane Jensen relied on a
heart-pounding storyline here.
</P>
<P>
   This third episode, ``Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the
Damned,'' takes place in a small village and valley in rural
Europe. A child is kidnapped and it's up to the hero, Gabriel, to
solve the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``GK is a series that takes story very seriously,'' Jensen said.
``It is closer to (the television series) `X-Files' than to (id
Software's) Doom. And like `X-Files,' the players got very attached
to the main characters, Gabriel and Grace. There's a lot of
bantering and smart aleck dialogue in GK that tempers the scary
storylines. It's a combination that people seem to like.''
</P>
<P>
   The series has undergone drastic changes, from its early
beginnings as a straightforward computer adventure to a confused
period when most games turned to full-motion video for a while. Its
current incarnation uses highly rendered 3-D art.
</P>
<P>
   ``When given a chance to do my own series, I wanted to use a
mystery format because in mystery the detective interrogates
people, examines evidence, visits crime scenes, does many things
that translate very well into interactive puzzles,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Sins of the Father'' or ``The Beast Within,'' this
Gabriel Knight adventure lets the player control the view _ you
move it around to check out things _ as in LucasArts' Grim
Fandango. Just click on an object to have your character respond to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, a lot is lost in this departure from the popular series.
The hunt for clues gets caught up in the camera angles the player
has to make.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the animation used here doesn't seem to match Jensen's
dark storyline. It's too easy to be reminded you're playing a game
when you look at the hero's cartoon-like features.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tension of uncovering the game's scheme will keep you
hunting for clues.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DUNGEON MASTERS
</P>
<P>
   If all this strikes you as just too dark, there are games that
have taken a lighter approach.
</P>
<P>
   In Dungeon Keeper 2, humor plays a key role _ the darkest
element here is that the player gets to be the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are loads of games where players get to play the
goody-two-shoes heroes out to slay the bad, old monsters,'' said
Nick Goldsworthy, a producer at United Kingdom-based Bullfrog.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dungeon Keeper 2, you're in control of those monsters.
``In fact you control their entire realm _ a nasty, dark dungeon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics, sound and music really bring this to life. Your
evil minions grumble aloud or cackle aloud, sounding suspiciously
like they're up to no good. You'll need to keep your eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   The original Dungeon Keeper looked more like cartoon animation.
But the 3-D used in its sequel puts it on par with today's games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visually the games are stunningly different,'' Goldsworthy
said. ``DK2 is a fully 3-D game, though you don't need a 3-D
(graphics) card to play. The original DK looked much more cartoony.
DK2 is as real as a virtual-dungeon can get.''
</P>

COOL CHICAGO CHEF JAMS AT THE AMERICAN RESTAURANT'S 25TH
ANNIVERSARY DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   .MDNM/KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It's after 3 p.m. and the fleshy,
orange-pink sides of salmon are filleted and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Word is Charlie Trotter has landed in Kansas City, but instead
of making a beeline from the airport to the American Restaurant to
prep for dinner, he stops _ with his chef-entourage in tow _ to
linger over a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   An intensely focused personality who demands perfection on the
plate, Trotter likes to put pressure on himself and his kitchen
staff. When jetting into a city for a gala appearance, he'll often
make reservations for a leisurely, 31/2-hour lunch, then watch his
cooks break out in a cold sweat, furtively glancing at their
watches.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the vaunted Chicago chef has either the confidence
_ or the audacity _ to arrive at 3:30 p.m. The seven-course,
$250-a-plate benefit dinner to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the American Restaurant is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter and company immediately head for the kitchen, where he
ties on a crisp, starched white apron bearing his restaurant's
signature turquoise ``T'' monogram and launches into a
Trotter-style jam session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way we approach food is a lot the way Miles Davis
approached music, as epitomized by the comment `I'll play it first
and tell you what it is later.' We're still figuring out the
presentation on our dishes right now,'' Trotter says during an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, sideman//sous chef David LeFevre appears carrying
a plate of salmon. Trotter eyes the size of the filet and checks
the overall presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Bright orange and so succulent it melts in the mouth, the fish
has been slow-roasted over a mirepoix of finely diced aromatic
vegetables in a 250-degree oven for 20 minutes. It is riffed by a
ginger-soy sauce with fresh water chestnuts, bits of preserved
pineapple, earthly elegant chantarelle mushrooms and grace notes of
hajiki seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Like saxophonist Charlie Parker, for whom the chef is named,
Trotter improvises. Working with only the most pristine raw
ingredients, he creates daring flavor combinations and presents
them in bold, almost minimalist designs. Those in the culinary-know
rave that he is creating nothing less than an original American art
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have a repertoire where we'll say, `OK, let's
do this signature dish.' It's very much in-the-moment food. It's a
little bit like working without a net,'' Trotter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to get out there and sort of say, `Well, let's
try this or let's try that.' Here we're going to do this for 160
people tonight and they have no idea that we've never really done
anything quite like this before. There's a margin for error which
can be exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   On becoming a chef
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Trotter is widely considered one of the, if not the most
influential American chef in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Wine Spectator named his restaurant ``the best in the
world'' for both food and wine. The Mobil Travel Guide gave the
restaurant its highest rating of five-star. The James Beard
Foundation named Trotter Outstanding Chef of the Year for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a month to get a weekday reservation at Charlie
Trotter's and 10 to 12 weeks to get one on the weekend. The
restaurant offers three degustation or tasting menus for $100 per
person. A $90 vegetable is also available.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accolades, ``we still get people in who open their
menu and then tell their waiter, `We're from New York,' '' says
Trotter, a native Chicagoan. ``Nothing gives me more satisfaction
than bringing these pathetically jaded New Yorkers to their knees
and proving to them it doesn't matter where you are from.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, food was ``never an issue'' in his home
while growing up, although his mother may have been ahead of her
time by serving fish two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Trotter worked as a busboy at a steak and burger
restaurant. ``I just liked the energy of here comes the guests and
here's all these things you had to do to make it happen,'' he
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter discovered his love of food almost by accident during
college, when he and a roommate found themselves in a friendly
competition to see who could make the more extravagant four-course
meal.
</P>
<P>
   A political science major, Trotter took a year off between his
junior and senior year to work as a waiter and bartender, but
still, ``there was no grand scheme. I thought I'd do it for five
years, and if nothing else, I'd learn enough about cooking to feed
my family and friends for the rest of my life. I figured because
food is such an important part of life, it behooved me to learn all
I can about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter graduated from college with a political science degree.
At 23, he took a job working under his mentor and longtime friend,
chef Norman Van Aken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a stereotypic idea of what a chef was,'' Trotter says.
``I thought a chef was some 55-year-old French guy. You know,
heavyset, ruddy cheeks with a mustache. Bellowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norman was young. I think he was 30 at the time. I thought,
`Wow! This guy's a chef?' This was the first time I'd ever seen
anything opposite of what I thought. It was very interesting that
this American guy was carving out a place.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen art
</P>
<P>
   In the white-coated bustle of the kitchen, Ouida and Robert
Merrifield look out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing street clothes, Robert bends his head in concentration.
His hands, though not unskilled, are a bit slower and clumsier than
the line cooks. He slices black olives for a red wine//black olive
sauce. Ouida stands next to him, intently stripping thyme leaves
from their stalks.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrifields own the Polo Grill, a fine dining restaurant in
Tulsa, Okla. Although they have never met Charlie Trotter or eaten
in his restaurant, they eagerly volunteered for kitchen duty in
hopes of rubbing elbows with the celebrity chef.
</P>
<P>
   As Trotter's assistant Sari Zernich supervises their efforts,
Robert confides, ``We're just trying to do what Sari tells us and
try not to get yelled at!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want me to yell at you?'' Trotter asks.
</P>
<P>
   Startled, Robert breaks into a smile as he discovers Trotter has
sneaked up on Robert's left side and is looking over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now why would I yell at you? My evil twin is the one who
yells. He stays back at the restaurant,'' Trotter says
mischievously. ``Sari, these people want you to yell at them so
they feel useful.''
</P>
<P>
   A pop celebrity with a devoted following, Trotter also has been
accused of creating food that is suitable for framing. His artistic
eye is most evident in his series of opulent Charlie Trotter
cookbooks, which are strewn with esoteric ingredients and plate
presentations that are sculptural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm a little envious of creative folks _ artists and
craftsfolks who work in mediums that are more permanent,'' Trotter
admits. ``For example, musicians can put it down on a disc or a
tape. Other people can do it with woodwork or on a canvas or with a
piece of rock they can sculpt something, but chefs do it and it's
so fleeting and it's gone.'' MORE

SENDING MASS E-MAILS NOT AGAINST LAW IF YOU ONLY SEND TO THOSE WHO
WANT IT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I am an 82-year-old novice at e-mail and I need
some help. About 18 months ago I established a Web site where I
sell queen bees and beekeeping books. Now, I want to send e-mail
advertising to my customer list, but I do not know the rules,
regulations and laws governing such use of e-mail. When I called my
provider, a technician told me that sending unsolicited advertising
by e-mail is illegal. However, I get a monthly letter from Lycos.
How do they get away with sending thousands of copies of their
advertising? Can you help me? Will you help me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The person at your Internet service provider told you wrong.
Sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, or spam, is not illegal.
There's no legislation against it. However, it probably is against
your provider's rules. So, if you do it, you can be kicked off that
particular service.
</P>
<P>
   But, the key word here is ``unsolicited.'' If you have customers
who want to get an e-mail from you about your business, that's not
spam. The key is to get their permission.
</P>
<P>
   At Lycos, when you signed up for access to certain areas of that
Web site, there probably was a check box that indicated you were
willing to receive the Lycos newsletter. You can do the same. When
someone buys from you online, set up some way to ask whether they
would like to receive information from you about your business.
Those who say ``yes'' can get the e-mail; those that say ``no''
won't.
</P>
<P>
   It's important that you let people know that you are going to
send them mail if they indicate they want it. In the mail you send
them, always indicate that you're willing to remove them should
they request it _ and then honor that request.
</P>
<P>
   You also should work with your provider so he or she knows what
you're doing. If you're sending out several thousand e-mails _
which, given the nature of your business, is probably not the case
_ you should make sure your provider can handle it. Make contact
with the provider and explain exactly what you're doing and ask for
help. That way, there are no surprises. Internet providers hate
surprises of this kind.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, regarding the legality of unsolicited commercial
e-mail ... You may see at the bottom of some spam a notice saying
the e-mail complies with a federal legislation. This is bogus, an
attempt to make the recipient think there's nothing to be done
about receiving the spam. There was a proposed bill in the Senate
that would have regulated spam, but it went nowhere. Don't be
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, remember never to respond to the instructions for
removing yourself from a spam list that appears at the bottom of
many spammers' e-mails. This is, in almost all cases, a way for the
spammer to verify that an e-mail address is good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Thanks to the stories on MP3 music files that have appeared
in the Chronicle over the past few months, I've really gotten into
them. They sound great! But I have been trying to download some of
my favorite tunes from pirate sites without much luck. Some say to
upload something _ when I do, I still don't have access.
</P>
<P>
   A: Remember that when you grab a song from a site that illegally
posts music _ usually taken off a compact disc _ you're violating
copyright laws. By downloading these songs, you're denying the
artists who made them royalties.
</P>
<P>
   You have a right to convert songs on a CD to MP3 files _ done
using a type of software program known as a ``ripper'' _ for your
own personal use, so long as you also own a copy of the CD.
However, once you give away that file, you've violated the artist's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   On sites such as MP3.com, which are full of songs for the
taking, most of the artists essentially have given up some of their
rights, hoping to get greater exposure for their music.

WRITABLE CD-ROM DRIVES PUT TO TEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating aspects of the computer revolution
is how individual devices once considered overpriced and esoteric
become mainstream, gotta-have-it features. We've seen this with
modems, scanners, color printers and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the latest hot peripheral is the writable and rewritable
CD-ROM drive. Besides the fact that prices have dropped through the
floor, several trends are driving this demand.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that once people purchase a scanner or a digital
camera, they want some kind of removable storage on which to place
these images. CD-ROM disks are nearly permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Another is music _ people have long wanted a way to make copies
of music CDs just as they can with cassette tapes, and writable
drives now make that affordable. Add to that the MP3 craze: Folks
want to transfer tunes downloaded from the Net onto CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the good, old-fashioned need for a decent
backup system. CD-ROM disks can hold up to 650 megabytes, and while
a single one won't hold all of what's on today's multi-gigabyte
hard drives, they still have greater capacity than many other types
of removable drives.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these drives can work with disks that let you write to
them once as well as disks that allow rewriting and erasing. They
can also read standard CD-ROM disks.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three writable CD-ROM drives you can add to
your system. All use the Enhanced IDE interface and are designed to
be installed internally.
</P>
<P>
   All the drives reviewed here include Adaptec's DirectCD
software, which lets you use the drive just as you would any other
drive on your system. You can drag and drop files onto its icon in
My Computer, create folders, even install software onto it.
</P>
<P>
   The drives also come with a ``light'' version of Adaptec's Easy
CD Creator, which lets you make audio disks and better manage the
process of storing files on a data disk. (While this software is
nice, if you get serious about using a writable/rewritable drive,
I'd strongly recommend getting the latest version, Easy CD Creator
Deluxe 4. It has a friendlier design and nifty new features,
including the ability to get song information off an Internet
database.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ZipCD, $210, Iomega Corp.: The maker of the popular 100- and
250-megabyte Zip disk drives has duly noted the writable CD-ROM
revolution. While Zip drives remain more popular than writable
CD-ROM drives, Iomega is covering its bases with this model.
</P>
<P>
   The ZipCD can record on a write-once CD at four times the speed
of the original CD-ROM drive. It also can rewrite and erase on
rewritable disks at that speed. And it can read standard CDs at 24
times the speed of the first CD-ROM drive. You'll see these
specifications usually expressed in this type of notation: 4x4x24.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Adaptec software, it includes a copy of Adobe's
Photoshop LE, Avery Media's label-making software and Iomega's
QuikSync backup software.
</P>
<P>
   The ZipCD comes with a minimum amount of printed documentation.
Most of the information is in the form of a multimedia presentation
on how the drive works and how to install it. The information is
very basic, though more details are available as Web page files
saved to your hard drive. I thought some of the information was
over the heads of most novices, particularly a crucial page that
tells you how to configure your new drive as either a master or
slave so it co-exists peacefully with other drives in your system.
</P>
<P>
   The drive performed well, though it significantly extended the
boot time on my PC. The BIOS seemed to be trying to figure out what
the drive was. Once the system was running, though, the drive
worked flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD-Writer Plus 8210i, $249, Hewlett-Packard: Of the three I
tried, this one was my favorite. It was very easy to install, ran
flawlessly and was very friendly to my system.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ZipCD, this also has a multimedia presentation on CD
that shows you how to install the drive. However, rather than have
you figure out on your own whether to set the drive up as a slave
or master, it examines your PC's configuration and makes
recommendations as to how best to install it. You can then print
this out as a kind of customized instruction sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The 8210i also is a 4x4x24 drive, and its performance was almost
identical to that of the ZipCD. However, it didn't slow down my
PC's bootup routine.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with both the Adaptec programs, as well as CD
label-making software from Neat-O; Broderbund's Multimedia
Organizer; HP Simple Trax, a backup program; and HP Disaster
Recovery, which lets you create a CD to be used in case of a system
failure.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD-ReWriter CRW4432A, $215, Acer Peripherals: This drive is a
great buy. Not only is it faster in reading traditional CD-ROMs
than the other two drives, but it also has more internal memory
that can keep recording glitch-free.
</P>
<P>
   Acer's drive is a 4x4x32 drive, with a maximum read speed of
32X. That's as fast as a lot of standard CD-ROM drives sold in PCs
today.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes with eight megabytes of internal buffer, which can
help prevent what are known as buffer overruns. This is when the
data being written to the disk fills up the buffer, usually
resulting in corrupted files. Although having more memory won't
guarantee this won't happen _ particularly on older, slower
computers _ it can help.
</P>
<P>
   However, this drive comes with terrible documentation in a
poorly written manual that is a bad translation from an Asian
language into English. I'd only recommend this drive for more
experienced users who don't need much handholding.
</P>
<P>
   The drive also comes with a minimal amount of software _ it's
got the Adaptec titles, and that's it. However, it was the only
drive of the three to come with Windows 3.1 drivers.
</P>

SMALL BOX, BIG SERVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON GARFINKEL   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NetWinder OfficeServer, by the Canadian firm Rebel.com,
brings a breath of fresh air to the stuffy world of network servers
and firewalls. Weighing just two pounds and taking up less space
than a three-ring binder, it combines innovative hardware with
great software in a package that won't intimidate the typical
small-office computer manager.
</P>
<P>
   NetWinder is designed to be a one-stop shop for office
networking. It comes with an e-mail server, a file server, and a
print server, all managed through an easy-to-use Web-based
interface. This combination makes the OfficeServer ideal for small
offices that have a few computers but haven't yet put together an
office LAN. All you need to buy is a NetWinder OfficeServer for
$895, a $25 network interface card for each PC, some cables, and a
$100 multiport network hub. The OfficeServer can easily handle up
to 100 work stations.
</P>
<P>
   The OfficeServer also can connect you to the Internet. For the
typical small office, you can connect the serial port on the back
of the computer to a modem, then use the OfficeServer to dial up an
Internet Service Provider. OfficeServer software lets everyone in
your office share the single dial-up connection. The computer also
includes a built-in firewall, so files and e-mail will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to upgrade to a faster Internet connection,
the NetWinder is ready, too. The computer's box has two Ethernet
interfaces on its backside. The first is for your company's
internal network. The second is for a high-speed DSL or cable modem
connection.
</P>
<P>
   When I first took the NetWinder out of its box, I did a double
take: I knew it would be small, but its truly diminutive size still
caught me off guard. The box measures just 9-by-6-by-2-inches,
which is still enough room for a hard drive (4.6GB with the $895
OfficeServer package; 10GB with the $1,995 version), a speaker, the
two Ethernet connectors, the serial port, the printer port, and
standard sockets for a PC-style keyboard, video, and mouse. Most
buyers, I think, won't even connect a keyboard, mouse, or screen.
Instead, they will just drop the OfficeServer onto a network and
configure it through a Web browser connected to a nearby desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Using OfficeServer's Web-based system administration program,
you can configure the network adapters and the firewall, add user
accounts, set up the e-mail system, and even configure the printer.
The computer comes with software to support Windows, Macintosh, or
Unix-style file sharing. It has discussion forums, Internet-chat,
and even a built-in Web server. This is all standard stuff for most
Unix gurus. What's amazing about the OfficeServer is that it comes
preconfigured with all these features.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes the NetWinder possible is its
StrongARM RISC microprocessor, an extremely fast chip that
nevertheless draws very little power. The StrongARM lets Rebel.com
build a tiny package that doesn't need to dissipate vast quantities
of heat, as do most desktop PCs and laptops built around Intel's
Pentium, AMD's K6, or Motorola G3 and G4 microprocessors. The low
heat and power requirements also make this computer ideal for
Internet Service Providers who want to stick a few hundred of them
into a single 19-inch rack and lease them out to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing that makes the NetWinder work is the Linux
operating system. Linux lets Rebel.com ship a boatload of server
software to its customers free. It is simply impossible to put
together a low-cost network server using Windows because of the
astronomical cost of licensing Windows NT Server and the requisite
software that Windows needs to get working.
</P>
<P>
   I have two big fears with network appliances such as the
NetWinder: backup and security. On backup, Rebel.com has done a
pretty good job. By design, You can back up the OfficeServer from a
typical Windows desktop computer. You can back up just the
computer's configuration, just the user files, or the whole
computer system. If the system crashes, just get another machine
and restore your backup: There are no user-serviceable parts
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But theft is a bigger issue for this small system. It is fairly
easy topick up the NetWinder, rip off all the cables, and carry it
away under your coat. Since an attack like that could shut down
many organizations, it behooves people using the NetWinder to make
sure the computer is kept under lock and key. Unfortunately,
Rebel.com made this harder than it should be. Many computers these
days come with a little slot to attach an anti-theft lock; the
NetWinder doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   I was prepared to dislike the NetWinder. I thought a computer
running Red Hat Linux would be too difficult for most small offices
to handle. But OfficeServer's Web-based management shields all but
the most inquisitive of administrators from the Unix operating
system that governs this machine's brain. I also thought a computer
without a floppy disk would be an invitation to disaster, but it's
clear to me now that most people who use this machine couldn't
rescue their computer with floppy disks if their lives depended on
it _ it's easier for them just to get another computer and restore
their backups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only thing I really don't like about the NetWinder
is its fan. Although small, the fan makes more noise than
practically every other computer in my office. For this reason, I
can't recommend it as a desktop machine. And that's a pity, because
I know a lot of Linux fans, who have already given Microsoft the
boot, would dearly love to be rid of Intel as well. Who knows?
Perhaps Rebel.com has a laptop system in the works that will
overcome this noisy problem.

AIR FORCE TURNS TO CYBERSPACE TO BOOST RECRUITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIG CHRISTENSON   
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Struggling to recover from a record-setting
recruiting tailspin, the Air Force has launched a retooled Internet
site that sports a 3-D view of jets and an arcade of video games.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned site (www.airforce.com) was activated this week
and uses high-tech advances to showcase Air Force offerings as the
service tries to strengthen its recruiting effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The innovative artistic design and increased functionality of
the Web site allows users the choice to link to `microsites'
focusing on career and educational opportunities provided by the
Air Force,'' said Tech. Sgt. Charles T. Marshall, one of the
designers of the site. ``The level of sophistication involved in
this site is more of what one would expect from a CD-ROM rather
than the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a series of new, fast-paced television spots that recently
aired in major television markets, the Web site comes with bells
and whistles the Air Force hopes will spark the interest of
computer-literate young people, said Master Sgt. Tom Clements, a
spokesman with the Air Force Recruiting Service in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we're trying to do,'' he said Wednesday. ``We are
looking for the young people who are technically savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappointing recruiting year is behind the marketing efforts,
Clements conceded, and ``greatly increased and enhanced'' the
service's turn to the Internet, which is seen as a key area for
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The service fell 1,734 enlistees short of its goal in the fiscal
year ending Sept. 30, making it the Air Force's worst recruiting
year since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army pondered changing its time-honored slogan, ``Be all
that you can be,'' and last month lured new soldiers with a $6,000
bonus in hopes of trimming a shortfall of its own, the Air Force
spent millions to air several slick Hollywood-produced television
spots as part of its first paid advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The same Dallas company that handled the advertising campaign,
BJK&AMP;E, also designed www.airforce.com, Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site includes links to the three television spots, and
tries to draw the attention of Web surfers by displaying old
fighters, bombers and experimental planes, as well as the latest in
high-tech hardware.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Web site sections include:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Boneyard,'' featuring older aircraft and a fact sheet with
information about the size, speed and armament of now-discarded
aircraft, as well as how they were used in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hangar,'' a section on the present-day Air Force, offering
what the service called ``vivid displays'' of today's jet aircraft.
Each month a plane will be featured with a 3-D view, a video, photo
gallery and an analysis, plus facts and figures on the aircraft's
size, speed and weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Flight Plan,'' which introduces visitors to the careers of
current Air Force members and invites them to complete a
questionnaire on their hobbies, achievements, educational plans and
goals. Users also are encouraged to take the completed
questionnaire to recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Other sections of the site are devoted to life in the Air Force,
technology now in use, screensavers and three video games, one in
which the player ``flies'' an F-15 combat mission against a
fictitious enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to see something this high-tech representing the
Air Force,'' Clements said. ``We've always been known as the
high-tech branch of the military.''

CHIPS ARE UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, maybe you should have bought chips, not stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the usual ups and downs, the Dow Jones industrial
average has been flat since April. Meanwhile, memory chip prices
have gone ballistic. A 64-megabyte stick of SDRAM chips, the kind
most newer PCs use, was selling for about $95 in August at my
favorite computer parts store. Today it's $150. This is bad news
for consumers, because cheap memory chips have driven the shift
toward cheap-but-good home computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's also no fun for computer makers. Dell Computer Corp. said
Monday that third-quarter profits would fall below expectations,
because the soaring price of memory is driving up the cost of
building PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean a return to the days of home PCs costing $2,000
or more? Not a chance. But computers won't be getting cheaper
during this holiday season. And machines may not be as
well-equipped as before. Dell says it'll start shipping PCs with
less memory. Don't be surprised if other companies do the same.
This way, they can prop up profits by lowering costs, not raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the consumer does pay a price: Less memory under the hood
often means worse performance. For some jobs, a 400-megahertz
Pentium II with 64 megabytes of memory may outperform a
500-megahertz Pentium III with only 32 megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   How much memory is enough? These days, anything less than 64
megabytes is a sick joke; both the Apple Macintosh operating system
and Microsoft Windows are memory hogs.
</P>
<P>
   If you run memory-intensive software, you'll want still more.
For instance, speech-recognition software like Dragon Systems's
Naturally Speaking needs lots of RAM. So do 3D games, graphic arts
programs, and large databases. And even if you run relatively
light-duty software like word processors, you need lots of memory
to run many different tasks simultaneously. For this kind of heavy
lifting, 128 megabytes would be nice. Only these days that's about
$400 worth of memory. In some places you can buy a whole computer
for that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, blame the earthquake in Taiwan, a vital chip-making
region. It's the easy answer, and like most easy answers, it's
wrong. Or mostly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the quake, memory prices spiked as nervous computer
makers rushed onto the spot market to buy up loose inventory. Peter
Goodman, president of PCs For Everyone, bought $70,000 worth of
memory. A lot of other dealers and computer manufacturers made
similar moves, and those who didn't got into trouble. A guy at the
Cambridge Micro Center told me they were out of some memory
products for two weeks after the big jolt.
</P>
<P>
   But the memory market had actually begun to tighten in July. One
chip distributor told me the shortage developed when manufacturers
began making fewer cheap RAM chips, to focus on higher-priced
``flash memory,'' the kind that goes into digital cameras and those
new audio devices that play music downloaded from the Net. But
Goodman blames the retooling of major Asian chip plants, in
preparation for the next generation of memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, this retooling will drive prices down. If you
buy a stick of memory today, each chip on the stick will generally
hold 64 megabits of memory. You need eight such chips to get 64
megabytes, because a byte is eight bits.
</P>
<P>
   The next-generation RAM chips, due out next year, will carry 128
megabits or even 256 megabits per chip. But these chips will be the
same size as today's, and factories will crank them out at the same
rate.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened in the mid-'90s, when memory makers went
from eight-megabit chips to the 64s we now use. It was this
multiplication effect that caused memory prices to plummet, and
that helped launch the age of the cheap PC.
</P>
<P>
   New-generation RAM chips should send memory prices to
bargain-basement levels next year. And with the earthquake panic
past, wholesale memory prices are already slipping. So despite
recent history, there are two things you can count on. In the long
run, stock prices go up, and microchip prices go down.

A CARAMEL APPLE A DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a good idea that led to a not-so-great caramel apple.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pillow wanted to create a gourmet caramel apple with a
Halloween twist so he stuck a stick in a tart Granny apple, dipped
it in caramel, rolled it in roasted pumpkin seeds and drizzled it
with chocolate tinted orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible!'' Pillow says in a recent telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Pillow and his partners at Candy's Apples in Phoenix have
been right on with many of their other flavor combinations.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Kum-Ba-Yah, a tasty combination of caramel,
marshmallows and graham cracker bits drizzled with milk chocolate.
Or the Englishman, a blend of caramel and crushed Heath Bar. Or the
decadent Big Kahunana with caramel and macadamia nuts drizzled with
a choice of milk chocolate or white chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for these premium caramel apples are not cheap. A popular
corporate gift-giving item, they range from $6.95 to $14.95 per
apple, although most go for $9.95.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a dozen standard flavors, the company offers an
apple-of-the-month club to its best customers, so they dream up new
flavors on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it really doesn't matter if Pillow couldn't come up
with a Halloween-themed coating. When you're in the caramel apple
biz, it seems December is the month.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Pillow and company work 18- to 20-hour days. To
churn out 1,000 apples a day, they swirl through 300 to 400 cases
of caramel, each case weighing about 70 pounds. Conservatively
that's 2,100 pounds, a virtual river of caramel. The handcrafted
apples are dipped in caramel that was formulated to Pillow's
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Pillow shared the following tips for making gourmet caramel
apples at home:
</P>
<P>
   - Choose a tart apple. Pillow uses gigantic Granny Smith apples.
Not only does the green of the Granny make an appealing color
contrast, ``if you have a sweet apple and you put all those sweets
on top, it overpowers the apple and you don't get a good contrast
in flavors,'' Pillow says. If you really want a red apple, try a
McIntosh variety.
</P>
<P>
   - Proper caramel viscosity. ``The key is the caramel,''
according to Pillow. As one of the largest buyers of caramel in the
country, he was able to get a product that was customized to his
personal specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The home cook should use a sticky caramel that will help the
goodies you apply adhere like glue. (In a side-by-side comparison,
I found the homemade caramel recipe included here, while not as
thick as store-bought caramel, was definitely stickier and seemed
to coat the apple better.)
</P>
<P>
   - To roll or not to roll? For maximum coverage, Pillow advises
to roll instead of sprinkle the goodies. Use food-grade plastic
gloves to ``pack on the nuts'' and shape the apple. (Always be very
careful when working with hot caramel; it can leave nasty burns.
Parents should always supervise kids.)
</P>
<P>
   - Use a heat-proof spatula. To get a flat top on your apple, use
a heatproof spatula to swipe the top while spinning off any excess.
</P>
<P>
   - Give one to your doctor. By his calculations, Pillow figures
just about every doctor in Phoenix will receive one of his caramel
apples this year. Nurses and pharmaceutical reps are among his best
customers. They, of course, order caramel apples for their docs.
</P>
<P>
   Instant apples
</P>
<P>
   Zapple _ For a no-fuss way to make caramel apples, zap those
individually wrapped caramels (sans wrappers!) in the microwave. At
least one brand includes five sticks inside the bag and directions
on how to ``zap an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrapple _ Don't trust yourself with a candy thermometer? Concord
Foods supplies a flat sheet of caramel. You wrap it around an
apple, then warm it in the oven or microwave until gooey.
</P>
<P>
   Dapple _ T. Marzetti's, the folks who positioned salad dressings
next to the lettuce, offer several tasty flavors of apple dip, near
the apple display in the produce section, of course. Flavors
include plain caramel and caramel-peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   Surf apple _ Gourmet candy apples can be pricey. Try up to $15 a
pop! But then again, it's hard to resist the Big Kahunana, a tart
Granny apple swathed in caramel, macadamia nuts, milk chocolate or
white chocolate. Look for 13 luscious-sounding varieties at Candy's
Apples at candyapples.com. Or call, 1-888-5-APPLE-1.
</P>
<P>
   Skewer perspectives
</P>
<P>
   Sure the standard Popsicle stick will work. But if you want to
get Martha Stewarty, try these ideas:
</P>
<P>
   - Cinnamon sticks _ To avoid breaking the stick, insert one
cinnamon stick just slightly offset from the core. Use the same
cinnamon stick over and over to bore a hole, then insert a new
stick.
</P>
<P>
   - Licorice sticks _ These natural twig-looking branches are not
to be confused with licorice candy sticks. Look for them in natural
foods stores.
</P>
<P>
   - Chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   - Bamboo skewers.
</P>
<P>
   The tart factor
</P>
<P>
   Macoun _ A smaller, crisper, spicier McIntosh, Macouns from
upstate New York make lovely caramel apples.
</P>
<P>
   Jonagold _ You can't miss with this cross between a Jonathan and
a Golden Delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Empire _ A McIntosh cross, the Empire holds its shape well and
has a mild, sweet-tart taste that marries well with caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Granny Smith _ When it's caramel apples, we tend to think red,
but Granny Smith's hard, crisp and tart flavor does a bang-up job.
</P>
<P>
   Lady and Cortland _ Your kids don't always eat the apple part?
Try these petite, kid-sized varieties.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll
</P>
<P>
   Roll your caramel apple in ...
</P>
<P>
   - Coconut and drizzles of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   - Chopped pecans and drizzles of chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   - Toffee bits.
</P>
<P>
   - Roasted almonds and chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   - Chocolate sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   - Crushed candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   - Granola and coconut.
</P>
<P>
   - Peanut butter and chocolate.

VINTNERS MAKE LAST STAND IN FIGHT FOR NET SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of the Napa Valley Vintners Association
issued a ``declaration of war'' Wednesday against the alcohol
distribution system, escalating the already pitched battle between
liquor wholesalers and California wineries seeking to ship wine
directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shelton, the chief executive officer of Joseph Phelps
Vineyards and president of the winemakers group, warned wine
wholesalers at a Washington press conference that direct sales over
the Internet are ``a fact of life ... because consumers demand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's comments underscored the winemakers' furious uphill
lobbying campaign against pending legislation that would
significantly strengthen the Prohibition-era system requiring wine,
beer and spirits to be sold through state-licensed wholesalers and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wine wholesalers were quick to lash back, accusing Napa wineries
of fattening their own profits at the expense of wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hidden behind the guise of small winery access (to
consumers) for years, and at this press conference they made it
clear that this is not about small winery access,'' said David
Dickerson, spokesman for Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America.
``It's about protecting the profits they make on direct
shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for both sides are enormous, as the Internet
threatens to breach traditional commercial barriers between
producers and consumers. Nowhere is that more visible than in the
wine industry, where the barriers are buttressed by state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers contend that the legislation, called the ``21st
Amendment Protection Act,'' is needed to prevent teenagers from
buying alcohol over the Internet and to allow states to enforce
their liquor regulations. Five states have made it a felony to ship
wine directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers charge that the bill, which has passed both the House
and Senate but must be consolidated in its final form, is nothing
but an effort to shield state-protected wholesaler monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton railed against the system Wednesday, likening it to
something ``out of a banana republic.'' He said small wineries
often cannot get their boutique labels on store shelves, and even
when they find a willing wholesaler, some state laws require that
the winery enter a contract to continue doing business with that
wholesaler indefinitely, regardless of performance or even whether
the wholesaler pays its bills.
</P>
<P>
   States that by law ``shackle you to a distributor for life,''
Shelton declared, ``must disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the system archaic and said it ``should not survive
the evolution of e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson retorted, ``We believe that following the law will
never be outmoded, and the law says there are specific ways to sell
and distribute alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet still accounts for only a tiny fraction of wine
sales _ under 2 percent at Joseph Phelps, Shelton said. (Limited
direct sales are permitted to some states that have entered into a
mutual pact with California.)
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton said non-Internet direct sales _ from winery tasting
rooms, wine clubs and direct mail, all of which are also sharply
limited by state liquor regulations _ represent a significant
percentage of winery sales, as much as 12 percent at Joseph Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very profitable percentage, I might add,'' Shelton
said, ``and one that's very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineries that sell directly can capture the entire markup on a
bottle of wine rather than sharing it with wholesalers and
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based Wine
Institute, which represents all California vintners, said the
entire industry agrees that the more stringent felony laws and
state-enforced wholesale monopolies need to be combatted.
</P>
<P>
   But in toned-down criticism of the existing distribution system,
he said it needs reform, ``but we're not out to eliminate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any threat to tear down _ as opposed to reform _ the liquor
distribution system is sure to meet with powerful resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor wholesalers are a potent lobbying force, much more widely
represented than wineries on Capitol Hill and in state
legislatures. They also enjoy a close relationship with the House
GOP leadership through David Rehr, the top lobbyist for the
National Beer Wholesalers Association, and a member of the
exclusive ``kitchen cabinet'' that meets regularly with GOP Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Napa Valley vintners also are seeking to protect their
geographic ``brand'' from large wineries that label their wines
Napa when in fact they come from places such as Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 federal regulation prohibited the practice but
grandfathered in an exception for wineries that were using the Napa
label at the time. Shelton said mass-production wineries can buy a
small label that owns the exemption and then slap the Napa Valley
name on wines that come from more pedestrian regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer finds a $5 bottle of Chardonnay and thinks it's
got to be good because it's from Napa,'' Shelton said. ``We believe
it's consumer fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that the chances of getting federal regulators to
lift the exemption are ``a long shot,'' but said vintners are
working on a voluntary ``seal of authenticity'' that vintners could
use to assure consumers that their wines really come from Napa.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``geographic brand'' issue can work both ways. For
years, California vintners have borrowed place names such as
Champagne, Burgundy, Port and even Johannisberg Riesling from
Europe, much to the consternation of vintners in France, Portugal
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Treaties governing the issue will be revisited in the upcoming
World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. The Wine Institute, a
larger trade group that represents all California vintners, is
about to release a white paper exploring the trademark issues to
help determine what position the group will adopt.

CYBERPORN EMERGES AS TOP NET CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans remain deeply concerned about the need to
protect children from sexually explicit material on the Internet,
but they do not want the government to limit access to cyberporn,
according to a new broad study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The research report, from the National Issues Forums Institute
and the Kettering Foundation, offered fresh insights into public
attitudes based on some 60 lengthy civic meetings held recently in
19 states, at which participants reflected on a host of
Internet-related matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This analysis shouldn't be confused with poll results, which
are a snapshot of public opinion at a given point in time,'' said
John Doble, whose research firm interpreted the results for the two
non-partisan and non-profit sponsors. ``Nor,'' Doble added,
``should such forums be confused with focus groups, in which
professional moderators, working from a tightly directed script,
interrogate respondents who receive an incentive to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the agendas of many policy-makers in Washington, the
forum participants failed to voice much spontaneous concern about
online hate sites, ``partly because people said they are protected
by the First Amendment and partly because participants did not see
them as presenting a clear and present danger,'' Doble said.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, most people concluded that neo-Nazis and
the Ku Klux Klan should be permitted online access, so long as they
do not directly incite violence, the report said. Nor were people
widely alarmed about bomb-making sites, because, they noted, such
data is already widely available in books and libraries
</P>
<P>
   A host of other often hotly debated issues, such as Internet
gambling, cyberterrorism, and potential cyberattacks by hostile
foreign powers were scarcely mentioned. The terrorism concerns have
led the Clinton administration to develop a $1.4 billion plan to
monitor the nation's data networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not yet blips on the public's radar screen,'' Doble
said.
</P>
<P>
   The theme that did strike home was the need to better protect
children from exposure to online pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``More generally, many felt that the abundance of pornography on
the Net is an indication of our ethical decline, a sign of what we,
as a nation and as a global community, have come to value,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most participants opposed imposing an outright ban
on sexually explicit online material. They cited four reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Such materials are protected by constitutional freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   No consensus exists about what constitutes pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The government cannot be trusted to censor wisely or well.
</P>
<P>
   As a worldwide phenomenon, the Web is virtually impossible to
control.
</P>
<P>
   As they deliberated, the forum participants favored the adoption
of improved software filters _ the online equivalent of the
so-called V-chips now being implanted in TV sets that would enable
parents to limit what comes into the home _ without limiting what
is actually online.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants noted that pornographic sites have been known
to use deception to lure people. Thus, a high school student from
Long Island described how classmates seeking information about the
Mars Pathfinder had navigated to a porn site designed to snare
surfers intending to reach NASA's Web page.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the most computer-literate participants,
including high school students, were among those least shocked that
personal information is available on the Internet, reflecting that
people have to get used to the fact that ``times have changed and
the old rules no longer apply.''

<P>
   Maybe it's time to look at Apple Computer Inc. in a different
light: as an Internet stock. As Apple points out in advertising for
new versions of its popular iMac computer, 90 percent of iMac
owners are connected to the Internet _ an astonishingly high share
_ and most of them got wired the first day they owned the machine.
So maybe Apple is an Internet platform company.
</P>
<P>
   Consider also that the latest versions of the Macintosh
operating system contain a metasearch tool called Sherlock that
links to powerful Web engines, like Alta Vista, Infoseek, Lycos and
Hotbot, and prioritizes their results.
</P>
<P>
   In MAC OS 9, Apple's latest version of the operating system,
which shipped last week, the improved Sherlock 2 channels make
searching easier and more powerful by grouping similar sources
together and returning more relevant results. It also adds a
shopping channel. So maybe Apple is an Internet portal company.
</P>
<P>
   Add the vast number of sites running video using Apple's
Quicktime technology, or created on Macintoshes running
Web-designing tools like Adobe's InDesign and you have a liberal
sprinkling of Internet pixie dust.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the 80.6 percent run-up in Apple shares this year,
to $73.9375 on Friday, they still trade at a discount to those of
other personal computer manufacturers like Dell Computer or
Gateway, let alone to a pure Internet play like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.2, versus 53.9 for
Dell and 45.1 for Gateway. (Yahoo's market capitalization is over
100 times trailing 12-month revenues; its P/E ratio is not
considered meaningful, because its net income is so small.)
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like these, some analysts say there is still strong
potential for an increase in Apple's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has been on a roll since its co-founder, Steven P. Jobs,
returned in 1997 as interim chief executive. The successful launch
of the iMac a little over a year ago was followed by splashy
rollouts of the G3 desktop machines, new G3 Powerbooks and the
iMac's portable cousin, the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that Jobs and company could walk on water,
they stumbled in the third quarter, announcing a shortfall in
earnings early because of inadequate chip supplies for the new G4
desktops and flat-panel displays for the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get the fastest versions of the G4 microprocessor in
time, Apple cut the speed rating of the new G4 machines by 50
megahertz without cutting prices. Then, in a move that surely
tested even devoted Mac loyalists, the company canceled existing
orders, only to reinstate them later for anyone who ordered before
Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Apple managed to beat analysts' revised estimates, as well as
its own predictions, by 6 cents a share for the fourth fiscal
quarter and predicted a strong December quarter. Of 20 analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings, six rated Apple as a strong buy, six as a buy, seven as a
hold and one as a weak sell.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York is among
those calling it a strong buy, with a 12-month price target of $90.
``There's more growth to come,'' Mazzucchelli said, ``and if you
look at how much negative perception there is still in the market,
that shows you the potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's prospects as an Internet play are an added bonus for
what is already a robust growth story, said Mazzucchelli, noting
that the company received orders for 150,000 iMacs in the three
months after its introduction, but booked 250,000 orders for the
new models in just one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple's not talking about it,'' he said, ``but should they
find a way to leverage their immense Internet installed base, which
is growing at a huge rate, you can make a case for at least part of
the business to be valued as an Internet company.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple executives have been coy about possible Internet service
offerings, saying only that they have nothing to say now.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts are bullish on Apple's Internet prospects. ``I
don't think Apple can reinvent itself, but I do think it can
rejuvenate itself via the Web,'' said Geoffrey Moore, president of
the Chasm Group, a Silicon Valley consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, as the market migrates from product to service,
Microsoft isn't getting it. Steve might get it,'' he said,
referring to Jobs and adding that a truly distinctive Apple
Internet service could prove a winner if it attracts enough Mac
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money would Mac loyalists part with? I think quite a
lot, if the experience were truly Mac-like,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Apple is busy adding loyalists through the iMac. The
company is establishing the iMac as the slickest platform for
surfing the Web, much as the original Macintosh was the clear
choice for desktop publishing or today's Wintel machines are the
standard for running Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has established its Internet status ``in very subtle
ways,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan, who also
has a 12-month target of $90 on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't beat you over the head saying `we're an Internet
company,''' he said. ``They've done it with their platform, and,
suddenly, with the launch of the new iMacs, it dawns on everybody.
Their claims are not overstated and they're really starting to pan
out.''

 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 50 years ago, the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov
formulated the three laws of robotics. The first is, ``A robot may
not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being
to come to harm.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is nothing to worry about from the robot
now under consideration. It has a pair of caterpillar treads, bent
yellow arms with multiple sockets, touch sensors and two rubber
bands. It even follows the second law of robotics: it obeys orders
without question _ after a program is fed into its central
processor via infrared signals from a desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, even the third law seems to be holding up: ``A robot
must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not
conflict with the first or second law.'' The two touch sensors turn
off the power when the robot reaches the edge of the table,
preventing destruction on the floor below.
</P>
<P>
   But the future may be less certain as these robots evolve.
Similar constructions, created out of Lego blocks and the Lego
Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   The $219 set, which contains familiar Lego pieces along with
light sensors, motors, touch sensors, gears and a minicomputer
``brick,'' has been an immense success since its introduction last
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Lego machine is made with the brick at its center. Then a
program is written on a computer and beamed into an infrared sensor
on the robot, which is then set free to follow its prescribed
orders. Lego is now introducing a Star Wars Droid kit ($109), in
which the robots take on forms familiar from the films' quirkiest
characters, and a Discovery robot set ($159) for more elementary
constructions that don't require a computer to program.
</P>
<P>
   What is most astonishing, though, is not one's ability to
instruct that yellow-armed table-sensor robot to back up from the
edge, nor to make an R2D2 model that will respond to coded signals
from a flashlight. It is what happens once technologically
sophisticated adults get hold of these machines' primitive
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms robots have become techno-toys with as much appeal as
the latest Nokia phone or Palm Pilot organizer. One Silicon Valley
start-up company, Nuvo Media, had to make an office rule: no Lego
play during work hours. One inventor, Anthony Fudd, has created an
elementary motorized copy machine with the Mindstorms set that uses
only one non-Lego part: the pen that is raised and lowered as it
sketches out the copy.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers have gone to work on the Lego computer brick, dissecting
its hardware, and the Internet has become host to proliferating
robotic improvisations. (There are discussions at www.lugnet.com,
Lego's own www.legomindstorms.com, and such hacker sites as
www.crynwr.com/lego-robotics.)
</P>
<P>
   Now two books are being published with more sophisticated
robotic instructions, engineering ideas and new programming
languages: ``Lego Mindstorms'' by Jonathan B. Knudsen (O'Reilly &AMP;
Associates) and the forthcoming ``Definitive Guide to Lego
Mindstorms'' by Dave Baum (Apress).
</P>
<P>
   The results might seem a far cry from the model towns that
children began building out of interlinking Lego pieces in the
1950s. But there are deep connections between the old and the new,
between, say, the minutely detailed pirate ship with monkeys
hanging from the riggings that Lego produced in 1989 and Knudsen's
invention of a Minerva Lego robot with a mechanical grasping arm.
The transition not only illustrates the evolution of technological
play but also reveals something about how computer technology
itself might be understood and even taught.
</P>
<P>
   The very name of the Lego robot set, Mindstorms, is taken from
the 1980 book of the same name by the Seymour Papert, a computer
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who argued
that training in computer programming may be one of the most
promising ways to teach children about the nature of problem
solving. Lego later financed some of his research, and an early
version of the Lego programmable brick was developed at the MIT
Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   What has been the nature of Lego's evolution? Consider the style
of Lego that has been in place since the Danish company produced
its first plastic pieces in 1949. The basic Lego element has always
been the rectangular brick marked with circular studs; before the
1970s, it seems as if no curved elements were created at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even when curved shapes were created for use in particular
models of ships or cars, the brick esthetic ruled: the point wasn't
to hide the bricks but to show how their edges and protrusions
could be used to suggest curves and movement. The more ``pure'' the
Lego model, the less use it has of specialized pieces with unusual
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the appeal of a Lego model is that it displays its
origins by showing its mechanical skeleton; that skeleton is all
the more astonishing because it can be reorganized to form an
entirely different body.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes Lego seem like a technological toy, even when
the models are nontechnological. Many of the models of the 1980s,
including towns and castles and pirates, are parts of traditional
children's fantasies; almost all of them (aside from the various
machinelike Technic toys) are also pretechnological in character.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning of technology _ the word grows out of Greek
linguistic roots invoking craft, making and mastery _ is evident
not just in the process of their construction but also in the
nature of their appearance. While some toys are put together to
seem as if they weren't put together, Legos proclaim their own
making; they display their technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lego instruction booklets are often exquisite
demonstrations of the process behind the display. There are no
words, only images. Pieces that previously seemed inconsequential
turn out to serve an important purpose; there is continuing
surprise as form and function align.
</P>
<P>
   But this notion of Lego technology is not just metaphorical.
What is being learned in classic Lego construction is a kind of
digital language. The use of block accumulations to create
illusions of smoothness is not unlike the way discrete numbers
become waves of sound in the playing of a CD.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a practiced Lego builder gradually learns that
there are certain ways in which pieces are combined again and again
to create arches, axles, walls, turrets, gear systems; they could
almost be conceived of as modules, small models that are regularly
called upon for continued use in larger systems.
</P>
<P>
   This is very close to the way one has to think to make computer
programs. There are very few ``smooth'' instructions, instructions
that might tell a mechanical robot, for example, ``Turn in a
circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead every smooth idea has to be broken down into the
smallest individual steps: turning in a circle requires moving in
minuscule movements up and across while slowly shifting direction,
each moment of which must be specified in a program. Moreover,
every programming language has certain procedures that are needed
again and again; like the Lego modules, these miniprograms become
ready-made ingredients for use in larger systems.
</P>
<P>
   So Lego construction and computer programming already have
certain similarities. And the Lego programming language for
Mindstorm robots _ based on a language developed by Papert at MIT _
makes those parallels clear. The program is constructed on the
screen of the computer. Each instruction appears as a colored block
that is then connected to another block.
</P>
<P>
   One block on the screen, might, for example, start the robot's
power; the next might choose its direction of motion, and a third
might instruct it to check a sensor and move only if a light is on.
Lego also has an educational division, Dacta, that develops
extensive curricula for schools and uses more advanced robotic
programming languages developed at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Papert, who studied with Jean Piaget, has argued that this
constructive process is also precisely the process by which
children's education should take place. Computer literacy is not a
matter of knowing how to use Microsoft Word, it is a matter of
understanding how computers ``think'' and how humans might learn
from thinking like a computer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Papert developed an early version of a robot he
called a Turtle that moved on the floor, following explicit
instructions from a computer. Children had to figure out precisely
which instructions would cause the motion they desired. They had to
dissect the motion and then reconstruct it. Papert has argued that
all construction inspires learning, and all learning is a form of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Papert's successor at MIT's Media Lab, Mitchel Resnick, is
working on objects that may become the next generation of Lego
Mindstorms, including small computer blocks called ``crickets,''
which not only receive programs from a PC but also send
instructions to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal,'' he said in an interview, ``is to bring back a
craft spirit. We think of computers as a new kind of material used
to create things in the world.'' The computer, he suggested, should
seem more like modeling clay or finger paint and less like
television.
</P>
<P>
   This celebration of material manipulation gives the Lego robots
an even closer connection to traditional Legos than many of the
other Lego sets that have recently been made. Several years ago, as
Lego was being overshadowed by video games and other forms of
electronic play, Lego styles changed.
</P>
<P>
   The company developed sets aimed at girls (which were far less
successful here than in Europe) while making other attempts to
rival video games. Models were created that make sound and flash
lights. Lego machines were used in duels, with scores being kept by
electronic counters. Objects began to take on the fantastical
appearance of the latest sci-fi fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of castles, there are Insectoid space ships shaped like
spiders and beetles. Instead of a medieval catapult, there is a
Stingray submarine with a swinging tail ostensibly searching for
magic crystals. Technology runs wild.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate sets have many specialized parts _ green windshields,
insect wings, rock grinders _ that could fit in no other
application, something that almost violates the elegant principles
of Lego building.
</P>
<P>
   The new Star Wars models hark back a bit more to the
technological spirit of traditional Legos, despite their
specialized accouterments. They are at the same time stringent and
fantastical.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the Mindstorms and Droid sets that the old Lego
principles fully come into their own: the use of the blocks and the
creation of the programs are interwoven activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lego has celebrated the act of making while displaying that act
in the objects being made: the Mindstorms creations, with their
mixture of engineering and programming, combine pretech mechanisms
and high-tech software and celebrate the union of making and
thinking. Who knows where this might lead?
</P>
<P>
   Voice synthesizers, subtle motor control, musical abilities,
robots conversing _ perhaps, one day, we will even come to be
grateful for Asimov's three laws.

RESORTS OFFER AN INSULAR RETREAT FROM JAMAICA AND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCHO RIOS, Jamaica _ Jamaica is old pirate movies with Errol
Flynn, James Bond's Dr. No and romance novels with steamy cover
illustrations of brawny captains and luscious maidens.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a nation of 2.6 million people, a third of whom live
in absolute poverty, according to the United Nations. The island is
ringed with hotels, golf courses and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, a member of the British Commonwealth, is the queen of
all-inclusive resorts, some 31 in all. But is that the be-all,
end-all in island vacationing?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone finds Jamaica a vacation paradise. Gang wars in
Kingston hit the news in July and riots erupted in the spring when
the government announced a 30 percent hike in gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican officials called out the armed forces to help patrol
the country's beaches. Periodically, warnings spring up on the U.S.
State Department's Web page (http://travel.state.gov/).
</P>
<P>
   Warnings aside, I wanted _ no, I needed _ a Jamaica vacation.
</P>
<P>
   From Montego Bay to Negril, Ocho Rios to Kingston, resorts such
as Sandals, Hedonism, SuperClubs, Grand Lido and Franklyn D attract
singles, families and groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica Tourism's Charles Handal, regional manager in the
southern United States, says the all-inclusive concept goes back to
the late 1950s. The first location was Frenchman's Cove in Port
Antonio and they certainly catered to guests. ``If they didn't have
it, they would fly it in.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1970s, Negril Beach Village (now Hedonism II) had
guests buying beads to exchange for drinks. Today, some 60 percent
of Jamaica's visitors stay at an all-inclusive resort, according to
Handal.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is this: You pay one price for accommodations, all
meals, all alcoholic drinks, gratuities and water sports equipment
(Sunfish, snorkeling, paddle boats, etc). It is much like a cruise,
except you don't get a big bar tab at the end and there is no
slipping the room steward an envelope. Or do you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipping is accepted,'' said Patroy Stewart, guest services
manager at the Jamaica Grande. Sandals and SuperClubs have a
no-tipping policy.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Knatt and her extended family from Baton Rouge, La., can't
stop raving about how good the service was on their second visit to
the Jamaica Grande. ``We just loved it so much,'' she said a month
after the family get-together. And perhaps one of the reasons is
that Knatt estimates that her husband, Theodore, an orthopedic
surgeon, shelled out $250 in tips for the week. Wait staff
practically ran to help the family at every opportunity, Knatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knatts and their four children shared our van on a 2
1/2-hour ride from Montego Bay to Ocho Rios. Avery and Mary Knatt
and Lionel Vitale (Doris Knatt's brother) and his wife, Detra, were
on their first visit to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale, a scout with the New York Jets, had difficulty getting
beyond Jamaica's obvious poverty, the narrow winding highway and
the roadside fruit stands. ``When I get home, I'm going kiss my
house,'' he said standing at the roadside rest stop, 30 minutes
from the resort. Minutes later, our speeding van hit a goat.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Jamaica, mon.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaica Grande was once two hotels. In 1993 the properties
became one under the Renaissance umbrella and a central open-air
lobby was built linking the east and west towers. With 720 rooms,
it is the island's largest single property. There are five
restaurants, the Jamaic'n Me Crazy disco, casino and children's
Club Mongoose. The Fantasy Pool is a replica of the nearby Dunn's
River Falls, with caves, bridges, Jacuzzis and swim-up bar. The
white sandy beach fronts the azure-blue Mallard's Bay, where
patrons get free use of Sunfish sailboats, kayaks and snorkel
equipment. Despite moderate tipping on our part, food and service
were not great at the Grande. The mediocre food came as a surprise
after reading a Jamaica bulletin Web site where past visitors raved
about the ``excellent'' cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   While the bars are plentiful, finding a bartender was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Table waiters were less than friendly and service was spotty
during our mid-July stay.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Knatt conceded the food was better on a previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   We fared better at the smaller 420-room Sunset Beach Resort and
Spa (the former Seawind Hotel) at Montego Bay. It didn't have the
fabulous beach of the Grande _ Sunset's was more rocks than sand
and the view wasn't striking _ but the service was warmer, food far
superior and entertainment more intimate. A duo played during the
Jamaica night dinner and the full-service spa was a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   The big minus here was the reggae band playing loudly under our
fourth-floor balcony until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   With multiple restaurants, water sports and entertainment, you
may ask: Why leave the grounds? Many people don't and that's where
Jamaicans lose. For some tourists, it is fear that keeps them
inside the resort's walls. Uniformed hotel guards do make an
intimidating presence on the beach. But island crime has dropped 30
percent since 1996 and visitor arrivals have increased steadily
over a 10-year period. Handal said that August visits were up 9.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   We ventured a few feet past a fence that marked the end of the
resort's private beach on the first night on the island. Stepping
out of the shadows a young entrepreneur quickly approached and
offered to sell marijuana. No surprise; a recent Jamaica Tourist
Board survey reveals that 60 percent of visitors are approached to
buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the outdoor crafts market at Ocho Rios, a few blocks from the
resort's main gate, we were the only shoppers on a sunny Wednesday
morning. Merchants, mostly women, use intense flattery to get you
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, pretty lady, over here. Let me show you what I have. Step
inside, there is no charge to look,'' they chant in singsong
voices. We found tourists aplenty at the duty-free shopping center,
about three blocks from the crafts market. Vans of shore excursion
cruisers disgorged at shops selling Swiss watches, Lalique and
gemstones.
</P>
<P>
   Early each morning there was a different cruise ship, such as
Carnival's Imagination and Royal Caribbean's Majesty of the Seas,
calling at Ocho Rios. By 4:30 p.m. the ships sailed away from
Jamaica. About 800,000 people have arrived in Jamaica by cruise
ship since Jan. 1, mostly to spend a day.
</P>
<P>
   All-inclusive resort stays, which were first geared toward
couples, now appeal to families. Children under 12 eat and stay
free at many, including the Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Smith, a native Jamaican and resident of San Antonio,
took her family of five to the all-inclusive Franklyn D Resort at
Runaway Bay in 1998. ``It was very nice, the people were very
friendly,'' Smith said, adding that management mingled with the
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths, with two children under 10, enjoyed the experience,
especially the Franklyn D nanny assigned each family at check-in.
</P>
<P>
   Smith says she felt especially ``shielded from everything
outside. I'd go back to the resort, but I'd get out (via taxi) a
lot more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The resort gives its patrons escorted field trips to tourist
sites or shopping. Getting out and away from the insular resort is
the only way to see Jamaica and its people.
</P>
<P>
   On a boat trip to Dunn's River Falls, our guide, Dudley, was
informed and lectured. He pointed out the sites, including Mick

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. have
been boasting this week about their new online stock trading
service and the head start they got on their competitors on Wall
Street. But when it came to the Internet address they desired,
somebody got a jump on them.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is telling the story, that somebody is either a
17-year-old schoolboy who created a Web site to share his passion
for mountain-bike racing, or an opportunistic ``cybersquatter'' who
registered dozens of Internet addresses in a scheme to exact
ransoms from big-name corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the domain name, or Web address, that Morgan Stanley
coveted takes a Web surfer not to its electronic brokerage but
instead to what appears to be a site dedicated to mountain biking.
It carries a photo of a helmeted cyclist under the title Mud
Sweat's Downhill World.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wong, a senior at a private high school in Los Altos,
Calif., says he created the site and named it after Mud Sweat &AMP;
Gears, the shop that sold him his mountain bikes. ``Me and my
friends saw other sites on the Net,'' he said, sitting with his
parents in the dining room of their spacious home in the
Hillsborough hills overlooking Silicon Valley. ``We wanted to start
our own, with a bunch of pictures and videos and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
alleging that Ivan's Web site infringes on the firm's trademarks.
Morgan Stanley is asking a judge to stop Ivan from using the domain
name.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, it seems a touching anecdote about a boy who
stumbled into the path of a profit-seeking juggernaut. But turn the
page and the story veers away from David and Goliath into a tale
more characteristic of this get-rich-with-a-click era.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a company set up by Ivan's father, Sau Wong,
has registered dozens of domain names, many of them derived from
the names of investment banks. Among them are
goldmansachsdirect.com and jpmorganonline.com. In Morgan Stanley's
view, the case is a blatant example of cybersquatting, the practice
of registering Internet addresses in hopes of reselling them to
companies or organizations that have a commercial use for them.
Some companies have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, but
others, like Morgan Stanley, have gone to court to obtain addresses
that they claim are rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed this week in its lawsuit, Morgan Stanley
alleged that ``the defendant in this case has targeted MSDW and the
New York investment banking community with particular precision and
malice.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of walking away, as many cybersquatters do when they
are sued by large corporations, Ivan is holding his ground. ``We've
hired three teams of attorneys to fight this,'' said his father.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wong said it was coincidental that the site had a name so
similar to Morgan Stanley's main Web site, www.msdw.com. ``It was
pretty ironic how they would have the same name as us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sau Wong's company, Smart Ideas, registered www.msdwonline.com
in May, several weeks before Morgan Stanley officials settled on a
new name for their online brokerage. In late July, a marketing
executive discovered that the obvious domain name for the new unit
was already taken. So the big securities firm had to introduce its
overhauled electronic brokerage, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online,
Thursday with a not-so-intuitive address on the World Wide Web,
www.online.msdw.com.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the firm, one of the biggest on Wall Street,
located the apparent owners and began negotiating with online
correspondents they believed to be Ivan and his 18-year-old
brother, Ben. They offered to pay what a company representative
called a ``reasonable fee'' for the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   The response that came by an electronic message: ``Give us an
offer we cannot refuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley quickly bid $10,000, a sum that Alejandro Levins,
who was representing Morgan Stanley, described to one of the boys
as ``a nice bag of money for a guy your age,'' according to
documents Morgan Stanley filed in court.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the tone of the online negotiations hardened,
according to the court documents. The sellers demanded $75,000 for
the domain name and when Levins balked, he received a message that
said, ``By the way, you are not dealing with a kid. I am the father
of Ben and Ivan...I am an entrepreneur myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dispatch to a Morgan Stanley executive, apparently from
Sau Wong, opened with this note, ``As you may not be aware, some
`useful' domain names can fetch as much as six (6) figures or
more.'' It went on to describe Smart Ideas as ``an innovative and
forward-looking company'' that had ``registered many relevant
domain names covering some of the major competitors of your parent
company. Our rationale is that all brokerage houses, which do not
have online trading today, will eventually provide that service.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong then lowered his asking price to $50,000 and later offered
to throw in another domain name his company had registered,
morganstanleydirect.com.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Morgan Stanley officials rescinded their offer of
$10,000 and filed suit on Aug. 13.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In court documents, executives allege that the mountain-biking
theme that now appears on the Web site did not appear there until
10 days after the suit was filed, ``in a transparent attempt to
conceal its fraudulent ransom scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   They now think they were dealing all along with Sau Wong, who
says he is a computer-chip engineer who has worked in Silicon
Valley for 25 years. But Wong and Ivan tried to dispel that notion
in an interview, saying the idea of registering domain names had
been Ivan's from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan said he had read an article that said the people who
register domain names can sometimes profit from them. ``In school,
we learned about freedom of speech,'' he sad, adding that one of
his teachers had told him that ``if you got a (Web site) first, you
can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a 17-year-old came up with the names of so many
investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Ivan said his father gave
him the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Goldman Sachs account,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ivan and his father insisted that they didn't solicit
buyers for any of the domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not beggars,'' Wong said. ``We do not need to beg.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybersquatting has created a storm of legal controversy.
Trademark holders are getting more support from the courts and from
Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit
corporation that oversees the registration of domain names, legal
experts said. So many disputes over the rights to domain names have
landed in court that ICANN is trying to set up a mandatory
arbitration system to settle them.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, a 16-year-old Canadian boy incurred the
wrath of Apple Computer Inc. when he registered the domain name
www.appleimac.com after Apple introduced its iMac personal
computer. He said he would use it to draw traffic to his Web-based
business but would consider selling it. But after hearing from
Apple's lawyers, he renounced ownership of the name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some judges don't see speculating in domain names as so
harmful, said Pam Samuelson, a professor of law at the University
of California at Berkeley. ``One could say that cybersquatting is
just another example of American ingenuity,'' she said. ``These
people are going out and creating things that somebody else might
find of value. In a sense, they're entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Samuelson said that ``This doesn't seem to be an
open-and-shut case'' of trademark infringement. The trademark in
question, MSDW, is relatively new _Morgan Stanley merged with Dean
Witter in 1997 _ and not that famous, she said. A federal statute
enacted in 1995 was expressly aimed at stopping cybersquatters from
diluting the value of established trademarks.

TV ON THE INTERNET: A FUZZY PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So there's Sam Donaldson on your computer screen, all smiley
with a head shrunk to the size of a postage stamp. He's trying to
drum up enthusiasm for his recently launched news show, which airs
three times a week on the World Wide Web. ``Television on the
Internet,'' he says, ``is a two-way, not a one-way, street.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Television on the Internet, at least for now, is a
frustrating dead end.
</P>
<P>
   What were the folks at ABC News thinking, anyway? You can't just
put an old-fashioned news talk show on the Internet, add a few
creaky ``interactive'' features, and expect to keep viewers. Bad TV
is still bad TV, even if it's on line.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about this concept was wrongheaded from the start.
Donaldson is best known for his acerbic, confrontational style, but
on SamDonaldson(at)ABCNews.com, he's trying to be Mr. Congeniality.
Since the show debuted three weeks ago, he has chatted up former
presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter and talked amiably with the
always controversial Governor Jesse Ventura. His questions are
softballs, and the witty banter is anything but. This isn't hard
news; it's soft corn. And when you can find breaking news and the
latest jokes all over the Internet, why would anyone put up with
the limitations of the technology to watch a ``news'' show in which
the host makes quips about Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the former White House correspondent seems to
know he's out of place in this medium. ``I'm quite aware that
you're seeing me in a little box, 2 inches by 2 inches,'' he says.
``But we save on makeup. There is no expensive set back there, and
the technology will get better,'' he promises.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it can't get any worse. When I tried to watch the show
live on Wednesday (it airs Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30
p.m. at www.abcnews.go.com), it crashed my browser three times. It
wasn't any easier watching the archives, either. An interview with
former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin looked like two little Pez
heads suspended in a split screen. Sometimes the screen froze, and
at other times, the video lost pace with the audio, making the
Rubin Pez head deliver Donaldson candy.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem here isn't just the technology or the insipid
content. The real potential of Web television is the option of
interactivity. But like most Web TV, this show doesn't tap that
potential. So far, Donaldson has taken a few ``unscientific''
polls. In one, viewers were asked to evaluate their boss
(``excellent'' or ``jerk''); in another, they were quizzed on the
spelling of, you guessed it, potato. Stal(e)?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers are also invited to e-mail questions to Donaldson, but
so far, the format is less spontaneous than that of a typical
call-in talk show. The questions from the viewers have actually
been quite intelligent, but communication on line, whether it be in
a chat room or on a news show, is stilted by its very nature. It's
impossible to get a real dialogue going by typing missives to a
talking head on a tiny screen.
</P>
<P>
   True interactivity may be impossible, but the Donaldson show
doesn't even come close to breaking new ground. The reporter is a
suit-and-tie kind of guy trying to fit into a jeans-and-T-shirt
world. ``Hit me again,'' he says, looking a bit worried that
someone might take him literally. No need to fret. Repeat hits
aren't a danger when it's so easy to just go click.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  The Reform Party's list of presidential candidates keeps
growing _ Warren Beatty! Donald Trump! Cybill Shepherd! Oprah
Winfrey! _ and the cyber squatters are already one step ahead of
the candidates. Kiley Pryor, a 22-year-old college student in
Amarillo, Texas, bought the domain name www.Oprah2000.com back in
March. ``We would like to make a great deal of money on it,'' says
the entrepreneur, who paid $100 for the Web address and hopes to
sell it to the talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   And there are already several Beatty sites. Beatty2000.com is a
site ``created to gauge interest'' for the actor's candidacy; its
Webmaster, Dave Perry of New Phase Media Design in Nashville,
refuses to say whether the site is paid for by the Bulworth, we
mean Beatty, machine. The actor already has an unofficial tribute
at www.beatty4president.org; it was started by Adrian Wild, a
University of Florida student. ``He's a charismatic outsider,''
says Wild.
</P>
<P>
   So far The Donald, the Talk Show Host, and the Model haven't put
up political sites. But Shepherd has a vanity site
(www.cybill.com), and Trump has a site for his hotel and casino
operations (www.trump.com). One has a platform for Revlon; the
other takes a stand on the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;  Dubious Internet firsts. Amazon.com has announced, quite
breathlessly, that Moby's performance on  &UR; tonight &LR; 's ``Late Night
With David Letterman'' show will be available for free download at
Amazon immediately after the show. ``This is an exclusive
opportunity, and it's the first time a song played during the show
will be available for download,'' says Amazon spokeswoman Jenny
Cherrytree. Well, we can't wait for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   We're told that a new site, www.beer.com, embraces ``a total
beer lifestyle and entertainment concept.'' Now, that's a scary
concept. The site has a feature called a bar finder, which helps
you locate a place where everybody knows your name. When we
searched for a watering hole in Boston, we got the response ``Zero
bars found.''

BOB MACKIE DOESN'T MIND THE TITLE `PRINCE OF GLITZ' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is a charming Bob Mackie moment. He grins his
boyish grin and looks around at the assemblage of his designs of
the last 35 years. ``It feels good now to see them out,'' he says,
``... having a good time again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stripped down to his shirtsleeves, he is overseeing completion
of a retrospective, ``Unmistakably Mackie,'' at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology, now through Dec. 31. It coincides with the
publication of a book of the same name by fashion writer Frank
DeCaro (Universe, $45) and a limited-edition fragrance in the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie, 59, is, of course, the quintessential celebrity
designer, having fashioned starmaking, hey-look-at-me clothes for
such entertainers as Cher, Carol Burnett, Diana Ross, Ann-Margret,
Mitzi Gaynor, Elton John and RuPaul since 1965. Let people snicker
at Cher's tacky Oscar costume, gasp at the exotic Las Vegas
dancers' beads or pay five-figure prices for a sequin-drenched
Barbie doll. Mackie gets the credit.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years he worked on the Carol Burnett show, churning out
as many as 50 costumes a week, including glamorous evening gowns,
for her openings and dozens of comic clothes for her caricature
skits. Mackie's own humor instinct came into play to help the
actress push the edge. One of the most famous sartorial jokes: the
Southern belle drapery knock-off from the segment ``Went With the
Wind,'' where Burnett appeared in a gown with the drapery rod still
attached.
</P>
<P>
   When the bumbling Mrs. Wiggins was first discussed, Mackie
suggested she do the role ``as one of the bumbling CBS secretaries
we all knew at the time,'' he says. He created a dress so
tight-fitting, she could barely walk. But he knew how to go for the
laugh; he advised her to stick out her rear end to exaggerate the
silhouette. For the ill-starred Eunice, he found a flowered
thrift-shop frock.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, he says, when she took questions from the audience at
the start of the show, someone inevitably asked who created her
costumes. Each time she gave Mackie credit. ``I kept thinking
they'd know by now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fashion Institute show also includes the gown Madonna wore
to the Oscars when she sang ``Sooner or Later,'' from ``Dick
Tracy,'' and Sharon Stone's sequin gown from the film ``Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John's luminous silver coat is a reminder of his moment
singing ``Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.'' After Mackie did Cher's
first television special, John came to him and said, ``I want some
things like Cher has. ... I drew him up about 50 sketches thinking
he would pick some. He picked them all.''
</P>
<P>
   An entire section of the retrospective is devoted to Cher, whom
early on he found to be a remarkable muse, someone to dress as one
would a Barbie. He started working with her on ``The Sonny and Cher
Comedy Hour,'' beginning in 1971, and he took her from character to
character _ an exotic dancer to gypsy to Olive Oyl to an Indian
princess in a beaded loincloth. Sometimes he would design her
costume for one song, he says, and then the song would be changed
at the last minute when it was too late to make her something else.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie made the skintight, pearl-strand dress she wore on the
cover of Time in 1975 and all her all-too-revealing Oscar gowns and
hats. One of the most notorious is the bare, beaded gown and
feathered headdress she wore when presenting Don Ameche with an
Oscar in 1986. She was annoyed, Mackie says, at the academy because
she was not nominated for ``Mask.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think this is a bit much?'' Mackie asked her,
according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, ``she was just so thrilled ... this is so
fun,'' Mackie says. She was like a chameleon enjoying the fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years she came into her own. ``She has become Miss
Expert,'' Mackie says like a loving parent discussing an errant
child. ``... She has been watching MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly for Bob Mackie, his destiny was set from early
childhood. At 5, he cut his chin when he fell down the stairs while
dressed as Carmen Miranda. When he was 10, he put together a
Halloween costume meant to look like a French lady of the evening.
He grew up going to movies where he found the spark of glamour and
fantasy he craved.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is involved with several projects: He designs for the
wealthy and glamorous on a custom-order basis; he provides his
talent to a less expensive ready-to-wear house and successfully
sells an affordable line on QVC. His signature fragrance is still
selling in department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Each year he also makes a new dazzling over-the-top Barbie Doll
costume, and the dolls ultimately become fine prizes for Barbie
collectors who pay thousands for them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a negative being typecast as the ``Prince of Glitz''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than being typecast for overalls,'' he says
cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   As for any regrets, there is one: He had to turn down the job of
designing costumes for the 1970s film ``The Great Gatsby.''

   QUIET, PLEASE: TEST IN PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   It has been three months since IBM and major record labels began
the experiment: selling albums over high-speed Internet cable
modems in 1,000 households in metropolitan San Diego. But efforts
to assess the music test's progress, have met the sound of silence.
The companies have effectively imposed a publicity blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Max Martens, a spokesman for the project, which is called Album
Direct, said the participating companies did not want the news
media to influence the buying patterns of the San Diego consumers _
or to even know who the consumers were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sequestering a jury,'' Martens said. ``We don't want
to taint the very perceptions we're trying to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and competitors posit a different courtroom
analogy: mistrial. There are rumblings in the industry that the
project simply is not living up to the organizers' vision of a
21st-century music delivery method that protects copyrights. And
since the effort began in June, the participating record companies,
including the industry giants Universal and BMG, have begun
pursuing technologies other than the IBM system.
</P>
<P>
   What IBM has said is that the trial lets record companies sell
albums directly to consumer's homes over high-speed Internet lines.
After paying for and downloading music, the consumers can transfer
the songs from their computer to compact disks using so-called CD
burner technology, effectively creating their own home-grown CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, IBM and Album Direct officials are not saying much.
It will be at least the end of the year before they share
information about the experiment.

   THE PC INDUSTRY SHOWS STRONG GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer industry is continuing to show significant
global growth, with third-quarter shipments of machines increasing
by 23.2 percent over the comparable quarter last year, according to
a Dataquest report to be issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest, a market research company based in San Jose, Calif.,
cited strong growth in all regions of the world and lower prices as
the foundation of the continued surge in computer shipments, which
totaled 28.5 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer remained the world's largest PC maker with a
12.8 percent market share, although that figure was down from 13.4
percent last year. Compaq shipped 3.65 million computers during the
quarter, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast Dell Computer, the No. 2 PC company, whose sales
have grown along with the rise of Internet commerce, expanded its
market share from 8.2 percent to 10.8 percent, shipping 3.07
million computers during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the two leaders were three other computer makers based in
the United States: IBM., Hewlett-Packard and Gateway. Dataquest
analysts said that companies like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and IBM,
which have typically sold to customers indirectly, had experienced
slower growth than those like Dell specializing in direct sales
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Compaq's global leadership position, it dropped behind
Dell in sales of machines within the United States. That was a
milestone for Dell, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Dell's domestic market share rose to 17.1
percent, up from 13.4 percent a year earlier _ a growth rate of
56.5 percent. Compaq's domestic shipments, meanwhile, rose only
24.9 percent, as its United States market share edged up to 15.3
percent, from 15 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, IBM's overall market share sank to 7.6 percent, from
8.4 percent in last year's third quarter. Last week, the company
announced that it was exiting the retail market and in the future
would sell its personal computers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest said that the quarter was unusual because of the rise
of computer memory prices, a trend whose impact had been felt most
directly by Dell, but also by many of the other computer makers, in
terms of lower profits margins.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest said that Gateway's new partnership with America
Online, announced last week, was an example of a shift to a
``next-generation PC economic model,'' which would shift the
emphasis in competition beyond high inventory turnover.

   AN E-COMMERCE SITE FOR E-COMMERCE VENDORS
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce is made possible by advanced communications
services and equipment. So it is noteworthy that many of the
companies that sell those services and equipment don't rely more
heavily on e-commerce themselves. But Telezoo.com, a Web site that
began operating earlier this year, is meant to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Telezoo's main asset is a data base of nearly 20,000
communications products and services from about 300 vendors and
communications carriers. At least as important as the data base's
breadth is its format.
</P>
<P>
   Telezoo's users _ generally information technology professionals
_ are able to submit their technical requirements for a given
product and then see a list of items that might meet their needs.
Or, a potential customer can submit a request for proposals from
carriers or equipment makers. Users have been logging into Telezoo
from various countries, including Egypt, Malaysia, Germany and
Singapore _ although the biggest contract handled on the site so
far has been a $55 million deal to supply communications equipment
to a Florida company. Elias Shams, the site's co-founder, who calls
himself ``chief zookeeper,'' said the site intended to charge
vendors fixed fees for listing their products and also a percentage
of the value of deals consummated through the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to find a product when it comes to telecom, which is such
a complex industry, is a three to five months average trying to
find a switch, a router or a service,'' Shams said. ``Even after
you spend that time, 30 to 40 percent of the time you might make
the wrong decisions because you're under a lot of stress, you have
to meet deadlines. At Telezoo, as a network engineer, you say,
`Give me a router, these are my requirements' and then _ zoom,
voila, you're shown an apples-to-apples comparison and put in touch
with someone at the vendor.''

AUTHOR EXPLAINS HOW COUTURE GAVE WAY TO CLOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began in the early 1990s when companies as vast as
Pittsburgh-based aluminum company Alcoa began to allow casual
office attire. The rest is history. Dress from airplanes to good
restaurants to some workplaces degenerated to such extremes that by
February 1995, Newsweek magazine asked in a cover headline, ``Have
We Become a Nation of Slobs?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after an excessive fashion-feeding frenzy of the
1980s, the clothing consumers became enamored with the charms of
bargain shopping, boasting of finding the $20 Gap T-shirt or the $9
Target polo shirt. The trend was fueled by a wave of simple styles
that made differences between high and low couture remarkably
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   And so, writer Teri Agins declares, fashion as we knew it began
a downhill slide to its demise.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal reporter who grew up Kansas City, Kan.,
Agins argues the point in a new book, The End of Fashion: The Mass
Marketing of the Clothing Business (William Morrow &AMP; Co., $25).
</P>
<P>
   Women long ago stopped heeding the dictates of designers to
select clothes for their own needs and tastes. So in the 1999 age
of Gap, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger, Agins notes, the fashion
field is driven more by marketing than designer whims. The power is
in a logo (Hilfiger), a lifestyle image (Lauren) or a campaign that
positions a label as so cool (Old Navy and Banana Republic).
</P>
<P>
   Agins tracks some of the influential movements that have helped
to shift the industry since the time when the elite French
designers set the styles that were copied by everyone else to
today's democratized society when many designers mine ideas from
people in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what everybody's wearing,'' she says during an
interview, pulling on the sleeve of her black shell designer top
and patting her trousers. ``These happen to be Zoran but you can
get the look anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Agins, who has been covering fashion retailing for The Wall
Street Journal for more than a decade, is the daughter of Phyllis
and William Agins of Kansas City, Kan. Her mother was a reading
consultant in public high schools and her father was deputy
regional director with Consumer Products Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As she recalls, in about the ninth grade at Northwest Junior
High _ about the same time she started spelling her name with
little letters _ she began to consider journalism. She briefly
wrote a column call for the school paper called ``teri's tips for
fashion flair.'' ``The journalism teacher knew I liked clothes,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   She went to Wyandotte High School, Wellesley College in
Massachusetts and returned to the University of Missouri to study
journalism. In the summer of 1973 she had an internship at The
Kansas City Star where she wrote obituaries. ``It was a good
learning experience. You had to check every detail,'' she says. The
next year she was an intern at the Boston Globe. While at Missouri,
she also wrote her master's thesis on ``How the government controls
the press in Lima, Peru.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her early jobs was with the menswear trade journal Daily
News Record in the Chicago office. She married and for about five
years she lived in Brazil, where she taught English and wrote
free-lance articles for American newspapers. She later divorced and
in the summer of 1984 settled into her job with the Journal in New
York, covering small business. She ultimately helped develop the
fashion business beat.
</P>
<P>
   While she researched the book, her 14-month leave from the
Journal stretched into 20 months. Interviewing about 140 people,
she chose to use case studies to reflect some of the recent
struggles and evolution of the apparel industry. Asked about
surprises she encountered, she says it was mostly how people had no
qualms about canceling or postponing interviews when she was short
on time and budget.
</P>
<P>
   The book includes a chapter on Emanuel Ungaro, one of the most
successful European designers in the United States, who sold his
business to Italy's Ferragamo House in 1996. It was not a perfect
marriage, and the well-known Emanuel sportswear label ultimately
suffered losses in sales and status.
</P>
<P>
   She writes about Chicago's Marshall Field, the once preeminent
department store acquired by Dayton Hudson and thrown up against
Bloomingdale's when the trendy New York retailer entered the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the genius in marketing a fantasy lifestyle has been
Ralph Lauren, whose images of the uppercrust good life helped to
put his clothing and home products on the front burner of the
American psyche. Lauren also appropriated the American flag as a
motif and, in 1998, as a cause by donating $13 million for the
restoration of the original star-spangled banner.
</P>
<P>
   His charity only intensified the hostile competition between
Lauren and Hilfiger, who has found inspiration not only in the flag
but also apparently in several other marketing ploys identified
with Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Agins writes about how Giorgio Armani introduced the first
unstructured jacket for men and women and decidedly influenced the
shape of menswear in the 1980s. But equally noteworthy, Armani was
well ahead of the curve when he first used celebrities to showcase
his clothes, starting with Richard Gere in the 1980 film ``The
American Gigolo.'' (An excerpt of the Armani chapter was rewritten
for the Journal in mid-September.)
</P>
<P>
   Armani was the first to hire a West Coast public relations
representative _ Wanda McDaniel, a close friend of Maria Shriver's
who was recommended to Armani by Shriver's aunt's sister, Lee
Radziwill.
</P>
<P>
   One of McDaniel's accomplishments was bringing Lakers coach and
Armani customer Pat Riley into the fold as a highly visible Armani
billboard. He and his wife were given an Armani wardrobe each year
and, pacing at courtside, he set a stylish pace for sports
commentators, coaches and basketball fans who wanted to dress like
him.
</P>
<P>
   The book is not necessarily an insider's story. Agins'
background information is well-developed. And the account may
actually be most interesting to readers outside the industry's
inner circles.

NEW MUSIC-TRIVIA SHOW ENCOURAGES WEB AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By EVELYN ELLISON TWITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the media industry's latest attempt to attain true
convergence of television and the Internet, MTV plans to start a
music-trivia game show in which viewers can play along by logging
onto MTV's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The program, ``Web Riot,'' has its debut late next month, but
MTV plans to begin ramping up promotion for it Monday and to let
potential players begin downloading the requisite PC software from
the MTV.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As MTV prepares for the program's premiere on Nov. 29, media
executives _ particularly advertisers _ will be waiting for MTV to
prove that the time for convergence has finally arrived _ even if
the estimated 44 percent of American households with Internet
access is still far below the nearly 80 percent that subscribe to
cable or satellite television services that carry MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can give us a good indication of the realities of
multitasking,'' said Bill Cella, executive vice president for
broadcasting and programming with the advertising firm of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 percent of U.S. households have a television and
personal computer in the same room, according to a survey of 1,166
households released in June 1999 by Paul Kagan Associates, a media
research and consulting firm. The survey was conducted with
Showtime Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   During the half-hour program each weekday afternoon, up to
25,000 ``Web Riot'' viewers, watching both their television and
personal computer screens, will be able to play along with four
on-air contestants.
</P>
<P>
   MTV will show clips from music videos and then multiple-choice
questions on television. Participants at home will use the numbers
on their computoard to log their answers.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the game, the show will scroll the player
nicknames of the top 10 online contestants across the television,
and they will win prizes.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, a division of Viacom Inc., considers itself well positioned
to test this approach to convergence because of the demographic
profile of its audience: people 12 to 34 years old. (For legal
reasons, MTV is requiring viewers to be at least 13 years old to
play.)
</P>
<P>
   MTV's research indicates that 51 percent of its audience members
between 12 and 24 years old have Internet access, compared with 43
percent of the general public in that age group, and that many of
the networks' viewers often watch the cable channel while surfing
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two experiences seem to live comfortably together in
their lives,'' said Judy McGrath, president of MTV. ``So this is
the first time we're going to really try to shake that notion and
see if it's true in a very real way.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV is not the only company trying to make convergence work.
Since September, angling for a different demographic segment, Walt
Disney Company's ABC and ESPN networks have been offering Enhanced
TV, an online complement to the networks' coverage of National
Football League games. While watching the televised game on ESPN or
ABC, a viewer can also log onto the ESPN.com, ABC.com or NFL.com
Web sites for various forms of audience participation.
</P>
<P>
   One feature allows fans to predict the ball handler before each
live play from scrimmage. Players can compare their scores with
those of others nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Web Riot'' is successful, it could spur other television
game shows to create interactive components. ABC, for example, is
already exploring online options for its hit quiz show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire?,'' said Jonathan Leess, vice president of
enhanced television at Buena Vista Internet Group, Disney's
Internet division.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MTV has been dabbling in convergent programming for more than
three years. The discontinued ``Yak Live,'' for example, allowed
viewers to chat online about videos as they played on television
and scrolled their conversations across the TV screen. Last May,
the network held a charity auction that was conducted on the Ebay
Web site but was coordinated with televised programming.
</P>
<P>
   MTV plans to place ``Web RIOT'' at 5 p.m. on weekdays, right
after the network's popular ``Total Request Live,'' a daily
countdown of the top videos as chosen by viewers who have voted by
telephone and on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The host for the new show will be Ahmet Zappa, who in the past
has been co-host for ``MTV Live'' and USA Network's ``Happy Hour''
with his brother, Dweezil Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's technology partner is Spiderdance Inc., an Internet media
company that creates mass-participation online programming, to
synchronize answers on television and computer screens. No special
software, beyond a standard Web browser, is required.
</P>
<P>
   If it catches on, combining television programming with an
Internet component, holds various implications. Advertisers, for
example, might benefit from the apparent ease of pushing consumers
to Internet links where they can register their interest or
immediately buy a product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents the product in a seamless manner,'' said Kristian
Magel, vice president for national broadcasting at Dewitt Media
Inc., who advised the automaker BMW to buy a banner ad on ESPN's
online program during ``Sunday Night Football.'' With an online ad
costing less than 1 percent of a television spot, Magel said, the
thinking was ``why not just do it?''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Web interaction gives television programmers and
their advertisers a wealth of information about viewers who
participate, including how long and how often they visit the site,
whether they click on ads and whether they make purchases online.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great boons of interactive media is that marketers
can learn a lot more about their customers than they ever could
before,'' said Aram Sinnreich, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   MTV says it intends to collect only the first names, ages and
e-mail addresses of contestants, but will also gather the addresses
and phone numbers of the prize winners.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to the privacy implications, the company does not plan
to sell this information to outsiders, said Rick Holzman, vice
president for programming and promotion at MTV Interactive Online.
</P>
<P>
   ```Web Riot' is just another way to get people to interact with
our brands in a meaningful way,'' he said.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INTERNET ECONOMY GROWS ON PLANS, NOT PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The desire to cash out big is not a new motivating force in the
technology industry. But what is striking about today's Internet
economy is how much of that money lust is focused on selling
business plans for their own sake, rather than planning viable
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This trend may have already sown the seeds of its own demise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it `the millennial pause,''' said Richard Miller, a
veteran Silicon Valley strategist and investor who is distressed at
the frenetic coupling of people with half-baked ideas and those
with an overabundance of money to finance them. ``It's the
industry's saturnalia.''
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Rome, the seven-day festival honoring the god Saturn
took place at the end of each year. Its ostensible purpose was to
pause long enough to resynchronize the lunar and solar calendars.
But in fact, it was a lengthy debauch during which Romans
enthusiastically engaged in all manner of licentious and excessive
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   What one considers licentious in the networked economy is a
matter of personal taste, of course. But excessive _ that is
something everyone apparently agrees on these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``MBAs aren't going to class anymore; they're taking two-year
sabbaticals to write business plans,'' said Ann Winblad of Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Her firm has reviewed as many as 1,000 business plans in a
single month, and looks at 5,000 to 7,000 of them a year.
``Business school has become business-plan school,'' she said.
``Students go there, find a team and start creating a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, precious few are the next Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming flood of plans are ``products for Wall Street,
not real businesses,'' said Yogen Dalal, a general partner with the
Mayfield Fund venture firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities we're seeing today are a real
disappointment,'' agreed William Davidow, a 20-year veteran of the
venture game and a general partner at Mohr, Davidow Ventures in
Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies being founded today don't even have a single
product,'' Davidow added. ``I know a guy on the board of a company
where the engineering manager was quitting. The company was public,
but the product hadn't shipped yet. The engineer had already vested
1 percent of his stock, and had done the same thing at four
companies in a row. He never completed a single project in any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, so one company hired the wrong guy. OK, so maybe
four companies hired the wrong guy. Cry me a river, right? Who is
really hurt?
</P>
<P>
   In a market flooded with easy money and profit taking, victims
are hard to find. But as Wall Street and individual investors
continue their process of reality checking the true worth of
Internet companies, some industry executives believe that the
flakiness of the work force is only one reason to believe that the
entire Internet economy is becoming a giant Ponzi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the description appears to fit. In today's well-known
Internet ``business'' model, the equation is that some venture
capitalists are willing to give, say, $1 for a dot-com's 75 cents
of value.
</P>
<P>
   A dot-com's first round of venture money might be $1 million. A
second round could be $10 million. The final, pre-IPO investment
might be $30 million _ then it goes to the public market to be
valued at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable example of overvaluation is Blue Mountain Arts, the
greeting-card Web site with a $1 billion valuation, 10 million
users and virtually no revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Just as ``every success sows the seeds of its own destruction,''
said Davidow, the very interconnectedness of the Internet, which
created such incredible opportunity, has also created the massive
instability in the economy that it has spawned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet creates vast amounts of `near-money,''' he said.
``Near-money tends to be things that can be translated into money
very quickly. Where it used to be that it was very expensive to
sell stocks, for example, and it took time to sell them, what the
Internet has changed is that stocks are now near-money _ you can
sell them very quickly; they're extremely liquid.''
</P>
<P>
   This change, Davidow asserted, is one of the reasons Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is concerned about the
tremendous overvaluation of the stock market. ``All these
institutions had physical constraints on the speed at which money
moved through the system,'' he said. ``When that constraint is
gone, stock equals money, and the method that you once used to
control the money supply is gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the ability of entrepreneurs and investors to
pull cash out of companies quickly and with impunity may soon begin
to crumple those Internet businesses that can no longer get free
money from investors or the public markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies have voracious, unsustainable cash
requirements,'' Davidow said. ``And their business models are based
on cash being available. It's not a even a Ponzi scheme, because
there's nothing downstream to pay off the investors.''
</P>
<P>
   And by nature of their interconnections _ Internet businesses
are nothing if not linked to each other, by their swapping of
advertising ``revenue,'' their reliance on each other to drive each
other's businesses, their critical need for cash to acquire
customers _ a few crumpled companies could quickly turn into a big
tumble for the successful businesses in the networked economy.
</P>
<P>
   As one investor put it, ``The point is that they will pull down
the good companies with them.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the millennial pause.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: SOME PRODUCT REVIEWS ON WEB BRING ADVICE FROM 
ANYONE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, advice on consumer purchasing decisions has been
the province of print publications like Consumer Reports, PC
Magazine or Car and Driver. While many of these publications have
moved their content online, the growth of the Web has empowered
another source of buying advice: the neighbor, cousin or uncle who
just bought a particular item and is more than willing to share an
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers and some publishers have already capitalized
on this instinct by allowing users to post opinions about products
the companies sell or review. But a handful of companies are hoping
to take the age-old effectiveness of word-of-mouth recommendations
one step further, by creating independent Web sites that give
common folks and bona fide experts a forum for their opinions and
users a way to rate the pundits. While some of these sites are
charging users for qualified help, most are looking for more
creative ways to balance their books and keep users coming to the
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company that has generated the most recent buzz around this
idea is Epinions, which was started in the summer by several
well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists. It is not the first
company to provide users with opinions on what to buy, but it has
been a force behind some changes in how these sites approach their
business.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of the Epinions service, for instance, is that
it both rewards and rates product reviewers, in hopes of giving
them enough incentive to provide useful opinions. Anyone can sign
up to give advice on products that fit into the site's 12
categories, and prospective shoppers can browse through the reviews
and rate them on a scale from ``not useful'' to ``very useful.'' To
build credibility _ and eliminate suspicions that they are merely
company shills in disguise _ advisers can build a page on the site
with photos and personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff is aimed at both the reviewer's wallet and ego.
Reviewers earn royalties of from one to three dollars for every 10
times their review is read by an Epinions member, and their picture
might be featured on the front page of the site if their reviews
are widely read.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nirav Tolia, a company co-founder, the site relies
on a so-called ``web of trust'' in which users, reviewers and
advisers tend over time to be matched up with people whose opinions
they have come to trust. ``It mimics the way word-of-mouth works in
the real world,'' Tolia said.
</P>
<P>
   When word-of-mouth recommendations result in a sale, Epinions
earns an undisclosed referral fee from merchants who pay to have
links displayed in areas where their product categories are
discussed. Epinions also earns money by displaying banner
advertisements on its pages, and can charge higher advertising
rates than general information sites _ between $30 and $70 for
every thousand banner ads displayed _ since advertisers know they
are reaching buyers more qualified than the general surfing public.
</P>
<P>
   Tolia said the company also earned money by licensing its
service to other e-commerce sites like Lycos, which included the
Epinions service in the new Lycoshop. ``It's hard to find people
who've actually walked the same path you're walking when you're
looking for a product,'' said Jeff Bennett, vice president for
e-commerce at Lycos. ``Epinions is very good when it comes to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like Productopia.com and Deja.com, have offered
recommendations from users for months, building expansive archives
of reviews across hundreds of categories of goods. But those sites
do not compensate contributors for their opinions _ at least not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Phillips, Deja.com's chief executive, said the company
planned to use both a rating and a reward system for reviewers in
the near future. The reward system ``could involve ego
gratification,'' he said, rather than financial incentives.
``There's a way to do both successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Neal, Productopia's chief executive, said his company had
no plans to compensate consumers who post reviews, since it already
pays professional product reviewers to post recommendations on its
site. ``We'd rather have people doing it for the normal reasons
they post on message boards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One question about the business model of these sites is whether
the quality of the user reviews is enough to attract a lot of
visitors on an ongoing basis. Phillips, of Deja.com, acknowledged
that the responses can be mixed, but said the current quality of
reviews on his site ``is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly get some three-word reviews that are insipid,''
he said, ``but anyone who's put any effort into it usually has
something worthwhile to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is objectivity. These sites purport to be more
objective than retailers that offer user opinions. But some
question whether sites that accept commissions, referral fees or
advertising can deliver worthwhile information, even if it is
provided by individuals with no vested interest in the products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since these sites derive revenue from transactions that result
from people responding to an opinion, it ultimately raises a
question of bias,'' said Andrew Bartels, an e-commerce analyst with
Giga Information Group, a consulting firm. Unscrupulous sites could
prominently display reviews that favor certain products, for
instance, and gain higher transaction fees for those products. ``It
could be that the only way to get true, unbiased opinions is for
users to pay for it,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, of Deja.com, disagrees. ``I don't buy that
argument,'' he said. ``We have no incentive to do anything except
try to make this valuable for consumers. The primary relationships
we have are with marketers who sell all of the products across a
category, so we don't do any better on one product versus
another.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one company is betting that consumers are willing to
pay for advice, although the services offered generally do not
focus on purchase decisions. Exp.com, introduced last month,
enables consumers to buy advice and services on topics ranging from
career planning and tax shelters to what type of roses to plant.
According to Mark Benning, the company's president, the site allows
users to rate the performance of its advisers, and takes a 20
percent cut of whatever the advisers charge.
</P>
<P>
   The service is unusual in that users contact the expert with a
specific question or request, and negotiate a fee before the advice
is given. ``So they get a much more personalized response,''
Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the arrangement will pay
off for those who offer their services for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Walworth, for instance, is a horticulture consultant and
columnist in Idaho who joined Exp.com in the late summer. She said
demand has been light, even though she often charges as little as
$5 for a short consultation _ and sometimes gives flower-buying
advice for free. ``Let's be real here: At that rate, I'm not going
to Europe any time soon,'' she said. ``But I got into this business
to help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Exp.com's motives, on the other hand, are decidedly more
profit-minded. Benning said he was optimistic that the company
could operate in the black, given what he has seen so far. ``We've
done thousands of transactions in just a month,'' he said. ``We're
pretty pleased with that.''

RX FOR Y2K: GO INTO HIDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What if you haven't been keeping up to date
with Windows 95 Y2K updates? I went to Microsoft's site to see what
was available, and there was quite a long list. Do I need to
install all of them?
</P>
<P>
   _ Millennium Bugged
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BUGGED: Don't you have enough to worry about without all
this Y2K mess? You don't make enough money, you're getting older,
you're not living up to your potential, and you have the fashion
sense of Andy Kaufman. At least that's what Momma Bombay keeps
telling me. So how much worse could things get if you do absolutely
nothing to prepare for 2000?
</P>
<P>
   It's not like you're an air-traffic controller. You might have a
little trouble balancing your checkbook _ as if that's anything new
_ but you won't be steering any 767s. Relax. All versions of
Windows 95 and 98 are 2000-compliant, meaning they won't think 2000
is really 1900 and refuse to let you play Quake III because you
haven't been born yet.
</P>
<P>
   True, since the first release of Windows 95, there have been
about a jillion service packs (Microsoft-ese for ``bug fixes'').
That's understandable. There are tens of millions of lines of
computer code in Windows, and bugs happen. Who knows? Maybe the
cafeteria was out of Jolt cola the day they wrote line 4,837,382.
At least Microsoft is good about making patches easily available.
Trouble is, you have to keep up with them, or you get way behind
way fast.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to avoid the hassle of catching up piecemeal, go
plunk down 75 bucks for Windows 98 Second Edition. After
installation, the Windows Update feature can take you directly to
an upgrade download center, where a very curious program will delve
deep into your computer's darkest recesses to see what else you
might need.
</P>
<P>
   Bet you thought you were done. Not by a long shot. Windows is
the least of your worries. The real problems are likely to come
from your older applications _ word processors, checkbook programs,
Reader Rabbit, whatever _ and the startup chip on your computer's
motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Go to 
download.microsoft.com/download/win2000pro/Install/2.0/WIN98/EN-US/y
 2k.exe to start downloading Microsoft's Y2K Product Analyzer, or
just poke around their download center until you find it. Running
it tells you if Windows and your Microsoft stuff are compliant. The
report has hyperlinks to technical help.
</P>
<P>
   If everything checks out, you still need to examine your other
apps and that chip, called the BIOS (don't ask _ geeks just like
acronyms). Get the 2000 Toolbox from www.mcafee.com. It's a
try-before-you-buy download, which seems pretty silly, since after
the first time you try it you won't need to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these programs will fix all potential problems, but
at least they'll point them out for you. If you've got BIOS
trouble, go to your manufacturer's site and see if it has an update
to fix the chip. If not, you'll need to find a software utility
that will interpret what your BIOS thinks at boot time into
something that will work after Dec. 31. Try cruising shareware
sites like www.shareware.com or maybe www.hotfiles.com and do a
search for ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Or do what I intend to do: Hide in a cave without electricity or
running water until all the Y2K consultants find new jobs.
</P>

INTERNET ECONOMY TO TOP $500 BILLION IN 1999
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The booming Internet economy has grown ``at an
astounding rate'' of 68 percent since last year and is on track to
generate $507 billion in revenue this year, University of Texas
researchers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the overall economy grows at (an annual rate of) 4
percent, we'd say it's 'hot,' `` Anitesh Barua, associate director
of the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce at the
university's Graduate School of Business, noted Tuesday. He is the
co-author of the study along with the center's director, Andrew
Whinston.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet makes up only a small part of the nation's $8
trillion economy, the study suggests it has surpassed such
traditional sectors as automobiles telecommunications and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers,'' Barua said in an interview here, ``suggest
that we are finally seeing some of the payoffs from having built
out the Internet infrastructure _ and it's still going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid rise was led by electronic commerce, whose revenues
rose 127 percent from $16.5 billion in the first quarter of 1998 to
$37.5 billion in the same quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the Internet accounted for 2.3 million
jobs in the first quarter of 1999, up from 1.5 million a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing these increases even though we do not as yet
have widespread use of broadband Internet technology,'' Barua said.
``Nevertheless, the commerce layer (of the Internet) is going
through the roof, and that's a very good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not suggesting that all of the security hurdles have
been overcome,'' he added. ``But the fear of the unknown is by and
large gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The next big online breakthrough may come through expanded use
of ``smart'' telephones, the Austin-based researchers suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are familiar with wireless devices and will use them to
buy things on the Internet, schedule their flights and so forth,''
said Whinston. ``To many people, it's something that doesn't seem
to be a computer. It's more like a telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whinston and Barua compiled their results by observing 3,400
U.S. companies that generate all or part of their revenues from
Internet products or services. Some of their data was gleaned using
reports from research companies, financial reports and the Web
sites of 350 of the largest firms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's findings update an initial report issued in June and
paid for by Cisco Systems. That study found the Internet accounted
for $301 billion in revenue in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shapiro, an undersecretary at the U.S. Commerce
Department, said the Internet is growing so fast because ``it is a
potentially incredibly efficient way to reach an enormous market.''
</P>
<P>
   He viewed University of Texas study as a useful, if broad,
measure of current trends. Both the Census Bureau and the Bureau of
Economic Analysis _ arms of the Commerce Department _ produce
measures of e-commerce activity that track closely with the Austin
results. The department plans to issue its first measure of
e-commerce retail trade early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers divided the Internet into four layers:
infrastructure, applications, intermediaries and commerce. They
view the interplay of these layers as the Internet ``ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   All four layers exhibited strong growth since early 1998. Total
revenue from the infrastructure and applications layers came to $63
billion in the first quarter of this year, while the intermediary
and commerce layers contributed $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After correcting for overlapping factors, the study pegged
Internet revenues in the first quarter at $108 billion, a 68
percent leap from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   As defined by the researchers, the Internet economy is made up
of companies that generate all or part of their revenues from
Internet-related products and services, such as Cisco, Dell
Computer Corp. and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To this group, they add both pure Internet sellers such as
Amazon.com and eToys.com and the cyberspace business of such
traditional companies as L.L. Bean and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The complete updated 95-page study is available on line at www.
internetindicators.com.

NETSCAPE COFOUNDER TO HEAD INTERNET SOFTWARE START UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For some people in Silicon Valley, the garage
still holds more allure than the board room.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Andreessen, a cofounder of Netscape Communications Corp.,
announced Tuesday that he would be the founding chairman of
Loudcloud Inc., a Menlo Park, Calif.-based company that is, for the
time being, housed in a single warehouse-like room. The company
will develop software to help companies get their businesses on the
Internet quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to head a startup, Andreessen is eschewing both his
recent corporate role as chief technology officer of America
Online, which acquired Netscape last year, and the currently
popular career route for successful entrepreneurs: becoming a
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Andreessen said he was reveling in
being back in a world that was closer to the legendary Silicon
Valley garages in which Hewlett Packard and Apple Computer were
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that we're cheap and we're proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, who is 28 and whose personal wealth has been
estimated at several hundred million dollars, said he had located
his new startup in an extra room at a semiconductor equipment
company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company so far is self-financed. Its management team
consists of three Netscape veterans: Ben Horowitz as chief
executive officer, Timothy Howes as chief technology officer and In
Sik Rhee as chief strategist. Andreessen will be the full-time
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had flirted with several offers to become a venture
capitalist but had ultimately rejected that path in favor of
hands-on entrepreneurism because ``I think it would get very
frustrating only being able to get so far involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Andreessen's decision to take an operating role comes at
a time when many of the Valley's venture capital firms have been
bemoaning a dearth of experienced managers in technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real issue in finding a good CEO,'' said Joe
Schoendorf, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``At the end of the day, you still have to run a business.
We love great ideas, but if we look at our top 10 successes, in
each case they are ones which have been started by great management
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Loudcloud is almost certain to have major competitors, perhaps
including giants like IBM Corp. and Microsoft Corp. But Andreessen
said he believed that the explosive growth of Internet commerce
would only accelerate the market for Loudcloud's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen said that more detailed announcements about the
company's strategy, products and customers would be made early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our DNA is going to be software,'' he said. ``We're not going
to be consultants, and we're not going to build Internet data
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he predicted that the traditional software
industry would face increasingly perilous times as the Internet
changes the way software is, purchased, used and distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software will become more important in the future, but at the
same time, the software industry will be less so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his new start-up venture, Andreessen said he had
made investments in two other start-up ventures: ReplayTV, a
digital television recording system, and Accompany, Inc. an
Internet consumer purchasing company.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen stepped down as America Online's chief technology
officer in September, seven months after the company acquired
Netscape.

THE HECTIC PACE OF HIGH-TECH WORKWEEK IS SLOWING FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May 1994, Jeff Treuhaft, 25, joined a little Silicon Valley
start-up called Mosaic, later to be renamed Netscape Communications
Corp. The pace was brutal _ 18 hours a day, seven days a week in
the early months _ but the work was exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The really tough part was that my son was 9 weeks old when I
started at Netscape,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Treuhaft has two more children and a tidy nest
egg from the sale of Netscape this year to America Online. Like
many former Netscape executives, he is stepping back from the front
lines of the Internet business, working part time as an investor
and adviser to a few start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Treuhaft finds himself free to play with his children,
feed them lunch, even tag along on a school field trip to the
pumpkin patch down the road. ``It seems mundane stuff,'' he said,
``but when you finally get a chance to do it, you appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, Netscape's main rival in the infamous Internet
browser battle, some have made similar personal choices. Brad
Silverberg, a former senior vice president, took a sabbatical in
the summer of 1997 to decompress after directing Microsoft's
hurried march to catch up and then gain leadership in the Internet
software business. He took a solo bicycle trip through the Canadian
Rockies, spent time with his wife and two children and thought
about all the personal things that had been shunted aside for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is the one thing you cannot get back,'' said Silverberg,
45, who now works part time as an investor and adviser to
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off choices made in so many American households of
personal life vs. work, time vs. money, are magnified in the
Internet economy. The time pressure is so intense because a lead of
just a few weeks or months over a rival can be a huge competitive
advantage in the Internet land rush. And the financial rewards for
the front-runners can be astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Internet is going to be a transforming technology,
like electricity, it must spread throughout the economy and
society, as it finds new uses and new customers.
</P>
<P>
   That process, inevitably, will take time. It means carefully
building big Internet businesses, not just starting them. Internet
``cruising speed'' will become a valued skill and a competitive
edge.
</P>
<P>
   For both companies and individuals, that means pacing, in one
way or another, in a race that is becoming more a marathon and less
a sprint. As the Internet economy matures, high-technology
companies are expanding programs and policies intended to help
harried workers balance their personal lives and the demands of
work. A greater use of flexible hours, part-time work, day care,
sabbaticals and longer vacations are all part of that effort.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Radford division of the benefits firm Aon
Consulting, average vacation time offered by high-technology
companies has steadily increased in recent years. Forty-one percent
even offer full vacation benefits to new recruits during their
first year of employment, and 10 percent of Silicon Valley
companies now offer sabbaticals, Radford reports.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, for example, gives all new hires four weeks of
vacation at the start. After surveying its employees last year,
Cisco is building a day-care center on its corporate campus in San
Jose. ``We found supply was low, demand was high and more and more
high-tech companies are doing something in child care,'' explained
Peggy Lynch, manager of benefits for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, IBM introduced a program allowing people to work
part time while still getting the benefits and opportunities of
full-time employees. One person in the program is Marie Wieck,
director of XML technology, a hot new field of Internet software
programming. Ms. Wieck, 39, works 32 hours a week now instead of
the 60 that she used to. She still travels, but she typically is in
the office only three days a week, giving her more time to spend
with her two young daughters. ``I'll keep doing this as long as it
makes sense both for the business and for me,'' Ms. Wieck said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in Internet start-ups, not established companies,
where the work regimen is the most grueling. The hours are still
long in today's second-generation Internet start-ups, but the
perspective of the young programming whizzes does seem to have
changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Montulli, 29, was one of the first engineers at Netscape.
After Netscape was sold, he moved on to another Internet start-up,
Epinions.com. ``I really like the energy of a start-up,'' he said,
``because it's an environment where you can really make a
difference as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Montulli is working 70-hour weeks instead of the
120 hours he often did at Netscape _ a single-minded commitment to
work that he acknowledges contributed to the break-up of his
marriage to the daughter of Jim Clark, a co-founder of Netscape.
``I'm just not emotionally equipped to work like that anymore,'' he
said. ``I have a life.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with children, however, 70-hour workweeks may not be
their idea of balancing work and personal lives. And the
stock-option wealth created by many high-technology companies has
given people like Treuhaft and Silverberg the financial freedom to
do what they call ``serial balancing'' _ shifting from stints of
intense work to time off or part-time work, and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance is a very difficult thing to achieve, at least in
parallel,'' Silverberg said. ``To achieve great things in one's
career typically takes a tremendous amount of focus and dedication.
I've tried to achieve balance in a more serial way, so that
hopefully it will even out over the long haul. And thanks to
Microsoft, I have the freedom to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, Treuhaft takes a similar approach to his
period of part-time work, viewing it as a recess. ``I don't think
I'd call this my career,'' he said. ``It's more catching my breath,
while still pedaling the bicycle.''

NEW ALLIANCE WILL PROMOTE WIRELESS ACCESS TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of leading technology companies said Monday that they
would form an alliance to create products that would allow
consumers to get high-speed Internet access through a wireless
system within the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium _ which is led by Cisco Systems Inc., the giant
Internet networking company, and Motorola Inc., the maker of
wireless telephone products _ is essentially backing an alternative
to delivering broadband Internet access through underground cables
and wires.
</P>
<P>
   The race to bring broadband Internet access to consumers has led
to several alliances that promise to deliver that kind of service
through satellites, cellular telephone networks and standard cable
and telephone lines. Now, the group headed by Cisco and Motorola is
trying to provide a cheaper and more effective solution to digging
up the ground and laying cables: They want to deliver data, voice
and video services over the airwaves and directly into buildings
and homes that are affixed with antennas or the equivalent of a
satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the technology that is going to take the fixed
broadband wireless market into the next millennium,'' said Steve
Smith, director of marketing in the broadband wireless business
unit at Cisco Systems, which is based in San Jose, Calif. ``This
gets consumers Internet access without tearing up the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Cisco Systems said Monday that a group of 10
companies _Motorola, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Bechtel
Telecommunications, Samsung, Toshiba, LCC International, EDS, KPMG
Consulting and Pace Microtechnology _ had agreed to create and
develop products that use a Cisco technology, one that is equipped
to deliver Internet service over a radio frequency called MMDS.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the AT&AMP;T Corp. was moving into cable television and
developing a system capable of delivering high-speed Internet
access through its cable services, MCI Worldcom and Sprint have
spent about $1 billion in the last few years to buy many of the
companies that owned the licenses to the MMDS radio spectrum. Three
weeks ago, MCI Worldcom agreed to acquire Sprint in a $115 billion
merger.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is successful, it appears that Internet
service providers will be able to choose among cable operators,
wireless service providers and perhaps even satellite operators
like Teledesic LLC, which is developing a kind of ``Internet in the
Sky'' technology, a multibillion-dollar plan backed by the cellular
telephone pioneer Craig McCaw and William H. Gates of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and Motorola are also backing something called
LMDS, which is another radio frequency that offers broadband
access, mostly to businesses. According to Cisco officials,
however, the MMDS system is more effective in crowded urban areas
and is more easily available to everyday consumers and the mass
market.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards, a spokesman at Motorola, which is based in
Schaumburg, Ill., said Monday that the company was backing both the
LMDS and MMDS technologies and working to develop a large portfolio
of offerings so that big technology companies and consumers could
have a wide range of alternatives to getting broadband access.
</P>
<P>
   The companies involved in the agreement Monday said that the
ability to deliver high-speed broadband access through a wireless
system would also rapidly accelerate the introduction of broadband
services to rural areas and urban centers, and do so more easily
and inexpensively.

HOUSE BACKS CLINTON PLAN TO BAN INTERNET TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seldom do House Republicans and President Clinton
agree on anything these days.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the House voted 423 to 1 to endorse a key White
House objective heading into a new round of global trade talks next
month: a worldwide ban on Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has little substantive effect, merely voicing a ``sense
of the Congress.'' But it signals a GOP embrace of what could prove
the most far-reaching policy of the Clinton administration, which
has set out to make the Internet a ``global free-trade zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible to me that we can have essentially a unanimous
vote on such a sturdy policy of no taxes in America or around the
world on e-commerce,'' said Chris Cox, the conservative Newport
Beach Republican who sponsored the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious White House agenda, first outlined two years ago
as a ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,'' amounts to a
free-market manifesto calling on governments to forgo regulation
and taxation of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Internet has such explosive potential for
prosperity, it should be a global free-trade zone,'' Clinton
declared at the time, ``a place where government makes every effort
first ... to do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who also authored last year's Internet Tax Freedom Act that
imposed a three-year moratorium on domestic Internet taxes, said in
an interview that the idea is one area where he fully agrees with
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the administration's Internet policy was developed
by former White House policy guru Ira Magaziner, who devised the
complex health care plan that nearly sank Clinton's first term and
helped usher in the GOP congressional majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undoubtedly the case that Ira learned from the health
care task force how not to develop a legislative program,'' Cox
said, calling Magaziner's Internet framework ``an excellent
product.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Magaziner left the White House, Cox said, no one is
clearly in charge of Internet policy, and the administration has
not ``shown sufficient support for a permanent ban'' on e-commerce
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``However the administration thinking may be developing on this,
it is opaque,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky
sharply disagreed, saying top officials ``are strongly on record''
advocating ``duty-free cyberspace. It's one of our strongest
messages and one of our firm commitments for the new round of
negotiations. We would take issue with anyone who says that we
haven't made that abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's urging, the World Trade Organization, the group of
135 countries whose trade ministers will meet in Seattle, already
agreed in May 1998 to a moratorium on electronic transmission
taxes, such as the recent U.N. proposal for a so-called ``bit tax''
on e-mails and other electronic data sent over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. idea was quickly shot down, and it is widely expected
that that WTO moratorium will be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   But once talks get beyond simple transmission taxes, the issues
surrounding Internet trade become hotly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to handle the problem of digital products'' in the
Seattle talks, Barshevsky said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   These can include Internet-downloaded software, movies, stock
trading, banking and professional services such as law,
architecture and consulting _ areas where the United States has a
commanding export advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous field, and WTO rules with respect to
digitized content are not clear,'' Barshevsky said. Rules on
patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property
sent over the Internet also have to be clarified, she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaron, the undersecretary for international trade at the
Department of Commerce, warned last week that the European Union
has made its support for the tax moratorium contingent on nine
other items that ``could pave the way for duties in the future,''
including labeling all electronic deliveries as ``services,'' to
permit trade restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The area of Internet content is even murkier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French and Canadians are already arguing that cultural
industries should be exempt'' from any moratorium, including music,
television and movies, said Tim Bennett, vice president for trade
at the American Electronics Association.
</P>
<P>
   sh1 Local Taxes Possible
</P>
<P>
   Even if national governments forgo e-commerce taxes, their own
localities may not. U.S. state governors continue to press hard for
the authority to impose sales taxes on interstate e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Cox issued a blunt warning to the Advisory Commission on
Electronic Commerce, which was established by his legislation.
``It's an advisory commission; it will only give us advice,'' Cox
said. ``So the real question is what would happen if they
recommended taxing the Internet, and I can tell you the answer: It
would die a horrible death in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While no country imposes taxes on e-commerce, Cox maintained
that governments will try. ``Birds fly, fish swim, and government
taxes and regulates,'' Cox said, adding that his domestic
moratorium demonstrated that it is easier to prevent taxes than to
roll them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has been to occupy the field with a policy
prescription that says this is off limits,'' he said. ``If we had
waited until this became pandemic, then the forces of the political
status quo would have overwhelmed us.''

PAINT YOURSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. - This is a story about painting, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   It's about tapping into the artist within us all, about freedom,
self-expression and living in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It's about people _ young, older, middle-aged _ who have rarely
if ever painted artistically in their adult lives and who, for the
most part, know diddly about painting. But what they do know is
that somewhere deep inside themselves or just shimmering beneath
the surface is a creative spirit pressing to burst out.
</P>
<P>
   So with their souls shouting, ``Let me play!'' or whispering
``Feed me,'' they come each week to a place in Lawrence to let
their souls hang out in color. They come to a
garage-turned-color-splashed-work-space behind Sarah Oblinger's
stone home where, for the better part of five years, the
47-year-old artist has run the ``Paint or Die Studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Paint or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Its name is both personal and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Personal because, as Oblinger tells it, when she began painting
_ which she didn't do until her 30s _ it not only helped turn
around her depressed life but also saved it. (We'll get back to
that later.)
</P>
<P>
   And symbolic because, as Oblinger sees it, life and creativity
are inseparable. We are all artists, she believes. To deny the art
within us is to deny a vital and expressive part of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that creativity is alive in all of us,'' Oblinger said
on a recent Wednesday morning as sunlight streamed through her
studio door, and one by one the morning's seven students _ all
women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s _ began wandering in for the 10
a.m. session.
</P>
<P>
   At 47, Oblinger is petite and lissome. Dressed in soft,
loose-fitting clothes _ a flannel shirt worn open over a T-shirt
and baggy pants _ she moves in a fluid and relaxed manner. She
walks with the quiet ease of a yoga instructor. Her dark hair is
cut peach-fuzz short. With her oval wire-rimmed glasses, she
radiates the look and calm of a Buddhist monk.
</P>
<P>
   Her studio smells like kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are white but are smattered with so much paint they
look like Jackson Pollock canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Bright shop lights dangle from the ceiling. At the center of the
room, 30 cups of tempera paints, the kind used in grade school, are
lined up in six rows on a narrow rectangular table. Inside, thick
luminescent pools of green, blue, red, yellow, orange, violet,
umber, black, white and burgundy hues shimmer under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the table, wads of paintbrushes sprout like floral
arrangements from clear Mason jars.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after they enter, the students begin.
</P>
<P>
   There is no talking. No music. No subjects. This is painting
from the imagination. Clear your mind, Oblinger will tell her
students. Let the painting grow from the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The only sound for 21/2 hours is that of birds chirping and of
swishing and tapping on sheaves of thick paper, as the students
start fresh paintings or work on old.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts you back in touch with a vital part of who you are,''
Oblinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Facilitator
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to think of students in any of Oblinger's weekly
classes as art students would be as wrong as thinking of Oblinger
as an art instructor or as the classes as art classes.
</P>
<P>
   Oblinger is fast to admit she is not teaching students how to
paint. She is teaching them that they can already paint _ that
inside every individual are 10,000 and 10,000 more images of
shocking, heavenly, phantasmagoric and even hideous beauty.
</P>
<P>
   And the key, the tough part, is to quiet the inner critic. To
muffle the noxious voice of the second-grade teacher who
``corrected'' your drawing, who told you cows aren't purple, your
lines aren't straight and that humans don't have eight heads.
</P>
<P>
   The key is to silence the judgment that your sister got the
talent while your gifts are different.
</P>
<P>
   The key, the bravest thing to do, is to just pick up a brush,
dip it in paint and let it flow.
</P>
<P>
   Exist in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think about painting pretty pictures. Or about what you
should paint or what your painting ought to look like.
</P>
<P>
   Let go. Let your expressive impulses guide you. So if you're
compelled to paint blue snake heads with yellow shark teeth, give
in.
</P>
<P>
   Let image after image after image emerge and you'll see ...
well, just look around:
</P>
<P>
   At Heather Roman's green super woman with wild purple hair, blue
lightning bolts shooting from her body and pink stiletto heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like her. The lightning bolts just came,'' said
Roman, 51, a Lenexa piano teacher who's painted with Oblinger for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan these paintings at all,'' she said. ``Sometimes
you're in this place where all you can do is just keep up with the
brush.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the wall, Stephanie Hansen, 31, who works at a center for
at-risk youths, is working on a sharp-featured character with an
array of curling tendrils, a kind of multi-limbed Shiva poised
above a squat naked figure with the word ``SABOTAGE'' scrawled on
his back and goldfish swimming in his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Hansen, Randee Werts, 50, an interior designer from
Prairie Village, has a three-paneled painting of overlapping
images: yellow-centered stars bursting into a field of gold, a
green hand holding a cherry red heart in its outstretched palm, the
words ``fragility punished'' scrawled nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has totally amazed me the kinds of things that have come to
the paper that I never would have expected,'' Werts said. ``It is
pretty liberating to just let go and do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also can be terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   When one is painting in the moment, the images that appear can
be spurred by intense feelings, thoughts and memories that arrive
unstoppable. Far from unusual, it's common, students said, to see
their fellow students well up at times or simply break into tears
as they pour images into their paintings. The experience can bring
up memories of abuse, neglect and divorce, as well as the array of
slights that mount in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You open yourself up. And if you're not used to it, it's
almost like being drugged,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too scary for a lot of people,'' Roman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Oblinger began painting this way in her 30s, even she found
it frightening. But she also believes that it was this process of
painting ``from a place of honesty'' that not only salvaged her
life but also magnified its beauty and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   `Hugely chaotic'
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Wichita, the oldest of six children in a
middle-class family (her dad was a landscape architect; her mom
stayed at home), Oblinger describes her upbringing as ``hugely
chaotic,'' and herself as a terrible student who flirted on the
edge of delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew at an early age what therapy was,'' she said, ``and I
knew one day I would be in it. I knew I wasn't happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her childhood, into adulthood and through two failed
marriages, Oblinger would suffer severe bouts of depression. As an
adult, her feelings of deep hopelessness only became worse by an
unremitting battle with psoriasis, a skin condition that left her
knees, elbows and face scaled and blotched.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 she graduated from Wichita North High School. ``I felt
terrifyingly lost,'' she said. ``I had no idea what interested me.
I had no idea where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So she went to George Williams College in Downers Grove, Ill.,
where her boyfriend was going. At 19 she married him. Eight months
later, scared and unhappy, she dropped out, left him and hightailed
it to a friend's home in New Haven, Conn. A year later her marriage
was over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going back to George Williams College, in 1974 she
enrolled at Kansas State University to study horticultural therapy.
Again it was because she had no idea what to do and because her dad
knew somebody in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that says to me, when I look back on my life, is how much
of it I spent in abject fear,'' Oblinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But it only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   After college came a job mowing lawns at the Sedgwick County Zoo
and ``feeling hugely incompetent.'' Again, she followed a boyfriend
_ David Arehart, whom she eventually married _ to San Diego, where
he got a job selling furniture. She taught ground maintenance to
disabled adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after I moved to San Diego,'' Oblinger said, ``it (the
psoriasis) cropped up. It was the way my depression and anger
manifested itself.''
</P>
<P>
   It also manifested itself with moves, one nearly every year,
from San Diego to Los Angeles to San Francisco to Marin County and
to one dissatisfying job after another. Until, in 1980, Oblinger
and Arehart found themselves living poor and miserable in the
basement of a decrepit cabin in the middle of the redwood forest.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she thought of killing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt hopeless,'' she said. ``Here I was. I didn't even know
if I liked this man or if I liked my job. I was depressed. My skin
was bad and I was seeing people who were telling me it might be a
precursor to cancer. I contemplated suicide and how I would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought `I can't blow my head off; that would be too
painful.' I felt even too hopeless to carry that off.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead, prompted by an ultimatum from Arehart _ ``Get help,
or we're done'' _ she went to a therapist schooled in a combination
of Reichian and Zen Buddhist philosophy, a doctrine centered on
``feeling and existing in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was so powerful,'' Oblinger said, ``is that I could go
and be a mess and have that witnessed and have it respected. It was
very much a process of learning to love myself. Not with positive
affirmations but by going through the feelings that were coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, in 1983, Oblinger began taking a painting class
in San Francisco. Its method, ``painting in the moment,'' jibed
exactly with her therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was frightening to paint out her moment-to-moment
feelings on paper, she felt the liberation. And something else: She
could paint!
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hugely overwhelming,'' Oblinger said. ``It was hard. It
was humiliating. It was everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the process, she felt alive, happy, safe, creative,
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and told David I want to work this way with
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history, albeit gradual: more
painting, encouraging friends, gallery shows, selling her work on
greeting cards, moving back to Kansas, more shows and, in 1995, her
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in class, when students find themselves in a moment of
disturbing feelings or images, Oblinger tells them: ``Stay in the
moment. Work through the darkness and see where it takes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Because as she well knows, in painting as in life, the most
dangerous ground can also be the most fertile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evil devil you paint one week,'' Oblinger said, ``one week
later may suddenly be wearing a halo or be bearing a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Oblinger's students attest to this.
</P>
<P>
   Besides allowing them to find the artists within themselves,
``Paint or Die'' is just as often therapeutic, they say. Some use
the word ``spiritual.'' Others say ``meditative.''
</P>
<P>
   And as often as not, they say, the lessons of painting in the
moment become lessons for living in the moment _ rejoicing in the
light, working through the dark, knowing that as long as you work
in honesty, stay true to yourself and work through the problems,
whatever you create will be yours. That alone will make it
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Paint or die?
</P>
<P>
   It's no contest. Paint.
</P>
<P>
   Workshops
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Oblinger runs periodic one-day workshops for $75 and
eight-week painting sessions for $160 in her Lawrence studio and at
St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Overland Park, Kan. For more

DREAMWORKS AND IMAGINE JOIN TO CREATE A WEB SITE OF DIGITAL 
ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ In what its principals say is a first glimmer of the
rapidly approaching digital entertainment world, executives at
Dreamworks SKG and Imagine Entertainment said Monday they would
join to create a new Internet entertainment company and Web site
offering short films, streaming video, live events, games,
performance art, continuing series, ``nonlinear interactive
features'' and whatever else they can think of.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, a ministudio formed by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey
Katzenberg and David Geffen, announced the partnership with
Imagine, a film and television production company headed by Ron
Howard and Brian Grazer, and vowed that the new company, to be
called POP.com, would be operating by early spring. The company is
to have offices in New York and Los Angeles, and the announcement
of its first chief executive will be made shortly, Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   POP.com is being financed by Vulcan Ventures, the investment
vehicle of Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft co-founder who is already a
major Dreamworks investor. Vulcan has committed $50 million for the
initial phase of the project, Katzenberg said. For that, Vulcan
will get 50 percent of the company; Dreamworks and Imagine will
split the other half.
</P>
<P>
   When it goes online, POP.com is to offer a daily menu of
interactive shorts it calls ``pops,'' most running between 30
seconds and six minutes. The emphasis will be on comedy, but no
genres will be ignored, Spielberg said, and each ``pop'' will come
with its own chat room and instant messaging capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be so seductive and ultimately addictive that
people don't click out after one click,'' Grazer said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Howard, both film directors, said they intended to
contribute their own ``pops'' to the site, though they added that
initially much of their work would be to encourage others to get
involved and to nurture the work of fledgling digital artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emerging and evolving new format,'' Katzenberg
said. ``The analogy I keep coming back to is 25 years ago when you
had this wonderful style called music and someone said, let's turn
it into an audio and video experience, and out of that was born
MTV. We believe we are at that time and moment now for the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement is indicative of the scurrying in
Hollywood in recent months to find ways to understand and
capitalize on the sweeping technological advancements in online and
digital filmmaking and utilize it to shape the entertainment world
of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Howard said, they want to have some fun. ``This is kind of
free-wheeling, less about narrative drive and all the discipline we
have to live with when we make a movie and more about the
exploration of interesting new ideas,'' he said. ``I think we're
going to able to entice a lot of really talented people to do some
work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pops'' presented on the site might also be the seeds of
other, larger projects, from video games to television series to
feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly see this as like a large, fertile field,''
Spielberg said. ``You can harvest all sorts of spin-offs, just from
whatever germinates. It could be a book, a piece of music, a movie,
who can say?''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the venture began to make the rounds in Hollywood and
in the investment community, most executives and analysts said they
wanted to reserve judgment until they could see exactly what was
planned, and how it might differ from other, perhaps smaller
Internet sites offering digital films.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do they promote it?'' asked one entertainment analyst.
``It's very nice to digitize films and put them on the Internet,
but where is the value in it for investors? I guess my initial
reaction is, `yeah, so?'''
</P>
<P>
   Digital moviemaking _ sometimes called microcinema _ is a
relatively small but growing movement of small-scale filmmakers
utilizing the cheaper and rapidly evolving digital technology to
make short films and exhibit them on the Internet. The October
issue of Wired magazine listed more than a dozen Internet sites
offering short digital films, among them Atomfilms _ which exhibits
shorts that are festival favorites or Academy Awards nominees and
counts as its partners the HBO and Warner Bros. Online units of
Time Warner _ and the Bit Screen, which offers short first-run
films and episodic series of 10 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   POP.com will be different, its founders say, in the scope of its
ambitions, the people associated with it and the strategies it will
use to turn a profit. They intend it as a money-making enterprise.
``We definitely see this as an advertiser and sponsor-supported
business,'' Katzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, POP.com plans to talk with Madison Avenue
executives about ideas for advertising on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same way that we have to really discover these new
forms, Madison Avenue is going to have to reinvent the way it
advertises to this kind of viewer,'' Katzenberg said. ``Each step
that is being taken in this world today is a first step. All of us,
individually and collectively, are on as big a learning curve as
you can be on. There are no rules, and there is no proven formula
for success in this as yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg said they did not intend to corner the market in
digital filmmaking or to muscle out weaker competitors. ``I think
there will be many stimulating sites in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will still be movies, and there will still be TV,''
Grazer added. ``We're not thinking we're changing the world. We're
just trying to be a part of the sensibility of this new medium.''

THIS YELLOW BALL CHOMPS HIS WAY INTO VIDEO GAME HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WARD TRIPLETT III  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pac-Man, the little yellow round ball with the big mouth, is
turning 20.
</P>
<P>
   Send bright dots and fruit and a power pellet or two.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the anniversary, the Japan-based company Namco
Hometek last week turned loose ``Pac Man World.'' More than two
years in the making, the new home video game for Sony's PlayStation
takes Pac-Man out of his traditional maze and into a 3-D world.
This Pac-Man has a face, arms and legs, and can run, jump, shoot,
climb, swim and ``butt-bounce,'' all the better to save his friends
and family from a new villain, Toc-Man.
</P>
<P>
   The new game also can be played in two other formats to suit
traditional tastes. One has the game's bad guys, the tireless
ghosts Binky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde, chasing Pac-Man around a maze
that, with new technology, is 3-D. The other looks and plays just
like the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we hid an arcade version of Pac-Man in some of our
Genesis and Super Nintendo game codes, and we still get calls every
single day asking how to open up the secret mode and play
(Pac-Man),'' said Mike Fischer, marketing director at Namco
Hometek. ``This time we decided to give true Pac-Man fans the
original classic right up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac-Man wasn't the first video game (see timeline), but ``he was
the world's first video game character,'' in Fischer's opinion.
``Even though he was just a little puck going `waka waka waka,' he
was imbued with a personality and people could relate to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Pac-Man stood out from other early '80s games such as
``Space Invaders,'' ``Asteroids,'' ``Missile Command,''
``Sinistar,'' ``Defender'' and ``Astro Fighter.'' You didn't just
zap something and see it disappear with a metallic-sounding fizz;
you were the Pac-Man, and you ran around a maze filled with dots of
light and two servings of fruit. If one of four ghosts caught you
before you ate all the dots, that would be the end of you.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, teens, kids, even the hard-to-reach female audience took
to it. Games found their way into restaurants and fast-food joints
across the country. Somehow in the short time it took to find a
table in a restaurant, kids always found the video console. They
clamored for permission to play games between courses, or instead
of courses.
</P>
<P>
   It all helped Pac-Man and its spinoff, Ms. Pac-Man, stick around
the longest, make the most money and leave the biggest impact on a
still-young gaming industry. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   - Pac-Man has swallowed more than $1 billion in quarters, which
means it has been played more than 10 million times.
</P>
<P>
   - The Pac-Man image has been licensed for 430 products,
including toilet seats and a hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   - The name has been co-opted by big business (the ``Pac-Man
Defense'' is when a company tries to swallow up another company
attempting a hostile takeover) and the boating industry (a 1999
model boat with a big mouth that opens and closes has been named
the pac-man).
</P>
<P>
   - People still play it. In July Florida resident Billy Mitchell
achieved what is thought to be the first perfect score on a
Pac-Man. Mitchell guided one Pac-Man through 256 boards and grabbed
every fruit and ghost for a total of 3,333,360 points. It took him
six hours.
</P>
<P>
   - There are entire Webrings of players devoted to the game. One
site, The 1st Church of Pac-Man at
www.geocities.com//SoHo//Lofts//8112//pac.htm has had 60,000 hits
in its two years on line. Tim Crist, 24, of Liverpool, N.Y., said
he started playing it around age 5 in the early '80s. He remembers
why it appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a game market saturated with spaceship shoot-'em-up games,
this was a nonviolent eating game with a strange-looking character
whose only weapon was his appetite,'' Crist said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people spent time considering Pac-Man's metaphorical
meaning. In May of 1982, Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe wrote
about wanting to ``save her man'' from his tormenting ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was his cute round shape ... his oral fixation ...
maybe it was because he seemed so easy to manipulate.''
</P>
<P>
   But she concluded that ``he had all the fatal charm, the
promising allure of a sadistic lover. He was like all the
three-dimensional people you know who lead their lives by
microchip. They're programmed to get you in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The old comic strip Bloom County touched on the same idea. In
one Sunday edition, a giant, depressed Pac-Man moaned about our
``crazy maze of a world ... just eatin' and runnin', and all the
while our various fears are forever chasing us close behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The commentaries, a handful of guidebooks and the Top 40 song
``Pac-Man Fever'' were confirmation of Pac-Man's status in pop
culture. When the arcade boom faded, he moved easily to home
formats and still ranks as one of the top 10 titles in the Gameboy
format. In 1998, Next Gen magazine proclaimed him ``the greatest
video game character of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the multibillion-dollar home video game industry thrives
on characters like Mario, Lara Croft, Duke Nukem, the Pokemon and
Sonic the Hedgehog. Can Pac-Man still chomp with the heavyweights?
Crist thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard stories of it selling out on the first day in some
Electronics Boutique stores,'' said Crist, whose site includes a
rave review of the new game. ``It's got some similarities to a few
currently popular games like `Klonoa,' so it should appeal to
younger players, too. It's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Namco thinks there's many an ex-video whiz kid who
dropped many a quarter in Pac-Man who has nary an hour to figure
out the new video games. But that person will love playing Pac-Man
with his or her growing children. Even better, the children won't
have to be told what Pac-Man is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say the Pac-Man icon is recognized even
more than Mickey Mouse's ears,'' Fischer said, ``and that's quite
an achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   PAC LINE
</P>
<P>
   1980: Pac-Man comes to America. (The game company Namco first
introduced it in Japan under the name ``Puck-Man.'') Game designer
Tohru Iwatani came up with the idea after looking at what was left
of a pizza after he had removed a slice.
</P>
<P>
   1981: Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia release ``Pac-Man Fever.''
The song makes it to No. 9 on the Billboard charts in early 1982.
</P>
<P>
   1981: The spinoff, ``Ms. Pac-Man,'' is introduced. The two
eventually fall in love and have children.
</P>
<P>
   1982: ``Pac-Man Plus,'' with bigger, harder-to-catch fruit, and
``Super Pac-Man,'' in which Pac-Man can get supersized and eat
keys, reach the market. Fan interest for them and subsequent arcade
upgrades would never match the fan interest of the original and
``Ms. Pac-Man.''
</P>
<P>
   1982: Pac-Man becomes a Saturday morning cartoon. Marty Ingalls
provides Pac's voice.
</P>
<P>
   1983: Pac-Man gets a cameo in ``National Lampoon's Vacation.''
He eats the Griswald family car.
</P>
<P>
   1984: The side-scrolling ``Pac-Land'' game beats the
groundbreaking game Super Mario Brothers to the market by over a
year. (Side-scrolling means the characters' environment can extend
beyond the screen you're playing.)
</P>
<P>
   1988: ``Pac-Mania'' allows Pac-Man to jump over the enemy
ghosts, who eventually learn to jump, too.
</P>
<P>
   1994: The Ms. Pac-Man character finally appears alongside
Pac-Man in an actual game in ``Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures.''
Other characters include Pac-Baby, Pac-Junior and Chomp Chomp,
Pac-Man's dog.
</P>
<P>
   1999: Pac-Man is back in video stores in THE NEW ``Pac Man
World'' and on TV in a commercial with Mr. T and Verne Troyer, the
``Mini-me'' of this summer's Austin Powers movie. The commercial
shows Pac-Man moving into Beverly Hills next to T and Troyer.

IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE: BEST WAYS TO MEET AND GREET
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who do not belong to a ready-made career network like 85
Broads or the Harvard Business School alumni clubs may need to be
creative in thinking about how to establish and use networks. There
are various networks, but joining them is not always useful,
according to Dee Soder, a career adviser for executives in New York
at the CEO Perspective Group. ``The people you want to meet and
interact with are generally not going to go to those things,'' Ms.
Soder said.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the best way to meet and greet? Ms. Soder says
focusing on organizations that you feel strongly about _ Girls
Inc., say, or City Meals on Wheels _ can be a good way for
like-minded men and women to get together. At a private reception
recently at the Economic Club of New York, for example, she made a
variety of contacts.
</P>
<P>
   People looking to connect should also not limit themselves to
one vehicle, says Herminia Ibarra, a Harvard Business School
professor. She suggests exploring a broad variety of informal and
formal ones, based on your interests and location. Join a local
alumni club, for example, as well as specific professional
associations. The more networks you join, the more opportunities
and ideas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at least, women may have an advantage. ``Women are far
more likely to have a variety of people they know than men are,''
Ms. Soder said.

LIFE IN DEATH VALLEY: CALIFORNIA PARK OVERWHELMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN HOLDER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOVEPIPE WELLS, Calif. _ The story should have seemed
suspicious from the beginning. In the canyons of Death Valley
National Park an explorer had come across treasure _ a chest of
gold and some other artifacts thought to be nearly 150 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But that was all I needed to start dreaming. Hey, I was on my
way to Death Valley in just a few weeks, and if a semiretired
substitute teacher could find $500,000 in treasure, well, who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   My fantasy didn't last long. Almost as soon I paid my $10 entry
fee into the park, I learned the find had been discredited. The
coins were authentic, all right, but the chest wasn't, and neither
were some of the other contents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no treasure for me to find in Death Valley. Or was
there?
</P>
<P>
   Boom and bust
</P>
<P>
   The search for treasure in Death Valley has been going on for
150 years or longer. Pioneers in the 1849 California gold rush
stumbled across the area looking for a shortcut. When they found
their way out a month later, the legend goes, one member of the
party turned back and cried, ``Goodbye, Death Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Gold and other minerals were discovered and boom towns sprang up
all over. But the gold made only a few people rich and the boom
towns quickly became ghost towns. The area became much more well
known for its borax deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Death Valley became a national monument in 1933 and a national
park in 1994. At 3.3 million acres, it's bigger than any national
park except Denali in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Its enormity is one of the first things you learn about Death
Valley. It's one of the first challenges as well. There's no
practical way to see a national park nearly the size of Connecticut
in just a few days. But choose a path that runs roughly from
Stovepipe Wells on the north to Badwater on the south (about 50
miles away), and you'll have all the canyons, mountain peaks and
geographical oddities you can handle.
</P>
<P>
   How low can you go?
</P>
<P>
   If Death Valley is famous for anything, it's as one of the
hottest and lowest places on earth. The average high temperature in
July is 115 degrees. Winter is much more survivable, if not
enjoyable. In January, when I visited, the average high reaches
only 65 or so, and it's the elevation that's much more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   As you wind your way into the park along California 190, the
signs won't let you forget that you're dropping: 3,000 feet, 2,000
feet, sea level. By the time you hit Badwater, about 17 miles south
of the visitor center at Furnace Creek, you're 282 feet below sea
level.
</P>
<P>
   A sign at Badwater announces that you're at the lowest point in
the Western Hemisphere. But you can appreciate that more by craning
your neck and looking up at the brown mountain east of the highway.
Way up on the mountainside, a white square stands out. So high up:
It's sea level. And in the other direction Telescope Peak soars to
11,049 feet _ from where you stand, even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Badwater got its name when a pioneer's mule refused to drink
from a permanent spring there. Even on the hottest days the water
remains, but it's unpotable, thanks to a combination of sulfur and
salt. ``And it is nasty,'' said one park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The real treat at Badwater, however, is the salt flats that
stretch out for 5 miles beyond the highway. It's so easy to imagine
the pioneers coming around a bend and seeing this great white
expanse of what, at first, sure looks like thirst-quenching water,
or maybe ice. What a disappointment this hard, crusty sea of salt
must have been. The surface patterns created by the wind and rain
are fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the middle it's bright _ grab those sunglasses. And you
almost have a feeling that you're on a lake covered with ice that
could give way at any time. Reality check: Pinch off a piece of the
surface and take a nibble. The briny taste will stay with you.
</P>
<P>
   Fore?
</P>
<P>
   The geography gets even more bizarre just to the north, at the
Devil's Golf Course, which got its name from a 1934 Park Service
guidebook that said ``only the devil could play golf on such a
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it looks like nothing more than a huge field of
dirt knobs, but on closer inspection you have to marvel at the
thousands and thousands of tightly spaced rock formations, created
when salt crystals exerted enormous pressure, forcing columns
upward.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the things you grow to quickly appreciate about
Death Valley. It's up to you to find the ... well, treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death Valley is certainly a place that takes people by
surprise,'' said Charlie Callagan, a park ranger. ``We encourage
you to walk and explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Look closer ... closer
</P>
<P>
   Life is all around, even though it's not readily apparent in the
hot, arid conditions of this place. Consider the sand dunes near
Stovepipe Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, Callagan said, is the best time for
finding wildlife tracks. Overnight the wind will have blown away
all signs of people. ``It's a real treat to be out there early in
the morning and look for the tracks of the creatures who have been
there during the night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here I was just before sunrise and the only tracks I could
find were tennis shoes _ mine. But there's no way this place could
be a disappointment. And there's no better time to see these
magnificent dunes, one of five sets spread throughout Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A few cars were parked along the highway, and one photographer
had set up a tripod waiting for dawn. But out in the middle of
hundreds of dunes, I was alone and it was magnificent. As the
evidence of a new day grew, the tan colors of these hills, as well
as the pinks and purples of the distant mountains, changed minute
by minute. And just when I thought I had noticed everything, the
sun leaped into the sky, creating a new world of light and shadows.
</P>
<P>
   And the wildlife? It was there, too. Tiny tracks offered plenty
of evidence that birds, beetles and kangaroo rats had been here.
All I had to do was look.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky roads
</P>
<P>
   If you pick sunrise to visit the dunes, you might save a canyon
for sundown. Death Valley has hundreds to explore.
</P>
<P>
   Mosaic Canyon, just past Stovepipe Wells, is notable because of
the artful patterns you'll find embedded in the rock walls. You may
have to scramble up and over the rocks here as you walk the narrow
trail, but you'll be rewarded again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Near Badwater, Natural Bridge Canyon is easily worth the
0.3-mile hike up a pebbly path, to see _ what else? _ a rock bridge
high overhead. Keep walking and you'll end up at a dry waterfall, a
stopping place for many of the canyon trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always amazed by people who come here looking for a loop
hike,'' Callagan said. ``I say, `Well, you can go so far, but
you're going to have to come back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the geography stops you, it's not so easy to turn back.
``It's almost like it lures you around the next corner,'' Callagan
said. ``You say, `I wonder what's going to be around there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Also check out the Golden Canyon Interpretive Trail and Gower
Gulch Loop, both through badlands near Furnace Creek. Titus Canyon,
about 35 miles north of Furnace Creek, boasts Native American
petroglyphs. MORE
</P>
<P>
   (of Furnace Creek, boasts Native American petroglyphs.)
</P>
<P>
   Now you see it ...
</P>
<P>
   You may well come away from Death Valley more impressed by what
you never saw than by what you did. That's the power of the tiny
Salt Creek pupfish.
</P>
<P>
   These 2-inch or smaller creatures once lived in what was Lake
Marley, a 90-mile-long freshwater lake. But the lake dried up
10,000 years ago and the creatures became trapped in all that was
left _ an underground river. The thing is, much of the year you
can't see any water at all.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the cold of winter and the unbearable heat of summer,
these fish bury themselves under the ground, where they thrive and
even reproduce. At certain times of spring and fall, when Salt
Creek makes its presence known, you can actually see the fish _ the
rangers promise. The rest of the time you'll just have to take
their word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Walk along the half-mile boardwalk and you'll learn how
difficult it is for anything to survive here. The salty soil allows
only a few plants, notably salt grass and pickleweed, to flourish.
So if you hear the sound of trickling water below, be sure to look.
You won't find Salt Creek pupfish anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not just a slogan
</P>
<P>
   You know the reputation of mules. Try getting 20 of them to
cooperate at once.
</P>
<P>
   At the ruins of Harmony Borax Works, just north of Furnace
Creek, the term ``20 mule team'' becomes much more than an
advertising slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony Borax Works, just north of Furnace Creek, was
established in 1883 to process ulexite cottonball borax, used to
make soap, fiberglass insulation and cosmetics, among other things.
Harmony closed in 1888, but the borax is still evident on the white
flats west of the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   You also can see the adobe remains where the mineral was
processed and hauled away in rugged wagons, which when full weighed
36.5 tons. Between 1883 and 1888, the 20-mule teams carried more
than 15 million pounds of borax out of Death Valley on 20-day round
trips.
</P>
<P>
   Those mule teams, by the way, often consisted of 18 mules and
two horses. The driver sat 120 feet away from the lead mule, with
whom he had to communicate. Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony was just one of many borax works throughout Death
Valley. In fact, the crystals are still mined in some places here.
The Furnace Creek borax museum has plenty of artifacts and borax
examples on hand to help complete the story.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, borax is kind of a symbol for Death Valley. It was a
unexpected boon, much more so than the lure of gold. Even if it's
gold that brings you here now, it's the unexpected treasures you'll
remember.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Death Valley National Park is about 120 miles west of Las Vegas,
Nev. Recent airfares between Kansas City and Las Vegas ran from
about $200, with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the park
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the park costs $10 per vehicle; the fee is good for
seven days. You can pay at ranger stations at Furnace Creek,
Grapevine, Stovepipe Wells or Beatty. Be sure to pick up a park map
and visitor's guide.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay
</P>
<P>
   - The Furnace Creek Inn was opened by the Pacific Borax Co. in
1927 and is undoubtedly Death Valley's most plush place to stay.
The 66-room resort boasts a spring-fed pool, tennis, massage,
horseback riding and carriage rides. Room rates run $230 to $345
through May. Call (760) 786-2345.MDSD/.MDNM/ or visit
www.furnacecreekresort.com or www.amfac.com
</P>
<P>
   - Furnace Creek Ranch, adjacent to the park headquarters, has
the feel of a Western town. Rates for the 224 motel rooms and

   ROTTERDAM, N.Y. _ Tommy Tang is throwing a pineapple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides all the tropical fruit in Thailand, pineapple,
especially in the south, pineapple over there is so sweet, whenever
you go there, you must try them. You will love it! What we gonna do
with fruit, like this? We can play football with it!''
</P>
<P>
   He whips it to an assistant, who lobs it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaahh, touchdown!'' shouts Tang as he catches the pineapple,
then sets it on a counter. ``OK, now we're gonna go cooking now.
Enough of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Tommy's world, a place where rapid-fire, elliptical
English, Hawaiian shirts, goofy antics, and hot Thai spices mix
together like a big pot of Bangkok Jambalaya. Tang, the 50-year-old
celebrity chef who introduced Thai food to America two decades ago,
is the king of fusion, both in life and in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to California from his native Thailand in 1972,
Tang has been a self-appointed ambassador for Thai cuisine, first
as a chef in Los Angeles, then as owner of Tommy Tang's
restaurants, two in California and one, now closed, in New York. He
has his own line of spices and sauces. In 1991 he wrote a
best-selling cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   He even makes a cameo in the new Bruce Willis movie ``The Story
of Us,'' in which he tells Michelle Pfeiffer's character, in a Thai
cooking class: ``Spicy food makes better lovers. The hotter the
food, the hotter you get!''
</P>
<P>
   But Tang's version of Thai food is, like everything else about
him, his own. While he uses plenty of traditional Thai ingredients
such as fish sauce, lemon grass and bamboo shoots, he also uses
everything from pine nuts to black olives. Some purists have
criticized his modern twist on Thai, but Tang dismisses them with a
wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to create new things. All the traditional stuff, I've
done that before. Can you ask Picasso to paint the same picture
over and over? Same thing with cooking. You need to create new
things. That's why I create this Thai fusion,'' says Tang, who has
two young daughters with his wife, Sandi, a Jewish
Italian-American. ``I just mingle the whole world, to do it my
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Tang was in the studios of WMHT-TV in Rotterdam,
taping the third season of ``Tommy Tang's Modern Thai Cuisine,'' a
cooking show that airs on 75 to 100 public television stations
nationwide. Tang and a crew from WMHT first travel to Thailand for
several weeks to tape segments on location, then finish filming the
26 episodes in the studio over a three-week period.
</P>
<P>
   Today's recipe is Macaroni with Shrimp, made with (among other
things) elbow pasta, shrimp, diced tomatoes, eggs _ and ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why ketchup?'' says Tang, as he scoots back and forth in the
studio kitchen, wearing one of his customary colorful Hawaiian
shirts and a bright blue bandana. ``In Thailand when I was young,
when we go to the restaurant, they call (it) macaroni with shrimp.
I didn't know it was supposed to be called tomato paste! All we
know is ketchup, so I use ketchup to make this dish. And now I
could use tomato paste, but why? My childhood memories, I'm very
fond about this dish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang has his own unique style. He chatters nonstop, expertly
tossing shrimp into a frying pan, adding more olive oil until the
whole thing goes up in a quick flame. At that, Tang lets out one of
his gleeful giggles. ``Whoa, what we got, a shrimp flambe?''
</P>
<P>
   Tang's first meal in the United States was significantly less
flashy. He says he landed in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve in 1972.
Hungry, he went to a movie theater to get something to eat because
no restaurants were open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course a movie theater in Thailand has every kind of food
imaginable that you can go and eat,'' he says. Tang ordered a hot
dog and large Coke, which he says he didn't realize would be quite
so large.
</P>
<P>
   But things, in general, got bigger for Tang once he was in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bangkok, the oldest boy of 10 children, Tang and his
family became homeless after a fire destroyed their house. He
dropped out of school after finishing the fourth grade, and began
working a series of jobs, first in a factory, then in a coffee shop
with a restaurant, where each night he emptied the buckets that
served as both ashtray and spittoon, and eventually began assisting
the cook. Next he worked as a bellboy in a top hotel in Bangkok
that catered to international tourists and American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Tang taught himself English by reading a dictionary and seeing
movies. If he came across words he didn't know, he wrote them on
his arm during the film to look up later. ``So by the time I come
out, it looks like I have tattoos on my whole arms,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made good money at the hotel, the lure of education
called, and when Tang was accepted to a community college in
Blythe, Calif., he went. While in school, Tang boarded with an
elderly woman, who volunteered him to cook for her ladies group.
``I said, `Are you out of your mind? I never cooked in front of
people!''' Tang's cooking became so popular that he began a
catering business on the weekends while finishing school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he graduated from college with a degree in
automotive mechanics and business, he did not think of himself as a
chef. He moved to Los Angeles and began managing a friend's rock
band. He was tempted back into the kitchen when the girlfriend of
one of his guitar players asked him to help out in the Thai
restaurant where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little did I know, I would just enjoy it more and more,'' he
says, adding that it didn't take long for him to quit the music
business. ``There was a whole kitchen for me to create in!''
</P>
<P>
   Tang worked his way up to executive chef at Chan Dara, the tiny
restaurant in Hollywood that some say was the first Thai restaurant
in the country. He developed a devoted following there, which he
took with him when he left in 1982 to open his own restaurant.

opening, period, because I don't have money. All the music people _
Jackson Browne, the Doobie Brothers _ everybody was there, all the
actors and actresses standing in line to come in,'' he says. They
opened at 6 p.m. that night, and an hour later they were out of
food. ``I knew that we were gonna be OK, but I never expected that
we were going to be a smash hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Donn Rogosin, general manager for WMHT, is from Los Angeles and
had eaten in Tang's restaurant many times. So when the fiesty chef
approached the station three years ago about producing a national
Thai cooking show, Rogosin jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited because he was the guy who brought Thai food to
L.A.,'' he says, explaining that the station has a ``reputation
within public broadcasting with how-to productions'' that Tang
heard about from a local friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work with somebody, it's just like marriage. You have
to feel comfortable,'' Tang says. ``I could do any big city I
wanted, so why choose here? It gives you some place with less
distraction. Small cities and townspeople are much nicer, more down
to earth, no ego.''
</P>
<P>
   His only complaint is that it can be tough to get a lot of the
ingredients he needs. He travels to Manhattan every weekend while
filming in the upstate New York town.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two recipes from ``Tommy Tang's Modern Thai Cuisine''
(Doubleday, 1991).

</P>
<P>
   MEEKROB
</P>
<P>
   (Serves 4)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups vegetable oil (for deep frying)
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces meekrob noodles (see note)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8 medium shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons tamarind juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sugar or honey
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika 1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces bean sprouts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded leeks
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs cilantro
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   Line a large bowl with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Pour vegetable oil into a large saucepan and heat to 375
degrees. (To test oil, drop in a small piece of noodle. If it
immediately puffs and enlarges, oil is ready.) Drop half the
noodles into the hot oil; noodles should immediately puff. Remove
noodles quickly (do not let them color) and transfer to
paper-towel-lined bowl to drain. Repeat with remaining noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Heat olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add shrimp and
saute 1 minute. Add tamarind juice, vinegar, sugar, fish sauce, and
paprika, bring to boil, and stir constantly until mixture is
syrupy. Reduce heat to medium, add egg, and stir briskly until
blended. Let sauce cool to lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer sauce to a large bowl, add noodles, and toss to coat
well. Arrange noodles on a platter and top with bean sprouts,
leeks, and cilantro. Sprinkle with pine nuts and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Meekrob noodles are very thin dried rice noodles, known in
Thai as sen-mee, comparable in thickness to angel hair pasta.

BUCHANAN AND REFORM: A BAD MARRIAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it's official. Pat Buchanan is no longer a member of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for the Republican Party, which has significantly
upgraded the quality of its membership.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan stood before the TV cameras Monday and tried to palm
off his switch to the Reform Party as an act of principle. What it
was, of course, was an act of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan wants to run for president. The Republican Party has no
interest in his candidacy. He went shopping for a party that needs
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is out on the question of Buchanan's appeal as a
potential standard-bearer for the Reform Party, but let's be
realistic: A political party that was founded by Ross Perot and
claims Jesse Ventura as its highest-ranking officeholder definitely
figures to be goofy enough to nominate Buchanan for president.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan is desperate for a political party to prop up his
candidacy, how desperate is the party that agrees to prop him up?
Pretty desperate, I'd say, especially when you consider that
Buchanan's only opposition at the moment is Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Trump has already set the tone for the campaign, by the way,
attacking Buchanan as a ``Hitler lover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's an anti-Semite,'' Trump said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan replied, more or less, that sticks and stones may break
his bones but words will never hurt him. Trump and others have
resorted to name-calling, Buchanan said, because people are afraid
of the ideas he represents.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan does have at least one legitimate idea: his pledge to
keep the United States out of foreign wars that are none of our
business.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good reason for people to be afraid of other
Buchanan ideas, especially his would-be policies on trade, race
relations, immigration, education and the relationship between
government and religion. Buchanan was going nowhere in the GOP
because he is too far out of the mainstream for even the most
conservative of Republican conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the issue of Buchanan's compatibility
with the Reform Party. Except for similar views on some economic
and trade issues, what does Buchanan have in common with the
Reformers? He seems to believe that the government should have
morality cops going door-to-door to enforce his version of
Christian culture, whereas the Reform Party is basically
libertarian on issues of personal morality _ not to mention
pro-choice on the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   If Buchanan bolted the Republican Party because the party
leadership has de-emphasized the moral and social issues he holds
so dear, how in the world can he hook up with an outfit that never
had any interest in those issues in the first place? He calls that
an act of principle?
</P>
<P>
   It was a blatant act of political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Buchanan doesn't really represent ideas or a cause
or even a constituency. He represents his own ego _ a beast so huge
and insatiable that he had to sever his lifelong affiliation with
the Republican Party in order to keep feeding it.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggesting that Buchanan might have a significant
impact on the general election if he turns out to be the Reform
Party's nominee are ludicrous because they presume that people who
care enough about their country to vote in a presidential election
would be willing to waste their votes on a man who is so obviously
unsuited for the job he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate makes mistakes from time to time. But the voters
_ not even 5 percent of the voters, as one poll suggests _ would
never so much as flirt with the notion of handing over the keys to
the White House to the likes of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   All these nervous-Nellie Republicans who are shaking in their
boots over Buchanan's potential to hijack votes from the Republican
presidential nominee need to stop worrying and get on with the
business of choosing a candidate and winning the election.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's presidential candidacy is a joke _ a bad joke, but a
joke nonetheless. If the Reform Party chooses him as its nominee,
it will be a joke as well.

THE UN'S JOB IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been anything quite like the reconstruction task
the United Nations has accepted in the liberated but devastated
territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Security Council authorized a UN administration
for East Timor until the Timorese can exercise the independence
they have long desired. Because Indonesian forces and their proxies
deliberately destroyed nearly everything that could be destroyed in
East Timor after the population voted overwhelmingly on Aug. 30 for
independence, the UN mission will have to create not only the
material infrastructure for a sustainable economy but also the
institutional foundations for durable self-government.
</P>
<P>
   Daunting as the task of nation-building will be, it is fitting
that the responsibility falls on the UN. Since Indonesia invaded
East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year, the UN has
properly refused to recognize Indonesian claims to sovereignty over
the Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   This year the UN took on the job of supervising preparations for
a referendum on independence for the territory. However, UN
officials failed to heed warnings from the Timorese about the
possibility of violence organized by the Indonesian military.
Because the UN left security in the hands of the Indonesian Army
and did not insist on international protection for the Timorese
people, it has an added obligation to shepherd East Timor toward a
viable independent existence.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there is no other candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Money and skilled workers will be needed to rebuild burned
houses and public edifices, to install water and sewer systems and
a communications network. Timorese coffee growers will need
assistance to revive cultivation of their most important cash crop.
The UN's interim administration will have to foster an indigenous
civil service, a police force, a judiciary, and the groundwork for
a constitutional government.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's rebuilding of East Timor is a mission that deserves
financial and political support from Washington and the rest of the
world.

THE WORK OF FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a social minefield to discuss why white students, on
average, get higher grades and test scores than black and Hispanic
students. The issue is fraught with aspects of history, fairness,
politics, money, and assumptions about innate talent. But this
turmoil can be avoided by sticking to facts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the debate over affirmative action, a new College Board
report says: ``Our public institutions have pursued relatively few
education policies specifically targeted to minorities.'' Most of
the work has been done in programs like Head Start that focus on
the disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   From pre-kindergarten through college, opportunities exist to
address minority underachievement using thoughtful, often proven
methods.
</P>
<P>
   One classic program was a calculus workshop at the University of
California at Berkeley in the 1970s. Taken at the same time as an
introductory calculus class, the workshop let students study in
depth, fill holes in their education, and use the strategy of
studying in groups.
</P>
<P>
   Workshop students learned to do hard work well. Most got an A or
B in the calculus class. This undermined stereotypes among other
students and faculty. And the program showed the need to strengthen
both students and schools.
</P>
<P>
   This takes many ingredients. One is money for innovations at all
school levels and across class lines. Growth, says the report,
should occur in the ``parallel education system'' _ the many
out-of-school programs that parents of all races use to supplement
their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes are tougher. Black students who get good grades
have to shake off the slur that they are ``acting white.'' Colleges
have to root out what has been called a ``lack of hospitality''
toward minority students that many experience as hostility. Changes
on this level could lead to insights on better teaching for boys,
who tend to underperform academically in comparison with girls.
</P>
<P>
   Missing is the public courage to insist that closing achievement
gaps need not be racist or discriminate against white students. It
simply responds to a problem with powerful solutions.

 &HT;    Squash the rumor that winter beauties are for decoration only
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A basket of winter squash can be so aesthetically pleasing that
it's tempting to grab a paintbrush, a camera or even a lump of clay
before thinking of putting them into a pot to cook.
</P>
<P>
   From deepest green and gold to yellow and chartreuse, orange,
russet and even blue, these natural sculptures of autumn could be
equally at home in an art gallery as in the supermarket. Perhaps
because they steal the show from other autumn produce, winter
squash are all too often appreciated solely as decorative art
rather than as wonderful food.
</P>
<P>
   Those gorgeous piles of brilliantly colored, exotically shaped
fruit tend to intimidate folks who assume that, because they're so
varied, each has to be treated differently. Not so. With the
exception of spaghetti squash, most winter squash are handled
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that doesn't mean they all taste alike. The flesh,
textures, aromas and flavors of winter squash vary widely. Most
marry well with nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, curry and sage
and can be baked, boiled, mashed, pureed, steamed, simmered or
stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Winter squash is a fruit well worth getting to know. With a few
minutes on the Internet, instead of just admiring them, you can get
to know their names, experiment with recipes and add beauty as well
as taste to your winter table.
</P>
<P>
   To begin your journey, visit ``The Old Country Market'' at
www.specialtyproduce.com
</P>
<P>
   /ConsumerProduct.asp?iItemID &QC; 452 before you go to your
supermarket. This is a great site that has encyclopedic information
about scores of fruits and vegetables, and, best of all, there are
color pictures. Scroll down to ``squash'' to get to know some
varieties you've probably seen and admired without knowing their
names.
</P>
<P>
   After you've familiarized yourself with appearances, go to
www.diabetes.org/nutrition
</P>
<P>
   /article091598.asp for a brief overview of the most common
types. You'll learn that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Acorn is probably the most familiar winter squash. It's the
smallest, with a deep seed cavity ideal for stuffing. An
average-size acorn squash is enough for two servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Butternut squash has a smooth skin and looks like a tan,
elongated pear. Butternuts have a moist, sweet taste with creamy,
reddish-gold pulp. They weigh from 1/2 to 3 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hubbard squash, a favorite of New England settlers, is a
large, football-shaped beauty. Its lumpy skin can be dark green,
light gray-blue, creamy white or pumpkin orange. All have bright
yellow pulp. They weigh from 3 to 8 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Turkish Turban is the most colorful squash, having a bright
orange rind with deep green, white and yellow splashes. It looks
like a flattened pumpkin and is attractive baked whole.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buttercup squash is turbanlike in shape, with a light green
cap on a dark green base. The pulp is creamy yellow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cushaw squash is globe-shaped at one end, tapering to a
narrow, curved neck. The skin looks like a striped, green
watermelon, and the pulp is white gold.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spaghetti squash is perhaps the most fun to prepare. The pulp
cooks up into golden yellow strands that are pulled from the
shells. Blimp-shaped, spaghetti squash makes a great substitute for
pasta. This is the only squash that cannot be used interchangeably
with others in most recipes, because of its unique strands. For
information about preparing spaghetti squash, see
soar.Berkeley.EDU/recipe
</P>
<P>
   /vegetables/squash/recipe51.rec.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're ready to make your selection. Choose the squash that
are most pleasing to the eye, knowing that they can be arranged in
a basket for up to two months and used through the season. They
should have hard, deep rinds, with no blemishes or moldy spots.
Avoid tender skin, which indicates the fruit was picked too soon.
Squash should feel heavy for its size: If it's lightweight, it
indicates that the insides have begun to dry.

   Acorn Squash
</P>
<P>
   With Cranberry Filling
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 17-22 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Here's a beautiful, easy recipe for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   2 large acorn squash (about 2 pounds each)
</P>
<P>
   1 (16-ounce) can whole cranberry sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   Prick squash several times with a fork to allow steam to escape.
Place in a microwave oven and microwave on high (100 percent) until
soft when tested with a fork, 10 to 12 minutes. (If the oven
doesn't have a carousel, rotate and turn the squash midway through
the cooking time.) Let stand until cool enough to handle. Cut
squashes in half. Remove and discard the stringy pulp and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Place two halves, cut sides up, into a 10-inch square casserole
dish. Set aside the other halves.
</P>
<P>
   In a small, microwave-safe bowl, mix the cranberry sauce, honey
and allspice. Microwave on high (100 percent) until hot and bubbly,
3 to 4 minutes, stirring after half the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon half the mixture into the two squash halves, reserving
half for the other two halves. Microwave on high (100 percent)
until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining halves.

 &HT;    No tricks to making these treats
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goblins and ghosts, mummies and monsters are all around you.
Just look in the grocery aisles. Licorice and candy corn make great
eyes and lips. Crooked nuts are noses. Corn chips are ears. Whipped
cream piped just so looks like ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   There are also great cupcake papers, sugar decorations, gel
icings and even canned frosting with orange and black confetti. So
pulling together something scary for a weekend fright fest should
be a snap.

   Ghoul-Aid Punch
</P>
<P>
   Makes 18 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   If you are in a pinch and don't have time to make an elaborate
punch, try this one. Kids are sure to love it. For an extra touch,
try floating ghoulish ``hands'' in the punch. The idea came from a
book chock-full of fun ideas _ ``Kraft Halloween: Let's Make
Something Good'' (Meredith Books, $12.95). This punch bowl will
have the goblins circling.
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope cherry flavor unsweetened soft drink mix
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope grape flavor unsweetened soft drink mix
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope tropical punch flavor unsweetened soft drink mix
</P>
<P>
   2 3/4 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   18 cups cold water (4 1/2 quarts)
</P>
<P>
   Ice cubes
</P>
<P>
   Place soft drink mixes and sugar in large punch bowl. Add water;
stir to dissolve. Serve over ice cubes._ From: ``Kraft Halloween:

</P>
<P>
   To make floating hands
</P>
<P>
   Wash and dry plastic or latex gloves. If the gloves have a
powdery residue inside, turn them inside out and soak in warm water
or wipe with soapy water and rinse. Allow to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare one envelope of an unsweetened soft drink mix according
to package directions; or fill a large bowl with water and drop in
food coloring until the water is very dark (the color may lighten
when frozen).
</P>
<P>
   Put a few gummy worms in gloves, if desired. Add enough soft
drink to fill gloves, but not so full that the fingers will not
move. Fasten gloves tightly with twist-ties. Place paper towels on
a cookie sheet and lay ``hands'' on paper towels. Freeze. When
frozen solid, carefully use scissors to cut gloves off frozen
``hands.'' Float ``hands'' in bowl of punch.

<P>
   The Purr-fect Treat
</P>
<P>
   Makes 36 cookies Preparation time: 20 minutes Chilling time: 1-2
hours Cooking time: 7-9 minutes
</P>
<P>
   We found this recipe for a firm chocolate cookie along with
other spooktacular ideas for Halloween on the Better Homes &AMP;
Gardens Web site (www.bhg.com/halloween). The cookie is not very
sweet, so it benefits from decoration. The number of cookies will
vary depending on the size of the cutter. I used a variety of 2-
and 4-inch cutters in the shapes of pumpkins, ghosts, cats and
bats.
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 tablespoons milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon finely shredded orange peel
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Orange Icing:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 teaspoons orange juice
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 drops orange food
</P>
<P>
   coloring
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl, beat shortening and margarine or butter
with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds or
until softened.
</P>
<P>
   Add 3/4 cup flour, sugar, cocoa powder, egg, 2 tablespoons milk,
orange peel and juice, baking powder and vanilla. Beat till
combined, scraping bowl occasionally. Beat or stir in remaining
flour. Dough may be rather dry. Feel free to add 1 or 2 more
tablespoons milk if needed. Divide in half. Cover; chill for 1 to 2
hours or until easy to handle. On a lightly floured surface, roll
each dough portion to 1/8-inch thickness. With cookie cutter, cut
in shapes. Place shapes 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in a 375-degree oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until edges are
firm and bottoms are light brown. Remove cookies; cool thoroughly
on a wire rack.
</P>
<P>
   In a small mixing bowl, stir together confectioners' sugar, 1/4
teaspoon vanilla and enough orange juice (2 to 3 teaspoons) to make
of piping consistency. Stir in enough orange food coloring (or a
combination of red and yellow) to color the icing orange. Place
icing in a small, sealed plastic bag with a small hole snipped out
of one corner, or in a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip.
Decorate cookies.

   Chocolate Buttermilk Cupcakes Makes 24 cupcakes Preparation
time: 15 minutes Cooking time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This recipe, along with the one for the Traditional Vanilla
Buttercream, comes from a charming little corner bakery in New York
City that specializes in old-fashioned layer cakes and cupcakes _
the Magnolia Bakery, which has a just-released cookbook, ``The
Magnolia Bakery Cookbook'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   We think it's worth the effort, which is only a few minutes more
than a mix. It's my new favorite chocolate cake recipe (this recipe
can also make two 9-inch layers, cooking 25 to 30 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Put cupcake papers in a muffin pan
and set aside. In a medium-size bowl, sift together flour and
baking soda. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar and brown sugar with an
electric mixer until smooth, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs one at a
time, beating well after each addition. Add the chocolate, mixing
until well-incorporated. Add the flour mixture in thirds,
alternating with the buttermilk and the vanilla extract, beating
after each addition until smooth. Spoon batter into the cupcake
papers about 3/4 full. Bake for about 20 minutes or until tops
spring back lightly when touched. Remove cupcakes from pans and
cool on rack. When cooled, frost and decorate.

   Traditional Vanilla Buttercream
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough for a 9-inch layer cake or 24 cupcakes
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, very soft
</P>
<P>
   4 cups confectioners' sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   Place butter in a large mixing bowl. Add 2 cups sugar, then the
milk and vanilla. Beat until smooth and creamy. Gradually add
remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time, until icing is thick enough to be
of good spreading consistency (you may not need all the sugar). If
desired, add a few drops food coloring and mix thoroughly. Use and
store icing at room temperature, as icing will set if chilled. Can
store in airtight container up to three days. _ From: Magnolia

   Snake Cookies
</P>
<P>
   Makes 48 cookies

<P>
   Chilling time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 4-5 minutes per batch
</P>
<P>
   You don't need cookie cutters to have fun. Just grab a roll of
sugar cookie dough from the refrigerated case in the grocery (or
make your favorite) and roll instead of cut to make these scary and
scrumptious snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerated sugar cookie dough
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Black food coloring
</P>
<P>
   Orange food coloring
</P>
<P>
   Freeze sugar cookie dough for 45 minutes or until thoroughly
chilled. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a 1/8-inch slice of dough and roll into a very thin pencil
shape on a floured surface. Each ``snake'' should be 1/4 inch in
diameter and 4 to 5 inches long. Carefully place the shapes on
ungreased cookie sheets, giving them a slight curve in the middle
to resemble crawling snakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 4 to 5 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Allow to
cool on cookie sheets before removing and transferring to racks.
(The cookies will break if you try to move them while they're
warm.)
</P>
<P>
   For the icing: Mix confectioners' sugar with 2 to 3 tablespoons
water until the consistency of a thick glaze. Transfer a few
tablespoons of the icing to a separate bowl and tint with black
food coloring. Add orange food coloring to the big bowl of icing.
</P>
<P>
   Place cooled cookies on wire racks set on top of newspaper to
protect the countertop. Use a thin paintbrush to completely coat
each snake with a liberal amount of orange icing. Put black icing
into a zippered plastic snack bag. Seal, and cut a tiny hole in one
corner.
</P>
<P>
   When orange icing has dried on snakes, pipe black stripes
horizontally on each cookie. Alternatively, you may decorate the
cookies while orange icing is still wet with sprinkles, sugar
crystals or other cookie decorations. _ From: Dallas Morning News

   Using all convenience items, you can make this centerpiece for a
Halloween party in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   1 package (20 ounces) chocolate sandwich cookies
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups cold milk
</P>
<P>
   2 packages (4-serving size each) chocolate flavor instant
pudding and pie filling
</P>
<P>
   1 tub (11-12 ounces) frozen whipped topping, thawed
</P>
<P>
   Set aside 6 cookies for decorations. Crush remaining cookies in
zipper-style plastic bag with rolling pin or in food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Pour cold milk into large bowl. Add pudding mix. Beat with wire
whisk 2 minutes. Gently stir in 3 cups of the whipped topping and
half the crushed cookies. Spoon into 13-by-9-inch dish. Sprinkle
with remaining crushed cookies (to look like dirt in the
graveyard). Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to decorate and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   To decorate graveyard: Use assorted cookies and decorator icings
or gels to create ``tombstones'' with the cookies. Write R.I.P. on
vanilla wafers or Milano cookies or others of your choice. Then
stand ``tombstones'' on top of dessert with candy corn, candy
pumpkins and tiny jelly beans. Drop remaining whipped topping by
spoonfuls onto dessert to create ghosts. Decorate with candies to
create ``eyes.''

 &HT;    Halloween treats so easy it's scary
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wicked weekend is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly ghosts and frightening ones will be roaming our
neighborhoods. Cackling witches and kind ones will be ringing our
doorbells. Ghastly monsters and goofy ones will be circling our
punch bowls.
</P>
<P>
   And they all have the same demand: treats.
</P>
<P>
   As times have changed, more and more folks are choosing to
celebrate Halloween in their homes, schools and community centers
rather than focusing on door-to-door visits. That means we need
more party fare.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who like the traditional trick or treating may want
more since Halloween falls on a Sunday. The whole weekend is set up
for freaky fun.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't given the first thought to how you'll satisfy the
little goblins, hold back that blood-curdling scream. We've got a
bag of speedy and spooky tricks _ 13 of them in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Like ghoulish punch with floating hands, Dracula's Eyes and a
Jack-O'-Lantern pie.
</P>
<P>
   So now's a good time to hop on the old broomstick and get to the
grocery, where you'll find everything you'll need for these creepy
13.
</P>
<P>
   1. Float some fun
</P>
<P>
   Give the goblins a scare when they dip into the punch bowl. The
day before the party, freeze colorful punch in plastic or latex
gloves. Just before serving, cut the gloves off and then float the
dismembered hands in the punch bowl.
</P>
<P>
   2. Spooky cookie
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts, bats, pumpkins and cats. We found cookie cutters for all
those shapes and more in local grocery and craft stores. So pick up
a roll of sugar cookie dough or try our recipe for
orange-and-chocolate cookies inside. Cut, cook, frost or sprinkle,
and you'll have spooky cookies in no time.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cute cutouts
</P>
<P>
   Those cookie cutters can cut more than dough. Stack thick-cut
slices of bologna and cheese and then cut into shapes. Or put the
stacks between two slices of white bread and cut _ for that ghostly
look. Use cheese, mustard and ketchup to add faces.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bewitched
</P>
<P>
   Whether you do this one in advance or make it a party activity,
it's sure to bewitch your pint-size guests. Freeze full, round
scoops of sherbet (lime is creepy, orange is Halloweeny) on small
paper plates. Set up a decorating station, with sugar cones for
hats, licorice for hair, nuts for noses and candies for eyes and
lips. Let guests create their own witches and then dig in. (If you
have some slowpokes, refreeze before eating.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Funny faces
</P>
<P>
   Halloween cupcakes are so easy to dress up. Candy corn and round
candy-coated chocolate make the eyes, noses and mouths. Thin
licorice or icing pens can also make the mouth. Or simply frost and
plop a spider ring on top. Use your favorite cake mix or try our
luscious buttermilk chocolate cake recipe inside.
</P>
<P>
   6. Sssscary snakes
</P>
<P>
   make snakes. Then ``paint'' them with orange and black frosting
to give them spots and stripes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Toothsome tombstones
</P>
<P>
   Create a ``graveyard'' in a baking pan by layering pudding,
whipped cream and crumbled cookies. Then stand assorted cookies in
the top for tombstones and use whipped cream to create ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   8. Jack-O'-Lantern Pie
</P>
<P>
   The face of a pie is a perfect palette for trickery. Licorice
eyebrows and candy corn teeth add a little fright and a lot of fun
to an easy orange cream pie.
</P>
<P>
   9. Popcorn party favors
</P>
<P>
   Stuff small paper bags with honey-coated popcorn and peanuts for
an old-fashioned caramel corn effect. And just for fun, throw in a
plastic-wrapped surprise, like a spider ring or a Halloween
noisemaker.
</P>
<P>
   10. I spy Dracula's Eyes
</P>
<P>
   For a really haunting treat, disguise peanut butter and
chocolate candy in a vanilla coating, then press in candy pieces in
the center for irises. A dot of black gel will make the pupil, and
squiggles of red gel will give the eyeballs that bloodshot look.
</P>
<P>
   11. Goody goblins
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of a tempest in a teapot. How about a ghost in a
cup? Spoon fluffy mounds of pudding and whipped cream into clear
plastic cups, then decorate with small candies and icing for
goblins sure to be gobbled up.
</P>
<P>
   12. Purr-fect dip
</P>
<P>
   Just a few quick tricks, like green pepper triangles for ears
and nose, black olives for eyes and chives for whiskers, and you
turn a basic dip into perfect party fun.
</P>
<P>
   13. Seedy sensation
</P>
<P>
   After you've carved the pumpkin, rescue the seeds. Wash and then
toss in a bowl with 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon vegetable
oil,
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon brown sugar and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Preheat
the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the seeds out on a nonstick baking
sheet and bake for about 12 minutes, checking once or twice and
stirring them around on the pan when they get bubbly. Let cool
overnight.

 &HT;    Raisin bread good choice for gift-giving
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Helen O. White of Winston (Ga.) came through with a
great recipe for quick Applesauce Raisin Bread, as requested by
Frances Fowler of Cumming (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   If you use regular raisins in this bread, soak in 1/4 cup of any
fruit juice _ we tested it with orange juice and liked the
additional flavor. If you use the newer moist baking raisins
available in many supermarkets, just reduce the amount of fruit
juice to 2 tablespoons.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said that before she lost her recipe, she liked to bake
several loaves of this fragrant bread for gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Applesauce
</P>
<P>
   Raisin Bread
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 loaf, about 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 50-60 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fruit juice
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons ground
</P>
<P>
   cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 cup quick-cooking or
</P>
<P>
   old-fashioned oats
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup packed brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups applesauce
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Grease and flour an 8 1/2-by-4 1/2-inch loaf pan (or 1-quart
casserole dish).
</P>
<P>
   In a small, shallow bowl, combine raisins and fruit juice and
let soak while mixing the batter.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking
powder, baking soda, cinnamon, oats and brown sugar. Add
applesauce, oil, beaten eggs and milk; stir just until all dry
ingredients are moistened. Mix in raisins and their fruit juice.
Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and
toothpick inserted in center of loaf holds moist, but not sticky,
crumbs; about 50 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.

<P>
   Recipe requests
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipe I'm looking for is a sweet-and-sour rice salad ...
(with) long grain white rice and chopped green onions and perhaps
raisins and a dash of cinnamon,'' says Susan Terry of Roswell
(Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lived near San Francisco, I used to eat this dish all
the time. But in Atlanta, I cannot find it on any menu, nor have I
found any Chinese chef that knows the recipe,'' says Sandi Boneta
(e-mail). ``It consists of chopped chicken and vegetables in a
tasty sauce _ it kind of reminds me of Mu Shu Pork. The best part
is the lettuce leaves. Using the largest leaves, put them in
boiling water for just a minute, then dip them in cold water. Put a
heaping amount of chicken and vegetables on a leaf and roll it up
like a burrito. It's wonderful!''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Whaley of Rome (Ga.) is wishing someone has the recipe for
Butter Fruit Cake like that one sold in the Sears catalog many
years ago. ``It had lots and lots of pecans, pineapple, raisins. It
was real good and moist,'' she remembers.

<P>
   The track, taken from the band's just-issued ``Make Yourself''
album, is the one where a squeaky-voiced kid declares himself ``at
23, on the verge of spontaneous combustion. ... Woe is me.'' That's
before the raging guitar and weird little turntable squiggles come
in.
</P>
<P>
   It's among several standouts on ``Make Yourself''
(Immortal/Epic), produced by Scott Litt (R.E.M., Nirvana, Days of
the New) with an eye toward increasing the five-member band's
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of real hard music out now with a lot of
screaming and a hip-hop beat and that's cool,'' said Incubus
guitarist Mike Einziger. ``But we don't need to go there. We made a
decision to go in a more melodic direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Incubus has been building its loyal fan base since 1991, when
Einziger and pals from Calabasas High School launched the band.
Within a year of their earliest party gigs, Incubus was playing
all-ages shows in the Valley and at the Roxy on Sunset Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The band's tireless gigging expanded its reach from Los Angeles
and beyond. A 1997 European tour supporting label-mate Korn was
capped by a show for more than 5,000 fans in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``European kids really appreciate the fact you've come all the
way from America to play in their town,'' Einziger said. ``I
sometimes think Americans have it better than they actually
realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, still supporting its 1997 debut album,
``S.C.I.E.N.C.E.,'' the band played more than 200 shows with the
likes of Sugar Ray, Limp Bizkit, Soulfly and Korn. Incubus _ which
also includes Brandon Boyd (vocals), DJ Chris Kilmore (turntables),
Dirk Lance (bass) and Jose Pasillas II (drums) _ also played a part
in the 1998 Family Values tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we started, there was a funky, hard-edged sound
around, but the only bands doing it were Primus and the Red Hot
Chili Peppers,'' Einziger, 23, said. ``That kind of went away and
punk got real big. Ever since then, we never fit in with any type
of scene.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, Incubus, which appears locally in December, is known
to go from a thrash anthem straight into a Jackson 5 cover, the
mosh-happy audience following along. On Nov. 6, the band embarks on
a five-week tour of North America supporting Primus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touring is all kinds of things,'' the guitarist says. ``It can
be exciting, it can be rigorous and even relaxing at times. It's an
intense experience.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, Einziger and company have been hanging at
home, finishing ``Make Yourself'' and looking forward to getting
back on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had nine months to sit at my house and think about how
much I love touring,'' Einziger said. ``I'm ready to get back out
there. But I love Calabasas. It's quiet and pretty. I could hang
out there all day and be very happy. I didn't appreciate it growing
up, but I think everybody in the band appreciates it now.'' &QL;

AFFLUENT FIND HOME AUCTIONS BEAT OPEN HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATTHEW YI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Calif. _ This might just be the cure for those who
want to sell their multimillion-dollar property without the
headache of waiting months or even years for the right buyer to
come along: auction it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the heir to a dried-fruit packing house did Tuesday.
Mark Mariani, the chairman and chief executive officer of Mariani
Fruit Inc., auctioned his five-bedroom ranch home and the 252-acre
lot surrounding it for $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The property, which sits just over the hills from the tony
Contra Costa County community of Blackhawk, also includes a guest
home, swimming pool and a private chapel with stain-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   Each prospective bidder was required to bring a $100,000
cashier's check to the auction and agree in writing to close the
deal within 30 days of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would be a unique way of merchandising
property,'' Mariani said. ``It's hassle free, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   The auction, held among 10 bidders and 40 observers sipping wine
on the west-side veranda of the main house, began with the
auctioneer rattling off dollar figures in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 30 minutes later, the property went to the highest
bidder, Julie Wallunas of Diablo. Including the fees to the auction
company, Wallunas' total bid was $3.44 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad I got it at the price that we got it for,''
Wallunas said as she was whisked away to a small bedroom to make
the initial $344,000 payment.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, she will have to pay the remainder of
the purchase price within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mariani said he also was satisfied with the price and was happy
that the property had been sold promptly.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of property at an auction is nothing new to Mariani.
</P>
<P>
   He recently bought a ranch home on a 600-acre lot in Shasta
County at an auction organized by the same company that
orchestrated Tuesday's auction, National Auction Group Inc. from
Gadsden, Ala. Mariani paid $1.9 million for that property.
</P>
<P>
   While some may feel uneasy about putting their high-priced
property up for auction, some real estate agents say the practice
is a growing trend among large estate owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a novel idea,'' said Vicky Campbell, of Alain
Pinel Realtors in Danville, who also attended the auction. ``It's
not easy selling properties like this. ... It's expensive, and it's
a long process.''
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, it's difficult finding buyers who can afford such
high-priced properties, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has a 122-acre ranch home east of Fremont that
has been on the market for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   And when the property doesn't sell right away, the owner's costs
can mount, mostly from advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, National Auction spent about two months advertising
through mailers and newspapers. The last two to three weeks were
spent showing the property to prospective bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The auction itself took less than 30 minutes, and that included
a five-minute break after three of the bidders asked for some time
to consult with their family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum started really quickly,'' said auction group
President William Bone, referring to the higher-than-expected first
bid of $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding rose to the $3 million mark in just a few minutes.
When the auction resumed after the brief break, about half of the
bidders didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Bone said his decade-old business had been picking up in recent
years. Last year, his company held 50 real estate auctions and this
year, the number jumped to 75. Next year, 100 are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bone's clients include celebrities such as Kenny Rogers,
who is planning to sell his 360-acre property in Athens, Ga., on
Nov. 4. Two years ago, Bone auctioned off a 10,000-acre ranch owned
by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, we've had to turn people back,'' Bone
said. ``Even today, I had some people ask me to come and see their
property.''

'20s MEET '90s IN `MAN OF THE CENTURY'  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating:   2 stars  
(Eds: for use Friday, Oct. 29 and thereafter. Fact box at bottom.) By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Man of the Century'' is one of those movies that just makes
you go, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished enough feature directing debut from Adam
Abraham, this low-budget, black-and-white whatsit has such an
arcane premise, it definitely puts the conceit back into the
concept of conceit.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick? The film's protagonist, a Runyon-esque 1920s
newspaper reporter (named, appropriately, Johnny Twennies), is
actually operating in '90s Manhattan. He says stuff like, ``Let's
fidget with the digit,'' writes on a manual typewriter and
chain-smokes like there's, well, no tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny's girlfriend Samantha (Susan Egan, of Broadway's ``Beauty
and the Beast'') is an art gallery worker who wonders why, after a
month of dating, she hasn't gotten any action. It's those
old-fashioned values of his, of course, although a gay couple finds
him more than a little intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the non-story involves Johnny trying to crack a big
corruption story before he loses his job. In pursuit of this
objective, he inexplicably winds up in a fantasy sequence wearing a
sailor suit at some Chinatown nightclub. That's one of the film's
more egregious Why moments.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser Whys keep popping up as Johnny runs into people who seem
to be in the same time warp that he is. This plays havoc with the
movie's internal logic: If there is indeed a parallel world from 75
years ago existing side-by-side with the contemporary one, how come
everybody from our time who encounters Johnny acts like they've
never seen anyone like him before?
</P>
<P>
   Gibson Frazier does a nice job as the fast-talking newshound,
but that ``Oh you kid'' jive gets mighty irritating after five
minutes. At feature length, it evokes the same, unhappy feeling you
got listening to ``Whiteboys' '' pale rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham fools around with images and icons from (mostly bad)
silent and early sound films, but he amuses himself much more than
he does us. Extra arcana is supplied by the appearance of Frank
Gorshin in bondage leather and Bobby Short as a washroom attendant.
</P>
<P>
   A formal experiment that might have worked better with a more
consistently applied rigor, ``Man of the Century'' should have been
given, somewhere along the production line, the old '23 skidoo. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
___ &QL; 
The film: ``Man of the Century'' (R; language, mild violence). &QL; 
The stars: Gibson Frazier, Susan Egan, Anthony Rapp, Cara Buono. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Adam Abraham. Written and produced
by Gibson Frazier and Abraham. Released by Fine Line Features. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 18 minutes. &QL;

MAN BEHIND NETSCAPE STARTS INTERNET SERVICE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ Netscape Communications co-founder Marc
Andreessen has launched a new company that is more mystery ship
than coming Internet juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference Tuesday, Andreessen, who in 1993
helped germinate the seeds of the first commercial Web browsing
software, said LoudCloud Inc. would provide an array of Internet
services to electronic commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what those services will be, Andreessen said, will be
announced in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Andreessen, who recently left his post as chief technology
officer at America Online to become an AOL consultant, did say the
company will help both new and existing e-commerce companies avoid
creating technological infrastructures from scratch. America Online
acquired Netscape in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce companies ``are forced to reinvent the wheel over and
over again,'' the 28-year-old Internet executive said, forcing the
companies to invest in ``huge technical teams, hire lots of
people.'' The result, Andreessen said, is a ``huge distraction to
the management team.''
</P>
<P>
   But he declined to define exactly what LoudCloud would do to
help companies avoid these pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   LoudCloud press releases have heralded the Internet ``all star''
team that Andreessen has recruited. This crew includes chief
executive Ben Horowitz, veteran leader of several divisions at
Netscape and AOL, and Tim Howes, a co-inventor of an array of
Internet directory technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Andreessen insists LoudCloud will be a ``relatively
unique'' creature, it does seem to have come from the same phylum
as many other Internet companies, ranging from startups like
BigStep, which allows small businesses to create e-commerce Web
sites, to giants like Microsoft and IBM, which have been
aggressively pitching Internet companies to contract out their
technological needs.

   An inspiring crowd-pleaser, ``Music of the Heart'' is based on
such a remarkable true story that it would take a complete hack to
mess it up. Fortunately, director Wes Craven makes good on his leap
from horror to the heartwarming, delivering a solid, if predictable
movie that will likely have audiences on their feet, a la ``Mr.
Holland's Opus.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's subject, violin teacher Roberta Guaspari, was
featured in the 1996 Oscar-nominated documentary, ``Small
Wonders.'' This time she is played by the formidable Meryl Streep,
which translates into a performance that's as close to real life as
any actor will come. Streep practiced violin four to six hours a
day and wound up playing the demanding instrument quite
convincingly throughout the movie. Forget all her film accents _
this is Streep's most impressive technical accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Guaspari was a military man's wife, moving with her Navy husband
from base to base. The film opens with the news that her husband is
leaving her and a grief-stricken Guaspari asking, ``What am I going
to do?'' Answers her practical mother (Cloris Leachman): ``Get a
job, any job.''
</P>
<P>
   The job Guaspari winds up taking is in East Harlem, where she
moves with her two young boys. She will be a (temporary) violin
teacher at an elementary school. She has little teaching experience
aside from schooling her own children, but she does possess one
important asset _ violins, 50 of them, in fact. Out of such small
origins, a thriving institution is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music of the Heart'' shows the genius behind Guaspari's
method. Doubters scoff that inner-city kids don't have the
discipline to learn the violin, but Guaspari believes that kids
want to succeed and will respond if challenged. She demands
attention, requiring her students to do things her way. She's
tough, too _ a class blackboard reads ``Do you LIKE the sound
you're making?'' _ but the kids listen and learn, delighted that
someone believes in their capacity to master a new talent.
</P>
<P>
   The film also delves into Guaspari's home life with her children
and love life with various suitors, including a wandering
journalist played by Aidan Quinn. Angela Bassett is persuasive as
the school's beleaguered principal, and singer Gloria Estefan has a
small role as a teacher sympathetic to Guaspari's cause.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand in a climactic scene at Carnegie Hall: famed
violinists Itzhak Perlman and Isaac Stern, as well as some of
Guaspari's actual students, being led in Bach's Concerto in D Minor
for Two Violins by, yes, Streep herself.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has enough melodrama for three films, but Craven keeps
the manipulation to a minimum, aside from a couple of shots of a
cute puppy dog. His greatest resource is Streep, who invests a
believable humanity into a character that, in lesser hands, would
have been rendered some sort of saint. It's hard to believe Madonna
was slated to play Guaspari. That, indeed, would have been a
scream, and not the kind that Craven appreciates. &QL;

   TAKE-BOS  
 EVANSTON, Ill: ...William F. Buckley Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wills spent six years as a Jesuit seminarian in the '50s and
remains an observant Catholic. The best way to understand his
politics, perhaps, is through his religion. ``It's important to
everything,'' he says of the church's influence on him. Figures
like Chesterton, St. Augustine, and Dorothy Day (the socially
radical and doctrinally conservative founder of the Catholic Worker
movement) have done more to shape Wills's politics than any elected
official or political theorist has.
</P>
<P>
   If Wills belongs to any school of thought, it's communitarianism
(he emphasizes the lower-case c, to distinguish his views from
those propounded by such upper-case Communitarians as the
contemporary liberal thinkers Amitai Etzioni and William Galston).
For Wills, an emphasis on the individual rather than on the
community endangers the spirit of both that individual and the
society she or he belongs to.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my papal sin book,'' Wills says, ``I've read several works
by Edith Stein (the Jewish-born Catholic nun who died at Auschwitz
and was canonized by John Paul II in 1998). Reading her, I
realized, yeah, this is what I've thought for a long time. She says
that our own self is born out of empathy with other selves. If it
weren't for that, we wouldn't have a self. That's a very strong and
important idea. It's in Augustine also. For me, I think the self's
interplay with other selves is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills was born in Atlanta. His father was a salesman, and the
family soon moved to the Midwest. Wills grew up in several towns in
Wisconsin and Michigan. Initially, he attended parochial schools.
``When my father went in the Army,'' he recalls, ``we moved to
Albion, Mich., where there was no Catholic school. I was way ahead
in the school there because the nuns had been so good. I had a very
good teacher there, Miss Beifuss _ she died about 10 years ago _
and she said, `Well, you're ahead, so don't waste your time here,
go to the school library and read.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson that has stood Wills in good stead. As he showed
during his Esquire days, he's no slouch at on-the-scene reporting.
What's most characteristic of his work, however, is Wills's
scrupulous attention to texts and thoroughness of research. ``I
spend a lot of time in libraries,'' Wills concedes. A book like
``Lincoln at Gettysburg'' or ``Inventing America'' (1978) is, in
effect, an extended exercise in close reading (of the Gettysburg
Address and the Declaration of Independence, respectively).
Conversely, Wills recalls his surprise at discovering that no one
before him had troubled to look up Newt Gingrich's doctoral
dissertation or Hillary Rodham Clinton's law review articles when
each came to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Wills attended a Jesuit high school and, impressed by his
teachers, decided to enter the seminary. ``For five years I was
completely cut off, no radio, TV, or newspapers,'' he recalls. ``It
seemed natural for a while, but I guess I missed (the outside
world) toward the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That cloistering helped make him a journalist. Sent for the
summer to a facility that did allow students access to secular
writing, Wills came across a stack of old Time magazines and went
through them in two days. The ``sleazy righteousness'' of Time
style so offended him he eventually wrote a critique that he sent
to National Review (one of the few magazines he was familiar with,
thanks to its staunch anticommunism).
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Buckley himself telephoned Wills to accept
the piece and urge him to come to New York. Wills, who had recently
left the seminary (``It was eros specifically and generally,'' he
once told an interviewer), immediately agreed. Thus was a career
born. ``I didn't plan it this way,'' Wills says with a smile.
``It's largely (been) accident, but I'm happy with the accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what the former seminarian who spent the summer of
1957 serving as culture editor at America's foremost conservative
publication would make of ``A Necessary Evil,'' a stoutly liberal
defense of the value of government. Wills began the book in 1994 at
the height of the term-limits movement. Those days now seem as
distant as Gingrich's speakership, but Wills isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superficially things have changed, but I don't think they have
deeply. The antigovernmental feeling runs through so much of our
lives. . . . That's why America is the only major industrialized
nation without any health care. All that people have to say is
`Socialized medicine: The government's coming, the government's
coming!' Or campaign finance reform . . . as if it would be
depotism for the government to say you can't give more than x
amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what will follow the papal sin book. ``There are
things I would have liked to write long ago,'' Wills says, ``but
there hasn't been an editor interested enough so that he or she
would give me a good enough advance!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ideas to last two lifetimes
</P>
<P>
   Prospective book topics include James Wilson, the unsung hero of
the Constitutional Convention; the Supreme Court; the historian
Henry Adams; Verdi's Shakespeare operas; the fusing of religion and
violence in the films of Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, and Paul
Schrader; and a mystery novel (it would be Wills's second _ his
first, ``At Button's,'' appeared in 1979). ``I'll never write half
the books I've thought about doing,'' he laments.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mourning volumes unwritten, the rest of us are
likelier to marvel that someone so myriad-minded has managed to
write as many books as Wills has.
</P>
<P>
   Writing once about Dorothy Day, Wills posed this question:
``What would a job applicant trying to fill her shoes choose as his
or her title?'' His answer, when asked that question, comes softly
but with hardly any hesitation: ``student.'' And that student's
curriculum would consist of? ``Oh, all kinds of things,'' Wills
says. ``That's why I insist on `student.' I can't imagine limiting
myself to one thing. Everything leads to everything else. Their
interaction is what's so fascinating.''

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the battleship New Jersey is being towed
from Washington state, where it has been in mothballs for years, to
the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The towing of the New Jersey from Puget Sound Naval Inactive
Ships Facility at Bremerton, Wash., began Sept. 12. ``Big J,''
pulled by the tug Sea Victory, entered the Panama Canal's western
end Oct. 16, and exited four days later on the eastern end. Arrival
at the Naval Inactive Ships Facility in Philadelphia is expected on
or about Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The battleship, the most-decorated in U.S. Navy history, is
destined to become a floating museum and memorial in the state for
which it is named, assuming the Navy releases the ship to the
Battleship New Jersey Commission. The most likely site is the
soon-to-be-former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne. Jersey City
and Camden also were contenders for the permanent site.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the battleship's official status is ``category
X'' on the Naval Vessels Register, meaning ``Stricken, on donation
hold as a museum or memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the New Jersey can be found online at the
Battleship New Jersey Historical Museum Society's Web site:
www.quuxuum.org/bnj/
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Jim Gray interview with Pete Rose after the All-Century
Team festivities prior to Game 2 of the World Series was a low
blow. Many of us are outraged. How can we contact Gray and NBC to
let them know how inappropriate we think it was?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Gray and/or NBC Sports at this address: NBC, 30
Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112. Or call 212-664-4444 (main
switchboard) or 212-664-2333 (audience line).
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported several times lately that the South Pole
is the coldest place on Earth. In World War II, when I was
preparing for the North African desert, I was stationed at Camp
Young, in California's Mojave Desert. We were told that it was the
hottest place in North America. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It does get hot in the Mojave, but Greenland Ranch, in
California, holds the record for the highest temperature ever
officially recorded in the United States: 134 degrees F. It
occurred on July 10, 1913. This station is in the below-sea-level
Death Valley, to the north of the Mojave.
</P>
<P>
   As steamy as it was at Greenland Ranch back in 1913, it wasn't
quite as hot as the high temperature of 136 degrees F reached on
Sept. 13, 1922, at Azizia, Tripolitania, in Libya. According to The
Weather Almanac, that temperature is generally accepted as the
world's highest recorded under standard conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a boy, I remember my father telling me what an injustice
was done to those of Japanese heritage living in the United States
or serving with U.S. forces during World War II. Now I see that
ground has been broken for a Japanese American Memorial in
Washington. How can I make a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Donations are welcomed for the memorial, to be built on
government-donated land in the shadow of the Capitol. Send your
check to: National Japanese American Memorial Foundation, 1920 N
St. NW, Washington, DC 20036. Make your check out to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question concerns the F-117 Stealth shot down over Serbia
earlier this year. Conspicuously absent from the news reports was
any mention of what became of the wreckage. Was it recovered or
destroyed by U.S. forces, or did it fall into the hands of the
Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter. Articles at the time did report it, and TV
footage and still photos showed Serbs examining large pieces of the
wreckage after the F-117 Nighthawk fighter-bomber was downed March
27.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing April 20, U.S. military authorities were
asked if there was any concern about Yugoslavia sending parts of
the aircraft to Russia for analysis of America's ``low observable''
(commonly termed ``stealth'') technology. Air Force Maj. Gen. Bruce
Carlson responded that this particular aircraft employed
long-outmoded technologies, and what little could be discerned from
the pieces wouldn't be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically why U.S. pilots didn't bomb the Nighthawk's
wreckage to prevent its study by enemies, Carlson explained that
the plane crashed in a remote location, and he wasn't sure that the
commander in the field felt it was worth the risk ``to try and go
in there and bomb it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Social Security pays $250 in death benefits?
How does one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The amount actually is $255. It's a one-time payment made
when a person dies if that person has enough work credits, said
Patti Patterson of the Social Security Administration. The payment
can be made only to that person's spouse or minor children if they
meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the requirements, and about procedures for
applying for the benefit, can be obtained from any local Social
Security office or by calling 1-800-772-1213.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article indicated that the Oct. 19 telecast of the
11-inning Braves-Mets baseball game had a national Nielsen rating
of 15.4, highest for a League Championship Series since the
Braves-Phillies drew a 17.4 rating in 1993. Can you list the 10
programs with the highest Nielsen ratings ever, whether they were
sports or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nielsen Media Research lists these: ``MASH Special,'' CBS,
Feb. 28, 1983, 60.2; ``Dallas,'' CBS, Nov. 21, 1980, 53.3;
``Roots,'' part VIII, ABC, Jan. 30, 1977, 51.1; Super Bowl XVI,
CBS, Jan. 24, 1982, 49.1; Super Bowl XVII, NBC, Jan. 30, 1983,
48.6; XVII Winter Olympics, CBS, Feb. 23, 1994, 48.5; Super Bowl
XX, NBC, Jan. 26, 1986, 48.3; ``Gone With the Wind,'' Part 1, NBC,
Nov. 7, 1976, 47.7; ``Gone With the Wind,'' Part 2, NBC, Nov. 8,
1976, 47.4; and Super Bowl XII, CBS, Jan. 15, 1978, 47.2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently heard about a recall of Hotpoint dishwashers. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: GE Appliances is recalling about 3.1 million GE and Hotpoint
brand dishwashers of certain models manufactured between April 1983
and January 1989. They have a slide switch that allows consumers to
choose between heat drying and energy saver functions. Over time,
the slide switch can melt and ignite, posing a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled machines are model GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540,
HDA467, HDA477 or HDA487 with a serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z (for example, BM12345). The model
and serial numbers are on a rectangular label on either the right
or left front edge of the inner tub.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are advised to stop using the recalled dishwashers
immediately, and to keep the dishwasher door unlatched to prevent
the flow of electric current from the latch to the slide switch.
</P>
<P>
   GE is offering consumers a rebate toward the purchase of a new
dishwasher. Call 1-800-599-2929 or check online at
www.geappliancerecall.com for information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain an Atlanta Braves-New York Yankees World
Series program? I don't live anywhere near either city and can't
attend the games.
</P>
<P>
   A: World Series programs and other official merchandise can be
obtained from the Atlanta Braves Clubhouse Catalog (1-800-433-2728)
and from Major League Baseball (1-800-694-9444). Programs cost $10
from either source, plus fees for tax, postage and handling. Orders
for programs and other playoff and World Series merchandise also
can be placed online with Major League Baseball's store,
shopmlb.sportsline.com/sportsstore/
</P>
<P>
   Another officially licensed source is OfficialStuff.com, which
also sells programs for such events as the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup
finals, NBA finals and Olympics. Information: 1-888-677-8833 or

</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the widows of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek
still living? Where? Ages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both are still living, but neither one makes public
appearances. Madame Chaing Kai-shek, who observed her 101st
birthday earlier this year, is said to be in a wheelchair most of
her waking hours at her duplex apartment near New York's Gracie
Square. On the occasion of her birthday in May, the New York Post
reported that she's attended to around the clock by three nurses,
along with several personal attaches and plainclothes guards. The
Post quoted a recent visitor as saying Chiang was less talkative
than she had been the year before, when she questioned him about
Taiwanese politics and joked about tea and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jean MacArthur, meanwhile, observed her 100th birthday last Dec.
28. She also lives quietly in New York, in the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel. As Q&AMP;A reported earlier this year, she has shunned the
limelight for years, never appearing on talk shows and rarely
turning up in celebrity columns. Col. Bill Davis of the MacArthur
Library Archives and Memorial in Norfolk, Va., described her as
being in good health. But other than that, he chose not to describe
her activities, saying only that she is ``very much a private
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I grew up in the Midwest, where hockey was common. I always
thought the ice had to be 3 or 4 inches thick, but I heard on the
radio that it's only a half-inch thick at the new Philips Arena in
Atlanta. Can you check on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Philips ice is one inch thick. It's built up in three
steps, and is kept at 14 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article described an exhibit in Charlotte,
N.C., of art glass created by Dale Chihuly of Seattle. If this is a
traveling exhibit?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a traveling exhibit. A number of exhibitions of the
glass artisan's works are planned in various locations for the
remainder of this year, and next year, however. So if you're in
Tacoma, Wash., between now and Jan. 9, for example, you can view
some at the Washington State Historical Society. Now through Nov.
7, a group exhibition including Chihuly works will be shown at the
Oklahoma City Art Museum. Another group show is at Gibbes Museum of
Art in Charleston, S.C., until Dec. 19. The Indianapolis Museum of
Art's Columbus Gallery in Columbus, Ind., is showing works until
Jan. 2. And the Habatat Gallery in Boca Raton, Fla., has a Chihuly
exhibition going on into the year 2000 (end date not yet known).
</P>
<P>
   Next year's schedule includes a group show at the Mobile (Ala.)
Museum of Art, Jan. 14-March 15; and installations at the Knoxville
(Tenn.) Museum of Art, July 1-Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Chihuly Studio in Seattle is closed to the public, but you
can get information by calling 206-781-8707 or online at
www.chihuly.com/ Q: In all the news reports about the physician who
was airlifted from the South Pole, I haven't seen any mention of
the nature of the research being done there. What are the
scientists up to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Antarctic Program is undertaking nearly 150 research
projects at the three U.S. stations (McMurdo, Amundsen-Scott South
Pole, and Palmer), aboard its two research ships (Laurance M. Gould
and Nathaniel B. Palmer) in the Ross Sea, at remote field camps,
and in cooperation with the national Antarctic programs of other
Antarctic Treaty nations. General research subjects include
astronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and
geophysics, glaciology, ocean and climate studies, and
environmental research. Human research focuses on the effect of
isolated and confined environments on human physiology and social
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also conducts missions in Antarctica, including
microbiology in the Dry Valleys, diving in McMurdo Sound and the
Dry Valley lakes, weather and ozone studies, and
communications/satellite projects aimed at improving telephone, TV
and other data services.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the research is available online at the
National Science Foundation's Web site, www.nsf.gov (click on Polar
Research), or call 703-306-1070. Issues of the Antarctic Journal of
the United States with reports by investigators about recent
research projects can be viewed online at

<P>
   Q: Like most Braves fans, I thought I hated Mets manager Bobby
Valentine and all the players. But they truly gained my respect and
admiration for the outstanding series they played. How can we write
to say we appreciate their worthy efforts, and we feel for the way
they lost?
</P>
<P>
   A: What a gracious gesture. The address: New York Mets, Shea
Stadium, Flushing, NY 11368.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best advice about giving out one's Social Security
number?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration spells out its
recommendations in Publication No. 05-10002 (viewable online at
www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html). It says the agency can't prevent
others from asking for your number, but notes that having the
number doesn't give anyone access to your Social Security records
(they're private unless disclosure to another government agency is
required by law).
</P>
<P>
   The publication adds the obvious, that if a business requests
your number and you refuse to provide it, you may have to do
without the purchase or service for which your number was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: ``Our primary message is this: Be careful with
your Social Security number and your card, and protect their
privacy whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an article several months ago about the health
benefits derived from eating blueberries. What is in blueberries
that gets the credit? Is this ingredient available in pill form?
</P>
<P>
   A: Blueberries contain phenolic acids, compounds that help
suppress lung, skin and liver cancer cells in laboratory animals,
said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia State University's
department of nutrition and a spokesperson for the American
Dietetic Association. They also contain plant chemicals, fiber and
vitamins considered valuable in fighting disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the helpful compounds can't be distilled out and made into
pill form, Rosenbloom said you'd be doing yourself a favor by
eating a variety of fruits and vegetables _ blueberries included _
for their health-giving properties. ``Don't think about finding
something in pill form,'' she advised. ``Instead, increase your
consumption of fruits and vegetables for the biggest health
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell us Joe Torre's complete managerial history?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the scoop: 1977-81, New York Mets (player-manager May
31-June 17, 1977); 1982-84, Atlanta Braves; Aug. 1, 1990-June 16,
1995, St. Louis Cardinals; 1996-present, New York Yankees. From
1985 through July 31, 1990, Torre was a TV broadcaster for the
California Angels. He also managed the 1997 American League
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Torre is the fourth manager to wear both Yankees
and Mets uniforms, joining Yogi Berra, Dallas Green and Casey
Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Andrew Young had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer, and would undergo surgery in December. Why
wait?
</P>
<P>
   A: The main reason the 67-year-old former ambassador and his
physicians agreed on the delay is because the problem was detected
early, said Lee Echols, Young's spokesman. That detection gave him
more options than if it had been detected later. The mid-December
date also enables Young to complete some obligations, such as
scheduled appearances, and it gives him the holiday season to begin
his recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Echols reiterated Young's previous statement that he had gone
public with the news about his prostate cancer in part to encourage
middle-age and older men to get checks for prostate problems. ``So
he is quickly becoming another kind of ambassador,'' Echols said,
``this time an ambassador for prostate screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How and when can fans get tickets to the baseball All-Star
Game in Atlanta next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Be patient. The only way you can be assured of a ticket is by
purchasing season tickets to next season's Braves games. And
information about season tickets for 2000 won't be available before
December. The number to call in December: 404-577-9100. At this
point, all the Braves are saying about individual tickets to the
All-Star Game is that information will be released ``at a later
date.'' The game will be played July 11 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the recent earthquake in Southern California
said it registered magnitude 7.0 and was ``three times stronger
than the 6.7 Northridge quake,'' referring to a 1994 earthquake
also in California. How could magnitude 7.0 be three times 6.7?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Richter scale uses a logarithmic basis. In the scale,
magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions. As
the U.S. Geological Survey explains, because of the logarithmic
basis, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold
increase in measured amplitude (ground motion 10 times greater than
that represented by the next lower number). As an estimate of
energy, each whole number in the magnitude scale corresponds to the
release of about 30-31 times more energy than the amount associated
with the preceding whole number value.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, in an earthquake of magnitude 7, the ground moves
10 times as much as it moves in a quake of magnitude 6. And an
earthquake of magnitude 7 releases about 30-31 times the energy
released by a quake of magnitude 6.

<P>
   Q: When Dr. Jerri Nielsen was airlifted from the South Pole, she
was replaced by another physician. I haven't seen that doctor's
name in the media. Is his or her identity being kept secret?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Robert Thompson of Harrisburg, Pa., took Nielsen's place.
His identity wasn't intended to be a secret, and in fact he has
been granting interviews to the media, said Mary Hanson of the
National Science Foundation, which operates the U.S. research
stations in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles about Dr. Jerri Nielsen, who was rescued from the
South Pole recently so she could be treated for breast cancer,
called it the coldest place on Earth. I'm confused about this.
Isn't the North Pole just as cold?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The reason, as explained by Von Woods of the National
Weather Service, is elevation. The South Pole research station is
on a hard, rocky plateau, at an elevation of 9,000-plus feet, while
the North Pole is just above sea level. Just like anywhere else,
the recorded temperatures are lower at the higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   Several stations at Antarctica have been recording temperatures
since 1957. A world record low, 128.6 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, was recorded at Vostok (Russian station) on July 21,
1983. At America's Amundsen-Scott station, on a snow plain within a
few hundred yards of the geographical south pole, the average
annual temperature from 1957 through 1964 was 59 degrees below zero
F.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, that makes the coldest temperature ever recorded
in the United States _ 79.8 degrees below zero F, on Jan. 23, 1971,
at Prospect Creek Camp in Alaska's Endicott Mountains _ seem almost
mild.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've followed Tom Brokaw's career with interest over the
years, and have just finished reading his book, ``The Greatest
Generation.'' How can I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Tom Brokaw, c/o NBC News, 30 Rockefeller Plaza,
New York, NY 10112-0002.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ABC's ``World News Tonight'' recently did a segment about
baseball and mentioned that the first baseball commissioner was
Kennesaw Mountain Landis. Can you give me any information about
him? There must be some connection to Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is indeed a connection, but the commissioner's name was
spelled Kenesaw, not Kennesaw. There's an explanation for this;
read on. But first, some general information about the man.
</P>
<P>
   Landis became baseball's first commissioner _ and absolute ruler
of the sport _ when he took office in January 1921, after the
Chicago White Sox scandal in which members of the team threw the
1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. His mandate was to deal
as he saw fit with anything deemed detrimental to baseball. His
decisions, and penalties, were to be binding, with no recourse to
the courts. The eight ``Black Sox,'' as they soon were dubbed, were
the first to feel Landis' wrath when they were expelled from
baseball for life.
</P>
<P>
   And about the spelling of the name: Previously a U.S. district
judge, Landis was given his unusual moniker by his father, Abraham
Landis, a Union soldier in the Civil War who was wounded at the
Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia. Apparently his father's
recollection of the spelling of Kennesaw was faulty, hence the
single ``n.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis was born on Nov. 20, 1866, in Millville, Ohio. He died on
Nov. 25, 1944, in Chicago. He was elected in 1944 to baseball's
Hall of Fame by the Committee on Baseball Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The PBS television program ``The NewsHour'' has two new
reporters, Gwen Ifill and Ray Suarez. Did they replace anyone, or
are they just new members of the show's staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been several changes in the recent past, said Sara
Hope Franks, spokeswoman for ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,''
which is entering its 25th year on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Ifill (formerly of NBC) and Suarez (formerly of National Public
Radio's ``Talk of the Nation'') joined veteran journalists
Elizabeth Farnsworth and Margaret Warner as the program's senior
correspondents on Oct. 4. Phil Ponce left ``The NewsHour'' in July
to become anchor of WTTG's ``Chicago Tonight,'' where he had served
as correspondent and subanchor prior to ``The NewsHour,'' Franks
added.
</P>
<P>
   The senior correspondents share the same duties: conducting
newsmaker interviews and studio discussions, reporting from the
field, and serving as backup anchor to Lehrer, the award-winning
program's executive editor and anchor.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the battleship New Jersey is being towed
from Washington state, where it has been in mothballs for years, to
the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Do you have any information about this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The towing of the New Jersey from Puget Sound Naval Inactive
Ships Facility at Bremerton, Wash., began Sept. 12. ``Big J,''
pulled by the tug Sea Victory, entered the Panama Canal's western
end Oct. 16, and exited four days later on the eastern end. Arrival
at the Naval Inactive Ships Facility in Philadelphia is expected on
or about Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The battleship, the most-decorated in U.S. Navy history, is
destined to become a floating museum and memorial in the state for
which it is named, assuming the Navy releases the ship to the
Battleship New Jersey Commission. The most likely site is the
soon-to-be-former Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne. Jersey City
and Camden also were contenders for the permanent site.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the battleship's official status is ``category
X'' on the Naval Vessels Register, meaning ``Stricken, on donation
hold as a museum or memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Information about the New Jersey can be found online at the
Battleship New Jersey Historical Museum Society's Web site:
www.quuxuum.org/bnj/
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Jim Gray interview with Pete Rose after the All-Century
Team festivities prior to Game 2 of the World Series was a low
blow. Many of us are outraged. How can we contact Gray and NBC to
let them know how inappropriate we think it was?
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Gray and/or NBC Sports at this address: NBC, 30
Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112. Or call 212-664-4444 (main
switchboard) or 212-664-2333 (audience line).
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported several times lately that the South Pole
is the coldest place on Earth. In World War II, when I was
preparing for the North African desert, I was stationed at Camp
Young, in California's Mojave Desert. We were told that it was the
hottest place in North America. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: It does get hot in the Mojave, but Greenland Ranch, in
California, holds the record for the highest temperature ever
officially recorded in the United States: 134 degrees F. It
occurred on July 10, 1913. This station is in the below-sea-level
Death Valley, to the north of the Mojave.
</P>
<P>
   As steamy as it was at Greenland Ranch back in 1913, it wasn't
quite as hot as the high temperature of 136 degrees F reached on
Sept. 13, 1922, at Azizia, Tripolitania, in Libya. According to The
Weather Almanac, that temperature is generally accepted as the
world's highest recorded under standard conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a boy, I remember my father telling me what an injustice
was done to those of Japanese heritage living in the United States
or serving with U.S. forces during World War II. Now I see that
ground has been broken for a Japanese American Memorial in
Washington. How can I make a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Donations are welcomed for the memorial, to be built on
government-donated land in the shadow of the Capitol. Send your
check to: National Japanese American Memorial Foundation, 1920 N
St. NW, Washington, DC 20036. Make your check out to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My question concerns the F-117 Stealth shot down over Serbia
earlier this year. Conspicuously absent from the news reports was
any mention of what became of the wreckage. Was it recovered or
destroyed by U.S. forces, or did it fall into the hands of the
Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   A: The latter. Articles at the time did report it, and TV
footage and still photos showed Serbs examining large pieces of the
wreckage after the F-117 Nighthawk fighter-bomber was downed March
27.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing April 20, U.S. military authorities were
asked if there was any concern about Yugoslavia sending parts of
the aircraft to Russia for analysis of America's ``low observable''
(commonly termed ``stealth'') technology. Air Force Maj. Gen. Bruce
Carlson responded that this particular aircraft employed
long-outmoded technologies, and what little could be discerned from
the pieces wouldn't be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Asked specifically why U.S. pilots didn't bomb the Nighthawk's
wreckage to prevent its study by enemies, Carlson explained that
the plane crashed in a remote location, and he wasn't sure that the
commander in the field felt it was worth the risk ``to try and go
in there and bomb it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Social Security pays $250 in death benefits?
How does one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The amount actually is $255. It's a one-time payment made
when a person dies if that person has enough work credits, said
Patti Patterson of the Social Security Administration. The payment
can be made only to that person's spouse or minor children if they
meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Information on the requirements, and about procedures for
applying for the benefit, can be obtained from any local Social
Security office or by calling 1-800-772-1213.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article indicated that the Oct. 19 telecast of the
11-inning Braves-Mets baseball game had a national Nielsen rating
of 15.4, highest for a League Championship Series since the
Braves-Phillies drew a 17.4 rating in 1993. Can you list the 10
programs with the highest Nielsen ratings ever, whether they were
sports or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nielsen Media Research lists these: ``MASH Special,'' CBS,
Feb. 28, 1983, 60.2; ``Dallas,'' CBS, Nov. 21, 1980, 53.3;
``Roots,'' part VIII, ABC, Jan. 30, 1977, 51.1; Super Bowl XVI,
CBS, Jan. 24, 1982, 49.1; Super Bowl XVII, NBC, Jan. 30, 1983,
48.6; XVII Winter Olympics, CBS, Feb. 23, 1994, 48.5; Super Bowl
XX, NBC, Jan. 26, 1986, 48.3; ``Gone With the Wind,'' Part 1, NBC,
Nov. 7, 1976, 47.7; ``Gone With the Wind,'' Part 2, NBC, Nov. 8,
1976, 47.4; and Super Bowl XII, CBS, Jan. 15, 1978, 47.2.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently heard about a recall of Hotpoint dishwashers. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: GE Appliances is recalling about 3.1 million GE and Hotpoint
brand dishwashers of certain models manufactured between April 1983
and January 1989. They have a slide switch that allows consumers to
choose between heat drying and energy saver functions. Over time,
the slide switch can melt and ignite, posing a fire hazard.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled machines are model GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540,
HDA467, HDA477 or HDA487 with a serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z (for example, BM12345). The model
and serial numbers are on a rectangular label on either the right
or left front edge of the inner tub.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are advised to stop using the recalled dishwashers
immediately, and to keep the dishwasher door unlatched to prevent
the flow of electric current from the latch to the slide switch.
</P>
<P>
   GE is offering consumers a rebate toward the purchase of a new
dishwasher. Call 1-800-599-2929 or check online at
www.geappliancerecall.com for information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I obtain an Atlanta Braves-New York Yankees World
Series program? I don't live anywhere near either city and can't
attend the games.
</P>
<P>
   A: World Series programs and other official merchandise can be
obtained from the Atlanta Braves Clubhouse Catalog (1-800-433-2728)
and from Major League Baseball (1-800-694-9444). Programs cost $10
from either source, plus fees for tax, postage and handling. Orders
for programs and other playoff and World Series merchandise also
can be placed online with Major League Baseball's store,
shopmlb.sportsline.com/sportsstore/
</P>
<P>
   Another officially licensed source is OfficialStuff.com, which
also sells programs for such events as the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup
finals, NBA finals and Olympics. Information: 1-888-677-8833 or

</P>
<P>
   Q: Are the widows of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek
still living? Where? Ages?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both are still living, but neither one makes public
appearances. Madame Chaing Kai-shek, who observed her 101st
birthday earlier this year, is said to be in a wheelchair most of
her waking hours at her duplex apartment near New York's Gracie
Square. On the occasion of her birthday in May, the New York Post
reported that she's attended to around the clock by three nurses,
along with several personal attaches and plainclothes guards. The
Post quoted a recent visitor as saying Chiang was less talkative
than she had been the year before, when she questioned him about
Taiwanese politics and joked about tea and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jean MacArthur, meanwhile, observed her 100th birthday last Dec.
28. She also lives quietly in New York, in the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel. As Q&AMP;A reported earlier this year, she has shunned the
limelight for years, never appearing on talk shows and rarely
turning up in celebrity columns. Col. Bill Davis of the MacArthur
Library Archives and Memorial in Norfolk, Va., described her as
being in good health. But other than that, he chose not to describe
her activities, saying only that she is ``very much a private
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I grew up in the Midwest, where hockey was common. I always
thought the ice had to be 3 or 4 inches thick, but I heard on the
radio that it's only a half-inch thick at the new Philips Arena in
Atlanta. Can you check on this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Philips ice is one inch thick. It's built up in three
steps, and is kept at 14 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent newspaper article described an exhibit in Charlotte,
N.C., of art glass created by Dale Chihuly of Seattle. If this is a
traveling exhibit?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is a traveling exhibit. A number of exhibitions of the
glass artisan's works are planned in various locations for the
remainder of this year, and next year, however. So if you're in
Tacoma, Wash., between now and Jan. 9, for example, you can view
some at the Washington State Historical Society. Now through Nov.
7, a group exhibition including Chihuly works will be shown at the
Oklahoma City Art Museum. Another group show is at Gibbes Museum of
Art in Charleston, S.C., until Dec. 19. The Indianapolis Museum of
Art's Columbus Gallery in Columbus, Ind., is showing works until
Jan. 2. And the Habatat Gallery in Boca Raton, Fla., has a Chihuly
exhibition going on into the year 2000 (end date not yet known).
</P>
<P>
   Next year's schedule includes a group show at the Mobile (Ala.)
Museum of Art, Jan. 14-March 15; and installations at the Knoxville
(Tenn.) Museum of Art, July 1-Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Chihuly Studio in Seattle is closed to the public, but you
can get information by calling 206-781-8707 or online at
www.chihuly.com/ Q: In all the news reports about the physician who
was airlifted from the South Pole, I haven't seen any mention of
the nature of the research being done there. What are the
scientists up to?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Antarctic Program is undertaking nearly 150 research
projects at the three U.S. stations (McMurdo, Amundsen-Scott South
Pole, and Palmer), aboard its two research ships (Laurance M. Gould
and Nathaniel B. Palmer) in the Ross Sea, at remote field camps,
and in cooperation with the national Antarctic programs of other
Antarctic Treaty nations. General research subjects include
astronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and
geophysics, glaciology, ocean and climate studies, and
environmental research. Human research focuses on the effect of
isolated and confined environments on human physiology and social
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also conducts missions in Antarctica, including
microbiology in the Dry Valleys, diving in McMurdo Sound and the
Dry Valley lakes, weather and ozone studies, and
communications/satellite projects aimed at improving telephone, TV
and other data services.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the research is available online at the
National Science Foundation's Web site, www.nsf.gov (click on Polar
Research), or call 703-306-1070. Issues of the Antarctic Journal of
the United States with reports by investigators about recent
research projects can be viewed online at

   Q: Like most Braves fans, I thought I hated Mets manager Bobby
Valentine and all the players. But they truly gained my respect and
admiration for the outstanding series they played. How can we write
to say we appreciate their worthy efforts, and we feel for the way
they lost?
</P>
<P>
   A: What a gracious gesture. The address: New York Mets, Shea
Stadium, Flushing, NY 11368.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best advice about giving out one's Social Security
number?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration spells out its
recommendations in Publication No. 05-10002 (viewable online at
www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html). It says the agency can't prevent
others from asking for your number, but notes that having the
number doesn't give anyone access to your Social Security records
(they're private unless disclosure to another government agency is
required by law).
</P>
<P>
   The publication adds the obvious, that if a business requests
your number and you refuse to provide it, you may have to do
without the purchase or service for which your number was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion: ``Our primary message is this: Be careful with
your Social Security number and your card, and protect their
privacy whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an article several months ago about the health
benefits derived from eating blueberries. What is in blueberries
that gets the credit? Is this ingredient available in pill form?
</P>
<P>
   A: Blueberries contain phenolic acids, compounds that help
suppress lung, skin and liver cancer cells in laboratory animals,
said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia State University's
department of nutrition and a spokesperson for the American
Dietetic Association. They also contain plant chemicals, fiber and
vitamins considered valuable in fighting disease.
</P>
<P>
   While the helpful compounds can't be distilled out and made into
pill form, Rosenbloom said you'd be doing yourself a favor by
eating a variety of fruits and vegetables _ blueberries included _
for their health-giving properties. ``Don't think about finding
something in pill form,'' she advised. ``Instead, increase your
consumption of fruits and vegetables for the biggest health
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell us Joe Torre's complete managerial history?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's the scoop: 1977-81, New York Mets (player-manager May
31-June 17, 1977); 1982-84, Atlanta Braves; Aug. 1, 1990-June 16,
1995, St. Louis Cardinals; 1996-present, New York Yankees. From
1985 through July 31, 1990, Torre was a TV broadcaster for the
California Angels. He also managed the 1997 American League
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: Torre is the fourth manager to wear both Yankees
and Mets uniforms, joining Yogi Berra, Dallas Green and Casey
Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Andrew Young had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer, and would undergo surgery in December. Why
wait?
</P>
<P>
   A: The main reason the 67-year-old former ambassador and his
physicians agreed on the delay is because the problem was detected
early, said Lee Echols, Young's spokesman. That detection gave him
more options than if it had been detected later. The mid-December
date also enables Young to complete some obligations, such as
scheduled appearances, and it gives him the holiday season to begin
his recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Echols reiterated Young's previous statement that he had gone
public with the news about his prostate cancer in part to encourage
middle-age and older men to get checks for prostate problems. ``So
he is quickly becoming another kind of ambassador,'' Echols said,
``this time an ambassador for prostate screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How and when can fans get tickets to the baseball All-Star
Game in Atlanta next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Be patient. The only way you can be assured of a ticket is by
purchasing season tickets to next season's Braves games. And
information about season tickets for 2000 won't be available before
December. The number to call in December: 404-577-9100. At this
point, all the Braves are saying about individual tickets to the
All-Star Game is that information will be released ``at a later
date.'' The game will be played July 11 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the recent earthquake in Southern California
said it registered magnitude 7.0 and was ``three times stronger
than the 6.7 Northridge quake,'' referring to a 1994 earthquake
also in California. How could magnitude 7.0 be three times 6.7?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Richter scale uses a logarithmic basis. In the scale,
magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions. As
the U.S. Geological Survey explains, because of the logarithmic
basis, each whole number increase in magnitude represents a tenfold
increase in measured amplitude (ground motion 10 times greater than
that represented by the next lower number). As an estimate of
energy, each whole number in the magnitude scale corresponds to the
release of about 30-31 times more energy than the amount associated
with the preceding whole number value.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, in an earthquake of magnitude 7, the ground moves
10 times as much as it moves in a quake of magnitude 6. And an
earthquake of magnitude 7 releases about 30-31 times the energy
released by a quake of magnitude 6.

   Q: When Dr. Jerri Nielsen was airlifted from the South Pole, she
was replaced by another physician. I haven't seen that doctor's
name in the media. Is his or her identity being kept secret?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Robert Thompson of Harrisburg, Pa., took Nielsen's place.
His identity wasn't intended to be a secret, and in fact he has
been granting interviews to the media, said Mary Hanson of the
National Science Foundation, which operates the U.S. research
stations in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles about Dr. Jerri Nielsen, who was rescued from the
South Pole recently so she could be treated for breast cancer,
called it the coldest place on Earth. I'm confused about this.
Isn't the North Pole just as cold?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The reason, as explained by Von Woods of the National
Weather Service, is elevation. The South Pole research station is
on a hard, rocky plateau, at an elevation of 9,000-plus feet, while
the North Pole is just above sea level. Just like anywhere else,
the recorded temperatures are lower at the higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   Several stations at Antarctica have been recording temperatures
since 1957. A world record low, 128.6 degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, was recorded at Vostok (Russian station) on July 21,
1983. At America's Amundsen-Scott station, on a snow plain within a
few hundred yards of the geographical south pole, the average
annual temperature from 1957 through 1964 was 59 degrees below zero
F.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, that makes the coldest temperature ever recorded
in the United States _ 79.8 degrees below zero F, on Jan. 23, 1971,
at Prospect Creek Camp in Alaska's Endicott Mountains _ seem almost
mild.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've followed Tom Brokaw's career with interest over the
years, and have just finished reading his book, ``The Greatest
Generation.'' How can I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The address: Tom Brokaw, c/o NBC News, 30 Rockefeller Plaza,
New York, NY 10112-0002.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ABC's ``World News Tonight'' recently did a segment about
baseball and mentioned that the first baseball commissioner was
Kennesaw Mountain Landis. Can you give me any information about
him? There must be some connection to Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is indeed a connection, but the commissioner's name was
spelled Kenesaw, not Kennesaw. There's an explanation for this;
read on. But first, some general information about the man.
</P>
<P>
   Landis became baseball's first commissioner _ and absolute ruler
of the sport _ when he took office in January 1921, after the
Chicago White Sox scandal in which members of the team threw the
1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. His mandate was to deal
as he saw fit with anything deemed detrimental to baseball. His
decisions, and penalties, were to be binding, with no recourse to
the courts. The eight ``Black Sox,'' as they soon were dubbed, were
the first to feel Landis' wrath when they were expelled from
baseball for life.
</P>
<P>
   And about the spelling of the name: Previously a U.S. district
judge, Landis was given his unusual moniker by his father, Abraham
Landis, a Union soldier in the Civil War who was wounded at the
Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia. Apparently his father's
recollection of the spelling of Kennesaw was faulty, hence the
single ``n.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis was born on Nov. 20, 1866, in Millville, Ohio. He died on
Nov. 25, 1944, in Chicago. He was elected in 1944 to baseball's
Hall of Fame by the Committee on Baseball Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The PBS television program ``The NewsHour'' has two new
reporters, Gwen Ifill and Ray Suarez. Did they replace anyone, or
are they just new members of the show's staff?
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been several changes in the recent past, said Sara
Hope Franks, spokeswoman for ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,''
which is entering its 25th year on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Ifill (formerly of NBC) and Suarez (formerly of National Public
Radio's ``Talk of the Nation'') joined veteran journalists
Elizabeth Farnsworth and Margaret Warner as the program's senior
correspondents on Oct. 4. Phil Ponce left ``The NewsHour'' in July
to become anchor of WTTG's ``Chicago Tonight,'' where he had served
as correspondent and subanchor prior to ``The NewsHour,'' Franks
added.
</P>
<P>
   The senior correspondents share the same duties: conducting
newsmaker interviews and studio discussions, reporting from the
field, and serving as backup anchor to Lehrer, the award-winning
program's executive editor and anchor.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ ``I'm interested in a lot of things,'' Garry
Wills says, demonstrating that not the least of his many talents is
a keen grasp of the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, few authors, living or dead, have tackled such a
variety of subjects or so excelled at cross-fertilization on the
page.
</P>
<P>
   Wills is best known for his writing on politics and history.
``Lincoln at Gettysburg'' (1992) won both a Pulitzer Prize and a
National Book Critics Circle Award. ``Nixon Agonistes'' (1970)
earned him a place on the White House enemies list. ``Reagan's
America'' (1987) is ``still, by far, the best thing that anyone has
written about Reagan,'' says Columbia University historian Alan
Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   Wills's latest book, ``A Necessary Evil,'' examines Americans'
distrust of government. Yet Wills's reach extends far beyond
presidents and policies. Earlier this year, he published a
biography of St. Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he came out with ``John Wayne's America,'' and
three years before that books on Shakespeare's ``Macbeth''
(``Witches and Jesuits'') and the nature of leadership (``Certain
Trumpets''). He's published 22 books in all and is working on one
about papal sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dante said the papal sin was greed and money,'' Wills notes.
``(Lord) Acton said it was power. I don't think there's much of
that around anymore (in the Vatican), but deception, dishonesty,
structures of deceit are pervasive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wise, and youthful
</P>
<P>
   Wills has been writing professionally since 1957. Even so, it's
startling to realize he's 65. From the outset, he seemed wise
beyond his years. In author photos, he had the slightly wide-eyed,
slightly pugnacious look of the smartest kid in class. Now, though
there's a little gray evident in his reddish-brown hair, he seems
youthful beyond his wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1959, Wills has been married to the former Natalie
Cavallo, a photographer. They have three children: John, a computer
programmer; Garry Jr., a film technician; and Lydia, a literary
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Wills has a blocky build and squarish face and wears boxy
spectacles. They combine to give a sense of bulk in abstraction.
Briskly low key, he speaks formally, in a mellifluous voice. The
precisely enunciated legato of his speech suggests there is an
answer to any question Wills might be asked _ and that he is in
possession of it. Chances are, he is. If there's any one problem
with Wills's work, it's his faintly know-it-all tone. Perhaps,
though, that can be excused as truth in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intellectual of a type that there really aren't very
many anymore,'' says Brinkley. ``I'm not sure there ever were very
many _ a person who's able to think intelligently and synthetically
about a huge range of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore Vidal would say, `He's comparable to me,' '' suggests
Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor at National Review, where Wills
got his journalistic start, and the author of books on George
Washington and Alexander Hamilton, ``but it would be insulting to
Garry to make that comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all,'' adds Robert Silvers, editor of The New York
Review of Books, ``he's a man of such exceptionally wide and also
deeply thought-through interests that I think there's no one like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Wills's uniqueness lies in his ability to straddle
scholarship and journalism. He has a PhD in classics from Yale and
taught the subject for several years at Johns Hopkins. Since 1980,
he has taught American history at Northwestern University here in
Evanston. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and
Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even before he got to Yale, Wills was a regular contributor
to National Review (so regular that he had to publish some reviews
under a pseudonym, ``William Roman,'' to keep his byline from
dominating the book pages). While at Hopkins, he was an integral
part of the New Journalism high-wire act that was Esquire under
Harold Hayes. Wills has long been a frequent contributor to such
publications as The New York Times Magazine and The New York Review
of Books, and since 1970, he's written a twice-weekly syndicated
column on politics. ``If you write for four hours every morning, it
just piles up,'' he says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   As much as versatility and vocational ambidexterity, ideological
volatility has distinguished Wills's career. In his first book, on
the English Catholic man of letters G. K. Chesterton, he wrote that
``conservative'' and ``liberal'' are ``the most misleading terms in
the modern world.'' Wills has spent much of the past three decades
proving that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Though he started out at National Review, a publication
considered even more conservative then than now, he was later
arrested twice for demonstrating against the Vietnam War. Asked to
discuss Wills's political views, NR's Brookhiser demurs,
diplomatically noting that to do so would simply be to list ``a
catalog of disagreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Though others would place him firmly in the liberal camp, Wills
hesitates to do so. Indeed, he kept calling himself a conservative
well into the '80s. And a book like ``The Kennedy Imprisonment''
(1982), with its scathing indictment of the mythology of Camelot,
demonstrates a freedom from liberal cant worthy of someone whose
first editor was William F. Buckley Jr.

CHAFEE AND BUCHANAN: A STRIKING CONTRAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 31)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) ,
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ironically, Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee died just
hours before conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan bade
farewell to the Republican Party with a verbal blast at the
enlightened mainstream Republicans that Chafee personified.
</P>
<P>
   No two Republicans could have been further apart in philosophy
and approach to government than Chafee, who was ending his fifth
term in the Senate, and Buchanan, who ended his fourth unsuccessful
bid for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee understood that the world is round rather than flat and
that humanity's future depends on the ability of nations to work
together for the greater good. Buchanan is basically a throwback to
19th century nationalism in which protectionism and isolationism
were the policies that guided an America separated from the
travails of Europe and Asia by two mighty oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the revolutionary changes of the 20th century, Buchanan
continues to believe that the most powerful country on earth can,
in the age of mass communications, convert itself into a Fortress
America and abandon its neighbors on this ever-shrinking planet.
</P>
<P>
   His White House aspirations having been rejected by Republicans
in the 1988, 1992 and 1996 primaries and the preliminaries this
year. Buchanan now wants Reform Party stalwarts to give him the
prize that the GOP denied him.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds, he will have a campaign fund of $12.6 million,
provided by the federal government, and a probable seat at the
televised debate table with the Democratic and Republican nominees.
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan claims that he severed ties with the GOP over
matters of principle and because party loyalty ``asks too much of
us,'' voters should note that he made his move when it became clear
that he could not raise the funds or get the votes to win the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Had he fared better against George W. Bush, John McCain and the
other presidential contenders in the early ratings, he undoubtedly
would have been content to remain loyal to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   So, it should be understood that his move toward the Reform
Party is not selfless. It is his one chance to join the
presidential race next year.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not assured the Reform Party nomination. Several
hurdles could separate him from that goal. Their names are Donald
Trump, Jesse Ventura and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee, a former Marine who fought at Guadalcanal and
Okinawa in World War II and later was recalled to duty in Korea,
was the antithesis of the explosive Buchanan. A three-term governor
of Rhode Island before he was elected to the Senate in 1976, he
worked quietly with his political opponents to achieve a compromise
on such issues as environmental protection and health care than
indulge in an explosion of political bombast.
</P>
<P>
   Where Buchanan cultivates the blue-collar vote by promising to
turn the clock back to the policies of the past that helped produce
the Great Depression and World War II, Chafee won the support of
labor by working diligently to win passage of Medicaid expansion
and clean air and water legislation that improved the lives of
working people and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of Chafee's death, his friend, Vermont Sen. James
Jeffords, another Republican moderate, explained why Chafee, from
the mid-'70s to the late '90s, was a respected and luminous
presence in the Senate. ``In a city that is known for its partisan
rancor, John was a champion of consensus and bipartisanship. I
don't know anyone that didn't respect John Chafee.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee served as governor of Rhode Island in the 1960s _ a time
that might be described as the ``golden age'' of moderate
Republican chief executives. Among the others were New York's
Nelson Rockefeller, Washington's Dan Evans, Oregon's Mark Hatfield
and Tom McCall, Pennsylvania's William Scranton, Michigan's George
Romney and Massachusetts' John Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   They were achievers who shunned the kind of wild rhetoric that
flows from Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, candor compels us to admit that our vaunted two-party
system is a snare and a delusion, a fraud upon the nation,''
Buchanan said in announcing his bolt to the Reform Party. ``Our two
parties have become nothing but two wings on the same bird of
prey.''
</P>
<P>
   After years in television, Buchanan is a master of mouthing
attention-getting sound bites. The two parties do on occasion
achieve bipartisanship, but more often they are at each other's
throats.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's diatribe, ignored the sharp differences between them
on abortion, gun control, campaign finance reform, tax cuts,
education, nuclear testing and allocation of the first federal
surplus in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder whether the supporters who cheered, applauded
and shouted, ``Go, Pat, go'' when Buchanan announced his party
switch agree with his outrageous contention that America's
participation in World War II was unnecessary because the brutal
aggressor Adolf Hitler posed no threat to us. It would be sad if
they agree with his anti-Jewish, anti-immigrant, anti-black,
anti-free trade philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   It is fascinating to find the news spotlight shining brightly
and simultaneously on two public figures, such as Chafee and
Buchanan, who differed so drastically in ideology and professional
conduct but who, for a time, claimed membership in the same
political party. That is a manifestation of democracy in action.

 A BLOODBATH IN CHECHNYA
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Let us call it by its real name. What Russia is committing in
Chechnya is the mass murder of civilians. Moscow's propagandists
speak of creating a ``security zone'' and of targeting ``terrorist
bases,'' but these are euphemisms. Russia is butchering Chechens by
the thousands and driving them from their homes by the tens of
thousands. And not only is the West failing to rise up against this
bloodbath, it is actively helping to finance it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Russian rockets slammed into the main marketplace in
Grozny, Chechnya's capital. More than 140 shoppers and passersby
were killed, according to local health officials; hundreds more
were wounded. The attack turned the marketplace into a scene from
hell, complete with dead children, dismembered bodies, and pools of
blood. One day later, Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a
former KGB man, gave it as his opinion that the Chechens had
probably blown up the marketplace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the rocket attack on Grozny, thousands of
additional refugees joined the flood of frightened civilians
leaving Chechnya. By now as many as 200,000 men, women, and
children have fled across the border into neighboring Ingushetia.
But this, too, is a put-up job, Putin says. The Chechens are
pretending to be terrified refugees in order to ``make the
situation look worse'' and to ``give the world the impression of a
humanitarian catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the world from being deluded by those crafty
Chechens, Putin's forces have taken the precaution of bombing TV
stations, radio towers, and telephone facilities, along with such
other ``military'' targets as hospitals, buses, and bridges. Moscow
has made it clear that it will not look favorably upon reporters
who try to cover Chechnya honestly _ for example, by broadcasting
images of the carnage caused by Russian attacks. It has also
created a new propaganda ministry _ politely called a ``press
center'' _ whose function, its director says, is to supply
``completely objective information that shows the official point of
view of the Russian government.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow defends its new war on Chechnya as an effort to rout the
Islamic terrorists it claims were behind a series of apartment
building bombings in several Russian cities that claimed nearly 300
lives last summer. This justification has been repeated
unquestioningly by the US press, but it suffers from a flaw: There
is no evidence to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the apartment bombings resembles the modus
operandi of the Chechens who have been fighting to free their
homeland of Russian domination. The guerrillas have attacked
Russian military installations and killed Russian soldiers, but
they have steadfastly avoided taking civilian lives. In addition,
the Chechen commanders routinely claim responsibility for their
anti-Russian operations. Yet they vehemently deny any connection to
the apartment-building bombs.
</P>
<P>
   What would Chechens have to gain by blowing up Moscow
apartments? The certain outcome of any such attacks would be a wave
of Russian rage against Chechens. And as Miriam Lanskoy of Boston
University's Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology, and
Policy asks: ``If the Chechen field commanders (ital) did (unital)
set the initial explosions, why have they stopped? Why aren't more
buildings in Moscow going up in smoke as retribution for the
bombing of population centers in Chechnya?''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment bombings did nothing to advance Chechnya's cause,
but they have been a boon for Putin and the security agencies in
which he rose to power. The police have been given a free hand to
crack down on ``criminals.'' Buildings and people have been
searched at random. Thousands of Chechens and other ``blacks'' from
the Caucasus have been expelled from Moscow, often after being
viciously beaten. The bombing of Chechnya _ and the heavily slanted
cheerleading it is getting in the semi-censored Russian media _ has
given Putin an enormous popularity boost, so much so that he is now
a favorite in Russia's upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just a short while ago that the United States led NATO
into a war to end Serbia's assault on its Albanian population in
Kosovo? Such ethnic ``cleansing'' was intolerable, the allies
insisted then; if Belgrade wouldn't stop its brutality voluntarily,
it would be stopped by force.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's savagery in Chechnya evokes no outrage from the
White House or the State Department. Madeleine Albright managed to
say that ``the events of the last 36 hours'' _ her antiseptic
reference to the Grozny marketplace massacre _ were ``deplorable
and ominous.'' That was it. No furious demand that Russia halt the
killing. No impassioned plea for the Chechens' safety. No warning
that Moscow sit down to negotiate or face economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   No, Washington would rather discuss how many more billions of US
dollars should be funneled into Russia's corrupt economy than
discuss the butchery underway in the Caucasus. But the one is tied
to the other: Those dollars are being used, in part, to blow up
children in the streets of Grozny. Putin's cruel war is but the
latest installment in Russia's centuries-old quest to subjugate the
proud people of Chechnya, but this time the United States is
underwriting the bloodshed. We can cry out in protest and try to
halt it, or we can look the other way. But we cannot escape our
responsibility. It is Russian pilots who are dropping the bombs,
but the Chechens' blood is on our hands, too.

A FAR EAST DELICACY CREATES A QUANDARY IN MAINE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILBRIDGE, Maine _ Sea cucumbers are not easy to love. Bringing
the bulbous creatures up in their nets, generations of Down East
fishermen stomped on them and dumped them back into the sea. One
Maine man described their interior as resembling ``red vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Chinese, the largest population that dines on sea
cucumbers, deemed the New England variety strange and inferior.
Unmolested for millennia, Cucumaria frondosa colonized the bottom
of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last five years, as preferred varieties in the
Pacific became scarce, Mainers persuaded Far Eastern buyers to take
another look, and for struggling New England fishermen, a new
market appeared out of thin air. Now, in the villages of coastal
Maine, the saga of the sea cucumber is a familiar tale. Regulators
are seeing sea cucumbers take on the pattern of several ``trash
fish'' species that became sudden hits in Asia: a dizzying
opportunity followed closely by a precipitous depletion from
overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   The number of boats dragging for sea cucumbers has tripled in
the last year alone, harvesting as much as a million pounds a week,
officials said. The much-maligned relative of the starfish is now
the focus of such intense attention that the Department of Marine
Resources this week moved to cap the number of people who can enter
the fishery, preventing a bust, basically, by preventing a boom.
</P>
<P>
   The sea cucumber's Cinderella story reminds fishermen and
regulators alike of another story, one that ended badly. Around
1985, Japanese buyers found that Maine's sea urchins resembled
their own scarce species. Fishermen had been bringing in annual
catches of about 70,000 pounds from 1947 to 1987, according to the
Department of Marine Resources. Then, sped along by the advent of
the fax machine and overnight flights to the Far East, during an
eight-year gold rush, the catch increased to a 1993 rate of 42
million pounds. This stretch of coastline had entered a complex
global market; when the Asian markets faltered, such as when the
Japanese emperor died in 1989, prompting Japanese businessmen to
put aside favorite foods in mourning, Winter Harbor felt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have these urchin divers saying, `The emperor died, so
we're not going fishing,' '' said Pete Collin, a Sunset
entrepreneur who helped open markets for the sea urchin and the sea
cucumber. ``We realized if you put a pebble in the water, the
ripples extend.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials first imposed restrictions in 1992, but it was too
late, both for the sea urchin and for the communities of fishermen
who had come to count on the market. Even with the restrictions,
commercial samplings from the sea floor dropped every year from
1993 until 1998, according to Ted Creaser, a marine resource
scientist at the Department of Marine Resources. The catch dropped
to 38 million pounds in 1994 and 32 million pounds in 1995. Last
year's catch was 16 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to break that boom-and-bust cycle, Maine's Legislature
passed the Emerging Fisheries Act, which can severely limit access
to a new fishery, so that the next trash-fish-turned-delicacy,
whether it is periwinkles or starfish or seaweed, will never reach
those giddy heights or that sudden collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They catch us completely off guard,'' Creaser said of the
Asian markets. He added that the sea cucumber will not be the last
species to find its first market halfway across the world. ``I
don't think we can even project at this point what those markets
might be,'' he said. ``They might be these dog whelks we see along
the shore, for all I know. It's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to look hard to see the Asian connection in Milbridge,
a town with one movie theater that shows one movie once per night.
Stray tourists might enjoy the grand, turreted, white Victorian
houses overlooking stretches of silver water, but the picturesque
tableau ends abruptly inside Lawrence Ray's sea cucumber processing
plant, where two lines of 30 workers are scraping sea cucumber
innards. To the rushing of 60 hoses, crates full of glistening gray
sea cucumbers are reduced to their usable parts: a small ring of
pink muscle and a patch of dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the creature slops into huge vats of stinking waste;
150 pounds of raw material yield just 7 pounds of meat, according
to Ray's wife, Drusilla.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, a former scalloper, had been dragging up sea cucumbers by
accident for years, but it took years of lobbying by Collin to
convince him that Cucumaria frondosa could be regarded as food.
Collin recalls sending out 20 or 30 samples of sea cucumber meat to
dealers in the early 1990s and receiving one response.
</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, he figured, he was the sea cucumber's only
predator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been my obsession for 10 or 12 years,'' said Collin,
whose company, Coastside Bio Research, markets nutritional
supplements made from sea cucumbers. ``I consider this my baby.''
</P>
<P>
   As Maine scrambles to control the Asian demand for sea
cucumbers, it is worth noting that the state helped create that
demand. Working with $3,500 in federal grant money, Collin said, he
and a few others ``singlehandedly introduced this species into the
Asian cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chamberlain, who was working in the research wing of
Maine's Fisheries Extension Program at the time, recalls Collin's
dogged efforts. ``Pete went through a lot of trials and
tribulations,'' he said. ``Nobody wanted to deal with anything that
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Collin needed any proof of his success, he got it last
Wednesday when Commissioner George Lapointe moved to use the
Emerging Fisheries Act for the first time to curtail the growth of
the sea cucumber industry. Within three weeks, he will announce
temporary emergency regulations, Lapointe said, declining to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Creaser said he would recommend that no more than 10 boats be
allowed in the market. A slow-growing species, sea cucumbers are
not ready to harvest for at least five years, he said. ``Even (10
boats) might be too high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Poised to challenge those limits, with a lawsuit if necessary,
are fishermen and processers who planned to increase their trade in
sea cucumbers. Roger Kratz, a vice president at East Ocean Seafood
Co. in Los Angeles, which buys sea cucumbers, has proposed a fleet
of 50 boats. He argues that by imposing strict limits, the
Department of Marine Resources risks stifling healthy competition
in an industry's infancy. His Maine Sea Cucumber Processors'
Association protests that until the state has some data on the sea
cucumber population, its regulations are bound to be arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   What the department has not acknowledged is that the sea
cucumber population is truly vast, extending north to the Arctic,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible to make the last Cucumaria frondosa
disappear. If we sent attack subs down there to kill every sea
cucumber, they would fail in their mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, by limiting the business to fishermen who are
in it already, authorities will give an unfair advantage to the man
who has been in the business longest _ Lawrence Ray, who owns four
of the 12 boats dragging for sea cucumbers and one of the two East
Coast plants processing them. Already, one Portland, Maine,
entrepreneur has scrapped his plans to build a processing plant
because of anxiety over the new regulations and the threat of
monopoly, Kratz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is against restricting access per se,'' he said. ``It's
just that the group of fishermen shouldn't be so small that it can
be manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   But regulators said they have seen too many fisheries fall flat
to stand by and watch it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   In Milbridge, many of the fishermen who cashed in on the urchin
boom are stuck with payments on the houses and vehicles they bought
during the glory days, said Christy Kennedy, 35, who works in The
Cinnamon Stick, a Milbridge gift shop. ``They really blew it. They
were making good money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ray, whose father and grandfather fished for herring, and
who saw herring run out in his lifetime, stands at one end of a
line of workers, surrounded by crates and crates of sea cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead, leave it the way it is,'' he said. ``I would say in
three years, the industry will be over.''

CHAFEE'S DEATH LEAVES SENATE A LESS HONORABLE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Senate, his Republican Party, and the political life that
John Chafee left behind upon his death Sunday at 77 were far
different from the Senate and party and politics he embraced in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   There is one fewer stand-up senator on the shrinking Washington
ice floe of civil and civic-minded politicians. In a season when
serious discussion of potential presidents mentions the likes of
Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot, and Warren
Beatty, the passing from the scene of an honorable gentleman of
probity and restraint is all the more keenly felt.
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee left Yale in 1942 for the Marine Corps and the
terrifying and perilous work of invading Guadalcanal and Okinawa.
In 1951 he left Harvard Law School for the risky task of leading
Marine riflemen in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   This week the class examines the likes of Bad-knee Pat Buchanan,
a Nixon speechwriter who begged off Vietnam but led the
grenade-tossing from the White House; a developer and casino
operator who flaunts his womanizing; a voluble governor who says
pro wrestling is on the level but politics isn't; a squirrelly
industrialist; and a Hollywood character of whom it might be said
that ``I'm-not-a-politician-but-I-play-one-in-the-movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does a John Chafee fit in that mix? Answer? He doesn't.
The times and the trade of politicking have passed him by,
mercifully. ``He was in government to do good,'' murmured his
sorrowful Republican colleague, former senator John Danforth of
Missouri. Chafee could claim paternity over the Clean Air Act and
other environmental protections. A champion of Medicaid and
Medicare, he sought to create middle ground in a Senate where the
center does not hold, where partisan rip tides kept eroding the
foundations Chafee and his ever-shrinking band of moderates tried
vainly to erect.
</P>
<P>
   There were heartfelt tributes from Narragansett Bay to the
Senate floor and the White House Tuesday. Some of the same
Republicans who voted to dump Chafee from the one leadership post
he held waxed eloquent at his sudden loss. For six years till 1990,
Chafee was number three in the Senate GOP leadership, but he was
too moderate for the party that was being yanked rightward by Sun
Belt right-wingers in an intramural putsch.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming listed the number of GOP
moderates whose departure had shrunk Chafee's centrist coalition in
an interview with CNBC's Chris Mathews: Maine's Bill Cohen,
Missouri's John Danforth, New Hampshire's Warren Rudman, Kansas's
Nancy Kassebaum _ those were the moderates whose help Chafee
enlisted to ameliorate some of the harsher Republican efforts. He
might have added Oregon's Mark Hatfield and Colorado's Hank Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The old Rockefeller wing of the GOP has atrophied steadily,
displaced by Republicans who relish pushing issues like banning
late-stage abortions. In a measure of how this Senate, hobbled as
it is by partisanship, stumbles from the sublime to the ridiculous,
Simpson pointed to last week's vote on abortion as one of the kind
that causes good men and women to weep at the inanity and futility
of much of the Senate's work.
</P>
<P>
   If Chafee was such a legend in his own time to his own kind, how
come we didn't hear more of him? Two reasons. The first is
personal, the second systemic. As a rectitudinous Yankee of
aristocratic stripe, tooting his own horn made him sick. The real
aristocrats, including many of the old Protestant families whose
ancestors led the carving of America out of the wilderness
hereabouts, were not plaster saints, but neither were they crass
self-promoters. Like Claiborne Pell, his seatmate for decades,
Chafee was a classy guy in a business that has lost a lot of its
class.
</P>
<P>
   The systemic reason why Chafee was an MIA in the media melange
that passes today for political journalism? The bad news about
doing good works is that routinely doing the right thing tends to
be, well, boring.
</P>
<P>
   Crafting legislation requires minute staff work, lengthy
hearings, interminable wrangles with lobbyists and interested
parties, extended colloquy in public but also in private with your
colleagues, and the inevitable deal-cutting, ticket-balancing,
log-rolling, and vote-brokering it takes to yield a finished
legislative product. Done right, it's tedious; done boldly, it
requires tradeoffs that might make a nun blush; done for a living,
it requires great stamina; done honestly, it requires saying no to
temptation a dozen times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The inherent friction and conflict of the legislative life are
not just the fault of willful politicians. Ask yourself: What would
you be more likely to follow? The exhaustive explication of how a
senator from Rhode Island worried about striped bass or the details
of a prominent politician's sex life, money problems, domestic
difficulties, or past indiscretions?
</P>
<P>
   Standing squarely on the principles he adhered to over four
generations in politics, Chafee presented a stoic rebuke to the Sun
Belt commandos who have captured the Senate. He voted consistently
for choice, gun control, patients' rights and the nuclear test ban
treaty. The old Marine captain memorialized in Jim Brady's book
about Korea, ``The Coldest War,'' was a magnificent soldier whose
lot in life was to wage a rugged rear-guard action his last decade
in Washington. The Senate was a better place for his presence and
is the worse for his leaving.

WHO NEEDS A CIVICS LESSON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a specter hanging over American politics. The specter
of civic journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Civic journalism, or public journalism as it is sometimes
called, is a voguish new addition to the campaign scene.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked up by an unholy alliance of charitable foundations so
rich they have no idea how to spend their money, pseudo-academics,
public broadcasting crackpots, and some sackcloth-and-ashes former
journalist types, civic journalism purports to reform the way the
media cover candidates for electoral office.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the foundations bankroll vast swaths of
coverage of issues they think voters should care about, and wag a
scolding finger at old-fashioned election coverage, which focuses
on such ``horse-race'' issues as polls, or fund-raising success. In
this looking-glass world of perfect democracy, informed voters are
dying to attend lengthy debates on the future of Social Security,
and are indifferent to ``gotcha'' coverage of politicians'
character flaws. The ur-civic journalism creature, of course, is
Bill Clinton: articulate, perfectly briefed on all policy issues,
and a complete louse. Getting to the bottom of the Lewinsky scandal
is not the Pew Charitable Trusts' idea of a worthwhile news story.
</P>
<P>
   The brief history of civic journalism would be funny, if it
weren't so pathetic. A dozen years ago, Marvin Kalb was pushing a
scheme called ``Nine Sundays,'' which wanted to fob nine
presidential debates on the American people at a time when they
would much rather be watching ``60 Minutes.'' That idea went
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, civic journalism, which is driven by the liberal
ideology of the big East Coast foundations, intervened in the North
Carolina senatorial race with disastrous results. The Jesse
Helms-Harvey Gantt rematch was a morality play that bedeviled
liberals, who just couldn't figure out how come a racist cracker
like Helms kept beating a nice black pol like Gantt. (Hint: It's
not just Duke University professors voting down there.) So the
North Carolina media dreamed up a civic journalism project called
Your Voice, Your Vote, which promised to focus voters' attention on
issues like affordable health care and education, instead of such
distracting ``hot button'' subjects as race, or family values.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what happened? Helms refused to participate, so the effort
went for naught. Caught up in the miasma of focus-grouped ``issue
forums'' and similar rubbish, the press ignored much of the
campaign. ``At the core of the idea, there was always a fraud,''
according to Michael Kelly, who wrote about North Carolina's civic
journalism experiment for the New Yorker. ``The fraud was the
notion that a self-selected group of reporters and editors somehow
could or should determine the fit subjects for debate in an
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Guess who's the civic journalism poster boy these days? Jesse
Ventura. That's right, the Pew-financed Campaign Quality Project is
very proud of having included Ventura in a series of debates that
provided ``a commanding alternative to the political ads and sound
bites that have so impoverished campaign discourse in recent
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Project director Paul Taylor _ this is the former Washington
Post reporter who has issued many a public mea culpa for asking
Gary Hart during the 1988 campaign if he was an adulterer _ noted
that the debates prompted an unusually large voter turnout, which
helped Ventura. ``I can't pass judgment one way or the other on
whether he'll be a good governor,'' Taylor said after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with civic journalism is that it is a cure for
a disease that doesn't exist. High voter turnout doesn't
necessarily produce better politicians. If memory serves, Leonid
Brezhnev won many an election with 99 percent of the vote. Debates
often obfuscate rather than elucidate. And voters know what issues
are important to them; they don't need a small army of
grant-grubbing double-domes to tell them.

TYING DRESS-UP WITH COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The casualization of America has been bad news for necktie
makers. Industrywide, tie sales have flattened as more men
gravitate toward business-casual clothing. What's a fashion
designer to do? Create casual neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. There is now a push to sell ``khakis-friendly''
ties, or neckwear that coordinates with chinos. Typically, they are
earth-toned; made of fabrics like knit, cashmere, silk, or flannel;
and constructed with either no lining or a very thin one, so
they're lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution of the tie,'' pronounces Jarlath Mellett,
design director at Brooks Brothers, which touts casual with, for
example, an indigo- and khakis-striped cotton twill version. ``In
the past, ties were geared toward shirts and suits, and there was
no other way to wear a tie.'' Now, with the advent of casual
workplaces, Mellett reasons, the casual tie is a means to stand out
as authoritative, without wearing a jacket. ``The whole idea of
getting dressed up again is coming back but in a new way: you're
comfortable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a sham if you want. But the fashion industry does make
one good point _ many American men have gotten sloppy.

   ``There is a very short list of people I would consider
stylish,'' says Alan Flusser, author of ``Style and the Man'' and a
New York menswear designer whose clothes are sold in Saks Fifth
Avenue. ``If (the industry) could somehow teach men how to dress .
. . how to wear a dark suit, white shirt, dark tie, dark socks, and
shoes perfectly . . . which kind of tie to buy for your complexion,
how to put the tie in the collar properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how to do that, no amount of fashion, money,
or high-quality will enable you to dress well.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, say style professionals, there is a whole generation of
young men under 30 who have never even worn a tie. ``Kids really
don't know how to put an outfit together,'' says Bill D'Arienzo, a
New Jersey marketing consultant to the apparel industry. ``They
were raised in jeans and sneakers. They were raised in an era of
confusion when there were major (sartorial) transitions going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outer dressing is really a reflection of your inner self,'' he
adds. ``People have lost sight of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tailored Apparel, Jewelry and Accessories Council _ an
alliance of 12 trade associations _ is determined to change all
that. This spring, it's launching a three-year $30 million national
ad campaign designed specifically to encourage men and women to
dress up. Ads will appear in magazines like GQ, as well as on
billboards, at bus stops, and on TV, says D'Arienzo, who is founder
and executive director of the group. ``The key is to create images
and messages which make dressing up fun again. It ought to be a
lifestyle choice. Just as you wear jeans, you wear a tie and
gown,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, plenty of casually dressed men think the whole
dress-up idea is bogus. ``A casual tie is an oxymoron,'' says
Stephen Burgay, vice president of corporate communications at John
Hancock Financial Services in Boston, who typically wears khakis or
jeans, button-down shirts and sweaters on casual Fridays. ``I think
people made casual day, not fashion designers. It has become as
popular as it is because people genuinely like it, not because it's
a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are concerned about comfortable clothes and
(the fashion industry) is concerned about making more money. . . .
My closet will be a casual-tie-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Cortez, a human resources professional at Cahners Business
Information in Newton, owns five ties and eight pairs of khakis and
he intends to maintain that ratio. ``Ties just aren't comfortable
garments,'' says Cortez, whose company allows him to dress casually
five days a week. ``You have to button your shirt at the top and
that's just not comfortable. Making a tie casual won't make a
difference. The only occasions I'll wear a tie are a funeral,
wedding, or job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers concede the concept is a tough sell. ``You can't push
men too far,'' says New York designer Joseph Abboud, who is
introducing casual ties in his fall 2000 line. ``Men love
stability. They don't want to ever appear foolish or frivolous.
Most of the guys I know will say `I'm not wearing that.' It will
take two or three seasons and then they'll get it. . . . We have to
walk gently with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Abboud is convinced the concept is a winner. ``There is a
way to bring ties into sportswear,'' he says. ``A sportshirt,
cardigan, or unconstructed jacket with a tie is a nice accessory
for men.'' Unlike in the past, when knit ties were so thick that
they couldn't be knotted neatly, Abboud's new product is more like
a scarf-tie, he says. ``I'm using a lot less lining. It falls
differently. It's not so firmly attached to your chest. It's not
perfectly aligned. It has the effects of a scarf but it still ties
beautifully and it moves with your body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the either-or syndrome. . . . Men don't have
options. Women can wear short skirts, long skirts, pants. If we
take away options for men, we're going to be a little boring.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the necktie hasn't outlived its usefulness. Bankers,
lawyers, and other corporate types wear ties everyday. In 1998, 105
million ties were sold nationwide and retail tie sales were $1.6
billion, according to the Neckwear Association of America. In 1997,
105 million ties were also sold. ``Reports of our death are greatly
exaggerated,'' says NAA executive director Gerald Andersen. ``A tie
is still the only accessory item men have in their wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   The necktie _ or its precursor _ has been around for centuries.
It originated in Europe in the 1600s, when, it is generally
believed, Croatian soldiers wore neckerchiefs (or scarves) with
tassles that draped on their chests, says Valerie Steele, chief
curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York. ``Originally, the soldiers could use it to wipe sweat or
blood off their faces,'' she says. In the late 1600s to 1700s,
France's King Louis XIV made cravats (in linen or muslin with lace
edges) a popular fashion statement in western Europe. By the late
1700s to 1800s, ``there were so many different ways of tying the
cravat that there were even books on it. . . . It definitely was a
major status symbol,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The long tie with fold-over collar was born in the late 1800s in
England, she says. It has prevailed ever since _ until casual day
changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think American men have never looked worse,'' says Andersen.
``The knit shirt and stomach hanging over the belt and wrinkled
pants is just not the answer.'' But he is optimistic. ``I think
young people will start to dress up again because they won't want
to look like their parents. When they see mom and dad traipsing off
everywhere in jeans, they will dress nicer.''

LETTERS FROM THE HEROIC, RICHLY HUMAN DAWN POWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SELECTED LETTERS OF DAWN POWELL &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Edited by Tim Page &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Holt, 373 pp. $30 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweights like her friends Edmund Wilson and Gore Vidal tried
to establish Dawn Powell's position in American literature, but
their efforts were unavailing. Powell's books swiftly went out of
print and stayed there; they became difficult to find. After her
death, her literary rights were caught in the logjam of her estate.
But finally, through the efforts of music critic Tim Page _ not an
academic, but a ``general reader,'' the kind Powell would have
appreciated the most _ nearly all of Powell's books have been
restored to print by the Steerforth Press. They have delighted and
touched a whole new generation of general readers, and one feels
certain that Dawn Powell and her books _ she wrote 15 novels, 10
plays, and more than 100 stories _ are now here to stay. We need
them. We need her exact depictions of a vanished Ohio and a
vanished New York City, and still more, we need her timeless wit,
sensitivity, and fortitude, her ability to make us laugh out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Page also edited Powell's diaries and produced a splendid and
moving biography. Now, he has completed his labor of love and
delight by editing a selection of Powell's letters, from 1913 to
her death in 1965. The letters, in conjunction with Page's helpful
seven-page ``time line,'' present an alternative autobiography, and
add different perspectives to her life. We see her again as wife;
mother of a beloved child injured during birth; devoted (but not
unquestioningly) family member; struggling Hollywood screenwriter;
peerless friend; deadly enemy; astute commentator on New York's
artistic scene, providing unusual glimpses of famous people we
thought we knew from other contexts; an unflinching observer of her
own behavior and, needless to say, that of others. Page's editorial
contributions provide a helpful guide to Powell's many worlds, and
this reader caught him out only once. (It is probably necessary to
provide a footnote elucidating the old advertising campaign ``Which
twin has a Toni?'' Page seems to think a Toni was a dye job, but
all readers of a certain age will remember that it was a home
permanent. Sic transit gloria mundi.)
</P>
<P>
   After judging a writing contest, Powell comments on the literary
college students of the time: ``The influence of Freud and
psychoANALYSIS is clear _ they write in the first person a lot and
remember sexy moments from their childhood and faraway first lays
when they were a rather bored ten or eleven. In fact, they seem
self-absorbed, sex-obsessed, oblivious to all surroundings and
people _ curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell herself boasted an indefatigable curiosity, and it is
instructive to watch her construct entertaining little dramas, or
short stories, for her correspondents out of the real dilemmas of
her life, to watch her wit rescue her from self-pity. ``How
frighteningly dependent we are on things beyond our control,'' she
writes to Edmund Wilson. ``Do I sound like Lin Yutang?'' She can
even make writer's block sound like fun. ``I think I will write a
short story,'' writes Powell to novelist Malcolm Lowry. ``I think I
will take a dexedrine pill and go out and have my hair dyed yellow
with matching accessories. I think I should take care of my
health'' _ and this is only one stanza out of a delirious and
disturbing aria.
</P>
<P>
   When lyricist John Latouche was searched at US customs after a
trip to Africa, the inspector sat down for a thoughtful study of
Powell's letters, ``tittering appreciatively from time to time,'' a
response that readers will still summon.
</P>
<P>
   One therefore hates to think of Powell's falling into the hands
of the universities and the lit-crit business, though this iron
butterfly is unlikely to be broken on any wheel of their devising.
Teachers and scholars will want to consult the entire known body of
Powell's letters _ more than a thousand of them are known to
survive, Page states, and he is certain that still more will turn
up. His own personal and engaging selection is not intended to
throw strong illumination onto Powell's novels: She doesn't seem to
have been given to discussing the aims of her own work very much,
except when she had to. Instead, the book aims to provide a
representative collection that documents Powell's life, interests,
and the various personae she constructed for her different
correspondents _ all facets of the same memorable, heroic, and
richly human character. The book's value is that it gives Powell's
captivated readers a few more hours in her delightful and
sympathetic company.

TWO LIBRARIES WITH ONE THING IN COMMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Nine subway stops and acres of attitude
away from Harvard Yard, the first sits beside the Atlantic on
Boston Harbor. The second occupies a hillside above the Pacific,
375 miles south of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the John F. Kennedy Library nor the Ronald Reagan
Library resides where originally intended. Despite rejection
letters from Harvard and Stanford, both are prospering in handsome
locations. Decades of bitter debate have ended happily.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Presidential Places,'' author Gary Ferris catalogues
birthplaces and tombs, also listing the Web sites of 10
presidential libraries. Under ``programs'' of speeches and
conferences, a pattern is clear: Libraries not affiliated with
universities are livelier, with a strong sense of identity with
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Dorchester is now a destination and Simi Valley is a new
intellectual hub for Ventura County. Each library is an ``agora,''
the ancient Greek concept for a marketplace of ideas, flourishing
while liberated from the passions of academe.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents are people, too, awed by academe. But ivy can
suffocate originality. In the past two years, the JFK Library
sponsored conferences re-examining the presidencies of Calvin
Coolidge and Herbert Hoover to the delight of C-Span fans. This
transideological innovation might have offended student groups
eager to demonstrate or disrupt. (Harvard students have treated
politicians rudely since Federalist thugs hooted at Andrew Jackson
during Old Hickory's visit to Cambridge in 1833.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Oct. 14 Dorchester Reporter, Bill Forry documents the
odyssey of the JFK Library, celebrating its 20th anniversary, from
the Charles River to Columbia Point. UMass-Boston was nearby but
not dominant. The clincher was that the president's mother, Rose
Fitzgerald Kennedy, was born in Dorchester and graduated from
Dorchester High.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's legacy is breathing independent air, as is Reagan's.
The Gipper's demonstrated popularity in America would meet its
match in Stanford's notorious zeal to enforce political conformity.
Had Edmund Morris, author of ``Dutch,'' done his research on
campus, he might have been lionized instead of laughed at. The
deconstructist and Dadaist caucuses in the English department would
have saluted his data-don't-matta biography. Morris might have won
tenure as a professor of literature, history, or physics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s in Massachusetts and the 1980s in California,
aesthetics rather than politics ruled antilibrary emotions. Citing
the moat-and-drawbridge icons of ``traffic and parking,''
Cantabrigians and Palo Altans objected less to the archives than to
the visitors, all those Americans invading their high-rent
hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   During both disputes a compromise was floated: OK for the
archives on campus, but send the tourists elsewhere. But the
democratic instinct is often sounder than dusty archives. Hearing
Reagan's voice muse on his career as an actor, how can any
biographer think him ``unknowable''? While some politicians
reinvent themselves, this politician, willing to screen his own
Warner Brothers clips, must be the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop is often where it's at. In Independence, Mo., a
popular item is a reproduction of Harry Truman's desktop reminder,
``The Buck Stops Here.'' At the Reagan Library gift shop, visitors
can buy a $25 copy of Reagan's favorite artifact, a paperweight
saying, ``There's no limit to what a man can do or where he can go
if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.'' One need not agree with
his legacy of lowering taxes and filling the skies with missiles
and bombers to appreciate the ultimate political guile of
guilenessness.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy scouted library real estate near Harvard in April 1963.
Reagan and Stanford agreed in 1983 that his papers would go to
Stanford. Neither plan worked out, but two presidential libraries
prove that intellectual life can thrive off campus.

SPEAKING UP TOO LATE IN STUART CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether his musings were that of a chastened or conniving mind,
Mickey Roache has brought a final clarity to the Stuart case. We
now know exactly how expendable black people were.
</P>
<P>
   Roache, today a Boston city councilor, but 10 years ago the
police commissioner, last week made the out-of-nowhere claim that
his cops never considered William Bennett a suspect in the murder
of Carol DiMaiti Stuart. Roache now blames then-District Attorney
Newman Flanagan for making Bennett the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Roache said his office begged Flanagan not to arrest Bennett.
Bennett was arrested. Roache said he held his breath as the arrest
``brought the city to the brink of serious disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   Roache said, ``The one thing that has really bothered me'' over
these last 10 years ``is Willie Bennett was not in jeopardy of
being indicted . . . I was overruled.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this recounting is true, it did not bother Roache enough
10 years ago to break the code of silence among cops. It was a
silence that, however candid Roache thinks he is being today, makes
yesterday even worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Oct. 23, 1989, police were called to shooting
in the Mission Hill area. Inside a car were Charles Stuart and his
pregnant wife Carol DiMaiti Stuart. Carol was dying. Charles was
bleeding with severe wounds to the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The two had just left birthing classes at Brigham and Women's
Hospital. Charles claimed a black man shot them. Charles's wounds
convinced police to go searching for a black man.
</P>
<P>
   It was far more than a ``search.'' Mayor Ray Flynn called for
``every available detective.'' Flynn fueled racial tensions by
saying the city _ despite the many murders of African-American
women and children _ particularly empathized with the Stuarts
because they had a ``bright, hopeful future.''
</P>
<P>
   It was understandable how Charles could fool the cops for a few
days. But instead of asking new questions as the chase led to dead
ends, the police vented their frustration on black men.
</P>
<P>
   The original description of the ``assailant'' was a black man in
a sweatsuit. Stuart could have substituted tuxedo for sweatsuit and
it would not have mattered, given how scores of black men,
including college students and those coming home from work in
suits, ties, and dress shoes were stopped and frisked. Back then,
Maria Sanchez of the Puerto Rican Tenants of Mission Hill in Action
said, ``The invasion of Panama was nothing compared to the invasion
of Mission Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   As we know, white communities, no matter the crime, are not
invaded like this. One black man, Alan Dawson, was jailed on Oct.
29 for 23 days, merely because a sweatsuit was found in his
apartment. Then, Bennett, a man with a criminal record who happened
to live near the crime scene was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   According to an investigation by US Attorney Wayne Budd,
Roache's cops berated and threatened to beat and imprison Bennett's
friends and relatives if they did not make false statements to
incriminate Bennett. Budd decided not to seek criminal charges, but
criticized the police over ``the fact that a community of color was
falsely targeted for this crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Roache's own policies led to the false, easy, and lazy targeting
of an entire community of color. It was Roache who enthusiastically
endorsed a decade ago a policy of ``stop and frisk,'' which police
justified because of the high murder rates and crack hysteria of
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the policy was often abused to harass law-abiding
African-American men, sending the message far and wide that all
black men are suspects. Such policies came back to haunt Boston in
1994 when cops stormed an apartment in a botched drug raid and
literally scared a black minister to death. Such policies live on
today in Driving While Black, in which African-American and Latino
motorists are stopped for no cause by police.
</P>
<P>
   One well-mannered high school student told me in 1990, ``Here, I
go to school, I go to work, and I have to feel every day that I
could go to jail.'' A 45-year-old African-American businessman told
me how he and his 47-year-old and 43-year-old professional friends
have been stopped more than once at gunpoint. ``No matter how old
we are, it's as if people are trying to say we're members of some
black gang,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Roache let this go on, with a gut feeling that Bennett was
not the suspect, then it betrays the gutlessness of his leadership.
If he is telling the truth, it means he placed the code of silence
over civil rights. It means he sacrificed the dignity and psyche of
untold black men to keep Flanagan happy.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years removed, Roache says he is ``amazed to this day that
we didn't have a riot.'' If he is telling the truth, he cannot be
amazed, since he could have blown the whistle to stop the invasion
of Mission Hill, but refused to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Today Roache says he was ``overruled.'' He cannot escape the
truth that he inflicted grievous wounds in the Stuart case. No
matter how much he changes the story, Roache inflamed the city by
playing too much by the wrong rules.

WOODSTOCK REVISITED; CAGE'S RETURN TO ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been months since the anarchic mess known as Woodstock
99, but Harper's Magazine for November comes up with one of its
best chronicles. By David Samuels, the you-are-there piece moves
from the behind-the-scenes obliviousness of people like Michael
Lang and John Scher to the concert-and-camping chaos where at least
four women were raped, two people died, and riots erupted after
three days of stepping through sewage. Samuels is unforgiving in
his portrayal of the dated ``hippie'' philosophies spouted by
people like Lang and Wavy Gravy, and he conveys a profound sense of
the disconnect between the show's organizers and its massive
audience. He's also got plenty of shade left to throw on his fellow
reporters, as they swarm around the highly promoted event. ``They
bustle around the walkie-talkie-wielding flacks . . . tossing out
hard questions about a reported drug overdose in the campgrounds
last night and the fact that the band Sugar Ray has backed out of
their slot on this afternoon's bill. Then they lower their voices,
shift from foot to foot, smile, and ask for interview time with
Alanis Morissette.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuels stumbles upon a wealth of telling images during his
weekend wanderings. Amid a carnival of topless women and leering,
yelling men, the writer's eye turns upward: ``Looking up at the
bright orange blimp hovering over my head, I wonder whether its
message _ FRIED DOUGH _ might be some kind of key to the deeper
meaning of this event. If the original Woodstock was about peace,
love, music and making a good movie instead of a bad one, Woodstock
99 is about feeling the grease soak through the paper and onto your
fingers.'' Watching the arriving knapsacked concertgoers kick up
dust, he thinks of ``a herd of dispossessed extras in a
made-for-MTV version of `The Grapes of Wrath.' '' He never manages
to define the malaise of the Woodstock 99 generation as well as he
nails their elders, but Samuels powerfully conveys the event itself
in all its aimlessness, sloppiness, and lack of unity.
</P>
<P>
   His is a far more visceral piece than William H. Gass's argument
in favor of paper and ink, ``In Defense of the Book.'' The essay,
brainy and sometimes beautiful, is filled with Proustian notions
about the life of a book and the memories it holds, from food
stains to handwritten marginalia. Gass also has plenty to say about
the profound importance of browsing and the inner life of
libraries, where epiphanies, ``enrichments of mind, and changes of
heart, are the stuff of everyday.''
</P>

   Director David Lynch once called Nicolas Cage ``the jazz
musician of actors.'' But since 1995, after riding ``Leaving Las
Vegas'' to international fame, Cage has pretty much turned away
from the art of jazz and taken up advertising jingles. For paydays
that are often more than four times the budget of ``Leaving Las
Vegas,'' Cage has devoted most of his post-Oscar energy to
big-budget actioners like ``The Rock,'' ``Con Air,'' and ``8mm,''
steroid puffery that requires little more than a firm physique, an
ironic smirk, and the tart delivery of trailer-ready lines like
``Put the bunny back in the box.'' He has become bent on replacing
over-50 action heroes like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 11 Rolling Stone profiles Cage on the occasion of his
first ``actorly'' role in years, in Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing
Out the Dead.'' How does the 35-year-old actor take all the
criticism about his post-Oscar career, such as when former friend
Sean Penn told The New York Times Magazine, ``Nic Cage is no longer
an actor. He could be again, but now he's more like a . . .
performer''? Cage: ``A sellout _ I've heard that word _ is only a
sellout if you're being paid to do something you don't want to do.
I want to make these movies. I like working with (Jerry)
Bruckheimer. I like the work we've done together.'' Indeed, Cage's
next project is ``Gone in Sixty Seconds,'' a Jerry Bruckheimer
production about car theft that promises no shortage of burning
rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The November issue of Vanity Fair profiles an actor moving in
the opposite direction. As Cage loses his attraction to the art
house and eccentric characterizations, Jim Carrey is cultivating
the artiste approach to acting and working against his multiplex
reputation. Cage got his acting props and now seeks box office
clout; Carrey started off with top-grossing hits and is now looking
for some credibility. For his turn as comic Andy Kaufman in the
forthcoming ``Man on the Moon,'' Carrey stayed in character on the
set and pulled some Method stunts, including berating Elton John in
the guise of Kaufman's lounge-act character, Tony Clifton. ``It's a
wonderful thing to get an Oscar,'' says Carrey. ``But I really
don't like the idea of kissing people and changing myself to get
it.''

<P>
   The casualization of America has been bad news for necktie
makers. Industrywide, tie sales have flattened as more men
gravitate toward business-casual clothing. What's a fashion
designer to do? Create casual neckwear.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. There is now a push to sell ``khakis-friendly''
ties, or neckwear that coordinates with chinos. Typically, they are
earth-toned; made of fabrics like knit, cashmere, silk, or flannel;
and constructed with either no lining or a very thin one, so
they're lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolution of the tie,'' pronounces Jarlath Mellett,
design director at Brooks Brothers, which touts casual with, for
example, an indigo- and khakis-striped cotton twill version. ``In
the past, ties were geared toward shirts and suits, and there was
no other way to wear a tie.'' Now, with the advent of casual
workplaces, Mellett reasons, the casual tie is a means to stand out
as authoritative, without wearing a jacket. ``The whole idea of
getting dressed up again is coming back but in a new way: you're
comfortable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a sham if you want. But the fashion industry does make
one good point _ many American men have gotten sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very short list of people I would consider
stylish,'' says Alan Flusser, author of ``Style and the Man'' and a
New York menswear designer whose clothes are sold in Saks Fifth
Avenue. ``If (the industry) could somehow teach men how to dress .
. . how to wear a dark suit, white shirt, dark tie, dark socks, and
shoes perfectly . . . which kind of tie to buy for your complexion,
how to put the tie in the collar properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know how to do that, no amount of fashion, money,
or high-quality will enable you to dress well.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, say style professionals, there is a whole generation of
young men under 30 who have never even worn a tie. ``Kids really
don't know how to put an outfit together,'' says Bill D'Arienzo, a
New Jersey marketing consultant to the apparel industry. ``They
were raised in jeans and sneakers. They were raised in an era of
confusion when there were major (sartorial) transitions going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outer dressing is really a reflection of your inner self,'' he
adds. ``People have lost sight of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tailored Apparel, Jewelry and Accessories Council _ an
alliance of 12 trade associations _ is determined to change all
that. This spring, it's launching a three-year $30 million national
ad campaign designed specifically to encourage men and women to
dress up. Ads will appear in magazines like GQ, as well as on
billboards, at bus stops, and on TV, says D'Arienzo, who is founder
and executive director of the group. ``The key is to create images
and messages which make dressing up fun again. It ought to be a
lifestyle choice. Just as you wear jeans, you wear a tie and
gown,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, plenty of casually dressed men think the whole
dress-up idea is bogus. ``A casual tie is an oxymoron,'' says
Stephen Burgay, vice president of corporate communications at John
Hancock Financial Services in Boston, who typically wears khakis or
jeans, button-down shirts and sweaters on casual Fridays. ``I think
people made casual day, not fashion designers. It has become as
popular as it is because people genuinely like it, not because it's
a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are concerned about comfortable clothes and
(the fashion industry) is concerned about making more money. . . .
My closet will be a casual-tie-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Cortez, a human resources professional at Cahners Business
Information in Newton, owns five ties and eight pairs of khakis and
he intends to maintain that ratio. ``Ties just aren't comfortable
garments,'' says Cortez, whose company allows him to dress casually
five days a week. ``You have to button your shirt at the top and
that's just not comfortable. Making a tie casual won't make a
difference. The only occasions I'll wear a tie are a funeral,
wedding, or job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers concede the concept is a tough sell. ``You can't push
men too far,'' says New York designer Joseph Abboud, who is
introducing casual ties in his fall 2000 line. ``Men love
stability. They don't want to ever appear foolish or frivolous.
Most of the guys I know will say `I'm not wearing that.' It will
take two or three seasons and then they'll get it. . . . We have to
walk gently with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still Abboud is convinced the concept is a winner. ``There is a
way to bring ties into sportswear,'' he says. ``A sportshirt,
cardigan, or unconstructed jacket with a tie is a nice accessory
for men.'' Unlike in the past, when knit ties were so thick that
they couldn't be knotted neatly, Abboud's new product is more like
a scarf-tie, he says. ``I'm using a lot less lining. It falls
differently. It's not so firmly attached to your chest. It's not
perfectly aligned. It has the effects of a scarf but it still ties
beautifully and it moves with your body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the either-or syndrome. . . . Men don't have
options. Women can wear short skirts, long skirts, pants. If we
take away options for men, we're going to be a little boring.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the necktie hasn't outlived its usefulness. Bankers,
lawyers, and other corporate types wear ties everyday. In 1998, 105
million ties were sold nationwide and retail tie sales were $1.6
billion, according to the Neckwear Association of America. In 1997,
105 million ties were also sold. ``Reports of our death are greatly
exaggerated,'' says NAA executive director Gerald Andersen. ``A tie
is still the only accessory item men have in their wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   The necktie _ or its precursor _ has been around for centuries.
It originated in Europe in the 1600s, when, it is generally
believed, Croatian soldiers wore neckerchiefs (or scarves) with
tassles that draped on their chests, says Valerie Steele, chief
curator of the museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York. ``Originally, the soldiers could use it to wipe sweat or
blood off their faces,'' she says. In the late 1600s to 1700s,
France's King Louis XIV made cravats (in linen or muslin with lace
edges) a popular fashion statement in western Europe. By the late
1700s to 1800s, ``there were so many different ways of tying the
cravat that there were even books on it. . . . It definitely was a
major status symbol,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The long tie with fold-over collar was born in the late 1800s in
England, she says. It has prevailed ever since _ until casual day
changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think American men have never looked worse,'' says Andersen.
``The knit shirt and stomach hanging over the belt and wrinkled
pants is just not the answer.'' But he is optimistic. ``I think
young people will start to dress up again because they won't want
to look like their parents. When they see mom and dad traipsing off
everywhere in jeans, they will dress nicer.''

START-UP CRASHED, STAFF BURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one can accuse Charlie Guyer of being afraid of risks.
</P>
<P>
   In July, he left a secure marketing position at Nortel Networks
to work for a one-year-old North Andover, Mass., firm that develops
software and hardware for telecommunications companies. That
start-up, Quantum Bridge Communications, has received $22 million
in venture capital so far and has a 45-member staff that, like the
company's founders, is banking on the firm's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further you go in your career, the bigger the risks,''
said Guyer, 30. ``But there is also an opportunity for greater
rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are replete with stories about tiny Internet
start-ups and high-tech firms that have helped turn company
founders and core employees into millionaires. ETrade Group Inc.,
Microsoft, Dell Computer, and Compaq are all part of the lore.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cambridge-based Allaire Corp. has had a meteoric
rise. Known for its application server Cold Fusion, it traded its
stock for the first time nine months ago at $20 per share. That
stock is now valued at $70 per share. In a second IPO last month,
another one million shares were sold at $62 each. ``It's been quite
a ride,'' said David Orfao, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of the successful start-ups, there are numerous
failures, according to the Small Business Administration. It
reports that for every 100 established firms, 16 start-ups are
created annually and a dozen or more fail.
</P>
<P>
   Most high-tech professionals thrive on risk, but a shutdown can
be stressful, especially when workers don't know it's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Phil DiBello of Billerica. In the 18 years since he
became a software engineer, the 39-year-old manager and father of
four has worked for five start-ups and numerous other firms, each
time lured by the promise of success and the thrill of launching a
new product.
</P>
<P>
   But DiBello is still reeling from the treatment he says he
received when a former employer shut down without warning last
year. ``I'm not that concerned about a company failing,'' he said.
``Companies go out of business all the time. What concerns me is
how they treat their people.''
</P>
<P>
   DiBello found work in just three weeks, but his anger lingers.
This spring, he and 16 others filed a lawsuit in Middlesex Superior
Court charging the defunct firm, UniPrise Inc. of Chelmsford, with
breach of contract. The suit alleges that the software firm closed
in 1998 without paying 16 workers and a consultant more than
$250,000 in wages, benefits, and business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   DiBello, who says he is owed $25,000 in wages and business
expenses, said he financed a business trip to San Jose and agreed
to work without pay for seven weeks after company officials
convinced him their financial problems would end as soon as a
sought-after contract was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the lawsuit alleges that William J. Zures,
former UniPrise chairman, transferred software and assets from
UniPrise to a new company called Acrylis Inc., which later opened
in UniPrise office space.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend Zures was appointed chairman of the
UniPrise board the same day defendants Joseph Z. Perry, company
president, and chief executive Robert Z. Mowry resigned, giving
Zures total control of the financially ailing firm. By transferring
software to Acrylis, they say, Zures generated a stream of income
for the new start-up.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Boston lawyer James Coyne
King, who represents Zures, UniPrise, Acrylis, and Mowry, declined
to comment in detail, saying, ``There was no fraud or
misrepresentation.'' Both sides are scheduled to appear in court
Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service representative Karen Buretta had been with
Digital Equipment Corp. for 12 years when she heard about UniPrise
at a trade show. ``I was hired in 1997, and I really liked the idea
of going to a small company where people could work hard and grow
with the firm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buretta, 38, of Brookline, N.H., said she had no inkling that
there were financial problems until the company stopped paying
employees about 18 months after she joined the firm. ``I lost seven
paychecks in all,'' said Buretta. ``We were constantly told to sit
back, not to panic. We were told there was a deal going and as soon
as it went through, we would get paid . . . . People thought we
were nuts to stay, but we believed in the company and the
product.'' She says the defendants owe her more than $7,000 in
wages.
</P>
<P>
   For DiBello, whose children range in age from 6 to 12, the
shutdown and the loss of seven weeks' wages led to financial
strain. DiBello landed a job at American Internet Corp. in Bedford
shortly after he lost his job. That company was purchased by Cisco
Systems last month.
</P>
<P>
   As for his last employer, DiBello said, ``I was stung, but I did
not die . . . . The issue here is one of justice. The issue isn't
going out of business. That happens. For us, the question here is
why lead us on?''
</P>
<P>
   Attracted to UniPrise by a unique software product the firm had
purchased from a Helsinki firm, consultant Steve Orr says he
eagerly accepted a job assembling a team of skilled engineers. Orr
was laid off three months before the company shut down. A plaintiff
in the suit, Orr is seeking $8,000 in unpaid vacation time, 40,000
shares of stock, and damages. He and others claim company officials
used money targeted for employees' 401(k) accounts to run the firm
during its final days.
</P>
<P>
   Orr, who had options on 75,000 shares, was hoping for an IPO
with an initial sales price of $15 per share. As it turned out, the
company never went public.
</P>
<P>
   Would Orr take a chance on another start-up? ``When you are a
software engineer with talent, you can make money three ways: be an
employee, consult and triple your money, or join a start-up in the
early phase for equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work, the most you can make is a function of the number
of hours you put in during the year,'' said Orr. ``But if you join
a start-up and the company takes off, the sky is the limit . . . A
big company may be guaranteed to grow 10, even 15 percent, but that
is child's play compared to what these young firms can do. They
have serious, serious potential.''

PATRIOTS COULD BE SITTING PRETTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On paper, the next two weeks can't be any better for the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-2, the Patriots are doing better than expected. Sunday's
opponents, the Arizona Cardinals, are 2-4, and hurting. If the
Patriots win, they will head into their bye week at 6-2, in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, after winning their first playoff game in nearly
50 years last January, and being regarded as a Super Bowl contender
this year, have fallen upon hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has gone right for coach Vince Tobin. Several key
players left in free agency. A car wreck and injuries have combined
to ruin his offensive line. And worst of all, his talented young
quarterback, Jake Plummer, has suffered a series of injuries since
preseason and will not be available this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some might call this a ``trap game'' for the Patriots, who are
coming off an exciting, and very important, win against the Denver
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   There is always danger lurking in the NFL when things look this
good.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin would like nothing better than to restart his season with
a win over New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched most of the Patriots game on television,'' said
Tobin, echoing the words of every coach that has played against New
England this year. ``They are very talented. (Drew) Bledsoe is
playing at a high level. They have a great bunch of receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the turning point of the year for us. A win in this
game could go a long way. I told our team this week, we need
another start. Just one win. And then think about winning the next
one. And if we get it, I think good things will start happening for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal offense, playing with a wounded Plummer, has been
pathetic. They are ranked 29th in the league, better than only
Philadelphia and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five games, the Cardinals have scored 16, 10, 7, 14,
and 10 points, for a total of 57, an average of 11 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer fractured the ring finger on his right (throwing) hand
in Arizona's last game, Oct. 17 vs. Washington (a 24-10 loss).
Former Giants starter Dave Brown will take over against New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our team we are lucky to have Dave,'' said Tobin.
``He's a guy who has started a lot of games, and won a lot of games
in this league, and you are fortunate when you have a backup with
that kind of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent the last week changing around our offensive line.
The break came for us at the right time to give us a chance to do
it. Circumstances have dictated a lot things with our offensive
line, so we are going to put one of our draft choices, L.J.
Shelton, at left tackle. He was a holdout in training camp, so he's
been behind. And we are going to put Anthony Clement at the other
tackle. Clement has been injured but is close to being all the way
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moves would give the Cardinals the youngest pair of
starting tackles in the league. Only one lineman, center Aaron
Graham, will remain from the formation that lined up against
Washington two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell how bad the offensive line has been. The
quarterbacks have been sacked 15 times. Plummer, under a lot of
pressure, has thrown a league-high 14 interceptions. The Cardinals
are the worst in the league at giving away the ball _ 20 times
between interceptions and fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't continue to make mistakes on offense like that
and hope to win,'' said Tobin. ``Our defense hasn't been that bad.
But it's hard when you try to overcome so many turnovers by your
own offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also has been weak against the run _ 29th in the league,
surrendering 136 yards per game. This will give the Patriots an
opportunity to see whether their 133 yards rushing vs. Denver were
an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The tough matchup for Bledsoe &AMP; Co. could come in the passing
game. The Cardinals are fourth in the league in pass defense. The
Patriots have been living on the pass all year. Arizona has a solid
group of defensive backs, headed by Pro Bowler Aeneas Williams, who
almost certainly will be assigned to Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   However, two of the best Arizona defenders may not be factors.
Mark Smith, considered by some the Cardinals' best defensive
lineman, had knee surgery in the past 48 hours and will not play
Sunday. Eric Swann, also dogged by injury, will play only on
third-down pass-rush situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the things that have happened to us,'' said Tobin,
``the attitude of the team is still good. We know we can win. We
know we have to be more consistent and do a better job of
protecting the ball. If we do that, I'm sure we will start winning
again. I told them this thing isn't over yet. We can get it
together and still get back into the playoff picture.''

THE NET'S GOLD-RUSH MENTALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in an e-world. There is e-commerce, e-brokerage, and
e-banking.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, what follows are some e-bservations on some of
the latest developments in the Internet business, not all of which
make sense to those of us who are not as caught up in the
e-xcitement as others.
</P>
<P>
   --If you came from another planet and watched the first game of
this year's World Series, you would assume that the most popular
activity on earth was on-line investing. During the first eight
innings of the game _ we went to sleep after that _ there were
advertisements for six different on-line brokerage services:
ETrade, Ameritrade, Fidelity, Waterhouse, Merrill Lynch, and Datek.
Doesn't anyone drink beer or drive cars anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong. We love the ads, especially the Ameritrade
ads where Stuart, the redheaded rebel, teaches his stodgy old boss
how to trade on line. But from an investment perspective, there is
definitely something wrong with this picture.
</P>
<P>
   After an explosive start, electronic trading has lost momentum.
The up-and-down stock market hasn't helped. It could also be true
that many of the people who are active stock traders have already
made the leap to cyberspace. Ameritrade, which will report its
earnings this week, is expected to say that average daily customer
trades fell 10 percent during the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the electronic brokerages are spending money as if this
market had unlimited potential. According to press accounts, the
on-line companies are spending up to $500 to snag each new
customer.
</P>
<P>
   As Mr. Rogers might put it: ``Can you spell shakeout, boys and
girls?'' Savvy investors apparently are catching on to the
underlying lunacy here. ETrade's stock is at 22, down from 60 in
May; Ameritrade's stock has dropped from 45 in April to 17. Rock
on, Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking of competition, stock prices, and the Internet, what
are we to make of the incredible valuation the market has placed on
Sycamore Networks?
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, Sycamore, a start-up based in Chelmsford,
Mass., did an initial public offering last Friday. At the end of
the day, it had a market value of $14 billion. The company has sold
$11 million worth of equipment since May. Naturally, it has not yet
turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are not quite as ridiculous as they seem. Sycamore
is in a hot field. It is building the next generation of
telecommunications gear. All the world's biggest telephone carriers
will need such equipment to cope with the growing data traffic
generated by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore also has good credentials. Its founding executives, Dan
Smith and Desh Deshpande, sold their last company, Cascade
Communications, for $3.7 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bet on Dan and Desh,'' says Todd Dagres, a partner
with Battery Ventures, a Wellesley venture capital firm.
``Investors have faith they will figure out what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But the dynamic duo will have plenty of competition.
All of the world's big makers of telecommunications gear _ Lucent
Technologies, Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, Alcatel _ are in a
race to supply this same equipment. The giants may be big and slow,
but they are not stupid. And it is unlikely they will let upstarts
like Sycamore take away their business without a serious fight.
</P>
<P>
   So far investors seem to be ignoring the competitive aspect of
the business. They are caught up in the story of the Internet as
Gold Rush and they have convinced themselves that the companies
that supply the ``picks and shovels'' to the gold miners will
strike it rich. Maybe. But what happens if lots of companies make
``picks and shovels,'' and it is hard to tell their products apart?
Can they all strike it rich?
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking of striking it rich, the people involved in the
Sycamore deal have done that and then some. As of Friday, Dan and
Desh were each worth more than $2 billion. The stake owned by the
venture capital firm, Matrix Partners, was also worth more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Matrix's money will be divided up among its partners;
the rest will go to its investors, who typically include some of
the nation's biggest college endowments, foundations, and pension
funds.
</P>
<P>
   What do all those winners have in common? They are all already
very rich. Dan and Desh split $150 million when they sold Cascade.
The investors in Matrix have enjoyed a fantastic decade of venture
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In a column called Boston Capital, you are not going to hear
anyone criticized for making money. Creating wealth is a good
thing, and the folks involved in Sycamore did it by being smart and
fast. Good for them.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder if there is not a way, short of Marxism,
that would spread the wealth around a little more. Is there a price
to pay for living in a world where a handful of people win
megabucks while everyone else just watches from the sidelines? We
don't know the answer. It's just an e-bservation.

HAPPY FOR A SECOND-PLACE FINISH

<P>
   Four years ago, Karen Smyers won the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon
World Championships. Last weekend, she was happy to finish second
in a performance that sealed a remarkable comeback from injury.

   ``After having won it once, I'll never be totally satisfied not
winning it again,'' a tired Smyers said Tuesday afternoon, straight
off the red-eye and back home in Lincoln, Mass. ``But all things
considered, I really did have a pretty good day, and that's all I
can ask of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``things'' include slashing a hamstring in a household
accident in 1997, giving birth to daughter Jenna on May 1, 1998,
and getting sideswiped by an 18-wheel truck while on a bike ride 3
1/2 months later. Smyers finally came back this spring and has been
competing well on the shorter, Olympic-distance circuit (0.93-mile
swim, 24.8-mile bike, 6.2-mile run), but Saturday was her first
Ironman since she finished third in Hawaii three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in with a different perspective this year,'' the
38-year-old Smyers said. ``I really appreciated getting to the
starting line healthy. I don't take that for granted anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyers's swim was the fastest she's ever had at the Ironman, and
she came out of the water well enough to take the lead about 35
miles into the bike portion. Going into the run, she was still in
front and feeling optimistic. Calculating her pace as she covered
the early miles, she figured her seven-minute miles would be good
enough for a 3:02 marathon, which would be her fastest ever, and if
anyone could catch her, more power to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big thrill to lead the race for so long,'' said
Smyers, who in her 1995 victory passed a depleted Paula
Newby-Fraser just before the finish line. Another high point came
early in the run, when she got the chance to high-five a very
special spectator: her 17-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria was short-lived. About 10 miles into the run,
eventual winner Lori Bowden of Canada blew by her, opening up a gap
so quickly that Smyers's spirits sagged until she realized there
was still a race going on (``I hoped maybe she went too early and
was going to pay the price later'') and that if she wanted to hang
on to second place in front of Fernanda Keller of Brazil, a
notoriously fast finisher, she had better buckle down. She did,
finishing in 9 hours 20 minutes 40 seconds, about four minutes
ahead of Keller. The 32-year-old Bowden, meanwhile, ran the fastest
marathon in Ironman history (2:59:16) to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, Lori Bowden was just totally inspiring,'' said Smyers.
``Lori earned that victory big-time. I don't feel it was anything I
did wrong. She was just better.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a decent day for the Smyers clan; 42-year-old
sister Donna, of Montpelier, Vt., finished second in the master's
division in 10:31:31.

   Caroline Purcell, a sophomore at MIT, won a gold medal earlier
this month in the sabre competition at the Junior/Cadet Pan
American Fencing Championships in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The
19-year-old from New York City, who is studying civil and
environmental engineering, also helped the US win the team relay.
This is the first year that sabre has been an NCAA sport, and in
November the first women's world championships will be held in
Seoul, Korea.

FILM FEST HAS A SMARTER SOPHOMORE YEAR _ BUT WITH GROWING PAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The second annual Fort Worth Film Festival
had an educational bent this year. ``This has been a very special
experience,'' actor Brock Peters said in his mellow baritone while
helping to introduce ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' to an almost full
house Saturday night. ``I will no longer,'' he continued, ``confuse
Fort Worth with Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival learned a lesson from last year. Things were more
concentrated, and as a result less hectic than during its inaugural
year. The first year had a biting-off-more-than-it-could-chew
quality, which made sense: Ambition is an American, and a Texan,
trait. Because things were less spread out, attendance looked to be
consistently higher, especially for the big events. Although last
year there was nothing quite on the scale of this year's keynote
event, film icon Gregory Peck discussing his career in a
Saturday-afternoon Bass Performance Hall show titled ``A
Conversation With Gregory Peck.'' After a well-chosen spattering of
clips, Peck employed his husky-voiced calm to discuss his life in
film and the reunion of the cast of ``Mockingbird;'' this was the
first time that Peters (Tom Robinson), Mary Badham and Phillip
Alford (who played his young children, Scout and Jem) had all been
in attendance for one of his shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most moving responses in the Conversation came
during the audience Q&AMP;A. When Peters was asked how he found his way
through the role of the black man accused of rape in
``Mockingbird'' (the film is an attack on racism, set during the
Depression, based on Harper Lee's novel), he talked about drawing
on the racism he had suffered. (Later, Badham said that Peters was
so powerful during a courtroom-scene rehearsal that ``... people
cried and (director Robert) Mulligan was motioning to get the
camera going. I think that was the take they used.'')
</P>
<P>
   This year's big-winner film was ``New Clear Farm,'' Danny
DeLoach's amusing short about a pair of yokels with an awesome
responsibility, the nuclear bomb they discover. There were other
shorts with fun elements, such as director Julienne Greer's ``Hand
of a Lifetime,'' a spotty film about a husband's anxiety over the
birth of his child. The film has one great scene: Just as he's
about to be beaten by a pack of thugs, the husband stammers that
he's about to be a daddy, and the thugs suddenly start whipping out
pictures of their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most charming aspect of the festival was hearing the
filmmakers stand and speak before the shorts ran. Generally,
introductions happen only during feature films at festivals, and
this touch is specific to Fort Worth. Unfortunately, these intros
make things a little more heartbreaking when the walkouts begin
during some of the less endurable films. This year at the Caravan
of Dreams, the lights illuminating the steps were kept on _ most of
the time _ which made that walkout much safer.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Anne Francis was also on hand to introduce a showing of
``Forbidden Planet,'' the 1956 sci-fi take on Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest.'' She looked spectacular and made a good impression; she
joked about the groundbreaking social-conscience melodrama
``Blackboard Jungle,'' in which she appeared, saying the gang boys
in that film ``are like pixies compared to today.'' (The guys in
the gang included Sidney Poitier and Jamie Farr _ Klinger from TV's
``MASH.)''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbidden Planet'' ``doesn't show you everything,'' Francis
said, ``you have to feel it.'' It barely showed much of anything,
given that it suffered most from the print and projection problems
that are the inevitable plague of film festivals. The print had
faded _ it was as pink as Bugs Bunny's gums _ and, at the AMC
Sundance, seemed to be projected through a Cuisinart. (There's talk
that next year, extra projectionists will be brought in to
alleviate the projection snafus.) Although a beautiful Technicolor
print did show up for the festival's surprise screening, a showing
of the heretofore unavailable ``Fort Worth,'' which festival
artistic director Dwight Greene browbeat Warner Bros. into
locating. ``Fort Worth'' stars the heroic, though inexplicably
prissy, western mainstay Randolph Scott.
</P>
<P>
   While introducing the film, actor Barry Corbin reiterated the
hilarious wisdom that ``if you close your eyes, Scott sounds just
like Oliver Hardy'' of the screen comedy team Laurel and Hardy.
``Fort Worth,'' in which Scott plays a gunslinger-turned-crusading
newsman who has to pick up his guns again _ and no, this is not the
story of any current Star-Telegram employee _ features dialogue
such as, ``His only friend was a gun'' and the audience favorite:
``News comes in pieces, like suits of clothes. Don't ever sport the
jacket unless you got the pants.'' While this lacks the simplicity
of the Star-Telegram's slogan _ ``What do you want to know?'' _ it
has an unforgettable poetry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. looked as if it might soar a year ago. Boasting
several recent acquisitions and a hotshot new chief executive, the
defense contractor seemed ready to transform itself into an
industry star.
</P>
<P>
   But this month Raytheon, Massachusetts' third-largest private
employer, suffered a hard landing instead. Orders for its Patriot
ground-to-air missile are off. An investment in a huge satellite
phone system flopped. Its construction unit continues to miss
schedules on power plant projects, keeping them off line as the
peak winter heating season approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The string of bad news culminated with the company's warning
Oct. 12 that its profits would be far below expectations this year
and next. The report eroded its credibility on Wall Street and
pushed its stock to around $30 a share for the first time since the
early 1990s, when Raytheon was a $10 billion company _ half its
current size.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, the company now admits, its purchases of other
missile and defense electronics facilities created a distraction
that left it vulnerable to increased competition. As a result, to
the intense displeasure of investors, Raytheon has taken charges
against earnings of $638 million this year. The company also will
cut 2,380 positions from its worldwide work force of 106,000,
including about 340 jobs in New England.
</P>
<P>
   These troubles have obscured some notable successes. One came
this month when a Raytheon antimissile rocket, known as an
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle,'' demolished a target during a trial
over the Pacific Ocean, a big step forward in the development of a
land-based Star Wars defense system. In June, a Raytheon-led team
won a $1.3 billion bid to build a radar system for the British
government. That month, Raytheon also won a major contract to
produce a prototype shipboard radar system for the US Navy,
positioning the company to win contracts that could eventually be
worth billions.
</P>
<P>
   Now chief executive Daniel Burnham must prove he can continue to
deliver such results while molding Raytheon into a high-profit
whole. He is relying on new quality-control programs and a massive
restructuring begun last year that has installed new executives in
half the company's top 175 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect a rough ride ahead for Burnham, who
replaced Raytheon's longtime chief executive Dennis Picard last
December. Even Burnham's hobbies have proved punishing: Riding with
other aerospace executives at a conference in Wyoming in September,
Burnham was thrown from a horse and knocked unconscious, and
suffered two broken ribs and a scar above his left eye that ``gives
him that Humphrey Bogart look,'' according to John R. Galvin, a
member of Raytheon's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham and other top executives say they now have a better
handle on operations and pledge to raise profit margins to the 6
percent level they once forecast. They also promise better
oversight of Raytheon's financial records, which are tracked by 50
different computer systems, many of them seriously dated.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the company's pace of restructuring, ``In
retrospect, we tried to do too much too fast,'' Burnham told
analysts on a long conference call announcing the charges this
month. While the company's underlying operations are sound, he
said, the focus on acquisitions caused the company to lose track of
changes in the market.
</P>
<P>
   That message, however, may be difficult to sell to investors,
few of whom expect the company's earnings to recover soon. One
problem is that Raytheon's largest customer is the Department of
Defense, which prevents the company from disclosing much data.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to see precisely what's going on internally'' at
Raytheon, said Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette analyst Joe Nadol.
``They give a lot of details but not the kind that offer a lot of
insight.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Burnham's ascendency was supposed to mark a
new era of openness at Raytheon. Hired from AlliedSignal Inc.,
Burnham was given a mandate to integrate major acquisitions of
missile and defense electronics makers Raytheon undertook in 1997,
including the operations of Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes
Electronics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham has taken some steps to make the Lexington, Mass.,
company more transparent, meeting with investors, visiting more
plants, and responding to personal e-mails from employees. Burnham
also declared his ``embarrassment and guilt'' over the recent
performance, unusual confessions in the defense industry. Lehman
Brothers analyst Joseph Campbell calls those statements ``more
convincing than the damage control efforts'' by other defense
contractors that have had problems, such as Lockheed Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But vestiges of Raytheon's old, closed culture are still
evident. In February, Raytheon brought a lawsuit against 21 people
who allegedly disclosed company secrets on an Internet chat board.
The suit drew criticism that Raytheon was trying to stifle debate
on line. Raytheon dismissed four employees after discovering their
names through subpoenas, but dropped the suit in May before
recovering any damages.
</P>
<P>
   Observers and some former company employees also say Raytheon's
ongoing layoffs contributed to its financial surprises, by making
managers reluctant to share bad news with their superiors in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stretches the imagination to think that anybody is going to
criticize the regime or (Burnham) personally when that person's
name could be considered one of those to go,'' said fund manager
Lee Forker Jr., president of New England Research Management.
Forker says he sold shares in the firm in September.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs have brought criticism on Beacon Hill from
legislators. They say the reductions violate the spirit of a 1995
tax-cut agreement designed to protect state jobs by committing
Raytheon to maintain certain payroll levels. The deal once was
estimated to be worth up to $20 million a year for the company,
though a report issued Oct. 14 by the state's Department of Revenue
shows that Raytheon and two other defense contractors claimed
benefits of only about $9.4 million in 1996 and about $3 million in
1997, the last year for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon says it has met the terms of its agreements. But the
company makes it clear that it plans to reduce its blue-collar
employment base and hire more software engineers and other
professionals whose work commands higher profit margins. Those
hires will keep the company's total employment in Massachusetts
around 13,700 this year, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main concern is keeping its projects on track.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 6,000 different projects in all, Raytheon has lagged
in some areas. The Army, for instance, has delayed a $100 million
payment to Raytheon and a partner for the shoulder-fired Javelin
antitank missile, because of problems with a fuse supplied by a
subcontractor. But military spokesmen say Raytheon has met its cost
and work schedules on other high-profile contracts such as the
Tomahawk cruise missile and on an extremely high-frequency
satellite communications program for the Navy. ``They're doing
fine,'' said Navy Lieutenant Meghan Mariman, spokeswoman for the
Navy's Tomahawk program.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's work on individual jobs isn't as important to
investors as is its ability to track its overall finances and
provide a clearer outlook on earnings, said Lehman analyst
Campbell. He estimates Raytheon's 25 largest projects account for
only about 10 percent of its revenue, compared to about 60 percent
for Lockheed Martin. Raytheon's ``program mix has a lot of programs
you've never heard of, which is probably an advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Burnham says he will continue shifting executives
until the company improves its performance. His own job is secure,
says Raytheon director Galvin. Burnham also has support from more
unlikely quarters, including one of the employees who was dismissed
as a result of the company's investigation into on-line messages.
</P>
<P>
   The former employee, who posts under the moniker ``Winstoncar,''
wrote on the board last week that because of the company's recent
disappointments, ``I should feel vindicated but I feel sorry for
Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is doing the best he can under the current
circumstances,'' the former employee wrote.

GIVEN ANOTHER YEAR, SHE'S ON THE RUN AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Lehane, Boston University's cross-country coach, knows
that one runner does not make a team. Still, he can't help but brag
when it comes to talking about Ann Kovalsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is critical,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Critical in that she's helped vault the Terriers to their
first-ever national ranking. And critical in that she's even on the
team at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky, a fifth-year senior who graduated with a bachelor's
degree in exercise physiology last spring, should be in her first
year of graduate school at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield,
Conn. But after running in three meets last year, then being
hospitalized with blood clots in her lungs, Kovalsky spent the
winter recuperating and petitioned the NCAA to grant her a medical
exemption, which would allow her to continue running for one more
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of startling to see the turn of events, because
there was a time when we didn't even know if she could run again,''
Lehane said. ``Having her back is fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky is thrilled, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting a lot of attention and energy into this year
because I know that this is my last opportunity to do it, and I
really feel like this year was a gift,'' she said. ``From whom, I
don't know. But I really feel like this is a gift to be able to
come back here and do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky, 22, grew up in Ridgefield, Conn., where she was an
accomplished soccer player _ her team won county titles several
times and won the state championship one year.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in shape for soccer, she decided to run track in the
winter and spring. Soon she realized that she had promise there,
too, when she ran a 5:09 mile during her freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I sort of figured out that I guess by playing soccer all
those years I had a natural tendency to run,'' said Kovalsky, who
started playing soccer when she was nine. She kept running, set
four high school records, and by the time she was ready for
college, was ready to abandon soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really had enough of it,'' she said. ``Running was new and
exciting for me, and I believed I could improve a lot, so I wanted
to go that route.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky was named MVP of the cross-country team in 1996 after
helping BU break through the NCAA rankings, something it had never
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a team sport, you have to have someone go to
the front,'' Lehane said of the sport where the team's total point
score is derived from how each runner places. ``Last year we would
have gone to nationals if we'd had her.''
</P>
<P>
   But those aspirations came crashing down after the team's third
meet in October. Kovalsky had experienced some trouble breathing
since August, but by mid-fall she developed chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we went through it, it was quite confusing, and we thought
it might be exercise-induced asthma, were thinking of going with
that, then she deteriorated,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky said she remembers well the team's PreNational meet in
Kansas last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it was a mediocre day, and I personally had a really
horrible race,'' she said. ``We got back Sunday night, and by
Tuesday I was in a lot of pain and feeling really sick. I had pain,
basically anywhere your ribs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Kovalsky was told that what was initially diagnosed as
asthma was bilateral pulmonary emboli, or blood clots in her lungs.
Dr. Jack Ansell, a hematologist at BU Medical Center, had Kovalsky
hospitalized for a week and put her on blood thinners to dissolve
the clots.
</P>
<P>
   Ansell said the clotting disorder is a genetic one that was
probably exacerbated on the plane ride back from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running is not an issue, but sitting for long periods of time
can be bad,'' he said, adding that he didn't fault other doctors
for their earlier diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her initial treatment and evaluation was just right; I
would have done nothing different,'' Ansell said. ``She probably
does have a touch of asthma.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky spent the next two months thinking about the pain in
her chest, thinking about not being able to run, and thinking about
how her collegiate cross-country career had apparently come to an
abrupt conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really difficult time, because my supposed last
cross-country season had ended, and I wasn't going to run indoor
track because I wouldn't be fit,'' she said. ``It was sort of
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   But her depression turned to determination, as Kovalsky vowed to
regain her collegiate eligibility. The NCAA rule book states that
you cannot run in more than two meets and then be redshirted. She
was one over the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said, but she ran those meets when she shouldn't have,
when she was suffering from blood clots and didn't realize it. She
wrote to the NCAA, her doctors wrote, BU admistrators wrote, all
saying that if Kovalsky had been diagnosed in September, this never
would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The months went by, and instead of concentrating on her final
exams and graduate school applications, Kovalsky was biding time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, six months after her last meet and three months away
from graduation, Kovalsky got her wish. The NCAA told BU that she
could run another year.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, Kovalsky ran track for BU and placed fifth in the
ECAC meet in the 5,000 meters. She graduated in May, asked to defer
her graduate school admission for a year, went home to Connecticut
for the summer, e back to BU this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the PreNational meet this October, both the team and Kovalsky
shined. She placed 22d, with a time of 17:51, over the 3.1-mile
course in Bloomington, Ind. Teammates Lauren Matthews and Kathryn
Ireland finished 71st and 76th, respectively, and the team was
ranked 13th nationally. It was the first national ranking ever in
the program's 22-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The team will compete in the America East championships this
Sunday, then the NCAA Regionals on Nov. 13, where the first two
finishers, along with an at-large selection, will be invited to the
NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're in good shape even if we finish third,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   lsky said the meet in Indiana ``was the most positive
experience that I've had my entire college career. As a team we
went in there as unknowns, and we came out as 13th ranked in the
country. People were not aware of our depth, of our strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to say it, but it was one of those things
when you go, `finally, all of this work has paid off,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention all the waiting and wondering she went through
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalsky said even though others might not understand it, she
knew there was no question that she'd fight to run another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I'd been cheated out of what I love to do the
most,'' she said. ``You know, you can only compete four years, and
you can never go back. So I felt like it would always be unfinished
business, and I really didn't want to walk away from it at that
point.''

SAN ANTONIO, SANTA FE IN FRITO PIE FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A real Frito pie feud is brewing between San Antonio and Santa
Fe.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico legend has it that Woolworth's employee Teresa
Hernandez concocted the first Frito pies in 1960, when business was
lagging at the new store in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   It was right after Christmas, and the normal lull in sales had
the store manager worried, Hernandez explained, so he challenged
his workers to come up with something special to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   After trying several versions, one of which included refried
beans, Hernandez sliced open a bag of Fritos and poured hot chili
on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked it,'' she said Tuesday in a telephone interview from
Five and Dime, the successor to Woolworth's, where she is part
owner. ``It became very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is all well and good for Santa Fe, but 1960 was
nearly 30 years after Daisy Dean Doolin created the cold-weather,
Friday-night-football staple in her San Antonio kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A story in Monday's Wall Street Journal recalled the incident.
The Journal explained that Doolin, mother of Frito company founder
Elmer Doolin, invented Frito pie in 1932 in her San Antonio home.
She poured leftover chili _ Texas chili _ over Fritos.
</P>
<P>
   John McCarty, a longtime Santa Fe resident who was a Frito-Lay
executive for years, backed up the Journal account. McCarty,
recruited by Doolin in 1952, hired Frito's first home economist,
Nell Morris, who put together a cookbook of recipes using company
products, including Frito pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably published the first official version of it, as far
as I know,'' McCarty said. ``That was in the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe ``New Mexican,'' in an obvious attempt to defuse
the controversy, reported Tuesday that although San Antonio might
indeed be the birthplace of the dish, ``Frito pies apparently
aren't well-known in San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   A receptionist at the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau
told the paper that ice cream trucks were the only places she knew
that sold them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, no, no,'' Martha Quan of the bureau said Tuesday. ``I
don't know who they talked with, but I'm just appalled by this. I
can't believe this. Everyone in San Antonio knows about the story.
They are very popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe paper said San Antonio food writer Ron Bechtol
hadn't heard that Frito pies were invented in his city, and he
added, ``The only place they're served is in funky places in the
Hill Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that,'' Quan said. ``He's our food critic, and
he's been around for a long time. I'm sure he knows about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechtol could not be reached to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Taylor, a district manager for Sonic Drive-Ins, said
``chili pie'' is a standard item on Sonic menus throughout Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a mean chili pie, and we sell a lot of them,'' he
said. ``I mean a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also dispelled the idea that the dish is scarce in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have them down there because it's a standard item
on our menus and we have 42 Sonics in San Antonio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Santa Fe had to settle for claiming the best Frito
pie, if not the first.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Mackenzie, spokesman for Plano, Texas-based Frito-Lay,
agreed with Santa Fe's claim to the ultimate pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had Frito pies at the Texas State Fair and at Woolworth's
in Santa Fe,'' he said. ``I think Santa Fe can lay claim to being
better than anybody else. If who invented it first is disputed,
then the best is undisputed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' said Dee Dee Poteet, also with the
San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``We don't recommend
specific restaurants, but I can tell you that Fritos were invented
here and so was chili con carne. It would make sense that we know
how to do the dish.''

   DUTCH-ARCHITECTS (Amsterdam) _ Architecture is a fractured
field. There are some who build but seldom break new ground, and
the experimenters whose idiosyncratic designs and arcane language
can scare off clients with the power to promote them. And then
there are a few, like Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, succeeding a
different way. By Philip Nobel.

   IMPERFECT-DESIGN () Were it not largely obscured by a privet
hedge, Gary Guerrette's three-bedroom bungalow might cause a
neighborhood revolt. But in low-key Water Mill, N.Y. _ where
picturesque dilapidation can be a badge of honor _ the rippling
asphalt-shingle roof, buckling wood steps and architectural malaise
pass without remark. ``It needs a little work,'' said a
brightly-smiling Mr. Guerrette, 40, of the house he shares with his
partner, Tom Lawson, 42, a massage therapist. Informally formal,
rough yet elegant, it is a semaphore for design on the century's
cusp _ a lively mosaic of pleasures and passions rather than a
catalogue of aspirational perfections. ``I don't think we own
anything that isn't chipped, rotten, broken or falling apart,''
Lawson said. By Mitchell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   WEEKEND-RETREAT (Delaware, N.J.) _ When Hal Bromm, a TriBeCa
gallery owner, and Doneley Meris, a bereavement therapist, bought
the old yellow clapboard Delawanna Hotel here as a weekend retreat
for themselves and their friends, there were 23 bedrooms. And lest
any of those friends felt left out, there was a stone guest house
on the hill. ``People keep stopping in to ask if this is a bed and
breakfast, and how much does it cost a night,'' said Bromm, a tall
man with dark curly hair, managing to sound both bemused and ever
so slightly annoyed. ``We tell them it's just for us.'' By Tracie

But they must have known something when they said, ``You can't
always get what you wah-ahnt.'' But after two months of trying, we
got what we needed. What we needed, in the material sense, was a
downstairs bathroom, with a shower. But what we also needed, big
time, was a new attitude. Nobody wah-ahnts to get old, for
instance. My 86-year-old mother certainly doesn't like it _ hates
it, in fact, when it means she can't run up and down the cellar
stairs with 30-pound turkeys, or see Africa again. By Anne Raver.

GAY MINISTER USED HIS FRIENDSHIP WITH FALWELL TO ARRANGE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mel White, the Southern California minister who
got Jerry Falwell and 200 of his conservative faithful to meet with
him and 200 gay faithful last weekend, tried not to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by fundamentalists to believe God hates homosexuality,
White spent half a lifetime trying exorcisms, faith healings,
psychotherapy and electroshock aversion treatments and, finally,
slicing both his wrists _ before realizing the problem was not
within but without.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Southern California minister and one-time
ghostwriter for Falwell and Pat Robertson is on a quest to end the
``spiritual violence'' against gays waged by fundamentalist
Christians and by most mainstream religious denominations in some
form.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Falwell and his faithful to meet was White's most
visible effort so far to stop the rhetoric of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: White will lead a contingent to Grand Island, Neb.,
next month as the United Methodist Church puts the Rev. Jimmy
Creech on trial again for blessing the union of a homosexual
couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to try to stop that trial,'' a tired but excited
White said Tuesday by telephone from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Disrupting the trial, White explained, is ``not for Jimmy
Creech's sake, but because the trial will be another opportunity
for the nation to hear all this spiritual violence against gay
people _ that their relationships aren't worthy of being blessed,
that they are not good enough to be full-fledged members of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   White, 59, has been on his quest since the early 1990s, but only
now has the conflict between religious proscriptions against
homosexuality and the gay rights movement taken center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Casting the struggle in high relief have been highly publicized
crimes against gays, such as the Matthew Shepard killing in
Wyoming, which White blamed in part on the anti-gay fervor of the
religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   His family's conservative religious roots run deep. His
grandmother led tent revivals. Carl and Faythe White raised their
sons in the Santa Cruz area, in the Church of God, and later served
as missionaries in Soweto, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   White, in his 1994 autobiography ``Stranger at the Gate,'' wrote
about the depths of his struggle to overcome his attraction to
other boys.
</P>
<P>
   He married his high school sweetheart, Lyla, after they both
graduated from a small Christian-oriented college in Oregon, and
they moved to Pasadena to raise their daughter and son.
</P>
<P>
   White earned a divinity degree at the evangelical Fuller
Theological Seminary in Pasadena, taught there and pastored a small
Swedish Covenant Church _ all the while grappling with his demon.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote books, and his speed and style caught the attention of
Richard Baltzell, who then worked for the Revell religious
publishing company in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baltzell who put White in touch with two conservative
ministers, Falwell and Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   White thrived through the 1980s as a ghostwriter for them and
another giant of the Christian right, D. James Kennedy, plus
evangelist Billy Graham and Oliver North. At the same time he
produced 53 movie and television documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   White has always said that he had never written anti-gay
rhetoric for any of them. He also refused to allow his name to
appear anywhere in their books, knowing his gayness might one day
tarnish them.
</P>
<P>
   He told Lyla of his struggle early on; she loved him, and they
vowed to cure him together. But none of his desperate measures
worked. Finally, he ripped his wrists with a bent coat hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out of intensive care, Lyla turned to me and said,
`Mel, you're gay. I like gay people, I just didn't want you to be
one,''' White recounted. ``She gave me the gift of life.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1980s. Soon, White met Gary Nixon at All
Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena. They have been partners for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   He has stayed close to Lyla and their children. Daughter Erin,
30, teaches fifth grade and raises her 7-year-old daughter; son
Michael, 29, is co-producer of TV's ``Dawson's Creek'' and a writer
on NBC's new series ``Freaks and Geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents, now of Scotts Valley, took the news hard. Their
move toward acceptance mirrors the one he's challenging Falwell and
the Methodists to make.
</P>
<P>
   Faythe White now feels, though her church doesn't, that
homosexuality isn't a choice. Carl White says he is more in
Falwell's camp _ recent Falwell, that is _ loving the sinner, but
not the sin.
</P>
<P>
   He's quick to say, ``Rest assured, we love Mel. And Gary, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White's public coming out took longer. He has been criticized
for continuing to write for Falwell and Robertson through the
1980s. He has said he did it to pay the rent and send his children
to college.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the strain of his double life crashed in on him. He
told Falwell and Robertson that he was gay, and sought to talk with
them about their anti-gay fund-raising letters. They refused.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, White has served as dean of the Cathedral of Hope
Metropolitan Community Church in Dallas, the largest congregation
of homosexuals and lesbian in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now back in Laguna Beach, he and Nixon have founded Soulforce, a
nonprofit organization based on the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King, to use nonviolent means to end ``spiritual
violence against gays and lesbians.''
</P>
<P>
   White has persisted in his efforts to talk to his old employers.
He fasted three weeks in jail after being arrested for refusing to
leave Robertson's headquarters in Virginia, when the televangelist
would not see him.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, his efforts yielded the meeting with his old
friend Falwell _ and a softening of the Christian Coalition
founder's anti-gay message.

 &HT;    CENSUS PLANS HUGE AD CAMPAIGN TO URGE PARTICIPATION
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau unveiled its first-ever paid
advertising campaign Wednesday as part of a $167 million effort to
reach minority groups that have been missed by past national head
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is aimed at reversing a 30-year trend toward fewer
Americans completing and returning the census forms that are mailed
out once a decade. The ads will target groups that have
historically been undercounted: African Americans, Latinos, native
Americans and new immigrants from all countries.
</P>
<P>
   From January through April, the peak season for pushing the
forms, the Census Bureau will rank behind only McDonald's and
Burger King as a national advertiser, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney,
D-N.Y., the ranking minority member on the House subcommittee that
oversees the census.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will feature more than 250 different spots in 17
languages on 3,000 media outlets _ TV, radio, newspaper and
magazine advertisements and billboards. All revolve around a
central theme: ``This is your future. Don't leave it blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Required by the Constitution, the census is used to apportion
each state's membership in the House of Representatives and to
distribute billion of dollars of federal funds. Conducting the
census ``will be the most important job our government will do over
the next year,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley at
Wednesday's ``Census 2000 Campaign Launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its importance, census participation has fallen in
recent decades. In 1990, the return rate was only 65 percent for
the forms mailed to the nation's 120 million households. That rate
compared to 75 percent who mailed back the forms in 1980 and nearly
80 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Without the new advertising campaign, a 61 percent return rate
had been projected for the 2000 census, said Kenneth Prewitt, the
bureau director.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the falling response rates are related to changes
in attitudes and demographics. Distrust and indifference toward
government has grown, he said. A growing proportion of the populace
is also made up of immigrants or their offspring, he said, and
these newcomers often don't understand the census forms or their
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   An advertising campaign aimed at some Hispanic groups will
stress the confidentiality of the forms, said Prewitt. The census
counts resident aliens as well as citizens, and some communities
fear the forms will be used by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to deport those who are here illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge fire wall between the Census Bureau and the
INS,'' said Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the census ads are the opposite of most
advertising, which is aimed at the most likely customers for a
product. The Census Bureau wants to reach the audience that is
least likely to fill out its forms.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some census commercials will be in Spanish and air
on networks such as Univision. Others will feature African American
actors and be seen on Black Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the spots stress that filling out the forms serves the
interests of the community. One shows an overcrowded school.
Another depicts a fireman with a defective hose. Yet another shows
a woman seeking day care for a child. ``Will you get your fair
share?'' they ask, in an reference to the public funds distributed
according to census findings.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign was designed by Young &AMP; Rubicam, with
input from several other agencies. Before it is over, the Census
Bureau estimated, 99 percent of all Americans will have seen or
heard 50 of the spots on the air or in print. People in the
targeted groups will have seen 100 or more. The campaign will use
more than 3,000 media outlets and carry more than 130,000
announcements during a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Census Bureau has relied upon donated time for
public service announcements, which mostly aired late at night or
at other periods of slack audiences, said Prewitt. This year, the
spots will run in prime time or other periods of high viewership by
the targeted audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Daley predicted the campaign will be ``the largest civics lesson
that the country has ever had.''

   Adults are discovering what they once knew and then forgot.
Halloween is fun.
</P>
<P>
   Now the second-largest American holiday (in dollar terms, and
what is more important in America?) Halloween has transcended
urchins with bags begging throughout the neighborhood. It's now a
holiday of light displays, extravagant and sometimes off-color
parades, specially brewed beers, and Elvira marathons. Adults just
want to have fun. After all, it was their holiday first.

   BABY PUMPKINS FILLED WITH WORMS AND MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12
</P>
<P>
   _ 12 baby pumpkins (about 10 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   _ 12 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 pound dried mushroom linguine or dried black squid-ink
spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   _ Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 pounds beef or pork, or combination, made into 24 meatballs
and cooked
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 cups spaghetti sauce, purchased or homemade
</P>
<P>
   _ Freshly grated good-quality Parmesan cheese, to garnish
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Using a large, firm-bladed serrated
knife, carefully cut off the top section of each pumpkin to a depth
of about 1/4 inch using a sawing motion. Reserve tops, then scoop
out the seeds and membrane of each pumpkin and discard.
</P>
<P>
   Place 1 sprig of thyme plus a little salt and pepper inside each
pumpkin and replace the tops. Transfer pumpkins to a baking sheet
and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until
pumpkins are just soft inside, being sure not to let them lose
their shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add linguine or black
spaghetti and cook until al dente, stirring occasionally. Drain,
toss with butter and season to taste with salt. Meanwhile, warm
meatballs in spaghetti sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Remove pumpkins from oven, discard thyme and fill each one with
the hot black spaghetti. Top each pumpkin with some of the sauce
and 2 meatballs, then garnish with the grated cheese. Place pumpkin
tops alongside pumpkins and serve immediately.

   TURKEY STICKS WITH ORANGE CHEESE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 18
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 pound boneless, skinless turkey breast
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 1/4 cups fresh bread crumbs, toasted
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 teaspoons turmeric
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 teaspoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   _ 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 cups mild orange Cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   _ 3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 teaspoons prepared English mustard
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: You can make the cheese sauce in advance if necessary.
Don't worry if it firms up. Rewarm it in a double boiler over
simmering water, stirring until smooth. Serve the sauce in
hollowed-out squash for a decorative touch.
</P>
<P>
   To make cheese sauce, combine cheese, cream and mustard in
double boiler over barely simmering water. Cook for 15-20 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until melted and well-combined.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut turkey into 18
pieces measuring about 1 1/2 by 2 inches. Using a mallet or bottom
of a heavy skillet, flatten turkey pieces until they're about 1/2
inch thick. Season on both sides with salt and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Combine bread crumbs, turmeric, paprika and nutmeg in small
bowl. Place flour and eggs in 2 bowls. Dip turkey in flour, shaking
off any excess, then dip it in egg and let any excess drip off,
then press it in the crumb mixture on both sides to coat pieces
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   In large nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil and 1
tablespoon butter over medium heat. When hot, add 1/3 of the
breaded turkey and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Transfer cooked
turkey to parchment-lined baking sheet and wipe out pan with paper
towels. Repeat with remaining turkey, adding more oil and butter
and wiping out pan between batches. Transfer baking sheet to oven
and bake turkey for 4-5 minutes. Serve with cheese sauce.

   IMPERFECT-DESIGN () Were it not largely obscured by a privet
hedge, Gary Guerrette's three-bedroom bungalow might cause a
neighborhood revolt. But in low-key Water Mill, N.Y. _ where
picturesque dilapidation can be a badge of honor _ the rippling
asphalt-shingle roof, buckling wood steps and architectural malaise
pass without remark. ``It needs a little work,'' said a
brightly-smiling Mr. Guerrette, 40, of the house he shares with his
partner, Tom Lawson, 42, a massage therapist. Informally formal,
rough yet elegant, it is a semaphore for design on the century's
cusp _ a lively mosaic of pleasures and passions rather than a
catalogue of aspirational perfections. ``I don't think we own
anything that isn't chipped, rotten, broken or falling apart,''
Lawson said. By Mitchell Owens.

   WEEKEND-RETREAT (Delaware, N.J.) _ When Hal Bromm, a TriBeCa
gallery owner, and Doneley Meris, a bereavement therapist, bought
the old yellow clapboard Delawanna Hotel here as a weekend retreat
for themselves and their friends, there were 23 bedrooms. And lest
any of those friends felt left out, there was a stone guest house
on the hill. ``People keep stopping in to ask if this is a bed and
breakfast, and how much does it cost a night,'' said Bromm, a tall
man with dark curly hair, managing to sound both bemused and ever
so slightly annoyed. ``We tell them it's just for us.'' By Tracie
Rozhon.

   BARRIER-FREE-DESIGN (Undated) _ I never thought, somehow, that
the Rolling Stones would be the ones to sum up our experience of
installing a new bathroom for our mother on the farm in Maryland.
But they must have known something when they said, ``You can't
always get what you wah-ahnt.'' But after two months of trying, we
got what we needed. What we needed, in the material sense, was a
downstairs bathroom, with a shower. But what we also needed, big
time, was a new attitude. Nobody wah-ahnts to get old, for
instance. My 86-year-old mother certainly doesn't like it _ hates
it, in fact, when it means she can't run up and down the cellar
stairs with 30-pound turkeys, or see Africa again. By Anne Raver.

<P>
   The first steps to creating a home office are evaluating your
space needs and then finding a suitable place in your home. Next,
estimate the amount of electrical power you need for equipment;
after that you can determine if the existing household circuits can
deliver the power without overloading.
</P>
<P>
   To estimate your power requirements, make a list of your office
machines. The list may include a computer, monitor, printer, fax,
answering machine and copier. It should be as complete as possible,
including even lights and appliances for comfort like a coffee
maker or microwave. Make a separate list for the climate-control
machines like the air-conditioner and heater; these should be on
individual circuits because they create power surges that can
affect the other office machines.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a complete list, calculate the amount of current
(this is measured in amperes) that each machine draws. Amperage
ratings are indicated in the owner's manuals and on labels at the
back of the machine. Typical current draws for office machines are
3 amps for a computer, 1.9 amps for a 17-inch monitor, 0.1 amps for
a telephone answering machine. Total the numbers. This is the total
current draw, or load, for all your machines.
</P>
<P>
   Most house circuits are designed to carry a load of 15 amps, but
it is recommended that you draw no more than 12 amps on these
circuits. Similarly, a 20-amp circuit should not have more than 16
amps. If your total exceeds these numbers, you can plug some of the
machines into another circuit. But remember that even if the load
falls within the specified circuit limit, you may still cause an
overload if other household appliances are on that circuit. In the
long run, it may be better to run a new line from the service panel
exclusively for your office machines.
</P>
<P>
   All of the circuits in your office should be properly grounded.
Don't assume that an outlet with three holes is properly grounded.
Use a circuit analyzer, a small hand-held device available in
electrical supply stores for less than $5, to check the ground
connection at each outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Office machines, particularly computers and printers, have
sensitive circuitry that can be damaged by power fluctuations.
Install surge protectors to safeguard your machines from voltage
spikes. Also consider installing an uninterrupted power supply unit
for your computer. This device has a battery that provides a
continuous flow of electricity in case of a power failure. The
continuous power will give you enough time to save current files
and shut down the computer properly. The unit also has a filter
that evens out electrical fluctuations to provide clean power. This
will result in better performance, reduce repair costs and increase
the longevity of your office machines.
</P>
<P>
   After evaluating the electrical circuits, concentrate on the
office plan. Start by designing a layout for the computer,
administrative and production areas. These are the areas where you
will spend most of your working time, and they also have more
elements _ furniture, shelves and machines _ to position. The
meeting and storage areas need little planning because they have
fewer elements.
</P>
<P>
   Workstation layouts will vary according to your needs, but the
most practical arrangements are the straight, galley, corner,
alcove and U-shaped arrangements. The straight arrangement,
sometimes called the railroad layout, is the simplest. The
worktables are arranged in a line along one wall, with necessary
shelves and cabinets mounted above. This arrangement works well in
a long narrow room that has at least one wall without a window. If
the room is wider, you can go to a galley arrangement. Here two
lines of worktables are installed in straight lines directly across
from each other on opposite walls. This is a good arrangement if
there are two people working in the office.
</P>
<P>
   In the corner arrangement the worktables, shelves and cabinets
wrap around a corner into an L-shaped arrangement. This layout
provides more legroom than either the straight or galley layout and
is a good choice if you have a room with two adjacent windowless
walls. In the alcove arrangement the worktables, shelves and
cabinets wrap around three walls of a room. This arrangement uses
the most wall space, but it can create a claustrophobic or cramped
feeling in a narrow room.
</P>
<P>
   The U-shaped arrangement is similar to the alcove layout except
that one stretch of worktables projects into the center of the
room, not along a wall. This is a versatile layout because it makes
the office into a meeting room as well as a work area. However, it
can only be installed in a wide room.
</P>
<P>
   Work out your office plan carefully on graph paper to see which
arrangement will fit into the space you've chosen for your office. &QL;

49ERS QB STILL SEES HOPE OF PLAYING THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER and LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve
Young said Wednesday he would neither retire nor go on a
season-ending injured reserve status because of his fourth
concussion in three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, said he was still suffering complications from his
latest concussion in a game with the Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 27,
but he also maintained that did not preclude him from returning to
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good now,'' Young told a news conference. ``It's really
a function of time. We have some time. We'll take some time. ...
It's something you can't rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a series of discouraging reports in the wake of his
most recent concussion, the 49ers had been expected to place Young
on the injured reserve list.
</P>
<P>
   After an examination by his primary neurologist, Gary Steinberg,
at Stanford Medical School two weeks ago, Young was encouraged by
the 49ers to seek other opinions on the risks inherent in
continuing to play football with a history of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg, who is no relation to Gary
Steinberg, said independent medical evaluations were not
encouraging for someone looking to play football again. Leigh
Steinberg said Tuesday there would be no decision on the
possibility of Young's retirement until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   If he never plays again, Young will leave the National Football
League with 33,124 yards passing and 232 touchdowns to go with
4,239 yards rushing. The rushing total is second in NFL history for
a quarterback, behind Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Young's problems with concussions began on Oct. 27, 1996, in a
game against the Houston Oilers. While scrambling, he was hit hard
by linebacker Michael Barrow and left the game. He was taken to a
local hospital for evaluation and treatment. He sat out the next
game against New Orleans and returned Nov. 10 for a game against
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Cowboys, Young again got hit hard while running with
the ball. This time, the knee of linebacker Jim Schwantz caught
Young in the forehead, resulting in his second concussion in 15
days. Young missed the next game against Baltimore but returned the
following week and finished out the season without event until
breaking three ribs in a playoff game against Philadelphia on Dec.
29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Young's 1997 season started painfully. On Aug. 31 at Tampa, Bucs
linebacker Hardy Nickerson came sliding in to help on a tackle of
Young and his knee inadvertently slammed into the back of the
quarterback's helmet. That was concussion No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Young did not play the next week against St. Louis, but he
returned the following game against New Orleans and played a more
cautious brand of football as the 49ers concentrated on the running
game to take the pressure off their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Young had his finest statistical season in 1998 as he passed for
4,170 yards and 36 touchdowns, both franchise records. At one
point, he had 300 yards passing in six consecutive games to
establish an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming San Francisco's starting quarterback in 1991,
Young has been to the Pro Bowl seven times. He was the NFL's player
of the year in 1992 and 1994. Young's career peaked in the 1994-95
season when he led the 49ers to a 49-26 victory over San Diego in
Super Bowl XXIX. He threw a Super Bowl-record six touchdown passes
against the Chargers and was named Most Valuable Player of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In Young's absence this season, Jeff Garcia has started the last
four games for the 49ers, during which the club went from 2-1 to
3-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still growing,'' head coach Steve Mariucci said of
Garcia. ``He'll show flashes of being a darn good quarterback, and
he'll show flashes of being a new quarterback. He's only going to
get better.''

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There's a worldwide shortage of hams.
</P>
<P>
   Not those canned pork products, and not theater bugs, but rather
those amateur radio enthusiasts who, during emergencies, are often
the only links to ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
   Augie Schwab has seen his friends, one by one, set aside their
radio equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of ham equipment sitting around not being
used,'' said the 77-year-old ham enthusiast, who lives near Boynton
Beach. He said one son dabbled in ham radio three decades ago but
none of his children or grandchildren is interested now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not replenishing'' the ranks of ham operators, Schwab
said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely culprit: the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage was brought home in September when Hurricane Floyd
threatened South Florida. A local volunteer group comprised of area
ham clubs that normally staffs storm shelters didn't have enough
operators to go around. Ham radio operators become crucial when
telephone lines go down, providing links between shelters and
administration and emergency operations centers. Radio Amateur
Civil Emergency Service, which uses the acronym RACES, coordinates
with emergency managers before hurricane season to staff shelters.
</P>
<P>
   County officials, police and paramedics rely on ham radio
operators at shelters when telephone lines are swamped or go down.
They also can become the only links to Caribbean islands hit by
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly concerned about it,'' Palm Beach County
Emergency Manager Bill O'Brien said of the shortage. ``The hams are
basically the last-ditch communications with the shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency operations center is offering to let RACES leaders
use Palm Beach County equipment to train ham operators so they can
qualify as volunteers, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hamilton, an electronics technician for Palm Beach County
Fire-Rescue and the county's coordinator for RACES, blames the
overall drop in the numbers of ham operators on demographics and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   First, the hobby of amateur radios dates back several decades,
and the median age of hobbyists is over 50, so many of its
enthusiasts are getting older or have died, Hamilton said. Also,
many of those retirees had lived in mobile homes, so they planned
on being the first to evacuate and were the first to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hamilton said, many have moved into retirement villages or
even nursing homes and probably would stay. Younger people joining
the hobby often must balance demands of career and family, he said.
And younger retirees _ along with the general population _ are now
moving away from ham radio, once the only way to talk to people
around the world for free, and toward its successor: the Internet,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ham radio is the original information superhighway, the
original World Wide Web,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hagy, spokeswoman for the Amateur Radio Relay League,
isn't ready to blame it all on the Internet. But she did say that
membership in the group, which dates back to 1914, has steadily
risen each year to an all-time high of 175,000 in January 1997, but
then dropped to the 163,000 it is now. That's about the same time
when the Internet exploded into popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Hagy believes hams still love the challenge of amateur radio
that the Internet can't provide _ ``being able to throw a wire up
in your back yard and not know who you're going to reach and how
far you're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes a greater factor is that there are more hobbies and
distractions today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different things to interest people,'' Hagy
said from the organization's headquarters near Hartford, Conn.
``There's a million different groups and organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Augie Schwab is convinced the Internet is responsible. Many of
his friends ``have minimized their activity on ham radio and
maximized their activity on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The native of New York's Long Island, who ran an import business
until he retired and moved to Florida in 1989, was a radio operator
in World War II in Africa and built his first ham radio in 1955. He
is Indian Springs' hurricane emergency coordinator and still enjoys
reaching fellow hams around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it will ever die out together,'' Schwab said.
``I just think there will be fewer hams worldwide.''-

A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU, AND FOR HUMANITY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Reporter's e-mail address: Slatalla(AT)nytimes.com.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hope I am not the first person to tell you that you do not
need a hemp linen pillow stuffed with buckwheat hulls. So what if
it has a zipper for easy hull removal? Never mind that the photo on
the Ethical Shopper home page made this $24 pillow look deeply
comfortable (www.ethicalshopper.com).
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't need it and I don't need it. Nor do we need to buy
a wool passport bag from Nepal ($9), a pet collar made with natural
hemp webbing ($7.95) or an earth-tone potpourri box with a lid
handle shaped like a frog ($14).
</P>
<P>
   So why am I lingering over the product descriptions (``Liven up
your bathroom with these bright colored all-natural, herbal
soaps'') at Ethical Shopper? Perhaps because the people behind it
and other ``ethical shopping'' sites like Ecomall and Enviroshop
are no fools. They know that for many consumers, the act of
shopping isn't just about what they want to own but also about what
they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   And so if I clicked the Order button, perhaps I would become
socially and environmentally conscientious, someone who supports,
say, the earthenware-producing efforts of an Indonesian women's
cooperative. I could also buy products that show my support for
animal rights, human rights, employee rights, community rights.
Also, I try not to litter.
</P>
<P>
   As you can probably tell, I didn't arrive at Ethical Shopper
with anything but disdain for something I saw as a marketing
gimmick. Even for someone who likes to shop as much as I do, it
would seem the height of self-delusion to equate the process of
buying useless trinkets with responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping, in fact, is the kind of activity I engage in to avoid
behaving in a morally responsible fashion. If I truly cared about
animals, for instance, wouldn't I stop gazing at the picture of the
hemp pet collar long enough to take my dog out into the yard for
some training to reiterate the importance of not running in front
of cars?
</P>
<P>
   Ethical shopping sites play upon that exquisitely painful
combination of lust and guilt that only shopping elicits. I was
online, happily imagining how the potpourri box would look on the
shelf in the bathroom when all of a sudden, my mind flashed on the
sad image of a chocolate Labrador retriever limping around the
neighborhood in a hip cast.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt won. And if I had been browsing among the limited wares in
a small gift shop in the real world, I would have simply walked
out. But online, where shopkeepers aren't limited by the amount of
physical space available to store inventory, the varied wares of
countless independent retailers are displayed enticingly on a
single Web site. And impulse buying is much easier when all you
have to do is click. I realized this when in my haste trying to log
off, I accidentally clicked instead on Eco-Supermarket and saw that
the Ethical Shopper was selling Annie's Homegrown Macaroni and
Cheese. I usually buy cheaper, inferior brands, the ones with
artificial colorings and artificial flavorings and actual
preservatives, because Annie's costs $1.49 a box at my local
supermarket. But here was an opportunity to get a case of 24 boxes
of the comparatively delicious Annie's brand at nearly $1.35 per
box ($27, plus $5.30 for shipping) and yes, the bunny pasta shape
was available.
</P>
<P>
   To reassure myself that 14 cents per box was a significant
saving, I applied my Starbuck's standard: let's see, 14 cents times
24 boxes equals slightly more than two cups at Starbuck's. Just
think of all that free coffee I would be drinking next week.
</P>
<P>
   Did I need 24 boxes of macaroni and cheese? Of course not. But I
did need to believe, temporarily, that I could be the sort of
mother whose children could finish dinner without having the
telltale evidence of orange chemical residue on their lips.
</P>
<P>
   I made a quick side trip to compare prices at the Annie's
Homegrown Web page (www.annies.com). I could order the identical
item for $30 including shipping _ $2.30 less than the Ethical
Shopper price. Then it hit me: Since the Ethical Shopper charges a
flat-rate shipping fee, the answer was to purchase more things,
spreading out the shipping costs.
</P>
<P>
   Did I forget to mention that I had been eyeing a bamboo-strip
book journal ($12), with paper made from Himalayan bark? With two
daughters who are diary-keeping fiends, I was bound to purchase
some journals somewhere out there in the world of shopping. Why not
buy socially responsible ones?
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping. Flat-rate shipping. Coveting Himalayan
bark-paper diaries. Somehow I didn't feel I was really in the
spirit of ethical shopping. But as I found out later, talking to
one of the Ethical Shopper's co-founders, Rachel Prishkolnick, on
the phone, that is exactly the reason shoppers end up buying
environmentally friendly products.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to buy a certain item anyway,'' she said,
``and you're given the choice of buying a product that's socially
conscious over something that's not, where's the dilemma? There
also is an increasing knowledge of our environment and the damage
we've done and how that affects us.''
</P>
<P>
   So buying from one of the growing number of online purveyors of
socially conscious products fills a great shopping need: the
ability for me to believe simultaneously in behaving selflessly
(supporting socially conscientious companies) even while I
selfishly get what I want. In other words, I could buy what I
wanted and, in some small way, what I wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the experience cost me $56.30, and we will be eating
macaroni until it makes us cry. But at least I didn't get hulls all
over the bedroom floor.

   PERFECT FOR THE HOLIDAYS: Mary Andrews of Azle in North Texas
would like a recipe for cheese puffs. This is a classic recipe,
using French pate a choux. Don't let that scare you; the dough is
rather fun to make, and you'll feel so accomplished afterward. This
version is from ``The Joy of Cooking.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CHEESE PUFFS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 48
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   _ 4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 1/2 cups Gruyere cheese
</P>
<P>
   Position rack in lower third of oven. Preheat oven to 400
degrees. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
</P>
<P>
   Bring first 4 ingredients to full boil over medium heat. Add
flour all at once and stir vigorously with wooden spoon until
mixture pulls away from sides of pan. Continue to cook and stir
mixture for about 1 minute, to eliminate excess moisture. The
butter may ooze out, which is fine; it simply means the moisture is
evaporating. Transfer to a bowl and let cool for 5 minutes.
stirring occasionally. Beat in eggs one at a time with a wooden
spoon, or on low speed with a mixer. Make sure the paste is smooth
before adding the next egg. Beat dough until smooth and shiny. Stir
in 1 cup cheese. Choux paste can be covered and refrigerated for up
to 4 hours. When it is cold, you don't need to bring the paste to
room temperature before shaping.
</P>
<P>
   To shape, spoon dough into a pastry bag fitted with 1/2-inch
plain tip. Pipe puffs 1 inch wide and 1 inch high. If you're
frightened of pastry bags, a common affliction, spoon dough onto
parchment paper with a tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth any tails or curls on the puffs with a finger dipped in
cold water. Dust tops of puffs with some of the remaining grated
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees
and continue to bake until golden brown and very firm to the touch,
up to 15 minutes more. Turn off oven, turn puffs upside down and
let sit in oven for 15 minutes.

recipe. Does anyone have that recipe?
</P>
<P>
   _ Patricia Long's husband's grandmother (following all of that?)
used to make a banana pie that was like a fruit pie _ not a cream

   _ Flo Clark would like to duplicate Walnetto candy at home. Can
anyone help?

CHURCH TURNS DOWN MONEY TO HELP PAY FOR ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON and LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Catholic archdiocese of San Francisco has
turned down an offer from a private donor to cover the church's
contribution to support the statewide voter initiative that would
reinforce California's ban on gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   California's 12 Catholic dioceses have contributed more than
$310,000 to support the initiative, formally known as the
Protection of Marriage Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   After the San Francisco Archdiocese announced its $31,724
contribution to the campaign, a donor came forward offering an
anonymous contribution to cover that expense, archdiocesan
spokesman Maurice Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the archdiocese and the California Catholic
Conference, the public policy arm of the state's 28 Roman Catholic
bishops, found that state law would not allow the donor to remain
nameless, Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   Healy declined to identify the potential donor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a San Francisco priest has written Archbishop William
J. Levada objecting to the Roman Catholic hierarchy's financial and
political support of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rev. Zachary Shore of Most Holy Redeemer Catholic
Church read his letter to Levada at Sunday's 10 a.m. Mass,
parishioners gave him a thunderous standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Gay parishioners ``are hurt, they're frustrated, they're
angry,'' he said, describing his congregation's reaction to church
support of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, which will be on the ballot in March 2000, is
sponsored by state Sen. William J. ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale,
whose gay son has publicly opposed the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Shore assured his gay parishioners that their offerings to
Sunday collections would stay in the parish and would not go to
support the initiative. He said his parish's only contribution to
the archdiocese comes through a special annual collection.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, now
housing a military school and the wrestling club, he discussed his
dream: To attend Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that better relations between Iran and the United
States will someday allow his dream to come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamani. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ As a revolutionary 20 years ago, Iranian Mohammad
Ebrahim Asgharzadeh considered it an obligation to take over the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a popular Tehran city councilman, he is in the forefront of
Iran's reformers. He says it may be time _ given the right terms _
for the two countries to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to take over the embassy,'' Asgharzadeh said
recently from his wood-paneled office in Tehran city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction. The Shah going to the U.S. was not
acceptable to us,'' Asgharzadeh said. ``We had to make claims
against what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asgharzadeh looks more yuppie than rebel. He's a
trim 44 year-old with salt and pepper gray hair. In his
wood-paneled city hall office last week, he wore a wool sport
jacket, slacks and argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   He has three children and had to give up his executive post at a
steel company to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh does not speak for all the hostage takers. Numbering
about 300, they represent the spectrum of opinions in Iran's
current political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still ardent defenders of Iran's strict religious rule
and defiance of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is one of several former embassy stormers
supporting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up
the country's economy and strengthen its democracy. Those are just
the moves western leaders look for.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has come from just the types of religious hardliners
who the embassy takeover helped strengthen amid anti-American
fervor. The hardliners, seeking to maintain strict religious
control over government, appear to fear that reformers like
Asgharzadeh could dilute their power.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, shortly after Asgharzadeh used the 19th
anniversary of the takeover to invite former hostages back to
visit, he was badly beaten by a gang. The attackers may have been
trying to keep him from running for the city council.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is not the only former hostage-taker to speak
out. Abbas Abdi, met publicly with former hostage Barry Rosen last
year in Paris. According to Rosen, Abdi apologized for the personal
pain he caused Rosen and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Abdi were idealists. They were young and they
believed in the Islamic revolution. They believed it was the birth
of a new freedom for them,'' Rosen said. ``Over the years, they
came to realize it was the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh denies that he has changed or mellowed, saying he
has just acted realistically with the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he was active in the revolution that overthrew the
dictatorial Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Shah.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter agreed to let the Shah enter the
United States for medical treatment, Asgharzadeh was among a small
group of leaders who organized the embassy takeover. He became the
group's spokesman but says now that he had no idea the hostage
crisis would last for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not possibly predict what would be the main result
and the reaction,'' he said. ``We just wanted to do something, some
kind of a student movement. It was very unprofessional and
amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagined that the U.S. would return the Shah to us and that
would finish the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shah should have faced the same fate as former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, who may face a trial for
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh describes a spiral of miscalculations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said the students were quickly disappointed that students in
the United States did not seem sympathetic to their cause. In the
wake of the embassy takeover, he said, the public in Iran and the
United States unified around their country's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the Carter administration escalated the
tensions and prolonged the crisis with economic sanctions and a
failed rescue attempt in the desert. Many in Iran think the landing
in the desert was an attempt to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and reinstate the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh conto be a stern critic of U.S. policy today,
saying America still seems arrogant in its dealing with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. believes that it is the winner of the Cold War, and
if this image will be the basis of its foreign policy with Europe,
the Pacific Rim countries, countries like Iran, they will have
problems,'' he said. ``It disgraces a nation to be put down and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the intense animosities of the embassy crisis have
waned and public opinion has become more varied in both Iran and
the United States. That, he said, provides an opportunity for
Khatami to attempt to appeal to the American public and Clinton to
approach the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion and emotions among our peoples would be derived
from the behavior and decision-making of our officials,'' he said.
``A relationship should be based on mutual respect and recognition
of each country's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Asgharzadeh concludes, that America is a world
power that Iran cannot ignore and Islamic Iran has emerged as a
power that America cannot ignore _ regardless of their history of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to forget about the past to be able to
build a future,'' he said. ``We have to accept what has happened in
reality and the future should be built on facts.''

FASTER AND FASTER, BUT WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another generation of faster microprocessors is about to arrive
in the stores, just in time to spark a new wave of holiday
technology lust among the pocket-protector crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Faster chips are introduced every few months. We all know that
the hot new PC chip that is the champion of the silicon drag strip
today will in just a couple of years become the desktop equivalent
of the embarrassing old clunker that leaves oil stains in the
driveway. But as always, the most significant result of the
introduction of new chips is that they inevitably trigger a price
war, and that typically translates to cheaper yet better computers
for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though costs are rising for memory chips and other PC
components, this week's processor price wars between the Intel
Corporation and its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices, are
expected to offset most of those increases and keep PC prices
steady before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any PC sold today, even those costing less than $500,
have enough processing power to perform the basic computing tasks
that consumers ask them to do, like connecting to the Internet for
electronic mail and online shopping, playing simple games and
writing business plans for new Internet start-ups. Getting more
processing power for the same money is a welcome bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few more advanced applications, like 3-D graphics,
high-end computer games, professional graphics, rocket science,
software development, digital video editing, speech recognition and
downloading streams of bootlegged music files from the Internet
while doing the computer equivalent of standing on one foot and
balancing spinning plates on a stick, the faster the microprocessor
the better.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to that audience, the Intel Corp. this week introduced
15 new and enhanced Pentium III microprocessors based on an
advanced production technology called Coppermine. Nine of the new
Coppermine Pentium III chips will be used in desktop computers,
with speeds ranging from 500 megahertz to 733 megahertz, or
millions of cycle per second. Computers built around these chips
are expected to cost from $1,200 to $2,500. Three chips will be
used in notebook computers, with speeds of 400, 450 and 500 MHz.
Three more, at speeds of 600, 667 and 700 MHz, are to be used in
powerful workstations and servers that consumers rarely see.
</P>
<P>
   Coppermine has nothing to do with the copper manufacturing
process developed by IBM as a superior replacement for aluminum in
microprocessors. Rather, it is Intel's code word for a new
.18-micron manufacturing process. A micron is a millionth of meter,
so .18 microns is exceptionally small. Earlier Pentium III and
Pentium II chips were made using a .25-micron process.
</P>
<P>
   By squeezing the Pentium III's 28 million transistors into less
space, the new Coppermine Pentium III chips are smaller, faster and
cooler. Faster is better for obvious reasons, and smaller chips not
only allow smaller and more stylish devices, but they also consume
less power, which means they do not get as hot. Smaller, cooler
chips that use less power are ideally suited for portable PC's.
</P>
<P>
   The new manufacturing process allows Intel to integrate the main
processing unit with a high-speed memory subsystem called a Level 2
cache, all on the same die. Until now, the L2 cache was on a
separate chip. The 256 kilobytes of full-speed, integrated cache on
the Coppermine chips improves their performance significantly,
Intel says, outperforming twice as much cache memory on a separate
chip.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part. Unfortunately, Intel made this a very
confusing introduction.
</P>
<P>
   After months of hype, Intel failed to deliver a new supporting
chip set, called the i820, that the company said was to have been
the underlying platform for getting the highest performance from
the new Coppermine processors. The i820 chip set is needed to allow
the new Pentium III to take advantage of a high-speed memory
subsystem called Rambus. The jury is still out on the value of the
Rambus technology for consumers. Rambus memory modules are much
faster, but also much more expensive, than current memory
technologies. Intel now says the i820 chip set will be sent to PC
makers before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the confusion, some of the new chips work only with a
slower, 100-MHz system bus _ the data path between the processor,
the memory and other system components _ while others work only
with a faster, 133-MHz bus. Some work with either.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of the new chips appear to compete with earlier
Pentium III chips at the same clock speed. Some consumers will need
help telling them apart without opening the computer case.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect is that there is a lot of confusion about the new
chips, even among industry analysts with advanced engineering
degrees. Consumers who do not need to buy a new PC right away may
want to wait until the smoke clears. High-end-PC users, including
game fanatics, may want to wait until computers arrive with the
i820 chip set, which also includes support for a new graphics
standard called AGP 4X.
</P>
<P>
   Technological esoterica aside, the Coppermine chips will allow
Intel-based machines to keep up with computers based on the
exceptionally fast Athlon processor from Advanced Micro Devices, at
700-MHz the current speed champ and darling of the 3-D game
community.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered the Salieri to Intel's Mozart, AMD makes
microprocessors that run Windows software just as well as Intel's
chips do, but at lower cost. AMD has vowed to keep prices 25
percent below Intel's for comparable chips.
</P>
<P>
   AMD plans to move to the .18-micron process next year. Both
Intel and AMD have publically demonstrated 800-MHz chips, and both
have said they will push speeds beyond 1 gigahertz by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter?
</P>
<P>
   Faster chips must be evaluated in three distinct ways. One, do
they allow me to do interesting new things that I could not do
before? In some cases, yes, but remember that it takes time for
software developers to take advantage of the faster chips, and by
the time they do, prices typically are lower.
</P>
<P>
   Two, is it worth spending more now for the fastest PC chip?
Buying the fastest processor available may prolong the useful life
of the computer, but not by that much. Other important PC
components evolve as well. In terms of value, it often makes more
sense to buy a lesser computer and to plan to replace it sooner.
</P>
<P>
   And three, will a faster chip save me at least four minutes a
day? There are 1,440 minutes in a day, but there is something
magical about 4-minute chunks of time. According to ``Faster,'' a
new book by James Gleick, Americans spend an average of four
minutes every day just booting up and shutting down a Microsoft
Windows-based personal computer. Americans spend an average of four
minutes a day filling out government paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans yearn for more time to fill out government forms
or to watch Windows booting. But I would be willing to spend the
money on a new computer if it allowed me to devote more time to
more interesting pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Most Internet users spend much more than four minutes a day
waiting for their computers to retrieve electronic mail, download
graphics and audio files, and display Web pages. Investing in a
cable or DSL connection would in theory have a more profound impact
on their romantic lives than getting a faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the Internet was faster and less
frustrating to use, people might spend more time in front of the
computer screen than they probably should.

WHETTING A CHILD'S IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Product notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagynasium's opening montage of fish, chairs, kitchen
appliances and other mundane objects floating through space gives
the impression that this isn't just another drawing program for
bored children. The program, developed with Robert Redford's
Sundance Institute, has a much higher sense of purpose _ it wants
to provide an expansive workout area for creative young minds to
refine their storytelling, music and art skills.
</P>
<P>
   Designed for children 7 to 12, Imagynasium is an engaging
program than pushes them to think in both linear and nonlinear ways
by creating projects on screen and off.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the program, the player is whisked to the
Skyscape screen, a futuristic, rainbow-hued urban sprawl. The names
of the various Imagynasium areas pop up as the cursor moves around
the city, and a quick click takes the user right to the desired
place.
</P>
<P>
   The program has three main sections: Downtown, the Jingle Jungle
and the Curio Shop. Little candy-colored space aliens named Mondo,
Frida, Roxie, Riff and Spike guide the child through the program,
serving as hosts in the different areas and providing instructions.
The child is also given an on-screen box called a collector to use
during the session. Objects found throughout the program, like
pictures of telephones or bison, can be dragged into the collector
for use in the creative areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Downtown, children can make festive collages by combining
objects, text and backgrounds onto a canvas. Separate items in the
collage can also be given motions and sounds through the program's
controls, and the work can be viewed full size on the computer
screen with one click. The art can also be saved and printed out
for framing or prominent placement on the family's refrigerator.
(This section of the program was particularly exciting for someone
who had to make collages in the early 1970s with nothing but safety
scissors, paste and old copies of Newsweek _ thus producing far too
many sticky masterpieces starring Henry Kissinger, Olga Korbut and
the bird from the Old Crow whisky ads.)
</P>
<P>
   The Jingle Jungle is the music area of Imagynasium. A blue
soundboard sits in the middle of the screen, surrounded by dozens
of icons like bugs and flowers that represent different sounds. The
child can listen to the sounds, everything from harmonica wails to
soprano vocal flourishes, by clicking on them. The sounds can be
arranged to make a soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The soundboard itself is divided by a grid, allowing four
different sounds to play simultaneously. Background rhythm tracks
are represented by creatures called ``backbeat worms'' (a great
name for a rock band, by the way) and play along with the other
sounds the child has selected.
</P>
<P>
   The story-creation place in the program is the Curio Shop. Using
a circular, multipage canvas, children can create their own visual
narratives by dragging and dropping stock characters, backgrounds,
sound effects and music onto a palette. The user can write text to
go with the picture and add it to a page. The resulting opus can be
read like a storybook or viewed like a movie.
</P>
<P>
   For children who need help deciding what to do next, each
section of Imagynasium comes with its own Brain Booster area that
provides suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Imagynasium has a distinctive look _ sort of Salvador Dali
crossed with Monty Python _ that engages the child's visual
faculties right off the bat. The program's instructions, easily
found by pressing the F1 key, are not always obvious on screen.
That encourages the user to wander freely, pointing and clicking on
things to see what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the thought and effort that has been put into
Imagynasium, it is still not a substitute for spending time with
paint and crayons. A character in the program offers perhaps the
best advice of all: ``This is a great place to come and be
creative. But you don't have to stop when you go back to the real
world.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, now
housing a military school and the wrestling club, he discussed his
dream: To attend Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that better relations between Iran and the United
States will someday allow his dream to come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamani. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ As a revolutionary 20 years ago, Iranian Mohammad
Ebrahim Asgharzadeh considered it an obligation to take over the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a popular Tehran city councilman, n the forefront of
Iran's reformers. He says it may be time _ given the right terms _
for the two countries to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to take over the embassy,'' Asgharzadeh said
recently from his wood-paneled office in Tehran city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction. The Shah going to the U.S. was not
acceptable to us,'' Asgharzadeh said. ``We had to make claims
against what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asgharzadeh looks more yuppie than rebel. He's a
trim 44 year-old with salt and pepper gray hair. In his
wood-paneled city hall office last week, he wore a wool sport
jacket, slacks and argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   He has three children and had to give up his executive post at a
steel company to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh does not speak for all the hostage takers. Numbering
about 300, they represent the spectrum of opinions in Iran's
current political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still ardent defenders of Iran's strict religious rule
and defiance of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is one of several former embassy stormers
supporting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up
the country's economy and strengthen its democracy. Those are just
the moves western leaders look for.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has come from just the types of religious hardliners
who the embassy takeover helped strengthen amid anti-American
fervor. The hardliners, seeking to maintain strict religious
control over government, appear to fear that reformers like
Asgharzadeh could dilute their power.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, shortly after Asgharzadeh used the 19th
anniversary of the takeover to invite former hostages back to
visit, he was badly beaten by a gang. The attackers may have been
trying to keep him from running for the city council.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is not the only former hostage-taker to speak
out. Abbas Abdi, met publicly with former hostage Barry Rosen last
year in Paris. According to Rosen, Abdi apologized for the personal
pain he caused Rosen and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Abdi were idealists. They were young and they
believed in the Islamic revolution. They believed it was the birth
of a new freedom for them,'' Rosen said. ``Over the years, they
came to realize it was the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh denies that he has changed or mellowed, saying he
has just acted realistically with the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he was active in the revolution that overthrew the
dictatorial Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Shah.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter agreed to let the Shah enter the
United States for medical treatment, Asgharzadeh was among a small
group of leaders who organized the embassy takeover. He became the
group's spokesman but says now that he had no idea the hostage
crisis would last for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not possibly predict what would be the main result
and the reaction,'' he said. ``We just wanted to do something, some
kind of a student movement. It was very unprofessional and
amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagined that the U.S. would return the Shah to us and that
would finish the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shah should have faced the same fate as former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, who may face a trial for
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh describes a spiral of miscalculations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said the students were quickly disappointed that students in
the United States did not seem sympathetic to their cause. In the
wake of the embassy takeover, he said, the public in Iran and the
United States unified around their country's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the Carter administration escalated the
tensions and prolonged the crisis with economic sanctions and a
failed rescue attempt in the desert. Many in Iran think the landing
in the desert was an attempt to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and reinstate the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh continues to be a stern critic of U.S. policy today,
saying America still seems arrogant in its dealing with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. believes that it is the winner of the Cold War, and
if this image will be the basis of its foreign policy with Europe,
the Pacific Rim countries, countries like Iran, they will have
problems,'' he said. ``It disgraces a nation to be put down and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the intense animosities of the embassy crisis have
waned and public opinion has become more varied in both Iran and
the United States. That, he said, provides an opportunity for
Khatami to attempt to appeal to the American public and Clinton to
approach the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion and emotions among our peoples would be derived
from the behavior and decision-making of our officials,'' he said.
``A relationship should be based on mutual respect and recognition
of each country's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Asgharzadeh concludes, that America is a world
power that Iran cannot ignore and Islamic Iran has emerged as a
power that America cannot ignore _ regardless of their history of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to forget about the past to be able to
build a future,'' he said. ``We have to accept what has happened in
reality and the future should be built on facts.''

THOSE DARK CORNERS OF THE WEB: SITES FOR HORROR AND THE OCCULT

   Halloween is a holiday with ancient roots that span many
cultures. The modern observance is thought to be a mixture of
influences from the Celtic festival of Samhain, Pomona Day in
ancient Rome and the Christian holidays of All Saints and All Souls
Days. In tune with its varied ancestry, Halloween sites on the Web
range from serious to silly.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a quick supply of Halloween information,
go to the obvious address, www.halloween.com. A hefty collection of
links resides there, and you can find everything virtual from
haunted houses to ghost stories and Halloween jokes. Information
about witches, both fictional and modern Wiccan, abounds. A link to
an electronic tour of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia is
there as well, for those who want a historical digression.
</P>
<P>
   Another plentiful source of spooky lore is the Halloween on the
Net page (www.holidays.net/halloween). In addition to a virtual
pumpkin patch to tromp through, the site has a section devoted to
Los Dias de los Muertos _ the Day of the Dead, a traditional
Mexican holiday. It is celebrated Oct. 31 through Nov. 2 to honor
one's ancestors. Although a holiday with the name Day of the Dead
may sound a bit morbid, it is actually a rather joyful time of
remembrance in Mexico, with parades and family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween seems to be a natural time to look up the writer J.K.
Rowlings' ubiquitous Harry Potter, with his adventures and tales of
adolescent witches and wizards. In addition to starring in three
best-sellers, the young wizard-in-training has his own official
home on the Internet www.scholastic.com/harrypotter, and the site
has a few features that do more than sell the books. Children can
play trivia games and download a Harry Potter screen saver (
available for both Windows and Macintosh). The site also contains
discussion guides and a reading circle where readers can post
comments and share their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Scary.com (www.scary.com) is a horror-themed Web site that
offers plenty of G-rated thrills and chills. A character named
Shriek the Bat (who even has his own playable theme song) leads
children through the fully interactive site, which includes a jam
session by a mummy band and a point-and-click haunted house. The
site features original Web cartoons _ one of which is ``Dead Run,''
the tale of a boy who really, really wants to be a vampire. The
cartoons are created by Spunky Productions, which also has
non-Halloween-themed shows at its main site, www.spunkytown.com.
The cartoons are created in Macromedia's Flash program and new
episodes appear regularly. Children can click on a character in
midshow to get more information and can e-mail jokes from the
program to friends. And there is a bonus for parents: the Web
cartoons can be watched at any time of year.
</P>
<P>
   And for those of you too shy _ or too cool _ to scream on the
big night, www.americangreetings.com is offering free electronic
Halloween greetings that will send the screams of seven
celebrities, including Gillian Anderson from The X-Files, _ to the
e-mail boxes of your friends and family. For every scream sent,
American Greetings says it will send make a 10-cent donation to the
Starlight Children's Foundation, a non-profit group dedicated to
helping children with serious illnesses.

MAKING IT EASY TO FIND OUT WHERE ALL YOUR MONEY GOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George was first spotted in Bremerton, Wash. He attended an arts
festival in Seattle, made his way to a coffee shop in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., and was last seen in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   This particular George is a 1995-series one-dollar bill, and his
biography is made possible by Where's George, a Web site that has
thousands of people tracking their money as it circulates through
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Users type in their ZIP codes and the serial numbers of any
United States denomination up to $100. Then they write
``www.wheresgeorge.com'' on the bills and go out and spend them,
banking on the possibility that future owners will be curious
enough to visit the site and update the bills' travel history. So
far, 55,000 people have entered about 815,000 bills, or more than
$5 million worth of currency.
</P>
<P>
   No, the site does not have a ticker clicking off the federal
deficit or political statements about the evils of consumerism.
Hank Eskin, 34, the database programming consultant who founded the
site two years ago, said he had simply come up with the idea while
pondering his pocket change and its destiny. ``It's a fun
diversion,'' Eskin said. ``Some people would call it a useless
diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the kind of diversion that could be possible only
through the Internet. Once a bill is registered, the site reports
the time between sightings, the distance traveled and any comments
from the finders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got this at a strip club in Brooklyn,'' someone wrote about
one wild single. A man in Bakersfield, Calif., who found a
registered dollar bill the day after a major tremor wrote that it
``survived the earthquake with the courage of a C note.''
</P>
<P>
   On the site's forum, chatters compare ``hit rates''_ the
percentage of bills they send out that are reported found. Four
percent is considered a good return. Serious players buy Where's
George rubber stamps ($15 through the Web site) to make marking
bills easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get to this, but people are obsessed
by it,'' Eskin said. ``They'll come home and stamp and enter bills
before going out to dinner to spend them. They'll get all their
spouse's bills and mark them and put them back.'' A man in New
Jersey has stamped more than 60,000 singles.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua McGee, a software engineer in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said
the site had changed his spending patterns. ``I used to use my
debit card whenever I could,'' he said. ``Now I intentionally pay
for things with cash.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had once purchased a VCR with a stack of ones. ``I
asked the cashier, `Could you use any singles?' which is a
wonderful entrapment phrase,'' McGee said. He tracks his bills with
a map, marking hits with pushpins. He had to expand to a world map
when a Swedish exchange student picked up one of his bills while
shopping in California and took it overseas.
</P>
<P>
   There is competition to get the most hits from the most
interesting places. As in any game, some players try to cheat.
Eskin continually updates his validation process for the 10,000
bills that are entered into his system daily, weeding out serial
numbers that are obviously false or bills entered repeatedly by a
person trying to claim a better hit ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Purposely bringing bills to other states and recording them
there is considered out of bounds, as is passing them back and
forth between family members in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do like to be sure that the bills actually enter
circulation,'' Eskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some spenders adopt creative strategies: taping a bill to a
balloon and letting it fly, leaving a 20-dollar bill in a book in a
bookstore or putting a bill in a bottle and throwing it into a
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's self-advertising, which is really intriguing,'' Eskin
said. ``I don't know of many businesses that do that. A friend of
mind at work said why don't I just stamp `Saab' on all my dollar
bills and advertise Saab? Well, you can, but what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   While Eskin, who has an MBA from the Wharton School, would love
to run his own business, for now the site is just a break-even
hobby. Advertisements on the site cover some of the cost of the
server, but not the 20 to 30 hours a week he spends maintaining the
site and answering questions, including the inevitable one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other day,'' he said, ``I'll get an e-mail from somebody
who asks, `Don't you know that defacing currency is illegal?'''
</P>
<P>
   It can be, he said, if it renders the bill unfit to be reissued
_ by cutting off numbers to change the denomination, for instance,
or altering serial numbers. But stamping ``Where's George'' on a
bill doesn't destroy the bill, Eskin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a dollar bill,'' he said. ``You can still spend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Dickens, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, agreed. ``According to the laws as they stand now, the
practice is not illegal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even at $4.8 million, the marked money amounts to less than
one-thousandth of 1 percent of the currency in circulation. And the
Secret Service, which enforces the defacement law, has not bothered
Eskin. ``They've got better things to do,'' he said. ``They want to
catch counterfeiters counterfeiting billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be that very defiance of authority, that feeling of
control over something produced by the government that fuels
peoples' fascination with the site. It also fuels suspicion of Big
Brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then someone will write in, `Did anyone ever
think this is just a big conspiracy by the government to track
where our money goes?''' Eskin said. ``And a lot of time some of
the regulars will answer: `No, the government's not running it.
They couldn't build anything like this if they wanted to.'''

A DOMAIN OF ONE'S OWN 
</HEADLINE>
 (af)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently purchased a domain name from Network Solutions and
was under the impression that it cost only $29. A month later, I
got a bill for $70 for a registration fee. Is this a legitimate
charge, or am I being fleeced?
</P>
<P>
   A. The fee on your bill is the price that Network Solutions
charges for the initial registration of a domain name. The standard
price is $70 for the first two years, then $35 a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions is a private company designated by the United
States government to handle domain-name registrations; it also
administers the master database for domains.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recently approved a few other companies, like
Register.com (www.register.com), to begin selling domain names as
well. There are some companies that offer to register a domain name
with Network Solutions for a small fee, but that often does not
include the actual Network Solutions fee.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a domain name _ the unique part of a Web address,
like ``banjo.com'' _ is a fairly simple procedure that you can do
yourself on Network Solution's home page
(www.networksolutions.com). The site will let you check for
existing versions of the name you want, and if your choice is not
already taken, you can sign up for it right there.
</P>
<P>
   The name can have a maximum of 26 characters, including the
three-letter suffix. In addition to the .com address, there is an
option to acquire the .net and .org suffixes for your desired
domain name if they are available.

A CUTE LITTLE TANK ADDS INSULT TO INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Reporter's e-mail address: Herz(AT)nytimes.com.; product
notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By J.D. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the brain of a high school sophomore in the body of a
military assault vehicle, and you have Tiny Tank. The hero of a
Playstation game by the same name, Tiny is the flagship product of
Sentrax, a military contractor in this fictional world. The company
thought Tiny would be a good public relations tactic _ something
cute and approachable to sell a robot defense program to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny thinks that is a really stupid idea. The prospect of
parading around as The Little Killing Machine That Could to promote
a robot army strikes him as absurd. In the cinematic segments
between game levels, you see him arguing constantly with the
off-screen director of Sentrax's promotional advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being difficult,'' the director trills.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being a __ BLEEP! BLEEP! A cute killing machine? That's
the dumbest _ BLEEP! _ thing I've ever heard! I've got an
80-millimeter cannon for a nose!''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny is hostile. He's surly, angst-ridden and appalled by his
appearance. In other words, he's a teen-ager with treads. So when
the robot army seizes power, drives the human race underground and
threatens to remove Earth's atmosphere, Tiny can feel justified in
his contempt for authority. And as the sole opponent of a towering
corporate war machine, he has plenty of opportunities to channel
his aggression.
</P>
<P>
   And channel it he does. What Tiny lacks in size, he makes up in
firepower, adding insult to injury with a series of sarcastic
one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   He is the exact opposite of The Iron Giant _ small and nasty
instead of large and gentle. He blasts towering robots with the
same sense of entitlement as a chihuahua barking at a pack of
mastiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny's Napoleon complex transforms the game into a parody of the
standard robot epic. In most ``mech'' games, the player pilots a
machine lifted from the pages of a Japanese comic book, and the
whole story plays out like an Italian futurist manifesto: huge,
imposing machines with terrifying power wreak havoc on the
surrounding landscape. Steel behemoths exchange fire in deadly
earnest. They're as serious as a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Tiny Tank, the big robots are just as absurd as the little
one. At one point in the game, for instance, you have to destroy a
generator. Naturally, it is surrounded by giant robot guards. It's
par for the genre, except that the 40-foot city-destroyer robots
are turning pirouettes. When the music plays, they twirl en pointe,
and you're free to move around. When the music stops, they start
firing. The combination of cartoon violence and Balanchine
choreography is worthy of a Warner Bros. cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   As in a Looney Tune, there is sophisticated commentary under the
camp, if you're paying attention. Tiny Tank is a game about blowing
things up. But it also takes potshots at the media in general, and
at corporate propaganda in particular. Tiny is cynically aware that
he's a sales tool and that his endearing appearance has been
engineered to dupe millions of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny doesn't mind being small. But he hates being cute because
his cuteness is a scam, and the scam succeeded. The take-home
message: Don't trust cuteness. Don't trust commercials. And think
twice before you believe anything staged in front of an American
flag, particularly if large amounts of money are at stake. That
also squares perfectly with the world view of the typical
16-year-old channel surfer and Net savant.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bugs Bunny (or Max Headroom), Tiny is a cynical character
in a world that's brazenly artificial and self-referential. Halfway
through one level, the mission ends abruptly. ``We ran out of
memory,'' said Ed Annunziata, Tiny Tank's producer. ``So we had to
cut the level in half. And rather than staying within the fiction
of the game, we wrote a letter from the programmer where he
apologizes to the player for running out of memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he apologizes for the inconvenience, because you have
to wait, but promises that what you're about to see is a lot of fun
and he describes it _ and he signs it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's sophomoric. But what could be more perfect for sophomores?
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregg Vanderheiden regularly washes his own clothes, but unlike
most people, he never loses any socks. He is immune to that modern
plague because he uses sock sorters, small plastic rings that keep
each pair together in the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a mismatched or incomplete pair in years,''
Vanderheiden said.
</P>
<P>
   While this minor invention seems a perfect product for a Lillian
Vernon catalog, it was actually created for and originally marketed
by organizations for the blind, to help those without sight keep
their matching socks together in the dresser drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Sock sorters are not the only invention that has migrated to the
general population. Some of life's more mundane innovations,
including cut-down curbs and large-handled can openers, have come
about as solutions for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But so have many more sophisticated, high-technology inventions,
like computer scanners and optical character recognition software.
And like many such innovations, their usefulness to the rest of
society has usually been realized only over time.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas Edison filed his patent for the phonograph in 1877,
he listed 10 uses for the machine. ``Phonograph books, which will
speak to blind people without effort on their part,'' was second;
music was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-captioned television, created to help the deaf, has
become ubiquitous in the nation's health clubs, allowing people to
watch soap operas or news shows while they work out. Descriptive
audio tracks _ secondary audio programs that provide summaries of a
television show to help the blind follow the action _ are popular
with home workers who want to keep abreast of a show's developments
but cannot always stare at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   What type of person devises such solutions for what are for most
people life's minor problems? ``Football players don't invent jar
openers because they have no trouble opening jars,'' said
Vanderheiden, head of the University of Wisconsin's Trace Center,
which researches ways to improve access for the disabled to
information and telecommunications systems. ``It takes somebody who
can't live with the way the world currently is to create a new
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody in love with that type of person, like Pellegrino
Turri. In Italy in 1808, Turri invented a machine to help his
lover, the blind Countess Carolina Fantoni, write letters to him.
That typewriting device was not needed for the seeing population
because upper-class, literate people had the time to write letters,
using quill pens. Writing with a quill was a difficult task for the
blind, who could not know if their writing was uniform or if the
quill was running out of ink.
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1800s, Turri in Italy and Ralph Wedgwood in
England, working separately, each created carbon paper. Turri's
paper worked with a typewriting machine. Wedgwood's invention,
patented in 1806, allowed the blind to write without worrying about
whether the pen had ink _ a metal stylus could be used instead. By
1823, carbon paper was being marketed in the United States as a
general business product.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the disabilities, it is blindness that has led to most of
the technological innovations that have later migrated to the
general population. ``Blindness is often an absolute, in a way that
deafness isn't,'' Vanderheiden said. ``Changing from an acoustic to
a visual world is not as hard as the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond C. Kurzweil, developer of the first practical optical
character recognition software, said: ``Blind people are early
adopters. They have a much more pressing need for new technology.
Even if it's not perfected technology, it still provides a useful
sensory aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurzweil said a blind person had once explained to him that the
only real handicap for blind people was their complete lack of
access to print. Kurzweil used his expertise to create the Kurzweil
Reading Machine, the first device that gave the blind the ability
to have printed material read to them by a machine, in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The machine combined the first charge-coupled device flat-bed
scanner with optical character recognition software and a
text-to-speech voice synthesizer. The scanner transfers the printed
document into the machine, the OCR software translates the words
into recognizable text, and the synthesizer translates that text
into understandable spoken English.
</P>
<P>
   The reading machine wasn't perfect; it couldn't recognize every
word. But that was not a fatal flaw. ``We didn't need 100 percent
accuracy because a human can always detect errors and make
corrections in one's own mind,'' Kurzweil said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the strong demand from the blind made this product
successful, Kurzweil said. ``We always knew that there were
commercial applications for scanners, OCR and text-to-speech
software and that prices would eventually come down,'' he said.
``But if we had pursued the commercial market initially, we might
not have succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, text-to-speech software lets the blind read text on Web
sites and in e-mail. But while some functions are newly accessible,
the popularity of graphically rich Web sites and operating systems
like Windows and Mac OS has actually reduced the ability of blind
people to use a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, for one, understands that in its attempts to make the
Windows operating system easier to use, it has actually made the
system more difficult to use for a significant minority. To ease
accessibility problems, the company has charged a staff of 40
full-time employees with insuring that its products _ from Windows
to Office _ can be mastered by people with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Software and Web site developers are encouraged to embed hidden
descriptive text in their programs so text-to-speech software can
read the graphics to people with limited vision.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enforcing stricter requirements for those who want to
use our Windows logo on software packaging,'' said Luanne LaLonde,
the product manager for Microsoft in the accessibility and
disabilities group. ``People will need to follow our accessibility
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to those standards, Word and Excel users can magnify
their screens and increase the size of their toolbars, both
features first perfected for the visually impaired. Similarly,
while the ability to create customized keyboard shortcuts as
substitutes for various computer commands is now taken for granted,
that concept was in fact originally developed to help those with
physical disabilities find keys they could easily use.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a set of
accessibility guidelines to help the visually impaired easily read
Web sites; for example, every button on a Web page should have
accurate and appropriately descriptive text tags. Otherwise,
clicking on a button marked Search on a site might prompt
text-to-speech software to say only ``button.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti McCuller, a legally blind Web site developer, was
frustrated by her difficulty in navigating through search engines.
``My text-to-speech software let me read the various search
sites,'' she said, ``but they often put so many links on a page it
became hard to use.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because the blind, even with text-reading software,
cannot glance at a page. There is no way for them to get a quick
visual overview of a site's contents and make mental notes about
where it would be worthwhile clicking and exploring later. Rather,
the blind must laboriously click from line to line, determining by
a process of elimination where they want to go.
</P>
<P>
   As a solution, Ms. McCuller created her own search engine
(www.seti-search.com), an amalgam of other search sites that does
not force the user to move slowly around the site and wade through
advertisements to find the right place to enter a query. Search
words are entered at the top of the page, and appropriate links are
displayed above all other material as well. Users do not need to
tab through extraneous material.
</P>
<P>
   The search engine has become popular with the sighted as well as
the blind. ``Those who can see like the fact that there are no ads
getting in the way of their information,'' Ms. McCuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, staple tools of
the blind, have become integral parts of a new generation of
software that allows consumers to retrieve their e-mail by phone,
program household devices and speak to business colleagues around
the world even though they speak different languages.
</P>
<P>
   The Clarion Corp. uses speech-to- text software originally
developed by Kurzweil and licensed from the Lernout &AMP; Hauspie Corp.
for Auto PC, an in-car computer that responds to voice commands and
reads e-mail and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Jfax.com utilizes text-to-speech software to give consumers the
ability to hear their phone messages, e-mail and, eventually, their
faxes over the telephone. The service is popular with business
people and others who are often not near a computer, said the
company's president, Gary Hickox. In the future, a customer will be
able to dictate a letter over the phone and have it sent as an
e-mail text message.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie has demonstrated its new simultaneous
translation system, which with just a one-second delay allows the
user to speak in English and have the words translated into another
language in a grammatically correct manner with a natural-sounding
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-to-text software translates the words into
machine-readable text, which text-to-text software translates.
Text-to-voice software simulates the sounds of the other language,
using the company's Real Speak speech synthesis software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen to 20 years from now, voice input and output for
computers could be the norm,'' said Greg Lowney, Microsoft's
director for accessibility. A restaurant filled with diners talking
into their voice-activated pocket-size devices may be the price for
society's attempt to extend the fruits of the technological
revolution to all.

   Last Friday, three respiratory-therapy students at the Borough
of Manhattan Community College were faced with an unsettling
learning experience: They were staring into the face of what looked
like a young boy having a severe allergic reaction to peanuts. His
larynx and tongue were swelling and his breathing was strained.
</P>
<P>
   One student placed a plastic resuscitator to aid breathing over
the patient's mouth. Another grabbed a syringe and administered a
dose of adrenaline, medication that increases circulation and
widens the airways. But the drug sent the patient's heart racing so
fast that it went into an abnormal rhythm and suddenly stopped
pumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no pulse,'' said Janelle Massiah, one of the
students. ``We need to defibrillate.''
</P>
<P>
   The students applied shocks to the patient's chest. Within a
second, the heart started again. The vital signs on a nearby
computer screen began to return to normal. In a few minutes, the
patient seemed to be breathing without effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I think we caught it just in time,'' said Keith
Adamik, another student, as he removed the resuscitator from the
patient's face.
</P>
<P>
   Most students in medical education would never have such
real-life interaction with a child in the throes of a severe
respiratory attack. But these students were not dealing with a live
child at all. They were interacting with a machine _ a plastic
mannequin, equipped with sensors, circuits, tubes and pumps, that
simulates the reactions of a child 5 to 7 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing and medical schools have been using mannequins and
simulated body parts for decades, but many are simply pieces of
plastic that are not equipped to simulate responses. Many schools
also use interactive computer programs that emulate medical
emergencies on a computer screen, without any physical
representation of a patient.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, however, computerized simulators that
react eerily like real people have become more commonplace.
Companies like Medical Educational Technologies Inc., in Sarasota,
Fla., and Medsim-Eagle Simulation, in Binghamton, N.Y., are
supplying schools with the virtual patients.
</P>
<P>
   The mannequin in use on Friday, which was designed to simulate
the physiology of a child, is one of the latest versions. Called a
pediatric simulator, it works in conjunction with a box of
electronic equipment and a portable computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of a half-dozen simulators that Medical Educational
Technologies is installing this fall at schools of medicine and
nursing around the country. The company also makes an adult
simulator that is in use at nearly 100 medical schools, nursing
schools, community colleges and military training sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have virtually no opportunity to practice in real
life on children,'' said Lou Oberndorf, president of the company.
``The consequence is that when a real emergency happens, it very
well may be the first time they are working with a child.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Pediasim, physical characteristics _ like the size of the
airways and lungs _ are scaled down to the size of a child's. The
software has also been adapted to include drug reactions and
emergency situations that typically affect children, like allergic
reactions and respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The Pediasim works by responding to commands that are entered on
a computer and then transmitted to the mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   In the scenario faced by the students at the Borough of
Manhattan Community College, Prof. Neil Rodia had set up the
software to demonstrate what might happen if a young boy came into
an emergency room with an allergic reaction to peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   When the students were introduced to the virtual patient, the
computer sent signals to the Pediasim that caused a balloon within
its tongue to expand, simulating swelling. That cut off air to the
lungs, which actually inhale air and exhale carbon dioxide. Using
stethoscopes applied to tiny speakers embedded in the mannequin,
the students could hear the sounds of the patient's heart and
lungs, choreographed by the software. The mannequin does not have a
heart, but electronic equipment stored within a box nearby sends
electrical pulses to spots on the chest and the wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Other features include eyelids that can be opened and closed for
clinical inspection and pupils that dilate or contract in response
to either light or software commands. The pressure of fluids moving
through tubes in the mannequin can simulate blood pressure and can
be measured by a monitor wrapped around the arm. The tongue can be
depressed to allow for intubation, the process of inserting a tube
into the patient's windpipe. Clinicians often have more difficulty
intubating children than adults because the airways are smaller;
sometimes the tube is inserted into the esophagus by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Pediasim also has the ability to simulate the effect of
various medications. The simulator comes with bar-coded syringes,
with each bar code representing a different drug. The mannequin
measures the amount of fluid injected and reads the type of
medication with a bar-code scanner. The computer then sends signals
back to the virtual body to cause it to react physically to the
injection.
</P>
<P>
   Professors can manipulate the programs to create a number of
scenarios, like an adverse reaction to a drug or no reaction at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rig it so that even if students are doing it properly,
the patient may still have no response,'' Rodia said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a far better teaching scenario, Rodia said, than
simply asking students to read books and listen to lectures about
what might happen in different situations. Even when students go
into hospital rotations to see real-life emergencies, he said,
``they usually just stand back and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical Education Technologies sells the Pediasim _ including
the mannequin, electronics box and software _ to community colleges
for $160,000 and to medical schools, which use simulators with
additional features, for $175,000. The adult version costs roughly
the same amount, although a college that already has an adult
version can buy the Pediasim mannequin and software for $35,000 and
plug it into its existing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the company are now investigating how they might
create a virtual baby that is less than 6 months old. ``We'll have
to shrink our technology even further,'' Oberndorf said.

AN UP-CLOSE, PERSONAL LOOK AT AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It begins, appropriately, with a gray shot of a graveyard. Then
the camera pans to a little girl twirling in the wind, and you're
left with a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   This is where mothers and fathers with AIDS end up. They die.
Sometimes their children die, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has the potential to look like is decimated
communities, decimated economies, decimated work forces, decimated
families,'' a woman with flowing dreadlocks is saying now about the
devastating effect of AIDS in the African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   This is the result. This is why we shouldn't let our guard down,
and why we should pay attention to AIDS. It's why it's important to
be our sister's keeper. Our brother's, too.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a national awareness and outreach campaign announced
last week by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, or NAACP, the film suggests as much.
</P>
<P>
   And then you're eye to eye with a sweet-faced little girl, and
she's telling you what you already knew, but what she just learned
about the deadly virus: ``I knew you could catch it, but I just
thought it would never come this close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how AIDS is. It's personal. And still very deadly.
</P>
<P>
   To date, an estimated 6 million women worldwide have died from
AIDS. And although treatment has progressed, there is no cure.
There are measures women can take, however, to prevent being
infected. This is the other message the NAACP wants to convey.
</P>
<P>
   The civil-rights organization, along with DuPont Pharmaceuticals
and AT&AMP;T Broadband &AMP; Internet Services, began distributing
education films last week focusing on HIV prevention, detection,
treatment and access to care.
</P>
<P>
   The three films will be showcased over AT&AMP;T and other cable
television systems, including Cablevision, Cox and Time Warner.
They will also be made available at AIDS service organizations and
the NAACP's 2,200 branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film project is an important step for the NAACP and our
continued commitment to fighting this health epidemic,'' Kweisi
Mfume, president and chief executive officer of the NAACP, said in
a news release. ``With the escalation of HIV/AIDS in the
African-American community, we are taking the initiative to deal
with what has become a national health crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the film, poet Maya Angelou put it this way:
``It really is a war against not just the virus, but it is a war
against ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   This brings to mind one of the film's Deborah Fountaine moments.
Fountaine is an AIDS outreach coordinator in Atlanta. Women tell
her all the time, she said, that the epidemic ``doesn't affect me;
I don't have to worry about that, I have been with my man for five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   What she tells them is that they have no idea who else he has
been with during those five years.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing is, we don't hear the men's stories. Not in this
film. But you know this is their story, too. According to the
national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta,
AIDS is the leading cause of death among African-Americans ages
25-44. That's men and women. In addition, blacks account for 45
percent of new reported AIDS cases, although we make up only 13
percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Mika Washington, Arlene Clark, Evelyne Zachary and Michele Lopez
were monogamous. Their men weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you are among those who say that those stories have
nothing to do with you. That's what these women believed, too. They
found out they were wrong, and the loss and mourning began long
before they were infected.
</P>
<P>
   This is what AIDS is like. It's personal, and we had better
start treating it that way.  &QL;

   DELAWARE, N.J. _ The little notice, thumbtacked to the peeling
wallpaper, is easy to miss. In spindly script, oxidized by time, it
reads: ``Please don't throw hair, papers or anything else in the
slopbucket.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the charms of a country hotel, circa 1900.
</P>
<P>
   When Hal Bromm, a TriBeCa gallery owner, and Doneley Meris, a
bereavement therapist, bought the old yellow clapboard Delawanna
Hotel here as a weekend retreat for themselves and their friends,
there were 23 bedrooms. And lest any of those friends felt left
out, there was a stone guest house on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep stopping in to ask if this is a bed and breakfast,
and how much does it cost a night,'' said Bromm, a tall man with
dark curly hair, managing to sound both bemused and ever so
slightly annoyed. ``We tell them it's just for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, they've ripped out walls, stripped woodwork and painted,
painted, painted: unusual colors, like a spice-laden pumpkin-pie
yellow, a frosty turquoise and the deep, deep green of ivy on a
shady wall. They've transformed the downstairs into elegant salons
and have combined some second-floor chambers into big bedrooms
ready for their 15 pages of design-magazine fame. They just
finished turning a separate two-bedroom apartment into a home
office, as Bromm spends less and less time in TriBeCa. Along the
way, they created collections: globes, stuffed birds and antique
vacuum cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   They started with 23 bedrooms. Now they're down to just 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the third floor is still untamed. It's reminiscent of ``The
Shining'': all the doors leading off a skinny, dark hotel corridor.
And those bedrooms _ rooming-house size, 8 by 13 feet, each with a
tall four-paned window, each with its original Easter-egg-colored
paint, which, appropriately, has cracks running from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bromm owns an art gallery the house is stuffed with
canvases hung on all the walls (even in the unused and unheated
third-floor bedrooms). Others fill a couple of unused rooms like
bubble-wrapped mummies.
</P>
<P>
   On the third floor, there's a room furnished with the work of
Russell Sharon, an artist represented by Bromm: wavy pieces of red,
yellow, green and blue wood create a headboard. Another assemblage
turns out to be a table and chairs. The room won't be used in
winter: a collection of air-conditioners (nonvintage) are arrayed
on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Bromm and Meris were reluctantly surrendering to
the autumn winds. The 120-foot-long wooden porch, which for half
the year is bedecked with vintage flags, was going into
hibernation. The 1920s ice cream parlor chairs were being stacked
and taken up to a bedroom. The white wicker planters followed. The
McCoy pottery planters in asparagus green and maize yellow were
emptied and arrayed on a wooden side table with turned legs, its
white paint just beginning to flake off. The plank floor, painted
the black-green of your mother's best Windsor chair, was swept and
will be repainted in the spring, whether it needs it or not.
</P>
<P>
   As they carried furniture, the screech of a power tool ripped
the air. A carpenter was taking off siding before blowing cellulose
insulation into the walls of one wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the endless list of invisible work that people
seldom appreciate,'' Bromm said. ``Traditionally, people think of
paper, floor finishing and colors. But a lot of very serious and
important work needs to happen first. The stuff that when people
come over for a drink on your porch, they don't say, `Ooh, look at
that great electrical outlet under the plant stand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meris turned up the Brazilian music on the stereo. ``We look at
it as a 20-year project,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the two men were scouring Connecticut,
upstate New York and all of New Jersey for a weekend house that
needed work. One Sunday, they saw an advertisement for an old barn
in the village of Delaware, in the mountains a few miles from the
Delaware Water Gap, an hour and a half drive from TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love with the barn but just missed it. It had been
sold to an artist, who has since become a friend. Months later,
they heard about the hotel, built as a two-story private house in
the Civil War era and enlarged to become a hotel at the turn of the
century, when the railroad was extended to this village and summer
visitors started arriving.
</P>
<P>
   When they first saw the hotel, the porch was caving in. A leak
poured into the entrance foyer. The real estate agent told them on
the telephone that they'd love the guest cottage but that they'd
probably have to tear down the old hotel. But there were six and a
half acres on the house side of the road, three and a half (and a
stream) on the other side. They ended up paying less than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have done a lot of the work themselves, guided
by a philosophy of choosing their battles, or knowing when to let
things alone.
</P>
<P>
   They have fixed up the house in dribs and drabs. For instance,
they bought a wonderful wood-grain pantry cupboard at a house
auction in Hope, N.J., about five miles away, for $150. But they
say they have no idea how much they've spent all together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've restored one or two rooms a year, on average,'' said
Meris, a full-time bereavement counselor at the Lesbian and Gay
Community Services Center in Greenwich Village. ``But it took four
years to do the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years into the process, they still want to put two
bathrooms on the third floor (where there are now none). They also
think it would be fun to use the old sepia photographs the past
owners gave them to restore all the small bedrooms to their
turn-of-the-century charm, when the Delawanna was a summer hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate they're going, they figure it will take 11 years
more.
</P>
<P>
   And then it will be time to start renovating again.

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMATITAN, Mexico _ When Lucinda Hutson started work on a book
celebrating fine tequila, many of her friends were astonished that
she would devote herself to something they considered to be little
more than Mexican moonshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, tequila was not regarded as a good thing.
People called it To-Kill-Ya,'' recalled Hutson, an Austin, Texas,
author whose book ``Tequila! Cooking with the Spirit of Mexico''
was published in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas and throughout much of the United States, tequila was
seen as little more than a raw and powerful libation. The brave
souls who licked salt, slammed back a shot and bit through a lime
wedge expected to get drunk that night _ and be hung over the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that tequila is too strong and harmful, and
that it makes you falling-down drunk. They say it was invented for
thieves and murderers,'' Enrique Martinez Limon facetiously wrote
in his book, ``Tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, tequila is in the midst of a radical image makeover.
Aficionados are sipping it from snifters, slowly savoring its
essence as if it were a cognac or brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started carrying Herradura Suprema at Taco Milagro. It
costs $200 a bottle, and we are selling it for $35 per shot,'' said
Susan Bennett, director of restaurant development at Augusta Foods,
the group that includes Houston eateries Cafe Annie, Cafe Express
and Taco Milagro. ``And it's selling. It's amazing. People don't
even flinch.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing fascination with Mexican food and Latin culture, along
with some crafty marketing by tequila makers, is helping make it
the fastest growing type of alcoholic spirit in the United States.
Tequila is cashing in on the same, sudden elevation in status that
sent nouveau connoisseurs flocking to single-malt scotches and
Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRADITIONAL DRINK &QL; 
FROM HEART OF JALISCO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tequila is rather long in the tooth to suddenly find itself at
the center of a fashionable trend.
</P>
<P>
   People in Mexico have been producing it for at least 380 years,
and the recipe for making tequila is as simple as it is ancient. In
its purest and best form, it is nothing more or less than the
distilled essence of the blue agave plant, which grows abundantly
in the highlands of Jalisco, a state on the Pacific side of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   By Mexican law and international agreement, all tequila comes
from Mexico. About 98 percent of it is made in Jalisco, especially
in the little villages of Tequila, Amatitan and Arandas. On the
winding roads that connect these villages, field after field is
bristling with rows of agave that shimmer with a blue-green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this part of the world, tequila is a drink. It also is a
town, and it is a mountain,'' said Juan Pablo Castro, the Tequila
Herradura representative responsible for U.S. exports. ``Tequila is
an attitude. It is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the Tequilan volcano, workers known as
``jimadores'' harvest agaves by hand, using a razor-sharp tool
called a ``coa.'' In less than two minutes, a skilled ``jimador''
can dig the agave out of the ground and shave off the spiky leaves
until nothing is left but the pineapple-shaped heart, called the
``pina.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pina'' is cooked _ right out of the oven, it tastes like a
sweet potato spiked with a mild tequila _ and shredded so the juice
can be extracted. Each ``pina'' yields about three liters of raw
juice, which is fermented and then distilled. About 70 percent of
the fermented liquid is lost in the distillation process.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive tequilas are aged in oak barrels, a process
that gives it a golden color that gradually deepens with time. The
aging process means another 12 percent to 15 percent of the liquid
is lost to evaporation, a sacrifice that is poetically known among
producers as the ``angel's share.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why there are so many problems in the world _
tequila-drunk angels,'' Houston chef Robert Del Grande quipped
while on a tour of the Tequila Herradura distillery in the heart of
Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
   The angels certainly have had a rapidly increasing supply of
vapor to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. tequila sales have increased 112 percent since 1985,
according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To judge just how fashionable tequila has become, consider that
rocker Sammy Hagar has come up with his own brand, called Cabo
Wabo. He and his band, the Waboritas, flog the drink by making
promotional appearances and singing songs such as ``Mas Tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of tequila has not been lost on the giant
brewing company Anheuser-Busch, which is churning out a new beer
called Tequiza. Made with tequila and lime flavoring, Tequiza is
trying to squeeze a little of tequila's good fortune out for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The most dynamic growth in the tequila category is in the high
end of the market, where the price per bottle hovers in the $30-$50
range. Sales of El Tesoro and Chinaco brands _ two highly regarded
brands generally placed among the first rank of tequilas _ have
increased 50 percent a year for the past three years. Sales of
Tequila Herradura's brands have grown 40 percent to 60 percent
during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 50 percent growth of not much is still not much,''
cautioned Robert Denton, the American importer for the El Tesoro
and Chinaco brands and one of the pioneers in promoting top-shelf
tequila in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Denton figures the entire category of super-premium tequilas _
those made of 100 percent agave _ sell about 100,000 cases a year
in the United States. That works out to be about 1.2 million
bottles, or less than 300,000 gallons. By contrast, total tequila
sales in the United States hit 15.7 million gallons last year.
</P>
<P>
   The big train pulling the bulk of tequila sales is still the
margarita, named by the readers of Gourmet magazine as the most
popular cocktail in the United States. A great deal of the tequila
going into margaritas is far from the best stuff and is rarely made
with 100 percent agave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKING PRODUCT WITH CARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law requires tequila be at least 51 percent blue agave,
but the rest can be lesser ingredients such as cane sugar. Cuervo
Gold, the best-selling tequila in the United States, is not 100
percent agave. The golden color is the result of caramel coloring.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brands that never strayed from making tequila out of
100 percent agave is Tequila Herradura, which has been in
continuous production since 1870. Its owners, the Romo family, have
been in the vanguard of those promoting tequila as being on par
with the best spirits made anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to get away from the idea of licking salt,
throwing back a shot of tequila, biting the lime and then throwing
up later,'' said Mitch Murray, the regional representative for
Sazerac Co., which imports Herradura into the United States. ``We
are trying to uplift the image of tequila. It is something to
savor.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Herradura's methods is its ``Embassy Program.'' The
distiller is selecting 250 restaurants nationwide with which to
form long-term marketing relationships. As part of that
relationship, Herradura takes the restaurateurs on an extensive
tour of the company's operations in Amatitan. They go to great
pains to show details, such as how all of the agaves used by
Herradura are grown on the family's 10,000-acre estate and are
harvested only after they reach full maturity of eight to 10 years.
It shows how the ``pina's'' are slow-cooked in big clay ovens for
24 hours and cooled for 24 more, not zapped in industrial
pressure-cookers that are the distiller's equivalent of a
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move forward the education process, and we want to
do it on a one-on-one basis,'' Murray said, while standing in a
courtyard of the Romo family hacienda that is adjacent to the
company distillery. ``We couldn't convey with billboards what this
family believes.''
</P>
<P>
   The distillery believes restaurant owners are the ones who help
define the culinary standards for a city. It hopes the ``embassy''
restaurant will extol the virtues of fine tequila, especially
Herradura.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word-of-mouth recommendations from the right people will do
more for us than all the billboards in the world,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the distillery tours in Mexico, after all of the
participants were well-stoked on tequila and rich Mexican food,
Murray raised a glass and jokingly announced the terms of their
marketing partnership: ``We are married now. There is no divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BRINGING IT ACROSS THE BORDER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herradura has been available in the United States since the
1960s, when Hollywood stars Bing Crosby and Phil Harris secured the
rights to import it to America. However, until recently, it was
only marginally successful here. Some observers say the first real
shots in the ``revolution'' of promoting pure tequila were fired in
1983, when U.S. businessman Robert Denton started importing
Chinaco, a gourmet brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first to battle for the truth about tequila,''
Denton said from his office in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Denton would pour the tequila for bar owners, trying to convince
them it was the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked it, but they said it wouldn't sell because it was
way too smooth,'' he said. ``We heard a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Denton persisted with Chinaco and El Tesoro, tequilas
that are made by distilleries adhering to the old methods and old
standards. Denton gradually was able to build a core following,
especially among those in the film and music industries on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Denton introduced these renegade tequilas made of 100
percent agave, and that's what started this whole trend,'' Hutson
said. ``El Tesoro is an exquisite example of the lost art of
tequila tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson believes key factors in the growing taste for tequila
include the ``incredible popularity'' of Mexican and Southwestern
food, increased tourism to Mexico, and the distinctiveness of
``tequila's bright and lively flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rydman, president of Spec's Liquor Warehouse in Houston,
sees the trend as the logical extension of current drinking habits.
By and large, people are drinking less, but they are drinking
better. They have explored the rarefied realms of single-malt
scotches and boutique bourbons and are now moving on to tequila as
a new frontier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FINER BRANDS STANDING OUT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the increased recognition and affection surrounding it,
this would seem to be a golden age for tequila producers. However,
the runaway popularity of tequila is threatening some producers
with a day of reckoning. Because it takes eight to 10 years for an
agave to fully mature, production cannot be easily or rapidly
altered to match changing demand. As a result, there is an agave
shortage brewing in Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I sold my agaves for 70 centavos per kilo,'' said
Jose Camarena, who owns four farms near the town of Arandas. ``This
year, I will sell my agave for 5 pesos per kilo.''
</P>
<P>
   With the current exchange rate, last year's price works out to
be about 7 cents per kilo, while this year's price is around 50
cents per kilo.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the wild run-up in prices, Camarena is not sure he
wants to plant more agave. Prices could slump before they reach
maturity sometime in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 70 centavos, we weren't making any money. We barely broke
even,'' said Camarena, who also owns the Arandas chain of taquerias
in Houston. ``The ones who have been making all the money have been
the distilleries.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the agave shortage, some distilleries are pulling their
cheapest stuff out of the marketplace, conserving their agaves to
make tequila with better profit margins. Prices for most tequila
brands haven't jumped at the U.S. retail level, but they might,
especially for tequilas made by businesses that buy bulk agave on
the open market. Those that grow their own agave supplies will feel
less pressure to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   However, even raising prices won't be enough to save some
operators. Several distilleries in Mexico have closed in recent
months because of the agave shortage, and it seems likely more will
be forced to shut their doors in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are only about 50 tequila distilleries in all of
Mexico, some makers are hired to churn out a variety of different
brands. As a result, there are several hundred brands of tequila on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these brands are going to disappear. They have to,''
Denton said. ``What will be left will be the established
distilleries and the established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be just fine with Denton and some others, who aren't
entirely comfortable with some of the faddish aspects of the
tequila revolution. They wouldn't miss some of the goofy bottles,
such as the one shaped like a worm, which is ironic since a worm is
sometimes placed in a bottle of mescal, not tequila. And they
wouldn't miss some of the marketing hype, such as the newcomer
Porfidio brand that has concocted a fictional history tracing its
heritage back to Don Ponciano Porfidio, a man who never existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we'll go back to the basic, traditional core,''
Houston chef Del Grande said. ``There will be a falling out, but I
think there has been an irreversible change of people appreciating
fine tequila. That will not go away.''

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Navy Capt. Henry M. Kleeman became a military
superstar the day he shot down a Libyan fighter during a dispute
over international waters between the United States and Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``This single incident reinstilled pride in being American,''
U.S. Rep. G. William Whitehurst, R-Va., said in a 1985 entry in the
Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Network television wanted interviews with Kleeman, who flew 128
combat missions and won a Bronze Star for valor in Vietnam.
President Reagan later thanked Kleeman's family. The front-page New
York Times story about the dogfight was bronzed and hung in the
National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., sharing space
with stories of the world's most famous aviators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank Kleeman was no ordinary individual. ... Precious few have
done as much,'' Whitehurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman's death in a plane crash four years later went hardly
noticed. But quietly it has made him a new kind of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 3, 1985, Kleeman was landing an F-18 fighter at Miramar
Naval Air Station, Calif., when the right main landing gear failed,
causing the tip of the right wing to hit the ground and send the
aircraft tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy had known about problems with landing gear in the F-18
for at least three years. Kleeman's widow, Carol, left with four
children to raise on her own, sued the company that made the plane,
McDonnell Douglas Corp. Though she lost the case, her legal battle
is required reading for legal scholars and a small, specialized
group of plaintiffs' attorneys because her case helped expand a
legal doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   That doctrine, called the government-contractor defense, created
an exception to one of the most important tenets of American law:
the right to hold someone accountable in a civil court for
negligence causing injury or death. The government-contractor
defense protects private companies _ including large aircraft
manufacturers _ from lawsuits for deaths and injuries caused by
their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was fair,'' said Carol Kleeman, whose
husband was partially blamed for the accident by the Navy. ``I
think it kept people from being aware there were problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the military had for years been protected from lawsuits
for injuries to active-duty military personnel under a separate
legal doctrine, the government-contractor defense narrowed an
already small margin of opportunity to file suit over a military
aviation accident.
</P>
<P>
   Though the threat of lawsuit hangs heavily over civilian
aviation, the military is free to fly its huge fleet of planes and
helicopters with little fear that longstanding mechanical problems
that go unresolved, or defective parts that should never have been
installed, will ever cost them or their contractors a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Military records of Kleeman's crash acknowledge that the primary
cause was the right main landing gear and that ``similar failures
have occurred in this type aircraft over the past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words could have convinced a jury to award millions to a
plaintiff in a civilian aviation case, but Kleeman's case was
dismissed before trial. Years later, attorneys representing
aircraft companies still cite the decision when trying to have
lawsuits thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to correct the problem so other people wouldn't have
to die,'' Carol Kleeman said. ``I don't know what else would get
their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after Kleeman's accident, F-18s continue to have
landing-gear problems.
</P>
<P>
   After a Jan. 26, 1997, incident involving an F-18 from the USS
Kitty Hawk, an investigator wrote, ``Aircraft has a history of
landing gear problems, as do numerous other aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In less than one month during 1998, three F-18s reported
problems with planing links, the same part that failed in the
Kleeman crash. A faulty planing link _ a metal rod attached to the
landing gear that helps the wheel turn and fold inside the aircraft
wheel well _ can cause a misalignment, a critical problem during
high-speed la7ndings in adverse runway conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On July 17, 1996, a pilot received major injuries in an F-18
crash in Florida that caused $30 million in damage. Navy records
show the planing link failed as the jet was landing, but Navy
safety officials said the link failed because the pilot made a bad
landing approach and slammed the landing gear on the carrier deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still concerned about'' planing links, said Rear Adm.
Frank M. ``Skip'' Dirren Jr., commander of the Naval Safety Center
in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has installed a warning light to address the problem,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it fixed the planing link? Probably not,'' the admiral
said. ``But it has mitigated the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Private companies seeking protection
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the U.S. Supreme Court created a doctrine barring
lawsuits against the government for harm caused to active-duty
military personnel. Under the doctrine, military members and their
families are prevented from filing lawsuits against the government
over military aviation accidents that kill and injure military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to sue the services, victims of military aviation
accidents and their families instead sued civilian companies that
made the aircraft, serviced them or had other related contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies began seeking protection, said Miami attorney
Joel Eaton, a former Navy fighter pilot and one of the nation's
foremost experts in the government-contractor defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry first mounted a concerted campaign in Congress,''
wrote Eaton, who once roomed with Capt. Kleeman on an aircraft
carrier. ``When that effort failed, the industry turned its efforts
to the courts, seeking an even greater prize: the abolition of tort
accountability altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense contractors eventually got what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, 1983, Marine Corps Lt. David A. Boyle was the
co-pilot of a CH-53 helicopter that crashed and sank into the
Atlantic off Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, like the three others aboard the helicopter, survived the
crash, but Boyle drowned after impact.
</P>
<P>
   His father sued the Sikorsky Division of United Technologies
Corp., which built the helicopter, alleging the company improperly
repaired a part that caused the crash. The lawsuit also criticized
the design because the co-pilot emergency escape hatch opened out
instead of in, making it difficult to open under water.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded Boyle's father $725,000. But an appeals court
reversed that ruling, and on April 27, 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled 5-4 in favor of Sikorsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes little sense to insulate the government against
financial liability for the judgment ... when the government
produces the equipment itself, but not when it contracts for the
production,'' the court's majority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ruling, a case can be dismissed if a court finds that
a contractor built an airplane or other product that conformed to
reasonably precise specifications approved by the government, and
the contractor warned the government about any dangers in using the
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had respondent designed such a death trap for a commercial
firm, Lt. Boyle's family could sue under Virginia tort law and be
compensated for his tragic and unnecessary death,'' Justice William
J. Brennan Jr. wrote in his dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The rubber stamp of the government
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics of the government-contractor defense agree
that, in theory, private contractors should not have to suffer when
they're only building what the government requests. In practice,
however, the contractors often know more about what is being built
than the government officials who are supposed to be writing the
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The government's approval, Brennan wrote in his dissenting
opinion, can be ``perhaps no more than a rubber stamp from a
federal procurement officer who might or might not have noticed or
cared about the defects or even had the expertise to discover
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kleeman case, David L. Bourisaw, former section chief for
design of the F-18 landing gear, testified that if the government
doesn't object to contract specifications, the contractor
understands that to be approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you telling me approval by acquiescence?'' Bourisaw was
asked by a lawyer for Carol Kleeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Bourisaw responded.
</P>
<P>
   Though difficult to document and prove, rubber-stamping has been
established in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1989, an S-3 Viking submarine-hunting aircraft
crashed shortly after the plane was catapulted from the USS John F.
Kennedy. The pilot, Lt. Douglas G. Gray, tried desperately to
recover from a right roll, but the plane wouldn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God! Eject! Eject! Eject!'' Gray screamed, just before
the plane crashed into the water. Gray and two others were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Gray and two others killed in the crash sued the
aircraft manufacturer, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show the crash likely was caused by a servo, a
device about the size of a small car engine that controls the
aileron, the movable part of the wing that helps control the
direction of the aircraft. For years prior to the crash, the plane
had problems with its flight control system, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed used a subcontractor to do the work on the servo.
</P>
<P>
   William Burriss, a civilian Navy engineer assigned to the S-3
procurement program and a defense witness for Lockheed during the
civil trial, testified that the prime contractor usually exerts a
large amount of control over subcontractors' work ``with little
involvement by the Navy,'' court records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development of the servo followed this pattern,'' the
appeals court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the relatives of the dead crew member, the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta found that approval of contract
specifications requires more than ``tacit approval'' or a ``rubber
stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy contract to build the S-3 Viking submarine-hunting
airplane included more than 600 pages of specifications, but the
court found that Lockheed ``presented no evidence that the Navy
approved reasonably precise (contract) specifications for the
servo.''
</P>
<P>
   `They got away with murder'
</P>
<P>
   Immunity from lawsuits is not a new idea. Local governments have
for years protected themselves from certain types of lawsuits by
private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court decision involving the lawsuit over Lt.
Boyle's death did something nearly unheard of in the American legal
system: It prevented private citizens from suing private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractor may invoke the defense in suits brought not
only by military personnel like Lt. Boyle, or government employees,
but by anyone ... including, for example, the children who might
have died had respondent's helicopter crashed on the beach,''
Justice Brennan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   These cases present another irony in the government-contractor
defense: When civilians are killed and injured, the federal
government can be forced to pay millions while private companies
can be protected by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Emory's wife, a civilian, was killed in 1992 when an F-18
Hornet crashed into her pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Emory collected $800,000 from the federal government, but his
lawsuit against McDonnell Douglas was thrown out of court before
trial because of the contractor defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got away with murder,'' said Emory, fighting back tears
during an interview at his home in Maryland. ``They should be
liable for what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory met his wife, Rose, in 1985. She was 21. He spotted her at
the Town Creek Marina near his home, followed her to the bathroom
and waited until she came out. She called him the next day, and
they were together until the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love at first sight,'' Emory said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1992, three days before Rose Emory's 28th birthday,
she was driving a pickup truck at the Patuxent River Naval Air
Station, Md., where she worked for a civilian company testing the
water quality on the base. She had just tested water near an
ammunition dump when the jet, weighing nearly as much as five
African elephants, fell directly on the cab of the pickup she was
driving, turning the truck and the plane into burned rubble. The
pilot and co-pilot ejected and survived.
</P>
<P>
   The F-18 had arrived at Patuxent River only two months earlier.
Before that, it was at Cecil Field, Fla., where it sat for nearly a
year without being flown. At Cecil Field, the plane was known as a
``hangar queen,'' a term the military gives to a plane used only as
a source of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always concern when an airplane doesn't fly for a long
period of time,'' the maintenance officer in charge of the F-18
said in a deposition. ``We use it for cannibalization. That is a
harsh term but a fact of life. And the reason we do that is because
we are short spares.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Warrant Officer Thomas H. Turner testified that he oversaw
maintenance for all F-18s at the base, but he had no formal
training for repairing several of the aircraft's critical parts,
including the flight control system (FCS) suspected of causing the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever take any courses on the FCS display?'' an
attorney for McDonnell Douglas asked Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he responded.
</P>
<P>
   When attorneys for McDonnell Douglas interviewed Emory, they
asked him if his wife had spent money on movies. Whether she
cleaned the house. Where she had her motorcycle repaired. How often
she did the laundry. What kind of garden she had.
</P>
<P>
   Emory lost his patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think this piece of paper is my wife, but it ain't,''
Emory told the attorney. ``And you ain't going to bring her back. I
know that. The only thing I ever see is paper, man. I would rather
see her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the attorney asked Emory, a Vietnam veteran, how much he
suffered because of his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a hole and put it right in your chest, just put a
big hole in your chest and have nothing left but a little skin on
each side, you find out what it's done to me,'' he said. ``It is
like cutting a man's heart out and he is still breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is about what it has done to me. It's ruined me, man. You
know. I mean .... there ain't no words that explain how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory's case helped established another irony of the
government-contractor defense: prior knowledge of a problem _ an
aggravating factor in most civil cases _ by the military can be
used as a defense, supporting claims by contractors that they
weren't withholding warnings. The case also helped expand the
contractor defense to civilian companies holding contracts for
aircraft maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is there a double standard?'' Emory asked. ``If I make a
mistake, I'll go before a judge. Why can't I hide behind the
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits can be deterrents
</P>
<P>
   Civilian aviation accidents, especially major crashes,
frequently result in lawsuits. Many bring multimillion-dollar
settlements or awards, which in some states can be doubled or
tripled in accidents linked to negligence or longstanding,
unresolved mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although not the primary motivating factor, the prospect of
paying tens of millions of dollars in legal settlements plays some
role in promoting civilian aviation safety, experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to these days, or you're not going to last very long in
the marketplace,'' said San Antonio attorney Ron Sprague, who
defends major airlines and aircraft manufacturers in lawsuits over
aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have plaintiffs' lawyers running all over the country:
self-appointed safety officers saying this product is designed
badly or that product is designed badly. For better or for worse,
their input gets heard by the manufacturer. If they're right, quite
often a product is changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's impossible to know exactly what effect the threat of
lawsuits has on civilian aviation safety, there is little doubt it
plays some role in the design, maintenance and operation of
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Cecile S. Hatfield, president of the Lawyer Pilot Bar
Association, recalled a case in which she learned the civilian
Federal Aviation Administration had found 22 accidents linked to a
problem with fuel tanks in one type of Cessna plane. Following a
number of lawsuits, the manufacturer fixed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these lawsuits did make the manufacturer do something
about it,'' she said. ``Before that it was not cost-effective to do
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the accidents started happening and they started getting
sued for millions of dollars, they felt they had to do something
about it.''

<P>
   That doctrine, called the government-contractor defense, created
an exception to one of the most important tenets of American law:
the right to hold someone accountable in a civil court for
negligence causing injury or death. The defense, created in the
1980s, protects private companies _ including large aircraft
manufacturers _ from lawsuits for deaths and injuries caused by
their products.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how much the threat of lawsuit promotes safety in
civilian aviation, but experts say it plays some role.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have plaintiffs' lawyers running all over the country:
self-appointed safety officers saying this product is designed
badly or that product is designed badly,'' said San Antonio
attorney Ron Sprague, who defends major airlines and aircraft
manufacturers in lawsuits over aviation accidents. ``For better or
for worse, their input gets heard by the manufacturer. If they're
right, quite often a product is changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contractor defense closed a giant window of
liability for the aerospace companies that manufacture military
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies began facing more lawsuits after a U.S.
Supreme Court doctrine in 1950 barred lawsuits against the
government for harm caused to active-duty military personnel.
Unable to sue the services, victims of military aviation accidents
and their families instead sued civilian companies that made the
aircraft, serviced them or had other related contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The companies began seeking protection, arguing that they
shouldn't be held responsible for products built to government
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kleeman case, Navy records show the service partially
blamed Kleeman for the crash but acknowledged that the primary
cause was the right main landing gear. ``Similar failures have
occurred in this type aircraft over the past several years,'' the
records say.
</P>
<P>
   Those words could have convinced a jury to award millions to a
plaintiff in a civilian aviation case, but Kleeman's case was
dismissed before trial. Years later, attorneys representing
aircraft companies still cite the decision when trying to have
lawsuits thrown out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The case that ultimately established the defense came in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Corps Lt. David A. Boyle died April 27, 1983, after he
drowned when his CH-53 helicopter crashed and sank into the ocean
off the coast of Virginia. His father sued the Sikorsky Division of
United Technologies Corp., which built the helicopter, alleging the
company improperly repaired a part that caused the crash. The
lawsuit also blamed the helicopter's design because the co-pilot
emergency escape hatch opened out instead of in, making it
difficult to open under water.
</P>
<P>
   A jury awarded Boyle's father $725,000. An appeals court
reversed that ruling, and on April 27, 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled 5-4 in favor of Sikorsky.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the Boyle case did something nearly unheard of
in the American legal system: It prevented private citizens from
suing private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractor may invoke the defense in suits brought not
only by military personnel like Lt. Boyle, or government employees,
but by anyone ... including, for example, the children who might
have died had respondent's helicopter crashed on the beach,''
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had respondent designed such a death trap for a commercial
firm, Lt. Boyle's family could sue under Virginia tort law and be
compensated for his tragic and unnecessary death.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan also argued that many government contracts are no more
than rubber stamps because the manufacturer has a heavy hand in
writing the specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The government contractor defense created another irony: When
civilians are killed and injured, the federal government can be
forced to pay while private companies can be protected by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Emory's wife, Rose, a civilian, was killed in 1992 when
an F-18 Hornet crashed into her pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Emory collected $800,000 from the federal government, but his
lawsuit against McDonnell Douglas was thrown out of court before
trial because of the contractor defense.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1992, three days before Rose Emory's 28th birthday,
she was driving a pickup truck at the Patuxent River Naval Air
Station, Md., where she worked for a civilian company testing the
water quality on the base. She had just tested water near an
ammunition dump when the jet, weighing nearly as much as five
African elephants, fell directly on the cab of the pickup she was
driving, turning the truck and the plane into burned rubble. The
pilot and co-pilot ejected and survived.
</P>
<P>
   The F-18 had arrived at Patuxent River only two months earlier.
Before that, it was at Cecil Field, Fla., where it sat for nearly a
year without being flown and was known as a ``hangar queen,'' a
term the military gives to a plane used only as a source of spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Emory collected damages from the government because his wife was
a civilian. Had she been in the military, he likely would have
received no compensation for his loss. But he was unable to collect
damages from McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got away with murder,'' he said from his home in
Maryland. ``They should be liable for what they've done.''

 &HT;    Carey's `Rainbow' a span of styles
 &HT;    By Mariah Carey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Understandably, the half-nakedness in the videos, the
hair-tossing at awards shows and screeching on the records can be a
bit much.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to give Mariah Carey credit: Underneath it all,
there is actually something underneath _ well-crafted pop.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmering example no. 1: ``Heartbreaker,'' the single that
helped the biggest selling female artist of the '90s break the
Beatles' record for No. 1 singles.
</P>
<P>
   Though decidedly calorie-heavy, ``Heartbreaker'' is fun that
gets pleasantly grittier on the remix with rappers Da Brat and
Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott. In fact, hip-hop grit obviously
becomes Carey, as ``Crybaby'' - with rap's amiable snarler, Snoop
Dogg _ is also among the best here.
</P>
<P>
   But the standout is ``Bliss,'' a slinky ballad with chirping
birds and convincing vocals reminiscent of R&AMP;B singer Minnie
Ripperton's classic 1979 single ``Loving You.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it just wouldn't be a Mariah Carey record without a few
big over-orchestrated opportunities for her to stamp her
considerable technical abilities all over your ears, like ``Thank
God I Found You'' (with R&AMP;B singer Joe and pop act 98 Degrees) and
``Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme).'' But surprisingly, those
kinds of songs are not in abundance on ``Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   So even if you still can't get past the hair-tossing and
occasional screeching, the crystal in your house should be pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rainbow''
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Carey. Columbia. 14 tracks.

   &QR;  COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ``LeAnn Rimes''
</P>
<P>
   LeAnn Rimes. Curb. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Since breaking through with the throwback yodel hit ``Blue,''
teen queen Rimes has become one of the hottest properties in
country music, an All-American hitmaker who has achieved
international status. So, why can't she seem to realize she's not
on the set of ``Star Search'' anymore? Her new CD is an uninspired
collection of cover tunes that sounds as plodding as the talent
portion of a beauty pageant. Rimes deserves credit for mining
classic country rather than turning to pop, but the tunes she has
chosen sound as predictable as Chrismas carols _ ``Your Cheatin'
Heart,'' ``Faded Love,'' ``Me and Bobby McGee,'' ``Cryin' Time''
and two Patsy Cline classics, ``Crazy'' and ``I Fall to Pieces.''
The arrangements are bland, and Rimes takes no risks. It's a shame,
because the Texas singer has a voice that could knock over bowling
pins. Perhaps the problem is that she is so used to being a
one-trick pony _ ``tiny girl with big big voice'' _ that she is
failing to mature her style beyond a belt-out-the-national-anthem
approach. One exception is the sassy single, ``Big Deal,'' the only
new tune on the album and the only track that lets her pump
attitude and tease into the notes. One just wishes that her
producer/father, Wilbur Rimes, would have let some of that passion
spill over into more new material. One clue that Rimes has it in
her: On the album artwork, she's sporting an ankle tattoo.
Unfortunately, this CD makes her sound like she should be wearing a
recital dress.

   ``Only God Can Judge Me''
</P>
<P>
   Master P. No Limit Records. 23 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly retired rapper Master P returns to the ring with an
album that swings wildly from the inspirational to the silly,
stumbles a lot, but never falls flat. His team-up with rapper Nas
on the admirable ``Where Do We Go From Here'' and the hook-driven
``Step to Dis'' and ``Say Brah'' throw strong rights. What's left
are his usual grunted proclamations of how much money the Forbes
cover subject has made (``Ice on My Wrist''), followed by reminders
that even with the New Orleans entrepreneur's mainstream success,
``Ain't Nothing Changed'' _ he's still streetwise. And like many a
punch-drunk boxer, P clearly didn't know when to stop this 23-track
album, offering too many forgettable two-minute songs.

   ``The Luxury of Time''

   David Mead. RCA .13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   While Capitol works up a sweat trumpeting boy band escapee
Robbie Williams as the savior of old-school pop, along comes this
out-of-nowhere New York artist to make a run for the title.
Brimming with smart arrangements, sophisticated singing and
well-crafted melodies, Mead's debut album makes ``The Ego Has
Landed,'' Williams' synthetically anthemic first effort, sound
positively amateurish. Imagine a summit meeting between Hall &AMP;
Oates and Oasis, arbitrated by Semisonic, and you begin to get a
picture of ``Luxury's'' hooky appeal. ``Robert Bradley's Postcard''
kicks off the disc with a grand flourish _ a pop chamber orchestra
of piano, organ and acoustic and electric guitars builds to a sweet
crescendo as Mead references Allen Ginsberg, Marlon Brando and Joni
Mitchell with blithe elan. The album wanders a bit in the middle,
but comes soaring back with the lovely ``Everybody Knows It But
You,'' which has all the makings of a slow-dance classic.

   &QR;  ``The Blair Witch Project'' (R) _ It's a first-person journey
into the kind of terror that comes from trying to glimpse something
moving in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three students head
into the woods to document an 18th-century witch tale, then
disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest effects:
odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, or an unexpected pile
of stones, or strange noises in the night. Like the 1963 version of
``The Haunting,'' its power comes from psychological intensity.
Priced to buy: DVD $29.98, VHS $22.98, including footage not
included in the theatrical release. Grade: A
</P>

<P>
   &QR;  ``Never Been Kissed'' (PG-13) _ Drew Barrymore is Josie
Geller, a mid-20s newspaper copy editor and former high school
dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they called her) who goes back to
teenville as an undercover reporter, promptly relives high school
hell and pretty much bumbles her way to popularity. Everything
about her career is implausible. The movie's jokes are lame, its
situations loopy. But Barrymore does make a go of it. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Hideous Kinky'' (R) _ Kate Winslet follows up her
``Titanic'' splash with this small-scaled independent film about a
single mother who takes her two young daughters to Morocco in 1972
in search of spiritual enlightenment. Set in the waning days of
flower power, the movie is a portrait of a generation whose
idealism had its poisonous side. Winslet gives a wondrously brave
performance as a loving but blinkered mommie-weirdest whose
feckless romantiscm makes her a benign menace to her children.
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' (R) _ This romantic fantasy starts
out with flat-footed awkwardness but gradually grows deeper,
nimbler. Its ideas about love and destiny gleam with promise, even
if the movie never quite finds the structure to show them off
properly. It's a near-miss. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Stop Making Sense'' (unrated) _ This ain't no party, this
ain't no disco, it's just a milestone concert film. Fifteen years
after it first appeared, director Jonathan Demme's wonderful ``Stop
Making Sense'' hasn't lost a bit of its energy and elegance. Though
the Talking Heads have acrimoniously parted ways, the movie
preserves the band members in their prime, young and percolating
with cross-cultural rhythms and their early-1980s blend of joy and
alienation. Priced to buy: VHS, $19.95, DVD $29.95. The DVD has
bonus tracks, audio commentary from all four band members and
Demme, and storyboard-to-film comparisons. Grade: A-

 &HT;    Suspense resides on `Arlington Road'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   The squeaky-clean suburbs of Washington darken into something
strange in this paranoia thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bridges plays a professor of domestic terrorism who starts
to suspect things about his new neighbors, the Langs (Tim Robbins
and Joan Cusack). They seem like an impossibly wholesome bunch,
almost a throwback to the '50s ideal of lemonade stands and tag
football in the back yard. They're so perfect there's something off
about them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bridges becomes convinced that the Langs are up to some
deadly secret business. Is he onto something? Or is he having a
meltdown, letting his personal and professional lives intertwine?
The movie keeps us guessing, though it can't totally sustain its
suspense. In its second half, it becomes too moody and baroque for
its own good, relying on monster-movie shots of Robbins and Cusack
to reflect Bridges' anxiety. But the script manages to stay a few
steps ahead of us, luring us toward a slam-bang, unexpected climax.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
possesses a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation of Alfred
Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' hot-wired to
a national nervous system that's already jolted by heavily armed
teenage commandos and high school spree shooters.

   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, now
housing a military school and the wrestling club, he discussed his
dream: To attend Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that better relations between Iran and the United
States will someday allow his dream to come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamani. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two weeks, U.S. diplomats watched from their
office windows at the American Embassy in Tehran as hundreds of
militant Iranian college students gathered each day on
Takht-e-Jamshid Avenue to chant ``Margh Bar Amerika'' _''Death to
America.'' But on that drizzly Sunday morning, the crowd seemed to
be in a particularly ugly mood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 10:30 on Nov. 4, 1979, their worst fears were realized:
With bolt-cutting shears, a vanguard snipped the chains that
clasped the iron gates while others stormed over the 10-foot
concrete wall. Soon, students were swarming through the 27-acre
manicured grounds. Flak-jacketed Marines sought to hold back the
rampaging mob with tear gas grenades, but they were soon routed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the diplomats and their security detail were bound
with tape and blindfolded. As TV images of the takeover circled the
globe, the United States began a prolonged ordeal, whose impact is
still being felt today.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, those events permanently eroded the presumed
sanctity of diplomatic immunity. But, more broadly, during the 444
days that the hostages were held captive, America's self-image, as
well as the nation's prestige abroad, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the public, Iran became a metaphor for everything,'' said
Gerald Rafshoon, then-President Jimmy Carter's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance changed to obsession, as Americans found themselves
checking their atlases and tracking the story so closely that the
names and views of the most obscure Iranian mullahs became
household names.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his poll numbers initially surged, Carter made what
turned out to be a fatal error: stating at the outset that his
primary concern was bringing the hostages home alive. By placing
the value of the hostages' lives above all else, Carter himself
became a kind of hostage to an angry public, a setting that would
haunt him throughout his re-election bid and eventually drive him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by a ravenous press corps, the hostage mania proved in time
to be more harmful to long-term U.S. interests than shocking events
in far-off Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For a subsequent generation of Americans, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the emergence of the United States as the world's
unchallenged pre-eminent power has removed much, if not all, of the
lingering sting. But in many European and Asian capitals, it is
still widely believed that U.S. foreign policy remains crippled,
especially in the Middle East, by the hostage trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded political analyst Daniel Pipes: ``The United States
paid in many ways for the emotionalism of its leaders. Officials
devoted so much time to this issue that their attention to matters
of greater significance was much reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Soviet troops occupied neighboring
Afghanistan, the president remained so consumed by the hostage
crisis that he was unable to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Carter resisted pressure to bomb Tehran, unlike
President Clinton who earlier this year approved the American-led
bombardment of Belgrade. One major difference: Carter lacked the
``smart bombs'' that NATO allies could deploy to cherry-pick
targets in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis over Kosovo erupted, former presidential adviser
David Gergen noted: ``The temptation again is to make it an
obsession. And you can't allow that to happen, because it will
suddenly begin to drive your policy in ways that are very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 in the morning in Washington when word of the
hostage taking first reached Hamilton Jordan, the president's chief
of staff. Jordan's immediate fear was that it would trigger a war
with revolutionary Iran, incensed because Carter had granted
sanctuary in New York to the ailing deposed Shah.
</P>
<P>
   War didn't come. But neither did a settlement _ at least not
until Jan. 20, 1981, the day Carter left Washington. Ronald Reagan
had been president for 20 minutes when the remaining 52 hostages
flew off to a U.S. military hospital in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hostage crisis of 1979 gave rise to that
peculiar agony, increasingly familiar to Americans in subsequent
decades, which arises after a major terrorist strike. It is an
agony born of great power, coupled with the knowledge of how little
at times it can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials empathized with the victims, heightening the sense
of crisis. Passengers of a downed Korean 747 receive more attention
than tens of thousands of Afghan peasants because Americans can
picture themselves sitting in a Boeing jet; similarly, fellow
bureaucrats can see themselves in an embassy surrounded by an
agitated mob.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were matters helped by a fierce policy dispute between
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's activist national security adviser,
and the late Cyrus Vance, who as secretary of state, argued that
diplomacy could resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Douglas Brinkley has written: ``For nearly a year
the crisis handcuffed the administration, which tried everything it
could think of to end the standoff: suspending oil imports,
freezing Iranian assets, expelling Iranian diplomats, imposing
economic sanctions, even conducting clandestine negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a former naval officer, hoped to repeat the
success of an Israeli commando raid that had freed 103 airline
passengers at Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. But the U.S. operation
proved a humiliating failure.
</P>
<P>
   As Brinkley noted: ``After the aborted rescue attempt, many
believed that Carter had not only tarnished the nation's honor but
lost control of his own administration in the process. Critics
condemned him for failing to mount a rescue operation sooner, for
not putting enough military hardware into it once he did act, and
then for retreating at the first sign of hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski had counseled Carter to bomb Tehran if the rescue
mission caused the deaths of would-be rescuers, hostages and
captors. Although no such attack took place, Vance quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Many years after the fact, Carter told reporters that he still
believed he could have been re-elected if he had bombed Tehran
until the hostages were released or incinerated along with the
entire Iranian government. But that kind of ground-zero solution
was morally repugnant to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of grumbles about my handling of the hostage
crisis,'' he said in looking back, ``but not a single responsible
politician offered a more realistic alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   An echo of such internal quarrels could be heard in Clinton's
1998 decision to launch a cruise missile attack against a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in a bid to punish Osama bin Laden,
the Islamic militant blamed for blowing up two American embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Brzezinski is hardly alone in believing that the Iran
hostage crisis crushed Carter's prestige. ``I think it was
devastating,'' he said. ``The Iran hostage crisis was one of the
two central reasons for Carter's defeat in 1980, the other reason
being domestic inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brzezinski contends that the events in Iran heightened
the nation's sense of vulnerability, particularly in the Middle
East. ``Once the Iranian pillar had collapsed, we were faced with
the possibility that one way or another, before too long, we may
have either a hostile Iran on the northern shore of the Persian
Gulf facing us, or we might even have the Soviets there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lasting legacy of the crisis is ABC's ``Nightline,'' the
media grand-daddy of today's saturation coverage, on cable networks
and the Internet, that arises whenever news blow-outs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Neither medium existed when Roone Arledge, the innovator of ABC
News, created ``America Held Hostage'' to track the crisis in
depth.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Reynolds left in December to cover the presidential
campaign, his role was taken up by Ted Koppel, the network's
diplomatic correspondent. In time, Koppel began anchoring
permanently, with the renamed ``Nightline'' premiering on March 24,
1980. It remains a stable of light-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some grudges that Americans seem to nurse longer
than others,'' Koppel said. ``Lord knows this program no doubt
contributed to that mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days before it was known as 'Nightline,' when it
was still called 'America Held Hostage,' we tagged a number on the
back, indicating just how many days it had been since the Ayatollah
Khomeini's followers first seized the embassy in Tehran . . . Many
people probably still remember it as the program that highlighted
the indignity and humanized a situation far removed from most of
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back on the program's first decade, Koppel once
reflected: ``What will never change is that hostages are by
definition a tremendous emotional and explosive domestic issue.
Ideally _ and this sounds very callous _ a president ought to be
able to say, 'We aren't going to deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter did not.
</P>
<P>

Washington Bureau, covered the Carter White House and Iranian
hostage crisis.)

   TEHRAN, Iran _ When student revolutionaries stormed the U.S.
Embassy here 20 years ago this week, Hossein Sarbazi was only 1
year old.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is a product of their revolution _ with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   He serves in the Revolutionary Guard forces established by the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. He won a national championship in
wrestling _ Iran's number one sport.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for a bus last week in front of the old embassy, now
housing a military school and the wrestling club, he discussed his
dream: To attend Georgetown University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that better relations between Iran and the United
States will someday allow his dream to come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they put an embassy here again,'' he said, showing a smile
beneath his Georgetown Hoyas ball cap, ``I assure you many young
people will come apply for visas.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the wooded embassy compound is still an emblem of two
countries that have not found common ground.
</P>
<P>
   The echoes of the embassy takeover, which turned into 14-month
hostage crisis, carry emotions and misconceptions that still
reverberate between the two nations. These days, as Iranians openly
and sometimes heatedly reassess the revolution, relations with the
United States are front-page news on an almost daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   The stubbornness of the impasse can be put in perspective this
way: During the last 20 years, the United States has opened an
embassy in Vietnam and Iran has traded official visits with its
former enemy in war, Iraq. But, Iran and the United States still
treat each other as foes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite U.S. oil companies' desire to start pumping in Iran
again, America maintains economic sanctions against Iran. And while
Iranians yearn for business with the world's biggest economy, Iran
continues to stoke anti-American sentiments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy takeover shocked America. It became a deciding
factor in an election _ Ronald Reagan's defeat of then-President
Jimmy Carter. It showed that fundamentalist religion, Islam, had
re-emerged in world politics. Americans also realized that their
Cold War support of dictators carried a high price.
</P>
<P>
   But for Iranians, it was so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Islamic revolution's Boston Tea Party and Battle of
Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah Khomeini called it ``the Second Revolution.'' The
hostage takers became heroes. Their actions the text of college
curricula.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago. These days, Iran is brimming with debate
about its future. Iranians seek to fit into the world community
without sacrificing its revolutionary identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate pits the young, like Sarbazi, against the old, like
Mehdi Naeini, a 48-year-old owner of a crafts store across the
street from the old embassy. And America is at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the Americans who are making things tense,'' Naeini
said, ticking off a list offenses, most recently comments by U.S.
officials accusing Iran of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Iranians, he blames the United States for the Iraqi
attack that lead to an eight-year war in the 1980s, killing
hundreds of thousands of Iranians. Murals of the martyrs are on
buildings throughout the country. In fact, the United States did
provide intelligence to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Naeini points to the embassy compound wall and notes that the
anti-American murals there were recently repainted.
</P>
<P>
   One reads, ``On that day (sic) U.S. would praise us we will
mourn.'' Another states, ``We will make America face a severe
defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, between the hope of youth and the defiance of the
old guard, are many of the former hostage takers. Many are student
extremists-turned-moderates, who say relations with the United
States are desirable, as long as America treats Iran as an equal.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, was a leader of the students who
stormed the embassy and is now a 44-year-old Tehran city council
member who has been physically attacked for his moderate views.
</P>
<P>
   He does not regret the embassy takeover, but has invited former
hostages to return as guests to his country. America and Iran, he
said, do not have to sacrifice their identities to renew relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary to forget the past to build a future,'' he
said. ``We have to accept realities and the future should be built
on facts.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To him, there was no alternative to the events of Nov. 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before, Carter visited Mohammad Reza Pahlavi _
the detested but U.S.-backed Shah of Iran _ and declared Iran ``an
island of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later there was an upsurge of riots against the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, street-fighting and murderous reprisals from the
Shah's troops resulted in the return from exile of respected cleric
Khomeini. The Shah fled in February. When Carter allowed him into
the United States for medical treatment, students took to the
streets again.
</P>
<P>
   They marched to the embassy, cut through the gate and
overwhelmed the small security contingent. They expected a siege of
just a few days. Surely, they mistakenly thought, the U.S. would
relinquish the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. officials reacted instead with economic sanctions and
the takeover turned into a stand-off that captured the Iranian
imagination. It provided an opportunity for Khomeini's
fundamentalists _ overshadowing revolutionaries seeking a secular
government _ to energize and unify their supporters around
opposition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 52 American hostages were held for 444 days and
released the day Reagan took office. By then, it was branded into
the identity of the new Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of the sacred tenets of the revolution,'' said
Iranian political scientist Hadi Semati. ``It is still seen as
current and is very hard to analyze objectively.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Iranians are doing a lot of analyzing these days.
</P>
<P>
   They have gone through the war with Iraq, experienced 20 years
of sacrifice and strict Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Though still widely revered, the charismatic Khomeini has been
dead for 10 years. More than half the country's 63 million people
were born after the revolution. They never knew the Shah or his
American patrons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians shocked the world again. They voted 70 percent
to 30 percent to make underdog Ayatollah Mohammad Khatami
president. He promised economic progress and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But, the country's most powerful person remains Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamani. He controls the army and courts.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes-violent tug-of-war is underway and at times it seems
Iran has two governments. Reformers have opened hundreds of
newspapers and slightly loosened strict Muslim codes. Conservatives
have closed papers and even killed a few critics of religious rule.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Iranians live firmly in the modern age. Many have
Internet access. They watch satellite dish broadcasts, though
dishes are technically illegal. The oil-driven economy has been
growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
   But, the population and unemployment are growing faster still
and people yearn for a prosperity many believe can only come with
the end of the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There have been tentative steps by both sides. Last year,
Khatami called for more cultural exchange and a ``dialogue of
civilizations.'' That was probably as far as he could go without
inflaming the powerful clerics.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton has praised Khatami and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has acknowledged that Iran has
``grievances'' against the U.S. support of the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have long lists of demands. American officials call
on Iran to end its support of terrorist groups, drop its opposition
to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stop developing weapons
of mass destruction and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Iranians say that the U.S. Congress has sent
money to the Iranian opposition, a group responsible for
assassinations of Iranian officials. They argue that they are not
developing weapons of mass destruction and that U.S. officials do
not object to Israel's nuclear arsenal or Egypt's chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians call for the United States to drop economic sanctions
and stop trying to discourage other countries from dealing with
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   They also call on the United States to release billions of
dollars in Iranian assets and drop opposition to a proposed oil
pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But, relations are still marked by missed or poorly sent
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem in American policy is the fact that
they don't realize how their policies are perceived here,''
political scientist Semati said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts expect progress to be slow. Iran has
parliamentary elections in February and the U.S. elections follow
in November. Candidates in neither country want to be seen as soft
on their nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also note, however, that America could use a friend
next to troubled Pakistan, anarchic Afghanistan and rebellious
former Soviet satellites. By comparison, Iran is peaceful and
appears to be moving toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Revolutionary Guard Sarbazi said he got hooked on the
Georgetown Hoyas while watching the school's basketball team on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 60 to 70 percent of Iranians want to have relations
with America,'' he said. ``I am for relations of all kinds _
political, economic.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he fears his position could get him in trouble, he
gives an answer that bodes well for democracy as well as relations
with America: ``I don't care. I believe what I want to.''

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ As a revolutionary 20 years ago, Iranian Mohammad
Ebrahim Asgharzadeh considered it an obligation to take over the
U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a popular Tehran city councilman, he is in the forefront of
Iran's reformers. He says it may be time _ given the right terms _
for the two countries to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were forced to take over the embassy,'' Asgharzadeh said
recently from his wood-paneled office in Tehran city hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction. The Shah going to the U.S. was not
acceptable to us,'' Asgharzadeh said. ``We had to make claims
against what he had done.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asgharzadeh looks more yuppie than rebel. He's a
trim 44 year-old with salt and pepper gray hair. In his
wood-paneled city hall office last week, he wore a wool sport
jacket, slacks and argyle socks.
</P>
<P>
   He has three children and had to give up his executive post at a
steel company to take office.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh does not speak for all the hostage takers. Numbering
about 300, they represent the spectrum of opinions in Iran's
current political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still ardent defenders of Iran's strict religious rule
and defiance of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is one of several former embassy stormers
supporting Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to open up
the country's economy and strengthen its democracy. Those are just
the moves western leaders look for.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition has come from just the types of religious hardliners
who the embassy takeover helped strengthen amid anti-American
fervor. The hardliners, seeking to maintain strict religious
control over government, appear to fear that reformers like
Asgharzadeh could dilute their power.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, shortly after Asgharzadeh used the 19th
anniversary of the takeover to invite former hostages back to
visit, he was badly beaten by a gang. The attackers may have been
trying to keep him from running for the city council.
</P>
<P>
   But, Asgharzadeh is not the only former hostage-taker to speak
out. Abbas Abdi, met publicly with former hostage Barry Rosen last
year in Paris. According to Rosen, Abdi apologized for the personal
pain he caused Rosen and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Abdi were idealists. They were young and they
believed in the Islamic revolution. They believed it was the birth
of a new freedom for them,'' Rosen said. ``Over the years, they
came to realize it was the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh denies that he has changed or mellowed, saying he
has just acted realistically with the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, he was active in the revolution that overthrew the
dictatorial Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Shah.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jimmy Carter agreed to let the Shah enter the
United States for medical treatment, Asgharzadeh was among a small
group of leaders who organized the embassy takeover. He became the
group's spokesman but says now that he had no idea the hostage
crisis would last for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not possibly predict what would be the main result
and the reaction,'' he said. ``We just wanted to do something, some
kind of a student movement. It was very unprofessional and
amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagined that the U.S. would return the Shah to us and that
would finish the crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Shah should have faced the same fate as former
Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, who may face a trial for
massive human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh describes a spiral of miscalculations on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said the students were quickly disappointed that students in
the United States did not seem sympathetic to their cause. In the
wake of the embassy takeover, he said, the public in Iran and the
United States unified around their country's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the Carter administration escalated the
tensions and prolonged the crisis with economic sanctions and a
failed rescue attempt in the desert. Many in Iran think the landing
in the desert was an attempt to topple Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and reinstate the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Asgharzadeh continues to be a stern critic of U.S. policy today,
saying America still seems arrogant in its dealing with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. believes that it is the winner of the Cold War, and
if this image will be the basis of its foreign policy with Europe,
the Pacific Rim countries, countries like Iran, they will have
problems,'' he said. ``It disgraces a nation to be put down and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the intense animosities of the embassy crisis have
waned and public opinion has become more varied in both Iran and
the United States. That, he said, provides an opportunity for
Khatami to attempt to appeal to the American public and Clinton to
approach the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion and emotions among our peoples would be derived
from the behavior and decision-making of our officials,'' he said.
``A relationship should be based on mutual respect and recognition
of each country's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Asgharzadeh concludes, that America is a world
power that Iran cannot ignore and Islamic Iran has emerged as a
power that America cannot ignore _ regardless of their history of
enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to forget about the past to be able to
build a future,'' he said. ``We have to accept what has happened in
reality and the future should be built on facts.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For two weeks, U.S. diplomats watched from their
office windows at the American Embassy in Tehran as hundreds of
militant Iranian college students gathered each day on
Takht-e-Jamshid Avenue to chant ``Margh Bar Amerika'' _''Death to
America.'' But on that drizzly Sunday morning, the crowd seemed to
be in a particularly ugly mood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 10:30 on Nov. 4, 1979, their worst fears were realized:
With bolt-cutting shears, a vanguard snipped the chains that
clasped the iron gates while others stormed over the 10-foot
concrete wall. Soon, students were swarming through the 27-acre
manicured grounds. Flak-jacketed Marines sought to hold back the
rampaging mob with tear gas grenades, but they were soon routed.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the diplomats and their security detail were bound
with tape and blindfolded. As TV images of the takeover circled the
globe, the United States began a prolonged ordeal, whose impact is
still being felt today.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, those events permanently eroded the presumed
sanctity of diplomatic immunity. But, more broadly, during the 444
days that the hostages were held captive, America's self-image, as
well as the nation's prestige abroad, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the public, Iran became a metaphor for everything,'' said
Gerald Rafshoon, then-President Jimmy Carter's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance changed to obsession, as Americans found themselves
checking their atlases and tracking the story so closely that the
names and views of the most obscure Iranian mullahs became
household names.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his poll numbers initially surged, Carter made what
turned out to be a fatal error: stating at the outset that his
primary concern was bringing the hostages home alive. By placing
the value of the hostages' lives above all else, Carter himself
became a kind of hostage to an angry public, a setting that would
haunt him throughout his re-election bid and eventually drive him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by a ravenous press corps, the hostage mania proved in time
to be more harmful to long-term U.S. interests than shocking events
in far-off Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For a subsequent generation of Americans, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the emergence of the United States as the world's
unchallenged pre-eminent power has removed much, if not all, of the
lingering sting. But in many European and Asian capitals, it is
still widely believed that U.S. foreign policy remains crippled,
especially in the Middle East, by the hostage trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded political analyst Daniel Pipes: ``The United States
paid in many ways for the emotionalism of its leaders. Officials
devoted so much time to this issue that their attention to matters
of greater significance was much reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Soviet troops occupied neighboring
Afghanistan, the president remained so consumed by the hostage
crisis that he was unable to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Carter resisted pressure to bomb Tehran, unlike
President Clinton who earlier this year approved the American-led
bombardment of Belgrade. One major difference: Carter lacked the
``smart bombs'' that NATO allies could deploy to cherry-pick
targets in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the crisis over Kosovo erupted, former presidential adviser
David Gergen noted: ``The temptation again is to make it an
obsession. And you can't allow that to happen, because it will
suddenly begin to drive your policy in ways that are very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 in the morning in Washington when word of the
hostage taking first reached Hamilton Jordan, the president's chief
of staff. Jordan's immediate fear was that it would trigger a war
with revolutionary Iran, incensed because Carter had granted
sanctuary in New York to the ailing deposed Shah.
</P>
<P>
   War didn't come. But neither did a settlement _ at least not
until Jan. 20, 1981, the day Carter left Washington. Ronald Reagan
had been president for 20 minutes when the remaining 52 hostages
flew off to a U.S. military hospital in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the hostage crisis of 1979 gave rise to that
peculiar agony, increasingly familiar to Americans in subsequent
decades, which arises after a major terrorist strike. It is an
agony born of great power, coupled with the knowledge of how little
at times it can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials empathized with the victims, heightening the sense
of crisis. Passengers of a downed Korean 747 receive more attention
than tens of thousands of Afghan peasants because Americans can
picture themselves sitting in a Boeing jet; similarly, fellow
bureaucrats can see themselves in an embassy surrounded by an
agitated mob.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were matters helped by a fierce policy dispute between
Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's activist national security adviser,
and the late Cyrus Vance, who as secretary of state, argued that
diplomacy could resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As historian Douglas Brinkley has written: ``For nearly a year
the crisis handcuffed the administration, which tried everything it
could think of to end the standoff: suspending oil imports,
freezing Iranian assets, expelling Iranian diplomats, imposing
economic sanctions, even conducting clandestine negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, a former naval officer, hoped to repeat the
success of an Israeli commando raid that had freed 103 airline
passengers at Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976. But the U.S. operation
proved a humiliating failure.
</P>
<P>
   As Brinkley noted: ``After the aborted rescue attempt, many
believed that Carter had not only tarnished the nation's honor but
lost control of his own administration in the process. Critics
condemned him for failing to mount a rescue operation sooner, for
not putting enough military hardware into it once he did act, and
then for retreating at the first sign of hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brzezinski had counseled Carter to bomb Tehran if the rescue
mission caused the deaths of would-be rescuers, hostages and
captors. Although no such attack took place, Vance quit in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Many years after the fact, Carter told reporters that he still
believed he could have been re-elected if he had bombed Tehran
until the hostages were released or incinerated along with the
entire Iranian government. But that kind of ground-zero solution
was morally repugnant to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of grumbles about my handling of the hostage
crisis,'' he said in looking back, ``but not a single responsible
politician offered a more realistic alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   An echo of such internal quarrels could be heard in Clinton's
1998 decision to launch a cruise missile attack against a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in a bid to punish Osama bin Laden,
the Islamic militant blamed for blowing up two American embassies
in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Brzezinski is hardly alone in believing that the Iran
hostage crisis crushed Carter's prestige. ``I think it was
devastating,'' he said. ``The Iran hostage crisis was one of the
two central reasons for Carter's defeat in 1980, the other reason
being domestic inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Brzezinski contends that the events in Iran heightened
the nation's sense of vulnerability, particularly in the Middle
East. ``Once the Iranian pillar had collapsed, we were faced with
the possibility that one way or another, before too long, we may
have either a hostile Iran on the northern shore of the Persian
Gulf facing us, or we might even have the Soviets there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another lasting legacy of the crisis is ABC's ``Nightline,'' the
media grand-daddy of today's saturation coverage, on cable networks
and the Internet, that arises whenever news blow-outs occur.
</P>
<P>
   Neither medium existed when Roone Arledge, the innovator of ABC
News, created ``America Held Hostage'' to track the crisis in
depth.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank Reynolds left in December to cover the presidential
campaign, his role was taken up by Ted Koppel, the network's
diplomatic correspondent. In time, Koppel began anchoring
permanently, with the renamed ``Nightline'' premiering on March 24,
1980. It remains a stable of light-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some grudges that Americans seem to nurse longer
than others,'' Koppel said. ``Lord knows this program no doubt
contributed to that mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days before it was known as 'Nightline,' when it
was still called 'America Held Hostage,' we tagged a number on the
back, indicating just how many days it had been since the Ayatollah
Khomeini's followers first seized the embassy in Tehran . . . Many
people probably still remember it as the program that highlighted
the indignity and humanized a situation far removed from most of
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back on the program's first decade, Koppel once
reflected: ``What will never change is that hostages are by
definition a tremendous emotional and explosive domestic issue.
Ideally _ and this sounds very callous _ a president ought to be
able to say, 'We aren't going to deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter did not.
</P>
<P>

Washington Bureau, covered the Carter White House and Iranian
hostage crisis.)

   What we needed, in the material sense, was a downstairs
bathroom, with a shower. But what we also needed, big time, was a
new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wah-ahnts to get old, for instance. My 86-year-old mother
certainly doesn't like it _ hates it, in fact, when it means she
can't run up and down the cellar stairs with 30-pound turkeys, or
see Africa again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too old,'' she'll say simply. She can't stand euphemisms
like ``senior citizen'' and ``elderly.'' Still, she isn't the type
to hop into a wheelchair. My brother Jim did talk her into one of
those electric chairs that attaches to a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock to see her get into the blue upholstered chair
and ride the steel track that now runs up the old polished
living-room staircase. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   But it was a pending hip replacement operation last June and her
10 days in a rehab unit (which we all called ``Mother's boot
camp'') that got us, finally, to stop pussyfooting around: a new
era had dawned, and it was time for the 200-year-old farmhouse to
get with the program.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a downstairs bathroom built along the principles
of barrier-free universal design.
</P>
<P>
   We'd often talked about installing a shower in the old pantry
off the kitchen, where more than 50 years ago my parents had taken
down the shelves and cookie tins and put in a toilet and sink. But
it's a small space _ about five and a half feet square _ with a big
window on one side. So, putting in anything more than a narrow
shower stall meant taking down a wall and extending into Mother's
beloved flower porch, a sunny, glassed-in space where her potted
plants thrive in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we just order a shower stall from Gary Watts and be
done with it?'' she had said, months before. Gary is our plumber;
his father had put in a shower stall on the third floor, when part
of the attic was converted into a bedroom. It works just fine. But
it has a four-inch-lip at the entrance, which anyone with a stiff
knee or hip could trip over.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been to the universal design show last fall at the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, where I was entranced by
Gianfranco Zaccai's prototype shower, with attractive grab bars, a
hand-held shower head and a comfortable bench. I could see,
suddenly, what universal design meant: everyone would enjoy a
well-designed space _ and it would remove the stigma of
``handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The design has not yet hit the production line, but I had seen
less elegant versions at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation
Medicine in Manhattan, so I made an appointment with Lucy Beck, the
designer there who helps patients redo their homes for independent
living. I took a rough sketch of the little downstairs room with
me.
</P>
<P>
   There were two basic options, she said, if we didn't want to
tear down any walls. We could buy the base of a prefabricated
shower unit, without the walls, and hang a curtain from a rod
attached to the walls and ceiling. That would leave the tiny room
more of a sense of space, though the base of the stall would make
maneuvering _ from toilet to sink to shower _ difficult for anyone
in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mother had insisted that she would not be using a
wheelchair, but what about other people? Why not design a bathroom
convenient to all?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beck's design for our little room created a no-barrier
shower without walls. A floor that sloped a quarter inch a foot
toward a drain in the corner of the shower space would keep water
from flooding out toward the sink and toilet. We would have to
install a lead pan or waterproof membrane beneath the tile floor
and a waterproof board behind the wall tiles in the shower area.
</P>
<P>
   We would have room for only a small, hanging corner sink by the
window, which would be accessible to anyone in a wheelchair. Ms.
Beck recommended a 19-inch-high toilet, which is five inches more
than the standard design, and grab bars at strategic points around
the room.
</P>
<P>
   The prefab unit might cost $2,000, without the labor, she said;
the no-barrier design, $8,000 to $12,000, depending on materials
and labor and unforeseen structural snafus.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began my first construction project. To my surprise, mother
voted for the no-barrier design, and went off to the hospital
saying: ``I'll leave all that to you. I'm sure you'll do a good
job.''
</P>
<P>
   I think it was the pain that inspired such confidence in her
neophyte contractor, which was not shared by the plumber, Gary
Watts; the carpenter, Randy Winecke, and Bernie Eckenrode, the
caretaker who can fix just about anything in this place. They had
been all set to install one of Gary's shower stalls, with the least
time and disruption to the house, and they looked at me with wary
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want us to rip up this linoleum, and put in a
subfloor,'' Randy said, mentally juggling his other jobs all over
the county. ``We'll have to see how the joists are running under
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to move the pipes,'' Gary muttered, as the two men
descended the cellar steps and started banging around downstairs.
Bernie turned to me and said, ``We'll have to take out that
radiator and put in some kind of overhead heater fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Joists? Heater fan? At age 50, I had successfully avoided doing
anything more than calling my landlord when the faucet started
leaking. Here I was trying to persuade these veterans of exploded
pipes and collapsed ceilings to tear up the floor and knock out the
old plaster, to move pipes and radiators _ not to mention tiling
the entire room _ just so Mrs. Raver wouldn't have to lift her foot
a few inches off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Then came my education at a family-owned tile company in
Westminster. I could have saved money shopping for tiles at the
Home Depot, but Gary, Randy and Bernie ``don't do tiles.'' I needed
someone who knew how to slope and line a floor properly.
</P>
<P>
   Then I had to choose colors. Look at your shelter magazines, the
tile man advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's no insulation behind this wall,'` Randy
said, as he knocked plaster off ancient wooden lathing. So, we had
to insulate, which would take a few days. Meanwhile, the house was
letting loose in other ways, like the kitchen drain that crumbled
when my brother Jim poked a coat hanger down the clogged line,
sending water all over the floor. Mother would just laugh, gaily,
from her cell in boot camp. We were seeing what it took to keep
This Old House from falling down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   All this was being negotiated in between trips to the hospital
and shopping for heater fans (I got the wrong one), and faucets
with levers, and grab bars, and toilet seats (oval or rounder?).
Days were turning into weeks, as our design kept bumping up against
reality, like the fact that the floor could not be lowered, because
of the joists supporting the house _ so this impermeable floor
would have to be built on top of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   After I decided on the color scheme (creamy white, with dark red
tiles in a simple alternating pattern), it turned out that the tile
store's best man would not be available for the installation.
</P>
<P>
   I suddenly understood the hysteria I've disdained in my
homeowner friends. But another man was sent in his place to lay the
floor. When my sister, Martha, and I returned from Home Depot, the
tile man had left for the day, and the tiles were laid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't the slope look like it's going the wrong way?'' Martha
asked. We weren't supposed to walk on the tiles, so we leaned
through the window. It was.
</P>
<P>
   In the week it took for someone else to come and do the job
right, Mother returned home, to a hospital bed in the living room
and plaster dust, and the high whine of a tile saw. The
bathroom-in-progress was missing even its original toilet and sink.
So, we got the ancestral potty chair down from the attic, and she
took sponge baths _ for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But finally, it all did take shape. The red tiles looked
beautiful. ``Like a New York diner,'' the tile man said, which was
a compliment, I think.
</P>
<P>
   It drains beautifully. The whole bathroom came in very close to
$8,000, which is a bargain when it means living where you want to,
safely and comfortably.

FOR SOME, THE YEAR 2000 THREAT IS AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: 2 optional sidebars at end of article; in the second
sidebar, titled `Y2K Information Sources', change (POUNDSIGN) in
the Web site address to the typographical symbol, with no
parentheses)  
 (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Bennett doubted that his home computer had Year 2000
problems, so when a visitor to his New York apartment raised the
subject 16 months ago, Bennett decided to prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   He set the date on its Windows 95 operating system ahead to the
last minute of 1999. Voila! The clock rolled smoothly into Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett then demonstrated that he could enter Year 2000 dates in
his Excel data program and his Lotus Organizer before calling it a
night. It was not until he reset Lotus to the current date the next
day that he learned to his horror that the test had wiped out his
Lotus data files, including freelance-writing records he needed for
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus offered to send a free updated version of the program, but
told him it knew of no way to recover the purged files.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a painful experience,'' said Bennett, who is an editor
at The American Banker, the financial services newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett undoubtedly has company. Computer experts say home
computer users may encounter a variety of Year 2000 flaws, some of
them potentially disastrous for people who operate businesses out
of their homes. But the biggest hazards for most people are most
likely to be misguided tests and mistakes in applying Year 2000
fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Home computer problems fall into three major areas: hardware,
the operating system (usually a form of Microsoft Windows) and
software applications. Some owners with extensive databases,
including those who use older versions of Excel, may also have
problems with the dates stored in them.
</P>
<P>
   In all three areas, the first step toward Year 2000 peace of
mind is to check with the companies that made your equipment and
programs. Fortunately that is a lot easier to do than in mid-1998,
when Bennett was first considering the problem. At that time,
Microsoft chairman and chief executive Bill Gates and much of the
personal computer world was dismissing Year 2000 as mainly a
problem for mainframe users.
</P>
<P>
   Today, all the major vendors have learned that PCs are also
prone to enough date bugs to be worrisome. As a result, their Y2K
Internet sites are finally relatively helpful. They may not explain
what will go wrong all that clearly, but at least they tell you
which products are flawed and offer advice on ways to cope with the
flaws. Telephone advice is also available for those without Web
access.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware defects are especially common in computers made before
1998. They stem from the way a chip known as the basic input-output
system, or BIOS, retrieves the date and time from another chip
called the real-time clock, or RTC, each time a computer is turned
on.
</P>
<P>
   RTC's keep time with batteries, and most track the ``year'' and
the ``century'' in separate two-digit registers. The ``year''
register, which now reads 99, will automatically move to 00 on Jan.
1, but the ``century'' register, which has read 19 ever since the
RTC was manufactured, is not likely to shift automatically to 20.
</P>
<P>
   What happens on Jan. 1 depends on how new and smart your BIOS
chip and operating system are. Some will update the clock when the
computer is rebooted or, at the very least, realize that a year
beginning with 19 is old and substitute 20. But if the BIOS does
not correct the clock when the computer is rebooted next year, an
older operating system like Windows 95 will conclude that the date
is Jan. 4, 1980, the earliest 20th-century date that it recognizes.
</P>
<P>
   None of that would prevent anyone from using a computer for word
processing or playing games, any more than a clock blinking 12:00
on a microwave oven interferes with cooking. But many applications,
from occasional tasks like sorting e-mail to ongoing activities
like banking online, look to the operating-system clock and require
accurate dates as well as times.
</P>
<P>
   A number of free tests are available online or on disks you can
get from vendors to probe the Year 2000 readiness of a PC's
hardware (all Apple computers are Y2K-ready, even though some
software for Apple machines may not be). And many free BIOS
upgrades are available if the tests turn up a problem. To find out
what BIOS your computer has, hit the Pause button as it is booting
or call the computer vendor with the model and serial number of
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   As nice as they sound, however, free tests and BIOS upgrades may
cause serious heartburn for users who become nervous at the thought
of doing anything more complicated than surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BIOS upgrade is usually over most folks' heads, and it can
virtually ruin the machine if the procedure fails,'' said Thomas
Becker, president of Rightime Co., a Miami-based vendor of computer
timing products for corporate desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said that anyone with a computer old enough to have date
problems should probably be thinking about buying a new computer.
Another strategy is to turn to a number of companies, including
his, that sell products to automate the process of finding and
repairing home-computer flaws.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not be necessary in many cases, Becker added. Many
home users who have the Windows operating system can simply go to
the Control Panel and open the Date/Time folder to reset the
computer's clock the first time it is booted next year. Often, that
will change the century register in the RTC to 20 for good.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the programs that find and fix glitches look at software
as well as hardware and operating systems. But many are loaded with
features that the average home user does not really need because
they were designed to help corporate computer managers overseeing
the Y2K readiness of hundreds or even thousands of desktop devices.
</P>
<P>
   There are a wide variety of operating-system problems that could
surprise home computer users, although most are so obscure that
many users might never encounter them. Microsoft lists 13 known
problems for Windows 95 on its Web site, including mysterious dates
in the file manager program after Jan. 1, 2000 (which appears as
1/1/:1).
</P>
<P>
   The list includes faulty date interactions between the operating
system and bundled applications, like the credit card tracking
function in MS Wallet (in early versions, an expiration date of
5/01 will be read as May 1 of the current year instead of May
2001).
</P>
<P>
   Home computer users may be surprised to learn that their systems
_ including those from Apple _ can hit Year 2000 snags in faulty
software even if the hardware and operating systems are ready for
2000 dates. For instance, the online banking applications of
Versions 5 and 6 of Quicken for Windows and Versions 6 and 7 of
Quicken for Macintosh will not recognize dates later than Dec. 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, the manufacturer of Quicken, a popular personal-finance
program, is offering customers with the flawed programs (or earlier
Quicken releases that Intuit has not tested for Year 2000
compliance) a choice of free upgrades to Quicken 98 or reduced
prices for its latest product, Quicken 2000.
</P>
<P>
   PC users with extensive databases and spreadsheets can run into
a separate set of date problems. Programs that handle the rollover
to 2000 smoothly can still flub the handoff of other dates from one
to the other: for example, one may interpret 1/1/15 in a
spreadsheet as Jan. 1, 1915, and the other as Jan. 1, 2015, even
though they agree that 1/1/00 is Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users may need to install special interface software to
prevent such database confusion. Others may want to move all their
data to newer database programs that are ready for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As Bennett's experience points out, however, crucial data should
be backed up before any effort is made to test or upgrade your
system.
</P>
<P>
   NO NEED TO WORRY: MR. COFFEE WON'T GET THE Y2K JITTERS
</P>
<P>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are you looking for your own niche as a technology collector, a
chance to specialize in something so rare and offbeat that a stash
of, say, early portable computers would look as commonplace as
Beanie Babies by comparison? Try rounding up consumer products
other than computers with Year 2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 fears have always focused primarily on the giant,
intertwined systems that provide society with basic services like
power, phones, banking and water. And, of course, personal
computers at home could have some problems if they are old or have
old software. But Year 2000 alarmists and even some of the more
moderate Y2K worriers also originally suspected that many popular
consumer entertainment and appliance products could stumble as New
Year's Eve turned into New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern was that hundreds of millions of such devices
contained microchips incapable of handling Year 2000 dates and
capable of malfunctioning if badly programmed, resulting in
unpopped popcorn, melted ice cream and VCRs incapable of recording
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' There were even fears that thermostats
would fail or that the family car would sputter to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what the situation was, and we couldn't get any
answers from the vendors,'' said Ann Coffou, a leading Year 2000
analyst at Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass., recalling
the warnings she issued about consumer products at Congressional
hearings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now the answers are there, and they are almost uniformly
reassuring. Microwave ovens, coffee makers and other appliances
were among the first home products to disappear from the Y2K
nightmare scenarios. The Consumer Products Safety Commission, trade
groups and major manufacturers all say they have yet to encounter
appliances with Year 2000 problems. The microchip clocks in
appliances track time and occasionally the day of the week, they
say, but have not been programmed to bother about the date.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in cars. General Motors, Ford and the
other manufacturers say cars will have no date problems, despite
the swarms of microchips embedded in them. The chips' timekeeping
capabilities are used for things like controlling the deployment of
airbags fractions of a second after a crash.
</P>
<P>
   Auto experts say that an expert with sophisticated equipment
could conceivably program the chips in a way that could shut down a
vehicle as the ball fell in Times Square. But no one has suggested
that anyone is trying to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average mechanic certainly isn't going to be up to such a
thing,'' said David Cole, an associate professor at the University
of Michigan's Transport Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least a possibility of failure for some consumer
electronics devices, but the glitches are still rare and, in some
cases, downright odd. Having checked their product lines,
manufacturers have come up with a handful of very old camcorders
that will continue working but will not print dates on film or, in
other cases, will display incorrect dates starting next year.
Despite speculation that some cameras may have a similar flaw, none
are listed on the company Web sites of the leading camera makers.
</P>
<P>
   One Philips pager (model PRG 2220) cannot be programmed to
delete messages automatically when the year reads ``00'' in the
date. But Philips says that problem will end when the date reads
01, in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Old VCRs may also have Y2K quirks. Some 1991 and 1992 models
made under the RCA name by Thomson Consumer Electronics cannot
easily be programmed at the end of this year to record programs
early next year using the VCR Plus feature, but users can still
tape by entering the time, date and channel information manually.
</P>
<P>
   Customized products _ some home security systems installed by
small, local operators for example _ may have unpredictable date
routines. But assuming that the power is on come Jan. 3, the clock
radio, the garage door opener and any other device you count on to
get you to work on a typical Monday will not miss a beat. You will
need something other than Y2K as an excuse for being late to the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K INFORMATION SOURCES
</P>
<P>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER
</P>
<P>
   Home computer users can get information on Y2K readiness
directly from manufacturers and convenient links to free tests. A
good entry point for research is www.pcy2000.org, a clearinghouse
created by major manufacturers. Several trade magazines also
provide useful if somewhat overwhelming portals, including PC World
(www.pcworld.com/onlinefeature/1707/countdown2000) and PC Week
(www.zdnet.com/pcweek/filters/zdy2k/resources).
</P>
<P>
   Users of Microsoft products may want to go directly to
www.microsoft.com/y2k and click on the Home and Small Business
site. Before heading there, though, stop to check Microsoft's
warnings about the latest Y2K hoaxes _ hackers have been sending
e-mail messages that purport to offer a Year 2000 countdown program
but can plant a virus in home computers.
</P>
<P>
   For an overview of consumer products, consult the Federal
Consumer Products Safety Commission at www.cpsc.gov/about/y2k.html.
The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association at
www.cemacity.org/govt/cema2000.htm(POUNDSIGN)(NU)4 has links to
major manufacturers of consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have access to the Internet, the information
clearinghouse run by President Clinton's Council on Year 2000
Conversion can provide written materials. Phone (888) USA-4Y2K
between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. to reach an operator.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the nation will be dry and rather mild as expansive high
pressure over the East and South continues to block the return of
moist air from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. A large
potent storm centered near Vancouver Island will result in strong
winds as well as widespread rain and mountain snow in the
Northwestern States.
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will dampen the Northwest Coast Thursday morning
as onshore winds gust frequently over 40 mph in exposed coastal
areas. Periods of snow will accumulate in the Cascades, especially
at elevations above 6,000 feet. Snow levels will fall during the
day as a pool of high-level chill passes overhead. Rain and wind
will diminish gradually during the afternoon and evening. Showery
valley rain and mountain snow will be common near the leading edge
of the cooler air as it spreads into the interior Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine will bathe a large area from the Southwestern
States to the east slopes of the Rockies and northern Plains.
Clouds will increase in northern sections later in the day as
moisture from the Pacific storm spreads east.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, a strong warming trend will develop from the lower
Mississippi Valley to the west slopes of the Appalachians as
breezes from the southwest increase. After a chilly dawn in the
East Coast states, plentiful sunshine will boost temperatures near
or above seasonal values in most locations. Onshore breezes will
cause patchy clouds to gather near the Southeast Coast later
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Sympathetic Storms
</P>
<P>
   Like the explosions from a set a fireworks, major storms have
been developing around the northern hemisphere. On Tuesday, a storm
rapidly strengthened in the North Atlantic near Iceland. Its
central pressure fell below 28 inches of mercury. Thursday, the
Pacific Northwest Coast will be lashed by rain and strong winds
from a potent Pacific storm. Major storms often form around the
same time at disparate locations. When a big storm develops the jet
stream pattern around the hemisphere becomes contorted providing
added energy for storms at several spots many thousands of miles
apart.

SPEEDING UP THE FIBER-OPTIC HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y., Ill.)   (af)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the race for greater bandwidth and faster Internet access,
fiber-optic lines have been hailed as the ultimate speedway, able
to transmit information at virtually the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   But there has always been one problem. Whenever that information
moves from one computer or network to another, it runs into an
electronic bottleneck. The switches that route the information are
not based on optical technology, but instead use electrical
components. To move through the switches, the signals carried by
photons must be converted into electronic signals and then
converted back to photonic signals to continue along the fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you convert backward and forward, you lose
information, and it costs money,'' said Lawrence Gasman, president
of Communications Industry Research, which follows trends in fiber
optics. ``The goal of everyone now is the all-optical network.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies have been working for years to
create switches that will make that all-optical network possible at
low cost. Getting light to change direction precisely and without
losing energy is one of the technical hurdles. Size and scale also
pose problems.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a switch that moves light from one channel to another
is easy compared to the challenge of switching light at different
wavelengths through thousands of different channels.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, new technological breakthroughs appear to be
bringing researchers closer to a practical solution. Bell
Laboratories, the research arm of Lucent Technologies in Murray
Hill, N.J., is using microelectricalmechanical systems, known as
MEMS.
</P>
<P>
   Its optical switches use silicon chips tiled with micro-mirrors,
each one small enough to fit on the head of a pin. When a voltage
is applied to the chip, the mirrors are pulled up or down in
response. The result is a tilting motion that can redirect light in
three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can steer the light from any input fiber to any output
fiber,'' said Dr. David Bishop, head of MEMS research at Bell Labs.
The device carrying the switches, Bishop added, could be the size
of a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., is also developing optical
switches. Its prototypes include liquid crystal displays that can
be turned on and off to route light from one fiber to another.
``Liquid crystal technology has no moving parts, which is big
advantage,'' said John Bayne, product-line manager for optical
switches at Corning.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Corning demonstrated a device based on this
technology that could route information between as many as 80
channels at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new company called Nanovation stepped into the
ring. It introduced a line of optical-switching components that are
based on research conducted at Northwestern University. Its
switches, it says, are the smallest yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about devices the size of a human hair,'' said
G. Robert Tatum, the company's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic switches could be created in bulk at very low cost,
Tatum said, because only small specks of material would be used in
manufacturing each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our devices will allow immediate access to the fiber at much
faster speeds,'' Tatum said.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation's technology has some skeptics, however. Engineers
for other companies say privately that they will believe it when
they see it; they are not convinced that the wave-guide technology
will actually work.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation has not given any public demonstrations, officials
say, because the switches are too tiny to see without specialized
equipment. But they add that the company has given demonstrations
to clients and investors in its nanofabrication laboratory at
Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind the switches is based on channels for the
passage of photons called wave guides. In the laboratory,
Nanovation engineers use an electron-beam lithography system to
etch these wave guides onto tiny wafers made of indium phosphite or
gallium arsenide, substrates that are commonly used in optical
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The wave guides look like deep ravines arranged in patterns of
circles and straight lines. The circles act as exit ramps that
redirect the light and create, in essence, an optical switch.
</P>
<P>
   One critical element of these wave guides, Nanovation's
engineers say, is the smooth surface of the walls. As long as the
surface is smooth, light is not deflected in the wrong direction
and lost during its movement through the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at Northwestern _ Seng Tiong Ho, a engineering
professor, and Mee Koy Chin, who is now Nanovation's director of
technology _ invented this approach, which they call ``strongly
guided'' wave-guide technology.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation licensed the technology and produced its first
optical chip in April. The chip includes 16 switches etched upon a
wafer that measures less than 250 microns, or about the size of a
few strands of human hair, on each side. Since these switches are
so minute, thousands of them can be integrated within a chip the
size of a thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which approach wins in the battle for best optical
switch, consumers may be reaping the benefits in the next few
years, analysts say. Bandwidth may become wide enough and fast
enough to make Internet multimedia like video teleconferencing
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now, we'll be switching huge amounts,
mind-boggling amounts, of bandwidth,'' said Bishop of Bell Labs.
``There are untold riches to be made for the company that figures
out how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of optical switches could also clear vast amounts of
space in the equipment closets at traditional phone companies.
Currently, phone companies are saddled with cabinets full of
equipment to switch signals among copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they may be able to go to completely optical
networks, depending instead on devices the size of breadboxes, or
smaller. That is, once they are willing to dispose of the bulkier
switches they have relied on for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will cut down on costs,'' said Sean Buckley, an editor of
optical newsletters published by the Information Gatekeepers Group.
But, Buckley said, it may not happen right away: ``Local phone
companies don't just want to rip out what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatum of Nanovation is more optimistic. In a few years, he said,
the all-optical network could be a reality, with fiber running
straight into homes and onto desktops. ``We're making it efficient
enough,'' Tatum said, ``to have fiber optics go straight to the
PC.''

WIDE-RANGING MOVIE SITES OFFER THE RARE AND OFFBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blockbuster last week announced that it would offer movie
rentals over the Internet by the middle of next year and said it
was evaluating ways to transmit movies into people's homes on
demand. But you don't have to wait until then to order movies over
the Internet and have them delivered to your door.
</P>
<P>
   There are already a number of videotape and DVD movie rental
sites on the Web, many offering the kinds of films you would never
see at a chain video store. The selections include high art and
film rarities.
</P>
<P>
   A quick search of the Internet turned up six online video rental
stores and nine DVD rental sites. Some are simply extensions of
brick-and-mortar video stores; others are Internet-only businesses.
Some, like Net Flix, are well financed and slick; others appear to
be shoestring, amateurish operations. All function in a similar
way, allowing some kind of search through a trove of films that can
be ordered on the site for delivery by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 sites, most people could eliminate DVD Rent right off
the bat _ it offers film and music rentals and sales throughout
Australia. And DVD Wave and Video Ltd. no longer rent movies, even
though their Yahoo listings say they do. Laser Discovery required a
security deposit of $500, which seemed excessive _ wasn't that the
total shooting budget for ``The Blair Witch Project''?
</P>
<P>
   The video sites offered more eclectic film collections than
those that handle DVD's, in part because some of the more offbeat
movie titles are not yet available in the DVD format. But as a
group, the video sites had the least consumer-friendly policies.
</P>
<P>
   Best Video (www.bestvideo.com) promises a broad selection, but
charges $16.99 per rental _ pretty steep, considering that a video
at the local Blockbuster is less than $4.
</P>
<P>
   Several video rental stores did not include a return mailer or
return postage in the cost of the rental. In the time it takes to
wrap up a video and wait in line at the post office, a movie lover
could watch an entire film festival. Both Facets Video
(www.facets.org), which also required a $35 membership, and Rick's
Video, (www.ricksvideo.com), which charges $19.95 for up to three
tapes or DVD's, do not offer the convenience of a return mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Two other video sites do not offer return postage, although they
do have intriguing film collections. One is Video Vault
(www.videovault.com), which has a delightfully tacky Web site. It
lives up to the slogan ``Guaranteed Worst Movies in Town'' with
rentals like Ed Wood Jr.'s ``Glen or Glenda,'' as well as the film
Siskel and Ebert used to cite as the worst ever made, ``I Spit on
Your Grave.''
</P>
<P>
   The second, www.videowasteland.com, specializes in horror,
exploitation and B movies. One of them is ``Skeeter,'' which
features giant mutant killer mosquitoes _ a movie certain to be in
demand in New York after the events of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth videotape site, Home Film Festival
(www.homefilmfestival.com), charges a $6 rental fee and a minimum
shipping fee of $4.30. There is also a $9.95 membership fee,
bringing the total to $20.25 for the first video. That's a lot of
money, but Home Film Festival could come up with a hard-to-find
cult classic like, for example, ``The Harder They Come,'' starring
the reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, so it might be worth it to a real
film buff.
</P>
<P>
   An order for membership and the movie was placed about 6 p.m. on
a Friday. On Monday, an e-mail message confirmed that the
membership had been processed but said ``The Harder They Come'' was
not available. It was an expensive movie not to see. But later, a
215-page catalog showed up with finds for cinemaphiles like
``Absolute Beginners,'' starring David Bowie, and ``Zou-Zou,''
starring Josephine Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Things went better with the DVD providers. The King Kong of DVD
sites is Net Flix (www.netflix.com). It has a wide selection _ it
was the only DVD site of those surveyed to have the hard-to-find
1970s Richard Lester costume romp called ``The Three Musketeers''
and the even-harder-to-find sequel, ``The Four Musketeers.'' The
site is also loaded with viewing suggestions. Leonard Maltin, the
reviewer, has a page where he recommends five films each month.
</P>
<P>
   Net Flix also packages films into fairly random collections of
five or so movies. The cover of ``Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil'' on the main page, is linked to the Southern Charm
collection, which includes ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' ``Sling
Blade'' and ``Eve's Bayou,'' but not ``In the Heat of the Night.''
</P>
<P>
   The main page is so jammed with films that it's a little busy,
and the box cover shots are postage-stamp size on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   No membership is required at Net Flix, but the site offers
packages. The Marquee service, for a monthly fee of $15.95, gives
viewers four films a month with no due date, late fee or shipping
charges. There are also package deals of 10, 25 and 40 disks that
offer discounts of about 50 cents on each rental, once shipping is
figured in. Single rentals are $3.49 per disk plus a shipping fee
of 95 cents and a flat fee of 99 cents per order, for a total of
$5.43.
</P>
<P>
   An order is quickly followed by an e-mail confirmation, another
to say the DVD's have been shipped and a third when it's time to
send them back. Disks ordered about 6 p.m. on a Friday arrived on
Tuesday. A stamped return mailer was included. The major downside
to Net Flix is the marketing blitz an order sets off, including
automatic subscriptions to electronic newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DVD Overnight (www.dvdovernight.com) has a streamlined opening
page, with video box pictures that are a little larger than most.
And the rentals are a reasonable $3 per disk with a flat shipping
fee of $3, return included, whether you rent one disk or six, the
maximum. The site carries mostly new releases, which means that you
would need to search for all but the most common classic films
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But DVD Overnight has one thing that neither Blockbuster nor Net
Flix has: pornographic movies. And that means you should be careful
surfing the site with children. The company said it would always
make sure that the DVD box art that appears on the main page for
such movies was not particularly revealing. However, if you click
on DVDO Top Rentals, the page of most popular films, the box art
for pornographic films can be sexually explicit.
</P>
<P>
   The site suffers the occasional technical glitch. Clicking on
``Toxic Avenger 2,'' for example, sent the surfer to ``Magical
Mystery Tour.'' But DVD's ordered on a Friday appeared by Wednesday
in good shape, with a return mailer that was easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   The Digibuster home page (www.digibuster.com) has the look of a
homemade Web page, with a champagne glass background and a very
prominent link to a different Reuters entertainment news article
each day. There is also a link to India Weekly, with which it must
be allied, because India Weekly appears on the credit card receipt
for rental DVD's. In fact, there is a special link to movies from
India.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a small selection, about 150 DVD's, and most are
the sort of movies that would have been featured on the wall at a
Blockbuster months ago. But it is among the least expensive: disks
are $1.99 plus $1.49 handling and shipping for each one, for a
minimum of two disks. An order was followed by an e-mail
confirmation, and the movies showed up in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Cache (www.dvdcache.com) has a Web page that proved a little
cranky, at least on a Netscape browser _ it loaded slowly, and
sometimes without a scroll bar. But the site was fairly easy to
shop, partly because it offers only about 350 titles, including a
total of six Westerns and five classics.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll bar was not the only technological problem. Using the
search engine to look up ``Costner'' turned up several films, but
not ``Silverado,'' with Kevin Costner, even though it was in stock.
Rentals are $2.99 each, with a flat $4 shipping fee for up to six
DVD's. If you order six, the shipping is free. But the return
mailer must be postmarked seven days after the shipping date _ most
other sites allow a lenient seven days from the time the movies
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to put up with the occasional technical
glitch and wade through some hard-to-browse pages, these sites
offer a broader array of films than you are likely to find in a
single store. All you need for your own film festival is the
popcorn _ also available for delivery on line.

THE ART OF MAKING A HOME PERFECTLY IMPERFECT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)   By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Were it not largely obscured by a privet hedge, Gary Guerrette's
three-bedroom bungalow might cause a neighborhood revolt. But in
low-key Water Mill, N.Y. _ where picturesque dilapidation can be a
badge of honor _ the rippling asphalt-shingle roof, buckling wood
steps and architectural malaise pass without remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs a little work,'' said a brightly smiling Guerrette,
40, of the house he shares with his partner, Tom Lawson, 42, a
massage therapist. Informally formal, rough yet elegant, it is a
semaphore for design on the century's cusp _ a lively mosaic of
pleasures and passions rather than a catalog of perfections. ``I
don't think we own anything that isn't chipped, rotten, broken or
falling apart,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of precious,'' chimed in Guerrette, a floral
designer who has segued into creating gardens and interiors for
clients in Manhattan and near his Water Mill home on Long Island.
(His company is called the Mad Gardener.) ``When everything's
perfect,'' he added, ``a room loses its spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing a visitor sees upon opening the front door is a
German Expressionist-style portrait of a young flapper, surrounded
by an 18th-century English gilt frame. The pairing is a potent
symbol of Guerrette's all-forgiving, all-inspiring vision; the
battered canvas is too small for the frame by at least two inches.
It is a flaw that offers a startling side effect: a glimpse of blue
wall that surrounds the canvas like a mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more interesting to look at that way,'' said Guerrette,
who found the discarded painting on a street in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Independent, clashing and, above all, loads of fun, the
Guerrette-Lawson bungalow is the kind of home that mainstream
shelter magazines avoid like the plague. Though positioned to teach
as well as tout, editors too often shy away from challenging the
status quo, claiming that their public would not understand.
(Translation: Readers lack imagination, are conventional and have
no sense of humor.)
</P>
<P>
   But who could fail to be inspired by cozily stylish rooms that
look like they took about a weekend to pull together _ and probably
did?
</P>
<P>
   For now, rows of staples brazenly hold yards of checked cotton
to the walls of a spare room, though Guerrette swears that ``one
day soon'' he will get around to concealing the evidence under
decorative braid.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the staples, skirting the margins of the room like
a sort of quicksilver Morse code, is momentarily odd but, in an age
when the cult of perfection can paralyze even the most confident,
it is strangely comforting at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In the living area, a gingham-check slipcover is seamed with
dozens of straight pins, its lumpy silhouette camouflaged by a
fluffy white sheepskin. Underneath the whole thing is a battered
rattan footstool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is properly sewn,'' Guerrette said. Few things are
properly hung either. The impromptu tapestry in the dining area, an
eight-foot length of a Manuel Canovas pineapple-print cotton, is
held aloft by transparent plastic pushpins. (So are the curtains
that frame the dining area like a theatrical tableau.)
</P>
<P>
   No, the decorator did not bother to conceal the manufacturer's
name emblazoned along the cotton's selvage. ``Anything done
correctly here would look out of place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He says even his mother has begged him, without success, to hem
the canvas curtains under the china cabinet that holds a cache of
English creamware, French faience, American ironstone and
miscellaneous lusterware. The china cabinet is homemade, too, made
by fitting an existing alcove with shelves and window frames backed
by chicken wire.
</P>
<P>
   Though Guerrette views pushpins and thumbtacks as viable
decorating tools for himself, clients typically prefer their rooms
more finished. For them, the designer's work is strictly couture.
</P>
<P>
   At a still-under-development apartment in a prewar building on
West End Avenue, for instance, the living room walls are shiny
aubergine, which Guerrette _ armed with a plastic graining tool
from a paint-supply store _ gave a subtle random pattern recalling
silk moire.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Louis XVI-style chairs are upholstered in silk striped
in two shades of blue, and lettuce-green taffeta curtains hang at
the windows. Of course, there is a flea-market touch, albeit a
swank one, amid the Dior-deluxe trappings: gold-tone spun-aluminum
table lamps, each topped with an exaggerated stovepipe shade.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrette and Lawson bought the Water Mill property for less
than $400,000 a year and a half ago, seduced by its physical
charms: towering trees, privacy, the sense of otherworldliness.
(There was income potential, too, thanks to a small cottage at the
back of the lot, which the men briefly lived in, smartly renovated
and now rent out.)
</P>
<P>
   Visitors walking to the end of the gravel drive take in a view
that is pure Millet, a bucolic scene stretching from a farmer's
field of organically grown vegetables out to the sparkling waters
of Mecox Bay on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, because the trees are changing, you feel like
you're in Burgundy,'' said Guerrette, who comes by his Francophilia
naturally (he had a French grandfather) as well as commercially (he
briefly sold 19th-century French antiques at a shop he opened near
the 26th Street flea market). ``It's all silver, gray and blue,
with touches of orange and yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bungalow, where the couple live year-round, Guerrette has
settled on French color and English comfort. Cultural
cross-pollination, not purity, was the goal. ``I like when the
French do an English look, or vice versa, because they knock each
other down a bit,'' he said. ``It's not right, but it's better.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the bungalow's woebegone state, Guerrette and Lawson do
have a long-range plan of improvements in mind, among them siding
the house in natural shingles, adding another bedroom upstairs,
removing the linoleum that paves the entire first floor and
replacing the ``awful'' 1970's picture windows with multipaned
charmers.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, Guerrette will be painting the interior trim
driftwood gray, inspired by a French manor featured in a
12-year-old issue of Vogue Decoration, now defunct. The floors will
be painted the same weathered blue that a French artist used for
the interior doors of his country house.
</P>
<P>
   Although on a recent afternoon the latter plan came as somewhat
of a surprise to Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember, Tom, I showed you the article,'' Guerrette said,
puzzled that such a perfect idea could have slipped his partner's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   An awkward pause followed. ``Oh, OK,'' Lawson said slowly,
eyebrows raised, face bemused.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Turning to a visitor, he said: ``I'm not the decorator, and I
accept that. There's something to be said for knowing what you can
and cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Guerrette, Lawson pointed out, who solved the spatial
problem of a long but narrow spare bedroom. First, he divided it
horizontally with secondhand cotton curtains that he upgraded with
chartreuse-and-black grosgrain ribbon. Then, he outfitted the far
side of the room as an alcove bed, installing a mattress and a box
spring and piling on cushions of blue damask and flowered chintz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way to make a full-size bed fit and make
something out of the room,'' said Guerrette. He also stapled up a
couple of bolts of grape-and-white checked cotton, bought for $1.50
a yard at Paterson Silks, and for good measure, dragged into the
scheme an extravagant console table with a marble top. Once
grandly, garishly gold _ call it Sunset Boulevard Baroque _ the
base of table has been painted soothing delphinium blue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see things the way Gary does,'' Lawson said. ``He has
the vision; I'm the practical one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawson acknowledges that Guerrette has a transformative way with
unexceptional flotsam. A rococo-style chest of drawers, sludge
green picked out with gold, was given an instant facelift with an
allover coat of slick azalea-pink paint. Guerrette next painted a
wood console from Ikea to match, and placed the blushing pieces on
either side of the front door, to balance a wall in the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to leave everything as I found it,'' said Guerrette.
``This is the first time I've consciously tried to coordinate
colors for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He is presently under the spell of gesso, the chalky white
undercoat that lurks under the gilt surface of frames. ``It gives
things a more sculptural look than glossy white paint,'' Guerrette
said. ``The texture is like plaster.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets it at Andy's Art Supplies on West 23d Street and relies
on it as a sort of esthetic Wite-Out, taming questionable
flea-market finds _ like garish metal sconces, or a fussy mirror
frame _ into submission. (Manufactured by Golden or Prima, the
gesso costs $21 to $35 a gallon, and is available in black or
white.)
</P>
<P>
   Guerrette is a paint manufacturer's dream consumer. To distract
attention from a previous owner's shoddy Sheetrock _ it was applied
directly over the existing walls, so every light switch and
electrical outlet in the house is buried an inch deeper than normal
_ he ennobled the living room with do-it-himself boiseries. Some
are sand-colored, some cobalt blue.
</P>
<P>
   The neoclassical panels were painted freehand, without benefit
of any measuring, and roughly, which gives the room a stage-set
artifice and, better yet, an architectural oomph that it never had.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century was the most prosperous era in France, which
explains why you see so much furniture from that time in the flea
markets there, especially Charles X and Louis-Philippe,'' said Gary
Guerrette, a decorator and seasoned scavenger who lives in Water
Mill, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Once the co-owner of a Manhattan shop of mid-19th-century French
antiques, Guerrette advises bargain hunters in France to go south.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are massive flea markets in Beziers, Montpellier and
Avignon, and the stuff is really cheap,'' he said. ``Dealers from
the Paris flea market go there, stock up and sell everything for 10
times as much.'' Guerrette said he bought two blue velvet Victorian
slipper chairs in one of those markets for his living room for
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, finding the perfect chair and shipping it home are
two different things. Guerrette _ who also haunts Ruby Beets, a
shop in Southampton, and the Calvary St. George's vintage furniture
shop on Park Avenue _ suggests contacting a specialist in the
packing and shipping of antiques. He relies on Edet, a Paris
company owned by Sandy Simpson and staffed with English-speaking
associates (011-33-1-48-59-11-73).

PILOT'S FRIENDS STUNNED BY CRASH

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTER HAVEN, Fla. _ Stephanie Bellegarrigue's friends didn't
know she was interested in flying planes until after she graduated
from Winter Haven High School in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those friends are stunned that the 27-year-old pilot died
in the plane crash Monday that killed golfer Payne Stewart and four
others in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard Stephanie was going to be a pilot, we were
shocked,'' Sherry Anastasio, her former coach in synchronized
swimming. ``We called her spacey, but if she put her head to
anything, she could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the oldest of Dr. Roberto and Irma Bellegarrigue's three
children. Reached in El Salvador were they now live, the
Bellagarrigues were distraught and could not talk about their
daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bellegarrigue, who returned to his native country when he
retired last year, said the family will travel to Orlando, where
his daughter lived.
</P>
<P>
   The family, described by friends as close knit, moved to Winter
Haven from Maryland in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be real devastating,'' said Debbie Banniza,
office administrator at Neurology and Neurosurgery Associates,
where Bellegarrigue practiced for 14 years. ``She grew up with us.
She even worked here one summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Brackett, who retired from the same medical practice,
heard about the accident in France, where he now lives. ``It's
almost like losing one of my own family,'' he said. ``She was much
beloved by her family, a very close family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellegarrigue, who had logged more than 1,700 hours in
flight time, was one of two pilots who died in the crash. The
captain of the plane was Michael Kling, 43, a former Air Force
fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Ms. Bellegarrigue attended Ohio State
University for about a year. Then she transferred to Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, graduating in 1993 with a
degree in aeronautical science.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school swimmer, Ms. Bellegarrigue traveled the state
and country performing. She also represented her native El Salvador
in international competition, her father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a good synchronized swimmer,'' said Anastasio, her
former coach. ``She gave it everything she had and then some.''
</P>
<P>
   Anastasio last saw Bellegarrigue in June, when she attended the
wedding of Anastasio's daughter, Dawn.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Bellegarrigue moved to Orlando and worked as an
on-call pilot for various companies until landing a job with Sunjet
Aviation Inc. about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not sinking in,'' said Carol Greene, who said she'd
known Bellegarrigue for about five years. ``You just keep expecting
her to walk back in the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an awesome pilot,'' Greene said. ``I trusted her. She
didn't scare me.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides flying, Bellegarrigue enjoyed gardening. ``She'd just
gotten the front yard like she wanted it,'' Greene said.

   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Sixteen years after splitting from the
Police, Sting has become one of mainstream pop's foremost cultural
emissaries, roaming the planet in search of obscure musical
textures to bring back and share with the masses.
</P>
<P>
   He assumes that role again with his latest solo release (his
seventh), ``Brand New Day,'' a typically well-crafted, propulsively
polyglot disc that demonstrates the British musician's intuitive
grasp of jazz, Algerian dance pop and bossa nova, to name only the
most obvious elements.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a four-show engagement Tuesday night at Universal
Amphitheatre, Sting and his current band of collaborators made
multiple forays into the ever-expanding realm of world pop without
ever losing their rhythmic compass. A bass-driven reggae
undercurrent remains the touchstone of most every little thing
Sting does, and it sustains his music even when he can't quite mesh
his wide array of influences into a seamless, organic sound.
</P>
<P>
   Sting explicitly acknowledged his reggae roots about midway
through the two-hour set when he launched into ``Roxanne,''
complete with a wailing ``dub'' solo and an unprompted audience
call-and-response chorus. But mostly Sting faced the musical
future, as he has been doing with thoughtful curiosity for well on
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off with the insistent, two-beat ``A Thousand Years''
from his new release, Sting cast himself in the familiar role of a
mystic cosmic traveler who'd rather be home with his loved ones.
``Mad About You'' and ``Seven Days'' played variations on the theme
of an introspective lover struggling to convey his feelings through
transcendent metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Sting's voice has developed into the perfect
instrument for these kinds of expressions. An unusual fusion of
grit and ethereality, it floats over his funky bass lines and
skitters across the tops of his literary allusions before breaking
into a bluesy groan or an ecstatic yelp.
</P>
<P>
   These elements all came together on such well-constructed songs
as the new ``Fill Her Up,'' a neat four-minute parable of Middle
American redemption that segues dramatically from country to
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   However, the song cried out for brassier backup from Sting's
three female chorines. Though he unleashed guitarist Dominic Miller
for a couple of brief solos and brought back his opening act, the
French-Algerian singer Cheb Mami, for an encore, the star of the
show was in no danger of being upstaged by his band.
</P>
<P>
   Sting closed with two encore sets that included a plaintive solo
acoustic version of ``Message in a Bottle,'' ``Brand New Day,''
``If I Ever Lose My Faith in You'' and a hopeful rather than
brooding rendition of ``Every Breath You Take.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, he wrapped up this upbeat, future-gazing
concert on an ambivalent note, observing ``how fragile we are.''
Even so, Sting's career looks as robust as ever. &QL;

IN SAN FRANCISCO RACE, SUPPORTING DEATH PENALTY IS A LIABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the ``Only in San Francisco Department,'' the
four candidates for district attorney are sniping at each other
over who would send fewer murderers to their death.
</P>
<P>
   Californians have twice voted overwhelmingly to allow juries to
impose capital punishment in certain murders with ``special
circumstances.'' But San Francisco's electorate marches to a
different drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Here, even tentative support for the death penalty among
prospective prosecutors could be a liability among largely liberal
voters. San Francisco is the only county to reject both pro-capital
punishment ballot initiatives in the 1970s. Juries in the city have
imposed the death sentence four times in the past 20 years, and not
at all since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The four major candidates for district attorney, including
incumbent Terence Hallinan, are either opposed to the death penalty
or express extreme reluctance in seeking capital punishment for
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Two challengers _ Matt Gonzalez and Bill Fazio _ have repeatedly
accused Hallinan of waffling on the issue. Both call Hallinan a
hypocrite because the incumbent has made conflicting statements
about his stand on the death penalty since taking office in January
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terence Hallinan has made so many conflicting statements that
I don't know if anyone knows what he really thinks,'' said
Gonzalez, a deputy public defender and opponent of the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can respect a moral difference on this issue, but he seems
to change his mind depending on the audience,'' said Fazio, a
former homicide prosecutor and a ``very cautious'' death penalty
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career as a defense attorney and member of the
Board of Supervisors, Hallinan has been against capital punishment.
Then, when he ran for district attorney in 1995, Hallinan said he
would support the death penalty in very limited circumstances _
``only in the clearest kind of case'' _ including crimes in which
women or children were tortured to death.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hallinan says he is absolutely opposed to seeking capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not asked for the death penalty in the past four years,
and I will not ask for it in the next four years,'' Hallinan said
at a recent candidate forum.
</P>
<P>
   But his office unsuccessfully sought the capital punishment once
_ seven months after Hallinan took over as top prosecutor _ during
the murder trial of Victor Diep and Than Wu in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Hallinan clarified his position,
saying that he had not ``initiated'' any new death penalty cases
since taking office. He inherited the 1992 Diep-Wu case from
predecessor Arlo Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply followed through with the plan to seek the death
penalty,'' Hallinan said. ``It was a heinous, brutal killing of a
9-year-old boy who was murdered for insurance money. ... I said
that I would let the jury decide, and they did. They went for life
without parole instead of death. I'm absolutely satisfied with that
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said he had had a change of heart after spending four
years in a job that allowed him ``the sobering power'' to make life
or death decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, I promised to look at every single case that
might merit the death penalty,'' Hallinan said. ``I promised to
carefully evaluate these cases and only seek the death penalty in
the most heinous, clear-cut cases. Now, after four years in this
job, I see that there are no clear-cut cases. There are always some
complicating factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in murder cases with special circumstances, he will
seek life a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of
parole.
</P>
<P>
   In two other special circumstances cases Hallinan inherited, he
allowed the defendants to plead guilty to murder with life
sentences without parole, in return for avoiding a possible death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the district attorney candidates, only Fazio has sent a man
to death row.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Fazio's first murder cases, Russell Coleman was
convicted in 1981 of raping and sodomizing a woman, and then
strangling her with her own pants. Coleman, 48, is still on death
row after his capital sentence was set aside but then re-affirmed
on appeal last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that in four years in office I would never seek
the death penalty,'' Fazio said. ``But I wouldn't rule it out. It's
a tool that is available to prosecutors in the state of California.
It should only be used very rarely, in those most terrible cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who criticizes Hallinan and Fazio on the issue, called
on all candidates to support a ``death penalty moratorium,'' saying
that ``moral leadership on this issue should start in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Castleman, also a candidate for district attorney, said
that all this focus on the death penalty was misguided because
``juries here don't like it, and it has no deterrent value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not object to it so much on moral grounds as I do believe
that it does not work,'' said Castleman, a former prosecutor who
specialized in white-collar crimes. ``There are no studies to
indicate that the death penalty in any way serves as a deterrent to
murderers.''

 &HT;    Technology is raising the bar with state-of-the-art kitchen
fixtures that make food storage, meal preparation and cleanup a
snap
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take a look at what manufacturers have rigged up for
the kitchens of the new millennium, and you'll be dazzled by
gleaming stainless steel, brushed chrome and control panels that
glow like the inside of a Boeing cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The latest dishwashers will come with pullout drawers rather
than pull-down doors, and one company even has a prototype of a
refrigerator that includes a built-in computer screen on the door.
With Electrolux's Screenfridge you can send e-mails and check out a
built-in library of recipes. And Sharp Electronics has its own
prototype: a microwave that pulls out like a drawer. But that's
still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the Jetsons would blink in disbelief at these
ingenious kitchen devices.
</P>
<P>
   But looks and slick tricks aren't everything in the new century.
Apparently speed cooking is.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are falling all over themselves to offer customers
fast cooking with excellent results, says Bob Wells, associate
merchant for appliances at Expo Design Center at Perimeter Mall in
Atlanta. ``These companies are looking at the consumer's lifestyle
and realizing that people are too busy to stay home and spend a lot
of time cooking,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, that doesn't mean we want to swap flavor for speed.
After all, a microwave will cook a steak in a few minutes, but who
would want it?
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest items is Advantium by General Electric. It's
not a conventional oven, but through the use of light, it cooks
oven-quality meals in a fraction of the time it takes in a regular
oven. It requires no preheating and uses 25 percent less energy
than a conventional range.
</P>
<P>
   GE claims Advantium browns, crisps and even bakes. And with the
push of a button it converts into a fully functional microwave.
Expect to pay $1,200-$1,399 for the oven, which is on the market
now.
</P>
<P>
   While consumers might be cooking with the speed of light, they
could have a hard time finding their refrigerators, which will
blend into the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-Zero's latest refrigerators and freezers meld seamlessly
into kitchen cabinetry. And forget the rule that says the freezer
belongs with the fridge. The company offers mix-and-match
components for infinite flexibility and creativity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can design your unit to look exactly like a
bookcase complete with drawers. Each drawer can be either a
refrigerator or freezer compartment.
</P>
<P>
   While rich woods are hot, they're also pricey. Today's consumers
are still opting for kitchen appliances in more traditional
finishes. Wells says stainless finishes are top sellers, with black
coming in second and white third.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are introducing a darker version of off white
such as biscuit and bisque, which is quickly gaining popularity.
Avocado, coppertone and harvest gold have had their day for now.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing never seems to change: As the 21st century
approaches, it's a sure bet that the kitchen _ even with its sleek,
high-tech look _ will remain the heart of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rosie, the Jetsons' robotic maid, would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   A HIGH-TECH KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   Hadco, a Suwanee appliance distributor, has several fully
operational kitchens so you can see the appliances
</P>
<P>
   in action through demonstrations that include the making
</P>
<P>
   of a four-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   This kitchen grouping features a stainless steel 600 Series
Sub-Zero refrigerator and freezer ($2,999 and $3,199); Thermador
Dual Fuel cooktop with four gas burners and two electric ($1,849);
Thermador self-cleaning oven ($3,599); and a Bosch Millennium
Series dishwasher ($999).
</P>
<P>
   DISHWASHING DYNAMICS
</P>
<P>
   Fisher &AMP; Paykel DishDrawer ($1,500) consists of two independent
wash drawers to give you a variety of washing options. You can put
delicate crystal in one half and more heavily soiled pots and pans
in the other. This innovative dishwasher is perfect as a second
dishwasher in a butler's pantry. At Expo Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   TWIN BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Gemini range ($1,399-$1,499) by Maytag provides two separate
ovens
</P>
<P>
   in the space of one. The range's dual ovens are designed to
prepare several dishes simultaneously at different temperatures.
The self-cleaning upper oven features 1.2 cubic feet and has a
``keep warm'' and a toasting feature. The full-size lower oven at
4.0 cubic feet is also self-cleaning. Both have broiling
capability. At Best Buy.
</P>
<P>
   WASH AWAY
</P>
<P>
   Those with laundry rooms on a second
</P>
<P>
   story might consider a second washing
</P>
<P>
   machine and dryer for the kitchen. Bosch
</P>
<P>
   offers convenient under-counter washers
</P>
<P>
   and dryers ($1,699/set) that take up little
</P>
<P>
   space. Note that front-loading washers don't use an agitator _
allowing more space for laundry. Also, front-loaders tumble
clothes,
</P>
<P>
   for less wear and tear. At Hadco.
</P>
<P>
   WINE TIME
</P>
<P>
   The Sub-Zero 400 Series wine storage ($3,949) maintains a
constant temperature and a nearly ideal humidity of 60 percent to
prevent corks from drying out. The high-tech units come with an
optional lock and also tie in to your home security system. And you
can customize them with wood panels to match your decor. They come
in four sizes, holding from 46 to 147 bottles. All have the ability
to store half-bottles as well as magnums. At Hadco.
</P>
<P>
   WARMING TREND
</P>
<P>
   Commercial looks in the home kitchen are gaining in popularity.
This handsome warming drawer by Viking ($987-$1,431) lets you keep
food warm like the pros. The electric warming drawer comes in 27-,
30- and 36-inch
</P>
<P>
   widths and features moisture control and temperature settings
from 90 to 250 degrees. You can warm plates, proof bread or serve
steaming soup. At Expo Design Center.

THE INCREDIBLE LIGHTNESS OF `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: for use Friday, Oct. 29 or thereafter)  
Our rating:   4 stars  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Operating on the principal that a movie cannot be too clever,
``Being John Malkovich'' is one smart, surreal cinematic wormhole.
</P>
<P>
   The feature directing debut of music-video whiz kid (and ``Three
Kings'' actor) Spike Jonze and the first produced screenplay by the
intricately minded Charlie Kaufman, the movie never lags in satiric
invention. It's a zonky examination of identity, artistry,
alienation and economics, among other not naturally funny subjects,
and it finds uproarious humor in the most unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich's head being the primary location. The sardonic,
fussy actor proves himself a surprisingly good sport and a
marvelous farceur as the unwilling host of this ripping
psycho-fantasy. As John Horatio Malkovich, an actor everybody
vaguely recognizes as the star of some jewel theft movie he never
made, he moves from mild bemusement to simmering outrage to
full-bore schizophrenia with unerring control and deadpan wit. He
even does a good John Cusack; it's the bravura performance of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But how does Mr. M come to this sorry state? We will do our best
to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack plays the woebegone Craig Schwartz, an artist cursed with
a puppeteer's skills. He performs existential marionette plays
alone in his basement workroom, and his street-corner renditions of
the Heloise and Abelard tragedy endear him to neither passing kids
nor their parents.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Craig's marriage to pet store operator
Lotte (Cameron Diaz, like Cusack almost unrecognizable under a
mountain range of bad hair) has become so rote that their apartment
has become a happier home for sick animals than for either of the
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Craig takes a real job, sort of, at a filing company on the
``seventh-and-a-half floor'' of a Manhattan office building. Being
just half a floor, about 5-foot-3 in height, all the schlubs who
work there have to stoop when walking _ a brilliant visualization
of dead-end job despair.
</P>
<P>
   To make conditions even more uncomfortable, Craig is instantly
smitten with an utterly uninterested co-worker, Maxine (Catherine
Keener, shrewdly refining the heartless witch she played in ``Your
Friends and Neighbors'' into an amusingly callous narcissist).
</P>
<P>
   In these cramped conditions, Craig discovers a hidden door. It
leads to a tunnel that ends, approximately, behind Malkovich's
cornea. For 15-minute intervals, visitors can experience whatever
John is doing at the time; they are then unceremoniously dumped
beside the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Lotte tries it and immediately decides that she's a transsexual.
Maxine, who sets up an after-hours business with Craig selling
Malkovich rides for $200 a pop, gets very intrigued by the idea of
making love to John while Lotte's inside him. A jealous Craig plots
a devious use of his puppet-mastery to win his heart's desire.
</P>
<P>
   Then things start to get weird.
</P>
<P>
   Jonze hits a remarkably effective tone early on, a kind of
grungy, kitchen-sink realism laced with extreme psychology and a
mild, ``Twilight Zone'' undercurrent and sustains it through
increasingly freakier complications. Incomparable wit comes in many
forms, among them the best surprise cameo of the year, the
flashback of a traumatized chimp and, when the actor catches on to
what's being done to him and insists on going through the door
himself, the ultimate John Malkovich experience.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably for a movie with so many shifting perspectives and
fantasy elements, ``BJM'' remains narratively coherent no matter
how strange it gets. Just as astonishing for such a jokey, playful
piece, the film boasts genuine emotional insight and affection for
its screwed-up characters. You'll never laugh as hard at the idea
of identity appropriation as you will at ``Being John Malkovich.''
You may never consider it as seriously, either. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Six innovators will be lugging weighty chunks of the
here-and-now home as the latest winners of the Daimler Chrysler
Design Awards. The awards, menu-shaped slabs of cast tombasil, an
alloy similar to white bronze, weighing in at more than 15 pounds,
will be presented in a ceremony Thursday night at the Four Seasons
restaurant in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This years winners are John Maeda, a digital artist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory; Karim
Rashid, an industrial designer who gave trash receptacles unsought
sex appeal with his plastic Garbo wastepaper basket; Peter Girardi,
founder of Funny Garbage, a digital design production company;
Pablo Ferro, a film maker of title sequences, among them the
fractured face of Steve McQueen in the original ``Thomas Crown
Affair'' and the credits in the more recent ``L.A. Confidential;''

   The Daimler Chrysler Design Awards, presided over by Chee
Pearlman, editor in chief of I.D. Magazine, and Leslie Gill, an
architect, was created six years ago to recognize what Ms. Pearlman
described as ``problem-solvers on a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The prize, which comes with $10,000, is both prestigious and
idiosyncratic, honoring a melange of the well-known and the obscure
and unsung. Frank Gehry and the designers of the popular iMac
computer have been recipients, as have Philip Zimmermann, a master
cryptographer and creator of a popular standard for encoding
e-mail, and the engineering team for the Mars Pathfinder, which
invented the air bags that broke the fall of the Mars probe as it
rammed the red planet.

   The weighty new trophy was designed by Todd Williams and Bille
Tsien, Manhattan architects and honorees in 1998. They chose
tombasil, which is used in the fabrication of fire hose nozzles,
ship propellers and inlaid tomb inscriptions (thus the name),
because, Williams said, it's ``strong and malleable, cool and
modern, but also warm and traditional.'' Tombasil also happens to
be the material the architects selected as cladding for the new
Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan, for which ground was
broken just last month. Williams said, ``We designed the award so
that people could use it as a trophy, a bookend or an ingot of
metal to be melted down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they manage to muscle it home.

   Q: Three years ago, I visited a relative in Ketchum, Idaho, and
enjoyed Cock 'n Bull ginger beer. When I returned to Atlanta, I
tried to locate it. No luck. Help! This is the best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anthony C. Murphy, Alpharetta (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: This is not a cock-and-bull story. The aforementioned,
non-alcoholic ginger beer contains triple the amount of ginger than
that of ginger ale, according to Daniel J. Meyers, majority owner
of C-B Beverage Corp. in Minnesota. ``That's what gives it the
extra zing,'' says Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   While once available nationally, the product is now only on the
West Coast. However, Meyers plans to once again roll out the beer
to other parts of the country, when he can find distributors. Until
then, you must rely on Western friends to mail you a four-pack of
12-ounce bottles, which ranges from $2.99 to $3.99. If you're
interested in this ginger beer, write to: C-B Beverage Corp., P.O.
Box 49, Hopkins, MN 55343. The company will keep your name on file
and contact you when it becomes available in your area.
</P>
<P>
   Originally this ginger beer was served at the now closed Cock 'n
Bull Pub in Hollywood, Calif. It was, and still is, used as a mixer
for making a Moscow Mule _ a jigger of vodka, juice of half a lime,
ice cubes and ginger beer _ and giving the drinker quite a kick.
Today, Meyers says sales are primarily to those who enjoy a soft
drink with extra ginger.

DEAL REACHED ON DISMANTLING NATION'S FIRST COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR POWER
PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE GENIELLA   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ After 20 years of regulatory wrangling,
California's Public Utilities Commission has set the stage for
early dismantling of the nation's first commercial nuclear power
plant.
</P>
<P>
   In what is seen as a precedent-setting agreement for the
nation's nuclear power industry, the commission next month is
expected to formally authorize Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to
spend $7 million of ratepayers' money in return for the utility's
commitment to begin decommissioning the Humboldt Bay plant,
possibly as early as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1963, the Humboldt plant was shut down 23 years ago,
after an earthquake fault was discovered running beneath it. The
region surrounding Humboldt Bay is considered to be among the
nation's most quake-prone.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, state and federal regulators, PG&AMP;E representatives
and spokesmen for a Humboldt citizens group that waged a two-decade
battle to get the plant shut down and removed agreed that the
utility commission's deal paves the way for early decommissioning
of all aging commercial nuclear power plants across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humboldt Bay will be the first nuclear power plant to be fully
dismantled in the United States,'' said Scott Fielder, an attorney
for the Redwood Alliance, the Humboldt citizens' group. Fielder
said the temporary storage technology PG&AMP;E plans to use at Humboldt
Bay will serve as a model for other power plant operators facing
similar dismantlings.
</P>
<P>
   Alec Arago, a PG&AMP;E spokesman, said the company can now move
ahead to secure a federal license to temporarily store spent
nuclear fuel at the Humboldt Bay plant site in concrete ``dry
casks'' until the federal government constructs a long-sought
national repository for all nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood Alliance was credited by an administrative law judge for
the PUC with breaking a stalemate between PG&AMP;E and state
authorities who had held up the company's plans. The state refused
to agree to spend ratepayers' money unless PG&AMP;E committed to early
dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E agreed to the state demand, after Redwood Alliance showed
how the utility could save at least $47 million in annual
inspection costs if it dismantled the Humboldt Bay plant 10 years
earlier than originally planned, according to the PUC decision
released Tuesday.

GET READY FOR RED

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the year of the scarlet woman.
</P>
<P>
   Once scorned, she's now leading the fashion parade into the next
millennium. But we're talking clothes, not professions, and whether
it's rose, ruby or rouge, tomato or vermillion, red is red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history, red has signaled excitement, dynamism,
danger and sex. Red is intense, passionate, dramatic, energetic,
aggressive and daring. It is the second most powerful color,
following black,'' says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the
Pantone Color Institute and author of ``Colors for Your Every
Mood'' (Capitol Books; $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Eiseman, a former San Fernando Valley resident who now works for
the New Jersey-based Pantone company, studies the psychological and
physiological aspects of color and predicts color trends for 100
countries around the world. She says she knows why we're seeing red
this fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last holiday season of the century and there's a
spirit of excitement. And red says it better than any other
color,'' Eiseman said. ``It's energetic, but also smacks of
nostalgia, taking us back to a time when we always wore red for the
winter holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the historical significance of red. In ancient
times, red dye came from the Far East and was therefore expensive.
It was the color of kings and religious royalty and thought to be
the color of life and energy in the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have even shown, says Eiseman, that brain function, as
measured by electrical responses, is more affected by red than any
other color of equal intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Justina Vail, star of TV sci-fi adventure ``Seven Days,'' (8
p.m. Wednesdays on UPN), hasn't done any scientific studies on the
color, but she knows red turns heads.
</P>
<P>
   The auburn-haired actress who lives in Los Angeles and
Vancouver, says her favorite color used to be olive green until she
wore a red gown to an awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I got so much attention,'' she said
with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   But she says it took a lot of nerve to wear it. ``It's very
sexy, and you have to have confidence to wear it ... even to wear
red lipstick,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast designer Calvin Klein says fire red is his signature
color this year, worn layered over other brights or played against
neutrals; while Bill Blass claims women want colors such as
bittersweet orange to spike up their colorless wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West Coast designers such as Max Azria for BCBG have
cooled down their reds with a blue base and described sweaters,
skirts, shoes and coats as ruby, garnet and vermillion. And it's
the same color story at other local design houses, including ABS,
Laundry, Guess? and XOXO.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eiseman, blue-toned reds are more sophisticated and
elegant, while yellow-based reds are considered more immature,
energetic and sexy, which is why they go so well with animal print
fabric (a favorite combo of locals Eduardo Lucero and William B.).
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why career consultants advise against wearing
red to job interviews. &QL;

 &HT;    TWO-THIRDS OF SCHOOLS, COLLEGES NOW Y2K COMPLIANT
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the nation's school districts and
colleges said their key computer systems are Y2K compliant in a
study conducted this month, the Department of Education reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department called the figures ``significant progress'' from
the summer, when only 28 percent of school districts and 30 percent
of postsecondary institutions said all their mission critical
systems were fully compliant.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is troubling that more than one-third of school
districts and colleges are not yet compliant, said John Koskinen,
chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern at this point for schools without Y2K-compliant
systems is that their margin of error is extremely slim at this
point, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the delays vary, said Marshall Smith, deputy
secretary of education, at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities focused first on health and safety issues,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts may have been on the second tier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the delays might be attributed to the
tendency of school districts and college administrators to view Y2K
compliance as an information technology issue, not something
requiring their immediate attention, Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken them a long time to understand how much they rely
on information technology,'' Koskinen said, adding that school bus
pick-ups are often controlled by computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education has encouraged schools to
incorporate Y2K readiness into classwork with an activity that
allows students to pinpoint areas in their schools that might
require updating, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it's a local issue,'' Smith said. ``We're prepared
to support that effort as we roll 65 days into the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men emphasized that since Jan. 1 falls on a Saturday,
schools have three days to make sure their systems, particularly
the ones controlling heat, fire alarms and security, are
functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those three days, if well spent, can save us and parents a lot
of grief. Schools need to keep working up through the first because
it's the first, second and third of January,'' Smith said. ``Those
will be the most critical days.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to start, said Dave Alston, a spokesman for
the General Accounting Office, which commissioned a survey for the
Senate Committee of the Year 2000 Technology Problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually you have to get these systems in order,'' Alston
said.

A SHOW OF SALTO'S SCARY DEMONIC POTTERY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Denmark, Sweden, France)   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's rare that pottery can give you a good scare, but
Axel Salto's does. You think twice about touching it. It gives you
goose bumps; it looks like goose bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Salto, a Danish ceramist and painter born in 1889, maintained a
studio and also worked for Royal Copenhagen from 1934 until his
death in 1961. He produced a body of work that didn't take those
words lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vase is like a living organism,'' he wrote in a 1949 book,
``The Sprouting Style.'' ``The body buds, the buds develop, and a
sprouting _ even prickly _ vessel results.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceramics and the drawings from which they were manufactured
are the focus of a small show, ``Forces of Nature,'' opening
Thursday at Antik, a modern design gallery in TriBeCa, organized
with Salto's youngest daughter, Naja, and Jorgen Dalgaard, a Danish
dealer. The show runs through Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Salto was inspired by nature, to say the least. Since the world
of living things has produced its own monstrosities, why not
investigate that too? ``Strangely, no one is really comfortable
with such perilous and eruptive shapes,'' he wrote. The artist
himself called them demonic, ``the devil's own vase.''
</P>
<P>
   At their most nightmarish, the ceramics look like those science
fiction spaceship interiors that turn out to be the stomach of the
thing chasing you. Pictured in the book is a vase that could be a
toad swallowing the flowers it is meant to be displaying. At their
most austere, the pieces look like Karl Blossfeldt's early
20th-century photographic botanical studies: portraits of growth
arrested in form. At their friendliest, they look like Maurice
Sendak characters: the horned gremlins and thorned fears that dance
while you sleep, protected by childhood. Salto was also an author
of children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Antik's owners, Juliet Burrows and Kim Hostler, have been
assembling the group of 40 vases and 20 drawings for two years.
``We started thinking more about Salto as an artist,'' Ms. Burrows
said. ``He was a tortured soul. You can see it in the work, in its
progression _ from fluting which is decorative to budding to spikes
and viscera.'' Salto lost both his sons; his first, Adam, died a
prisoner in World War II; his second, Axel, was institutionalized
as a schizophrenic for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Salto comes at a time when interest in modern
Scandinavian art ceramics, exceptionally strong of late, may be
turning a corner, from the pure Asiatic shapes and glazes _ of
Swedish ceramists like Berndt Friberg and the companies like
Gustavsberg that produced him _ to more idiosyncratic, sculptural
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I think there is a slow, building momentum for a
return to complexity and richness and detail,'' said David
McFadden, senior curator of the American Craft Museum. As curator
of decorative arts at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum,
McFadden organized ``Scandinavian Modern Design: 1880 to 1980,'' a
1982 exhibition that restored interest to a subject that had been
out of fashion since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scandinavians have used glaze, color and texture in a way
that makes the pieces particularly tactile, very sensual,''
McFadden said. ``Especially Salto, with his warts and bumps and
running glaze that he liked so much. They're almost baroque _ full
of life and movement, with a muscular energy to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Royal Copenhagen, much of the artist's most expressive
ceramics were built like sculpture, not thrown like pots. Salto
modeled the originals for molds for production, then signed and
dated the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't throw on a wheel; he hand-built,'' Ms. Burrows said.
``Some pots were formed from within: he put his hands in and pushed
out. It's a different approach from throwing beautiful decorative
curved forms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swedes' approach to work was craftsmanlike _ Berndt
Friberg went to the studio every day and threw pots. Some of
Salto's vases don't even work as vases.''
</P>
<P>
   The distended cylinders were embellished with a variety of
anatomical surface relief like knuckles or tendrils, then glazed.
</P>
<P>
   Though standard Royal Copenhagen glazes were used, Salto's real
innovation appeared in the firing, when the pronounced ceramic
shapes forced glazes into irregular rivulets and pools. Protrusions
left parts of the pot raw; as the glaze ran thick or thin, it
changed color. Salto spoke of the ``boniness'' of the form and the
``fattiness'' of the glaze. The finished, fired pieces look as if
they were pushing at their own skin.
</P>
<P>
   As a young artist of 27, Salto traveled to Paris, where he met
Picasso and Matisse. In 1925, he was awarded a silver medal at the
Paris World Exhibition. In 1951, he won the Grand Prix at the Milan
Triennial. As he wrote in ``The Sprouting Style,'' his intention
was to put ceramics ``on a level with the great art forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Salto's ambitions have produced prices that can be scary, too.
The Antik show's pieces range from $600 to $26,000. They represent
a hard push on the modernism market's part to turn the higher end
of the decorative arts into a fine art commodity. Ms. Hostler said
that Salto's most serious collectors have tended to be established
ceramics collectors interested in potters like George Ohr and now
pursuing newer names.
</P>
<P>
   The artist himself was not without his doubts, writing that the
work ``approached the tasteless,'' where, however, he was quick to
observe, ``much of the best is to be found.''

   What do Hollywood producers know about single motherhood?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, if you've been watching ``Once and Again'' on
Tuesday nights is, apparently, very little. In case you've missed
the show, the ABC drama stars the extremely sexy and well-eyebrowed
Sela Ward, whose character is newly separated and has two lovely
children. In the car-pool line at school one day, she sees an
incredibly dishy man dropping off his progeny. What fortune! He's
divorced! The two happy Beautiful People _ free from any personal
issues or anxieties _ begin the coupling process with a series of
nail-biter situations that dare to ask such deep questions as,
``Should I call him back if he calls me?'' and ``Will he notice my
cellulite when we're nuzzled in my fresh, white 350-count cotton
percales?''
</P>
<P>
   The big drama moments come when Sela's ex-husband stops by to
kiss her on the forehead and tell her he ``just wants her to be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, pleeeeease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the show's co-producer, Marshall Herskovitz, is divorced
himself (says my reliable-source sister, who lived down the road
from his ex-wife in Santa Monica), but perhaps life in LaLa Land
has made him immune to real-world problems that obviously lie
outside the province of the Beautiful People.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of a) helping the lovely Sela keep her day job
and b) retaining my personal commitment to Tuesday-night
television, I hereby humbly offer Herskovitz a sampling of
situations from this past week in my own life as a real single
mother. Note that it's a hybrid lifestyle that involves Issues of
the Married (even though, technically, I no longer am), the Rampant
Anxieties of the Single Female and a whole host of new experiences
peculiar to the Single, with Children.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Herskovitz, feel free to pluck any or all of these poignant
snapshots for your show.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese restaurant on a Thursday night: Nice white tablecloths.
Kids are on best behavior. Feel good about life. Tell kids that
their dad has decided to go to Scotland for a Halloween party so
they'll spend that whole weekend with me _ won't that be fun? Kids
seem unaffected. Kindergarten daughter puts egg roll down. ``Any
other news from `Dad'? '' she asks, forming her fingers into
sarcastic little quote marks as she says the word Dad. Wonder for
the 35th time why ``Dad'' took a then-5-year-old to see ``Austin
Powers,'' where she learned this Dr. Evil mannerism. Wonder if
daughter has deeper issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatrician's office on a Friday night: Here for my daughter's
6-year-old checkup. Nine-year-old son, in full football pads having
just come from practice, smells like a goat. He's jumping up and
down behind the doctor's back and glaring at me. Doctor leaves the
room for moment and son rushes over. ``Mom, I can't believe you.
Fix your shirt. The doctor can see your bra.'' Classic example of
being Single, with Overprotective Children.
</P>
<P>
   Son's Saturday morning football game: Ex-brother- and
sister-in-law (does this make them ``outlaws?'') arrive. Haven't
talked to them since separation, 2 1/2 years ago. Ignore their
attempts to ignore me and bridge the 3 yards between us. Try to
keep forced smile despite their far-right, self-righteous comments.
Must maintain harmony. Might as well be Married.
</P>
<P>
   Single anxiety on Saturday night: Reading ``Bridget Jones'
Diary,'' the hilarious novel about neurotic 30-ish London woman who
is single. I'm at home. Alone. Have fever of 100.5. Think Bridget
is lucky: At least she's exchanging lively, flirtatious e-mails
with her boss. Envy her full life.
</P>
<P>
   Single anxiety on Sunday afternoon: Boyfriend from 1998 leaves
message while I'm at Garden Ridge, buying 100 tea candles. He's
returning my call, returning his call. Yes, he's had a great
birthday weekend. It's super to be 27. He's on his way to his
mother's, but I sounded sick on my message. Can he bring me some
soup? Decide to pretend I didn't get message. Wonder what I was
thinking in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well be married on a Sunday night: Ex-husband calls to
say he has to go out of town for business tomorrow. He'll be gone
for a couple of days. Was supposed to have kids until Wednesday.
Can I take them? (Do I have choice?) Have no one to pick up kids
from after-school program for these days, so I'll have to leave
work early. It's the week before my yearly evaluation, but surely,
this will all be OK, right? Have flashback to pre-divorce days when
ex actually said his job was more important than mine. Wonder how
things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Might as well be married again on Monday: Get mysterious letter
from IRS in mail. Says back taxes are due, from when married,
filing separately. Call ex on cell phone. He says, ``Don't worry,
it's all taken care of.'' Feel dependent. Feel helpless. Feel
married.
</P>
<P>
   Sickly single on a Wednesday: Drink too much with girlfriend
after work. Try calling most recent ex-boyfriend on cell phone. No
answer. Realize he's probably out with new girlfriend, getting on
with life, being happy. Feel sad. Console self that this is for the
best because tomorrow night is Taste of the World PTA meeting at
the elementary school and need to bring apple pie. It's 11:30.
Drive to Tom Thumb and buy $3.99 pie, along with two six-packs of
Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Single parent pressures in the a.m.: Wake up early Thursday.
Feel great! On highway to work by 8:11. Going to be early! Will
make fabulous impression for week of annual evaluation! Cell phone
rings. Ex-husband says he forgot to tell me that last night in
daughter's take-home folder there was a note saying to bring pies
to school in the morning, rather than the evening. Turn around. Go
home. Get pie. Drive to school. Go to daughter's classroom. Get
caught in the Pledge of Allegiance part of the proceedings. Feel
embarrassed that I don't know the Texas pledge and have to fake it.
Daughter gives me a big hug. Feel great again. On highway by 8:30.
Late for work. .MDRV/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

BRIMMING WITH ANSWERS ABOUT HAT ETIQUETTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I'm a teacher and want to give a good reason for students to
remove hats when coming into school. What's the story behind this
rule of etiquette for men? _ S.M., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The tradition is credited to King John of England, who
ruled from 1199 to 1216 and is better known for agreeing to the
Magna Carta. ``Kings expected people around them to show respect by
uncovering their heads when the monarch was in their midst,'' said
Jean Mitchell, a hat historian and owner of the Hattitudes shop in
Essex, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The general rule has been that men should remove their hats when
indoors and women should keep them on unless the hat is considered
male attire _ such as a baseball cap. Today, many people at
weddings and other formal occasions keep their hats on, Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With today's gender equality, some of those rules are becoming
passe,'' she said. ``People wear western hats and baseball caps and
leave them on all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   To ask Mitchell a question about hat etiquette, call Hattitudes
at (860) 767-0775 or visit the Web site www.hattitudes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I find a Morris Minor club in the area? _
L.C., Fort Worth, texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ There doesn't appear to be a club in Fort Worth-Dallas,
but you can find 750 North American owners and enthusiasts of the
British car in the Morris Minor Registry.
</P>
<P>
   The club publishes a bimonthly newsletter with tips, meet
reports and other features. Membership dues are $20 per year.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, write to Morris Minor Registry, 318
Hampton Park, Westerville, OH 43081-5723, or visit the Web site
hometown.aol.com/morrisminr/page.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Minor, which is sometimes confused with a Volkswagen
Beetle, was billed as the ``world's supreme small car'' at its
launch. More than 1.6 million were produced from 1948 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Minor Owners Club, a British group, publishes an
extensive Web site at www.morrisminoroc.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I know that the Walt Disney movie ``The Love Bug'' had
several sequels. What were they, and when did they come out? _
K.R.P., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ There were three sequels to the 1969 film ``The Love
Bug:'' ``Herbie Rides Again'' in 1974, ``Herbie Goes to Monte
Carlo'' in 1977 and ``Herbie Goes Bananas'' in 1980. All four are
available on video from Disney.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a 1982 TV series called ``Herbie, the Love Bug''
and a 1997 made-for-TV remake of the original movie titled ``The
Love Bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Jones portrayed driver Jim Douglas in four of those
projects: both ``Love Bug'' movies, the TV series and ``Monte
Carlo.''  &QL;

   ``Assassins''
</P>
<P>
   by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Tyndale Press, $22.99
</P>
<P>
   You know that trite saying about books, ``It was so good I
couldn't put it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Think the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins,'' by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, was so bad I
couldn't keep picking it back up. It literally sat on my coffee
table half-read while I thumbed through cheesy magazines and
flipped on the television.
</P>
<P>
   This book caused a rabid reader to avoid her favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   When I first began to read ``Assassins'' I realized that,
although its Christian message is sincere, its style is stale. It
seems as if Jenkins and LaHaye were fearful that writing with
pizazz might upset God.
</P>
<P>
   The book's eschatological plot centers on Revelation and a group
of newly converted Christians who are struggling to live under New
Babylon, a regime that wants to kill all Christians. If you've read
Revelation, you pretty much know what to expect. The authors' only
challenge was creating characters to carry the plot.
</P>
<P>
   After the 100-page mark, I began to like the characters and the
style used to describe the last days of the world before Jesus
Christ comes again. But my feeling of warmth for the book was
similar to the feeling I get watching a soap opera: I had invested
myself in getting to know the characters, so I wanted to know what
would happen to them in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins'' is the sixth installment of 12 books in the Left
Behind series planned by Jenkins and LaHaye. It ranked No. 3 on the
hardcover Christian bestseller list last month, and it also ranked
No. 4 among fiction bestsellers on the Amazon.com list.
</P>
<P>
   For the life of me, I cannot figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   The book is entertaining, but not well-written. The dialogue can
be confusing. At times, I didn't even know who said what.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the poor transitions in dialogue, a 12-year-old could
read this series. Oh, but that would override the need for the
publishers to print a ``Left Behind: The Kids'' series for children
10 to 14, which they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the previous installments in the series _ which also hit
the bestseller lists _ are carrying this one by reputation. I
haven't read the previous books. Evidently, those books introduce
the Antichrist and describe the chaos that occurs when Christians
begin disappearing, as Revelation says they will when the end is
near.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I did respect about ``Assassins'' is that it didn't
assume I had read the previous books. At the beginning, there is an
easy guide to the characters, listing their names and backgrounds.
My favorite characters are Tsion Ben-Judah, a Christian convert in
his late 40s who works as the prophet to thousands of underground
Christians. He posts daily messages about the events of the future
on the Internet. I also found myself liking one of the ``enemies,''
as Jenkins and LaHaye call them. Leon Fortunato was a more
believable character than some of the other polished Christians. He
made mistakes, as real people do. And his facial expressions were
often described in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and LaHaye seem to hold the other characters back by
making them two-dimensional, black and white. The Christians are
flawless believers and the enemies are flawlessly evil, according
to the authors.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't forget to mention Rayford Steele, the former 747
captain for PanContinental who is the focus of this installment. I
didn't like him, and maybe that's why I didn't like the book. After
about 150 pages, I tired of Steele's all-too-predictable thoughts
and mood swings. He was a Christian who doubted his role as the
head of a safe house concealing other Christians. He obsessed about
killing Nicolae Carpathia, the ruler of New Babylon, the man
Christians believe to be the Antichrist. The reader knows this much
about Steele in the first 50 pages. But the book keeps returning to
it for the full 413 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this book drags because of the publisher's decision to
extend the series. Tyndale, a Christian publishing company, had
originally slated ``Left Behind'' as a six-book series. As the
first titles began to fly off the racks, Tyndale obviously saw the
advantages of adding more books.
</P>
<P>
   I believed I would like this book. I wanted to like this book. I
wanted Jenkins and LaHaye to be the next Frank Peritti, who is one
of few other authors who have crossed over from Christian to
secular bestseller lists. Peritti's ``This Present Darkness'' made
me think that Satan had spirits roaming the Earth influencing
people. Peritti's writing was fast and exciting. He made me believe
that Satan was imperfect and God would win the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and LaHaye fail in comparison.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the year of the scarlet woman.
</P>
<P>
   Once scorned, she's now leading the fashion parade into the next
millennium. But we're talking clothes, not professions, and whether
it's rose, ruby or rouge, tomato or vermillion, red is red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history, red has signaled excitement, dynamism,
danger and sex. Red is intense, passionate, dramatic, energetic,
aggressive and daring. It is the second most powerful color,
following black,'' says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the
Pantone Color Institute and author of ``Colors for Your Every
Mood'' (Capitol Books; $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Eiseman, a former San Fernando Valley resident who now works for
the New Jersey-based Pantone company, studies the psychological and
physiological aspects of color and predicts color trends for 100
countries around the world. She says she knows why we're seeing red
this fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last holiday season of the century and there's a
spirit of excitement. And red says it better than any other
color,'' Eiseman said. ``It's energetic, but also smacks of
nostalgia, taking us back to a time when we always wore red for the
winter holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the historical significance of red. In ancient
times, red dye came from the Far East and was therefore expensive.
It was the color of kings and religious royalty and thought to be
the color of life and energy in the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have even shown, says Eiseman, that brain function, as
measured by electrical responses, is more affected by red than any
other color of equal intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Justina Vail, star of TV sci-fi adventure ``Seven Days,'' (8
p.m. Wednesdays on UPN), hasn't done any scientific studies on the
color, but she knows red turns heads.
</P>
<P>
   The auburn-haired actress who lives in Los Angeles and
Vancouver, says her favorite color used to be olive green until she
wore a red gown to an awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I got so much attention,'' she said
with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   But she says it took a lot of nerve to wear it. ``It's very
sexy, and you have to have confidence to wear it ... even to wear
red lipstick,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast designer Calvin Klein says fire red is his signature
color this year, worn layered over other brights or played against
neutrals; while Bill Blass claims women want colors such as
bittersweet orange to spike up their colorless wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West Coast designers such as Max Azria for BCBG have
cooled down their reds with a blue base and described sweaters,
skirts, shoes and coats as ruby, garnet and vermillion. And it's
the same color story at other local design houses, including ABS,
Laundry, Guess? and XOXO.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eiseman, blue-toned reds are more sophisticated and
elegant, while yellow-based reds are considered more immature,
energetic and sexy, which is why they go so well with animal print
fabric (a favorite combo of locals Eduardo Lucero and William B.).
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why career consultants advise against wearing
red to job interviews. &QL;

NEW PROCEDURE STRAIGHTENS SPINE WITH LESS TRAUMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long gone are the days when patients spent a year lying flat on
their backs in full-body casts to correct severe spinal curvature.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, are the casts and braces of 20 years ago that
immobilized patients for up to four months after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a few cases, gone are the long surgical incisions that
have been necessary to insert rods and hooks and screws to
straighten the spine without a cast since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cox, 11, has four tiny scars that mark where surgeons
at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children implanted a 6-inch
titanium rod and seven screws to straighten her nearly 50-degree
spinal curve in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has four little nicks, basically _ and a much straighter
spine,'' says Steve Richards, orthopedic surgeon and assistant
chief of staff at Scottish Rite, in Dallas. Richards led the
orthopedic surgeons who made four smaller-than-1-inch incisions to
insert the tiny camera and all the tools necessary to fuse the
spine and properly place and tighten the rod.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional surgery involves attaching two metal rods and
multiple hooks to the spine through a 12- to 14-inch incision down
the middle of the back.
</P>
<P>
   For younger children with a lot of growth ahead, such as
Jennifer, it is also necessary to fuse the front part of the spine
to prevent twisting and deformity. That requires an additional 4-
to 5-inch incision in the chest and the removal of several spinal
discs and a rib.
</P>
<P>
   Thoracoscopic anterior spinal instrumentation and fusion, as the
new procedure is known, requires one rod installed through four
keyhole incisions.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure was developed in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just ecstatic that Jenny's surgery could be done this
way, without a major incision,'' says Bethany Cox, Jennifer's
mother. ``She was up walking around in two days, and is back in
school full time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny, who lives in Wichita Falls, says it was ``a little
scary'' being the first to have the new procedure in the Metroplex.
</P>
<P>
   She tires easily and can't take phys ed yet, and she is wearing
a protective plastic jacket for the first few months, except when
she showers or goes to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is not supposed to lift more than 5 pounds for a few
months, her sixth-grade teachers have provided an extra set of
books so she can keep one at home and carry only notebooks back and
forth to school. She is more concerned that she can't pick up her
cat for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   After six months, she will be free to do anything she wants _
except play on a trampoline, her mother says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once her spine has healed, she will have no restrictions, no
limitations,'' Richards says. ``If she wished to participate in
gymnastics, she could give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer's mother first noticed the crook in her daughter's
spine seven years ago, when the child was 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see a curve already then, and her right shoulder was
higher than her left,'' recalls Bethany Cox. ``Her right scapula
(shoulder blade) winged out in back, and when she was sitting she
had a pronounced rib hump. She started curving so young, I knew
something was terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors began talking about the need for surgery when Jennifer
was 6, but the family was hoping to put it off until she was 13 or
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put her in a brace 2 1/2 years ago, but then last year,
it started getting worse real fast. In five months, her curvature
went from 40 to almost 50 degrees, and we knew it was going to get
worse, so we opted to do surgery now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer has idiopathic scoliosis, meaning the cause is unknown.
But orthopedic surgeons at Scottish Rite also treat children who
have scoliosis caused by birth defects, spina bifida, cerebral
palsy and muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   About four of every 1,000 children develop scoliosis that is
severe enough to require treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are numerous reasons for it. I estimate we do 250 to 300
spine surgeries to correct scoliosis each year,'' Richards says.
``Scoliosis treatment is our most visible specialty to the
community. We have seven orthopedic surgeons on staff, working for
the hospital. Patients come from all over Texas. There is no
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards went to California to learn more about the new spinal
surgery after Jennifer's mom found some information about it on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea he was going to do that. I was amazed. He was
curious, but it was new, and he had to be convinced it would
work,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopes are not new to orthopedic surgery, but spinal
surgery is a new application, Richards says. One of the first
procedures to be done routinely through a scope was knee surgery,
to trim bulging and torn cartilage from damaged knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very uncommon now to open a knee,'' the doctor says.
</P>
<P>
   However, the traditional surgery for scoliosis works so well, he
says, he was hesitant about switching.
</P>
<P>
   After trying thoracoscopic anterior spinal instrumentation and
fusion on Jenny, he says: ``I would use it again. I sure would.
Recovery is quicker because the incisions are so much less
invasive... and from a cosmetic viewpoint, there is no contest.''

<P>
   When Elizabeth Dole quit the presidential race last week, our
response was, ``Oh, yeah; she was in the presidential race, wasn't

 &HT;    PROPOSAL WOULD GIVE LEGAL STATUS TO SOME ILLEGAL FARMWORKERS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With growers nationwide facing a shortage of legal
farmworkers, a group of bipartisan lawmakers unveiled a plan
Wednesday to change the foreign guest farmworker program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the current system _ commonly known as the H2A
program for its provision in the law _ claim that it is too
cumbersome and takes too long for growers to be able to hire
foreign workers. The result, they say, is a flood of illegal
workers who often are taken advantage of and who live in constant
fear of being deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulation-ridden H2A program is an example of government
bureaucracy at its worst,'' said Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr., D-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., said the bill would give local
farmers the assurance of having legal workers so they ``don't have
to look over their shoulders to see if the INS'' (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) is coming into their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Farm worker advocates opposed similar efforts last year to
change the H2A program, arguing that the bill did not do enough to
protect workers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan _ which is expected to be introduced soon in both
houses of Congress _ would immediately grant temporary legal status
to an estimated 600,000 illegal farmworkers. Those workers could
gain permanent residency status if they continued to work in
agriculture for at least 150 days during the next five out of seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require growers to offer available jobs to
domestic farmworkers enrolled on a computerized database to be
maintained by the U.S. Department of Labor, which already has such
a system for non-farm employment.
</P>
<P>
   If no domestic workers were available, growers would then be
allowed to bring in foreign workers on a temporary basis under a
streamlined H2A guest worker program.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would receive at least the federal minimum wage,
employer-provided housing or a housing allotment, and
transportation if they are required to relocate more than 100
miles. Growers would be responsible for paying all these costs.
</P>
<P>
   Although a similar bill passed the Senate 68-31 last year, it
ran into strong opposition in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Wash., said the bill faces ``an uphill
fight.''

GET READY FOR RED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the year of the scarlet woman.
</P>
<P>
   Once scorned, she's now leading the fashion parade into the next
millennium. But we're talking clothes, not professions, and whether
it's rose, ruby or rouge, tomato or vermillion, red is red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout history, red has signaled excitement, dynamism,
danger and sex. Red is intense, passionate, dramatic, energetic,
aggressive and daring. It is the second most powerful color,
following black,'' says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the
Pantone Color Institute and author of ``Colors for Your Every
Mood'' (Capitol Books; $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   Eiseman, a former San Fernando Valley resident who now works for
the New Jersey-based Pantone company, studies the psychological and
physiological aspects of color and predicts color trends for 100
countries around the world. She says she knows why we're seeing red
this fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last holiday season of the century and there's a
spirit of excitement. And red says it better than any other
color,'' Eiseman said. ``It's energetic, but also smacks of
nostalgia, taking us back to a time when we always wore red for the
winter holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the historical significance of red. In ancient
times, red dye came from the Far East and was therefore expensive.
It was the color of kings and religious royalty and thought to be
the color of life and energy in the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have even shown, says Eiseman, that brain function, as
measured by electrical responses, is more affected by red than any
other color of equal intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Justina Vail, star of TV sci-fi adventure ``Seven Days,'' (8
p.m. Wednesdays on UPN), hasn't done any scientific studies on the
color, but she knows red turns heads.
</P>
<P>
   The auburn-haired actress who lives in Los Angeles and
Vancouver, says her favorite color used to be olive green until she
wore a red gown to an awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I got so much attention,'' she said
with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   But she says it took a lot of nerve to wear it. ``It's very
sexy, and you have to have confidence to wear it ... even to wear
red lipstick,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast designer Calvin Klein says fire red is his signature
color this year, worn layered over other brights or played against
neutrals; while Bill Blass claims women want colors such as
bittersweet orange to spike up their colorless wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, West Coast designers such as Max Azria for BCBG have
cooled down their reds with a blue base and described sweaters,
skirts, shoes and coats as ruby, garnet and vermillion. And it's
the same color story at other local design houses, including ABS,
Laundry, Guess? and XOXO.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eiseman, blue-toned reds are more sophisticated and
elegant, while yellow-based reds are considered more immature,
energetic and sexy, which is why they go so well with animal print
fabric (a favorite combo of locals Eduardo Lucero and William B.).
</P>
<P>
   It also explains why career consultants advise against wearing
red to job interviews. &QL;

 &HT;    6.700 ARMY TRAILERS USELESS BECAUSE THEY'RE UNSAFE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army spent $57 million for ``high mobility''
trailers that were supposed to be towed up to 20 miles per hour
cross-country or 55 miles per hour on highways.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 6,700 trailers are sitting in storage because the
Army has determined they are unsafe at any speed.
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentagon has not figured out how to fix the problem. One
necessary repair will cost taxpayers $4.2 million, but mechanical
experts are still stumped on other modifications that are needed,
said the U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are simple trailers,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who
had requested the study. ``If the Army couldn't properly manage
this contract, how can we expect them to handle high-tech missiles
and other weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The trailers were built to be towed by trucks known as High
Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, the 1990 version of the
Army jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Electrospace Systems Inc., of Richardson, Texas, now part of
Raytheon E-Systems, Inc., won the contract for the trucks but
subcontracted the manufacture to Silver Eagle Manufacturing Co., of
Portland, Ore. A spokeswoman for Raytheon Wednesday had no
immediate comment on the GAO findings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO report, the contractor was not held
responsible for repairing the trailers because the Army accepted
the design in 1996, despite the fact that the trailers damaged the
trucks towing them during testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program office did not believe the truck damage was a
major problem because only three of the trucks were damaged during
testing,'' the GAO said. Later, the Army found that the trailers
were not usable because the trailer drawbar could break,
disconnecting it from the truck and sometimes causing the trailer
to overturn.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, which plans to buy 18,000 additional trailers, is
considering starting from scratch on the design. However, the GAO
concluded that ``it is not clear yet if the Army plans to
demonstrate, prior to production, that the new design will meet its
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, in its response, concurred with the GAO
findings and said that, in the future, it would perform tests to
demonstrate that new trailers meet its standards without damaging
the trucks.

HATS OFF TO COWGIRL HALL OF FAMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Western movies were dominated by cowboys,
shaping the image of the Old West held by much of the world. But in
real life, cowgirls filled a big place in the western landscape.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, check the list of those in Fort Worth's National
Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame: Pioneering women from writer Laura
Ingalls Wilder to markswoman Phoebe Ann Moses Butler _ better known
as Annie Oakley _ have been inducted, as have an assortment of
artists, entertainers, tribal leaders, businesswomen and educators.
In honor of today's inductees, here are quick snapshots of their
claims to western fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha Kaepernik Blancett
</P>
<P>
   She has gone down in history as a champion bronc rider and trick
roper from back in the days when the West was still young.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Champion Lady Buckaroo,'' Bertha Kaepernik
Blancett rode her way through a 40-year career in rodeos, Wild West
shows and western films with Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who broke horses on her family's Colorado homestead,
began riding competitively at the 1904 Frontier Days Celebration in
Cheyenne, Wyo. She continued, evolving from bronc rider to the
``pickup'' who rescues fallen bronc riders, until she was nearly 60
years old.
</P>
<P>
   She was inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1975,
four years before her death.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Norton Jones
</P>
<P>
   This living legend breeds, trains and races quarter horses and
thoroughbreds from the ranch she owns with her husband, Ralls C.
``Punch'' Jones, in southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman she rode western and English styles, and she
rode in the international show circuit and in college rodeo. She
went on to win every major horse show in North America, from
Madison Square Garden to the Concurso Militar in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-H horse-handling school in Albuquerque is named in her
honor, a tribute to her decades of training young people in
handling horses. Several of her students and horses have appeared
on the U.S. Olympics equestrian team.
</P>
<P>
   This year, after seven decades as a horsewoman, she was inducted
into the American Quarterhorse Association Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Krone
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen her interviewed on Leno or Letterman a few
years back. Julie Krone retired this year as one of America's
leading jockeys, with more than 2,800 races under her saddle, and
$50 million in career purse earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Krone was the first female jockey to ride in the
Belmont Stakes and, in 1993, she became the first to win that leg
of the Triple Crown. She also was the first woman to compete in a
Breeders' Cup race.

<P>
   Always popular with the news media, she has been on the cover of
``Sports Illustrated,'' and when ABC named her a news person of the
week, CBS News turned around and named her one of five Women of the
Year in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Serpa
</P>
<P>
   This Manhattan native and Vassar College graduate is said to
have brought more positive exposure to the sport of rodeo than
anyone. She does it with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa left behind her East Coast upbringing and became the first
woman sanctioned by the Rodeo Cowboys Association to shoot inside
the rodeo arena, where the flying hooves and spurs can be dangerous
to anyone not savvy to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa started shooting junior rodeo as a way to pay bills in
Tucson, Ariz., in 1961. She parlayed that endeavor into a
photography career that has gained her entry into the Grand
National Steeplechase in England, the Dublin Horse Show in Ireland
and the Royal Easter Show in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary on her life, ``When the Dust Settles,'' was shown
nationally on PBS in 1994.

NEW BILL WOULD HELP VICTIMS COLLECT CASH FROM TERRORIST STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two senators introduced legislation Wednesday that
would reverse Clinton administration policy and allow victims of
foreign-sponsored terrorism to collect money from the country
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we make these country pay in some way for pain and
suffering that they have caused,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
told the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing on the
legislation. The other sponsor was Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal law empowers American victims of foreign
terrorist attacks and their families to sue the country responsible
in U.S. courts. Since then, U.S. courts have awarded damage
judgments in a number of cases against terrorist countries,
including Iran and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But the victims have been able to collect their judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Payment of the court judgments has been blocked by the Clinton
administration on the basis that such awards might provoke other
nations to retaliate against the United States and further
complicate relations with hostile governments.
</P>
<P>
   The legal ability of the administration to block collection
stems from a provision in the same law that allows the president to
stop payment of judgments against foreign countries if it is in the
U.S. national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed legislation, known as the ``Justice for
Victims of Terrorism Act,'' the frozen assets of any country could
be freed to satisfy U.S. court judgments in terrorism cases and the
president would not be able to block a successful plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``American citizens deserve the right to know that their
government stands with them when acts of terrorism are committed
against their families,'' Mack told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Clinton administration supported the idea that
U.S. families could sue terrorist nations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after a 1996 incident in which Cuban air force jets
shot down an airplane flown by unarmed members of a Cuban exile
group _ Brothers to the Rescue, the White House issued a statement
saying the president would ``request the Congress to pass
legislation authorizing payment of compensation to the families of
victims out of Cuba's blocked accounts in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism Act of
1996, which allowed victims to sue Cuba and other foreign nations
that supported acts of terrorism. Within a year, U.S. federal
courts had awarded $187.5 million to Brothers to the Rescue
families and $247.5 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, a
20-year-old American college student killed in a 1995
Iranian-backed bombing in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said the administration knew of the possible diplomatic and
financial complications when it supported the law in 1996.
President Clinton's later decision to block the award payments
amounts to an ``abandonment of his word and his support for the
families of victims,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Flatow, father of the slain college student, told the
committee that Clinton personally encouraged him to sue Iran after
his daughter was killed. ``I don't think I would have done it had
the president not called me and told me it could be done and that
it was the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two years, Flatow said, the Clinton
administration has ``done everything possible to stonewall my
family's case'' after the family won a judgment against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat defended the
administration's policy, arguing that the frozen assets of a
terrorist country can be a significant bargaining chip in
international relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, the only leverage we have with a rogue country is (its)
money in the United States,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that in some cases, such as Cuba and Iran, the
large number of potential lawsuits against the country would likely
result in damage awards far in excess of the amount of money that
the foreign nation has in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally thousands of Cubans who could win tens of
millions of dollars each,'' Eizenstat said. ``Cuba's frozen assets
in the United States aren't even close enough to the size needed to
pay those people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Several committee members, however, appeared skeptical that U.S.
national security would be harmed by unfreezing the assets of
terrorist countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, the United States doesn't have any
leverage with terrorist countries anyway, so why not hit them where
it hurts for once?'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said to
Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., said the president was ``putting the
interests of foreign countries over his own citizens.''

TEXAS NEED MORE MINORITY COLLEGE GRADUATES, PERRY SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Annual public college enrollment by Hispanics
must quadruple and for blacks it must grow at an even greater rate
by 2015 if Texas hopes to close the gap between minorities and
Anglos who get four-year degrees, a top education official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate of enrollment, it would take 100 years to
close the gap, Higher Education Commissioner Don Brown told a new
statewide special Commission on 21st Century Colleges and
Universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a longer period of time than we ought to wait,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Rick Perry appointed the commission of state senators
and education and business leaders to look at how Texas can meet
future training and employment needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an increasingly global economy, advances in
telecommunications and the incredible progress in high technology,
more and more jobs will require a college education,'' Perry told
the 16-member group at its maiden meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today in Texas only about 20 percent _ or 1 in 5 _ of our
citizens will earn undergraduate or graduate degrees. Unless we
encourage more of our citizens to pursue a college education,
whether it's at a four-year institution or at a community or
technical college, Texas will suffer from a growing education
gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic enrollment in Texas public colleges and universities
has increased, on average, by 2,100 per year, Brown said. To keep
pace with projected population growth and to close the gap with
Anglos, Texas must enroll 8,300 more Hispanics per year, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   For blacks, keeping pace with population trends will mean hiking
enrollment by 3,200 each year, compared to the current average
annual increase of only 400.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is particularly significant, several commission members
noted, given that population projections show ethnic minorities
will soon outnumber white residents in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will study population, enrollment and graduation
trends as well as other higher education issues as it develops
recommendations for the Legislature when it reconvenes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas merely maintains the current trends and does not
increase the numbers of Texans with college degrees, Brown said,
the state will face increased spending on prisons, welfare and
Medicaid because of a growing unskilled and undereducated
population unsuited for a technology-based workplace.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, encouraged the group
to look at where major universities are located, noting that there
are no professional programs _ such as medical, engineering and law
schools _ in heavily Hispanic South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the percentage of minorities attending college is
increasing, Brown added, minority enrollment is still far below
enrollment of white students, especially when it comes to getting
bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, according to Brown's figures, almost 8 percent of
Anglos ages 15 to 34 were enrolled in a Texas public university,
compared to fewer than 4 percent of Hispanics and 4.5 percent of
blacks in the same age group.
</P>
<P>
   And while 57 percent of Anglos enrolled in public universities
eventually got undergraduate degrees, only 27 percent of blacks and
34 percent of Hispanics did.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: About two years ago we had a fold-down stairway installed in
our hall ceiling so that we could get up into our unfinished attic
more easily for storing luggage and similar items.
</P>
<P>
   Now we notice that on cold, windy days we can feel a chilly
draft coming down from around the ceiling door or panel that covers
this ladder opening.
</P>
<P>
   We believe this is wasting fuel and would like to insulate the
opening. What do you think is the best way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to insulate such an attic opening is to build an
insulated plywood box that fits over the opening as shown here. The
box should be easily removable (it can be hinged or simply lifted
off when necessary).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lining the inside with rigid, foil-faced
insulation, the box should have weather-stripping installed around
the rim on all four edges so that it will form a reasonably air
tight seal when in place over the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I live in a rented house that is not air conditioned, so I
cannot install a regular whole-house attic fan to help cool it.
</P>
<P>
   I do not like (and cannot afford) a room air conditioner for
each of our bedrooms, but have been told that installing a large
window exhaust fan will work almost as well. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   A: A large window exhaust fan can serve to bring cool air into
one or two bedrooms, although it will not be as effective as a
whole house attic fan.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a fan will only help if turned on after the sun
goes down and outside temperatures drop lower than the indoor
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The fan will be most effective if installed in the window of a
room other than the one you are actually trying to cool.
</P>
<P>
   The fan draws hot air out from inside the house while
simultaneously pulling in cool air through one or two open windows
in the adjoining rooms _ or even in rooms on a different floor.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure that except for opening the windows in the bedroom you
are trying to cool, all other windows in the house are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our bathroom has plastic tile on the wall that was put up
years ago with some type of mastic adhesive. What can I do to
remove this tile so that I can paint or paper the walls?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use a wide flat scraper or chisel to pry off the tiles, then
use a scraper to remove as much of the mastic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If the walls are plaster you should be able to get most of the
mastic off by scraping and sanding, even if you have to use an
electric sander to get it all off.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the walls are gypsum board (drywall) then scraping
may be impossible without damaging the surface. In that case you
may have to replace the drywall _ or install another layer of
drywall on top of the existing layer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a water stain on the top of my beautiful wood desk.
What can I do to remove this stain and repair the original finish?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most water stains on varnish, lacquer or similar finishes
show up as a white mark or ring. This usually means that the stain
is in the finish only and has not penetrated deep enough to
actually be in the pores of the wood, so refinishing is not often
required.
</P>
<P>
   This type of stain can usually be removed by rubbing with a rag
that has been moistened with alcohol. If this doesn't work, try
using camphorated oil instead.
</P>
<P>
   If this still doesn't do the trick, try rubbing with a rag
dipped into toothpaste _ preferably one of the brands that
advertises it has extra ``whiteners'' in it (these actually contain
a very mild abrasive).
</P>
<P>
   Spread a little paste over the stain, then rub vigorously with a
piece of cloth wrapped around one finger. If this dulls the finish
you should be able to restore the luster by waxing or polishing.
</P>
<P>

   Protecting Garden Sculptures
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does one best protect statues in the garden from snow and
ice damage? Ours are cast cement with steel reinforcing rods and
will be left out all winter. Is it appropriate to wrap them in
burlap, lay them flat on the ground, leave standing or what?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ice has always been a problem because water expands as it
freezes, forcing tiny cracks apart and creating cracks where there
had been only small depressions.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, on the other hand, is a comparatively new hazard. It
wouldn't bother anything if it were pure, but these days, like
rain, it tends to be acid, and if it doesn't melt off quickly, it's
melting whatever it's sitting on.
</P>
<P>
   Though the damage is different, the key to prevention is the
same: keep your sculpture dry. Burlap is unwise; it will retain
moisture. And there's no point in laying the sculpture down unless
you fear high winds.
</P>
<P>
   At Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, N.Y.,
where the gardens are complemented by an extensive collection of
sculptures, caretakers take different approaches for different
materials. Bronzes are simply waxed to repel the elements, but
Cynthia Altman, the curator, said, ``We cover the marble with
Gore-Tex covers. It breathes and sheds moisture so nothing can
freeze and thaw.'' She added, ``With a metal armature, it will be
even more important to prevent condensation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1908, when Kykuit's garden was built, its designer, William
Welles Bosworth, created a wooden pyramid to protect the huge
reproduction of Giambologna's ``Oceanus and the Three Rivers,''
which anchors Kykuit's forecourt, and he put decorative lattice on
the wooden boxes that covered smaller sculptural elements. Now,
Oceanus and his pals have to make do with a vented plastic wrapper,
so it's a good thing that Kykuit is closed in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the heart of the dilemma: the best protection
is so unlovely that unless you've got museum pieces you may
conclude the cure is worse than the disease. If your sculptures are
in good condition, without places where water can collect, you may
prefer to chance the ice and rush out with a broom when snow falls.
</P>
<P>
   A Blight on Carrots
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! Our organically-grown carrots were beautiful when we
started harvesting them six weeks ago, but now they're full of
blackish, horizontal lines and some have worms in them. Should we
just abandon the crop? How do we keep this from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Welcome to the wonderful world of the carrot rust fly, a very
common pest. Adults lay eggs on the soil around the crowns of
carrots, parsnips and related plants. The newly-hatched maggots
tunnel into the roots, eat for a month or so, then return to the
soil to pupate and turn, a few weeks later, into the next
generation of flies.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to stop further damage is to harvest the carrots,
trim off the nasty parts and eat or preserve the rest. Don't
abandon the crop, destroy it. Maggots and pupae can overwinter in
the soil or compost and make things worse next year.
</P>
<P>
   Prevention is tricky. Start by planting next year's crop as far
from this one as possible. Try planting late; flies lay their first
eggs in May or June, so if you plant in mid-June you can sometimes
sneak by them (it takes carrot seeds a couple of weeks to
germinate). Be sure to harvest early as well, since the second
generation of flies lays its eggs in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you can use floating row covers to prevent
egg-laying. Be sure to bury the edges in the soil so no flies can
get underneath. Leave them on from planting to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43d St., New York 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(AT)nytimes.com.
Those of general interest will llbe published. Unpublished

<P>
   Anyone knowing the modest size of  &UR; Dianne Feinstein &LR; 's war
chest, Rep.  &UR; Chris Cox &LR; , R-Newport Beach, said on Tuesday, would
surmise that South Bay Republican  &UR; Tom Campbell &LR;  has a good chance
of beating her for the Senate. ``I am surprised,'' he said, ``she
only has a million dollars and some in the bank after six years,
and that suggests her heart's not in it.'' Cox said he had called
Feinstein personally to discuss this point of view, a frankness
that might seem surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, though, when it's viewed as another way of saying what
Capital Style alleges Cox said about Feinstein at the recent
California Republican Convention in Orange County: ``She's old, fat
and lazy, and her husband doesn't want her in politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox says he never said that. ``That's not the way I'd express
myself. I called Sen. Feinstein and told her so. I'm going to write
a letter to the editor, which they told me they would print. ...
It's an opportunity fiction piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital Style stands by its story, insisting that two of its
reporters heard the quote. ``We're owned by the Economist,'' said
editor  &UR; Bill Thomas &LR; , ``and we make very few mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox referred to Roll Call, the Washington newspaper from which
Capital Style spun off. ``It's just not journalism,'' he said.
``...It's a high school newspaper we have on our campus here.''

   &UR; LIBRARY OF CONGRESS WANTS KING PAPERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Members of the House of Representatives are negotiating with the
 &UR; Martin Luther King Jr. &LR;  Center for Nonviolent Social Change to
make the most expensive Library of Congress purchase ever: a
collection of King's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has appraised the 80,000 or so documents and valued
them at $30 million. Rep.  &UR; Jim Clyburn &LR; , D-S.C., sponsor of a bill
authorizing the purchase, told Roll Call he's hoping that the King
family will lower the price ``as a gift to the nation. ... I do
believe, that if approached directly and by the right people, that
they would be benevolent with this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The library's most expensive past purchase was a Gutenberg
Bible, bought in 1930 for $1.5 million. The 1815 purchase price of
 &UR; Thomas Jefferson &LR; 's library was $23,950.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLEARING AN ART BUY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A recent purchase of an 8th century Mayan stone carving by the
de Young Museum in San Francisco was approved by the governments of
Mexico and Guatemala because neither country thought it could claim
origin.
</P>
<P>
   The stela, which was bought from a private collection, was
attributed to a civilization that straddled both countries.
Concerned about looting ancient cultures, Fine Arts Museums
director  &UR; Harry Parker &LR;  and curator  &UR; Kathleen Berrin &LR;  consulted
officials in both: The Guatemalans said it probably was a Mexican
work; the Mexicans said it was probably Guatemalan. Both OK'd the
buy. And the Guatemalans said the San Franciscans were the first
Americans to have consulted them before making a purchase.

said  &UR; Gloria Estefan &LR; , who's in the movie, ``and at one point he
had to get up to go to the bathroom, &LR;  and brought back popcorn for
people. Do you know how awesome that is?''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Chris Morano  &LR; says the owner of a BMW Z3 that bears a ``B
HUMBLE'' license plate is a much nicer guy than the juxtaposition
of plate and car would indicate. And on Townsend Street,  &UR; Andy &LR; 
 &UR; Orrock &LR;  overheard a guy telling some pals, ``Oh yeah, if I were a
girl, I'd definitely be bisexual.'' And cartoonist  &UR; William &LR;

``ground to a stony silence'' at one of those trendy inner
Mission/east of Potrero cafes when a woman exclaimed loudly to her

   Cheaper Digital Camera Connects Directly to PC
</P>
<P>
   UMAX, a company known for its scanners, is introducing a
low-cost digital camera on Monday that borrows a feature from
palm-size devices: linking to a PC with a single touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   The camera, called Astracam, connects to a Windows-based
computer through a cradle that is plugged into a USB port. Press a
button on the cradle and images from Astracam's memory load onto
the computer. The cradle also recharges the camera's two AAA
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Astracam has a list price of $199 but will sell for considerably
less at some discount outlets, making it one of the least expensive
digital cameras on the market. The tradeoff is that it offers only
medium resolution and few features. There is no flash, and no
preview screen, and there is also a lag between the time the
shutter button is pressed and the photograph is taken; slow shutter
speed means any movement results in a blurry image.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the camera, which can store up to 46 images
and can make voice recordings through a built-in microphone, comes
with software that makes it easy to e-mail images, create greeting
cards or make screen savers from photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Images can be modified for brightness or contrast, and the
inclusion of Adobe Photo Deluxe Home Edition allows advanced
special effects like making a picture look like a charcoal
drawing. &QL;

   Digital Video Camera Is Freed of Its Tether to the PC
</P>
<P>
   Cams _ tech slang for tiny video cameras for personal computers
_ have been popping up in all sorts of shapes and styles. The
latest, Video Blaster Webcam Go, is the first to free itself from
its wired connection to the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Creative Labs, this $150 digital-camera-to-go can
snap individual pictures and snippets of motion pictures, all of
which are easily uploaded to the Internet or attached to e-mail.
The camera can also be used to set up video conferences, and,
detached from its wired base, it can be used like a point-and-shoot
digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   With four megabytes of on-board memory, the camera delivers 90
good-quality 640 x 480 images (or you can get more than 200 images
at a much lower resolution) in Internet-ready JPEG format.

   Making It Easy to Put TV Signals on Your Computer
</P>
<P>
   TV cards, which let you watch television on your computer
monitor, have been slow to gain popularity. Cable hook-ups and
antennas are often not conveniently located near computers, and
some people don't like the distraction of a television running in a
window on their monitor while they're trying to work.
</P>
<P>
   But another big reason for the slow adoption of TV cards is that
selecting and installing the right one can be complicated. They
come as stand-alone cards or, in the case of the the market leader,
the ATI All-In-Wonder 128, as part of a state-of-the-art graphics
card.
</P>
<P>
   So before you buy one, you have to know which of an alphabet
soup of slots your computer has _ older ISA, newer PCI or a special
slot for graphics cards, the AGP. Then you have to open your
computer to install it, which strikes fear in many a consumer's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   A new product from the consumer division of Pinnacle Systems, a
leader in professional video editing equipment, promises to solve
the complications of installation. Its Studio PCTV is an external
device that plugs into any computer equipped with a USB, or
universal serial bus, port.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to accepting up to 128 channels, the $99.95 device
can record screen snapshots, full TV programs or home videos on a
hard drive, recordable CD or Zip disk. It also comes with an FM
tuner.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ATI card, it includes software for video editing, video
conferencing and producing streaming video for the Web, offering
yet another way to amaze family, friends and unsuspecting party
guests with those videotapes you shot 11 years ago at Sea World.

   MP3 Goes on the Road: A Digital Player for the Car
</P>
<P>
   Portable digital audio devices, commonly known as MP3 players,
continue to evolve faster than the music they play. A new
Atlanta-based company recently introduced a twist on an old idea:
an MP3 player for the car.
</P>
<P>
   Looking like a bloated pager, the Ego is designed to tap into
the car's stereo system through the cassette-tape player with an
adapter similar to ones used by portable CD players. It also
features a built-in port that permits a more direct connection to a
car's stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Like all MP3 players, the Ego, made by I2go, has no moving
parts. It stores and plays its music, also like all MP3 players, by
way of computer chip and electronic storage technology.
</P>
<P>
   For the Ego, the storage is managed by Compact Flash II memory
cards; the same slots can accommodate IBM's new micro drives for
removable storage. The player has no on-board memory for audio
storage, but it does have two card slots, giving it the capacity to
store up to 680 megabytes of near CD-quality music and much more
for voice recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The player, which comes in three shells _ black, clear and
translucent blue _sells without memory for $189. A player that
includes a 96-megabyte memory card sells for $329.
</P>
<P>
   The Ego also includes software to help users download and
organize MP3 files when the player is connected to an
Internet-connected computer. The software can also convert e-mail
text into voice files, storing them in the player in the MP3 format
so they may be played back when the player is attached to the car's
stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   The Ego will be sold on Web sites, including www.I2go.com,
beginning Nov. 15.

   Live From Las Vegas, a Concert on the Internet
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet grows, bigger stunts are needed to attract
attention. It's hard to imagine what will top the online iBash that
the new streaming video company, Pixelon, will stage this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to call attention to its new ability to send
full-screen, live pictures over the Internet by giving a party in
Las Vegas, hiring acts like the Who, the Dixie Chicks and Faith
Hill and broadcasting their performances live. The show begins at
2:30 p.m. on Friday, Pacific standard time, and ends at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pixelon is a small, tightly held start-up company that is
reaching out to the public with a big gesture to demonstrate how
its Web-based solution could replace old-fashioned television.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fenne, Pixelon's founder, said that the company was able
to shrink the size of the data stream to about 100,000 bits per
second, about a third of what the standard, MPEG, would use to
represent the moving pictures. The solution represents several
years of serious mathematical research into how to represent images
on the screen with the least amount of data.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also investing heavily in placing proprietary
technology at the local substations to which home computers would
connect. These points of presence, or POPs, are getting a huge bank
of disk drives to hold video for delivery on demand as well as a
satellite link for picking up live events like the Las Vegas
concert.
</P>
<P>
   The new system also includes a technology that will tailor the
advertisements shown to the demographic information about a viewer.
If the scheme works as planned, a 23-year old man who used the
Pixelon network to tune into a talk show like ``Oprah'' would still
see advertisements for a forthcoming monster truck rally and
wrestling festival. &QL;

   A New Web Site for Armchair Marathoners
</P>
<P>
   As race time approaches for the 30th New York City marathon on
Nov. 7, runners, spectators and enthusiasts can get a preview of
the 26.2-mile pageant of sweat, muscle and determination by way of
a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, an official Internet sponsor of the race, has joined
the New York Road Runners Club, which puts on the race, in
developing a site that offers training tips, weather reports,
suggestions of the best locations to see the race, marathon trivia
and screen savers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site www.nycmarathon.msn.com is set up to track each of
the 30,000 registered runners, via sensors on their sneakers.
Statistics will go on line as soon as they become available, and
the information will be searchable by runner number, age group,
country, city or state.

`THE VOYAGE': SENDING THE BOYS OFF TO MEET THEIR FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, the title of Philip Caputo's tumultuous new novel,
``The Voyage,'' appears to refer to a strange seafaring journey
undertaken by four young men.
</P>
<P>
   On a June morning in 1901, Cyrus Braithwaite, a craggy Boston
millionaire, rows a dory with his three sons, Nathaniel, 16, Eliot,
15, and Andrew, 13, out to his two-masted schooner, Double Eagle,
moored off the shore of the family's summer estate in Maine.
Presumably they're embarking on their annual weeklong summer
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   But Cyrus has commanded the boys to do an unusually vigorous
overhauling of Double Eagle this year. He seems in a darkish,
autumnal mood as he accompanies his sons to the yacht. He has
brought no personal gear with him. Once aboard, he inspects the
boat, hands each of the boys $10 and announces: ``You boys are to
leave as soon as I'm off this boat. You are not to show your faces
until September. That money should last. If it doesn't, don't ask
for more, because you won't get it. Understood?''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he climbs back into the dory and takes his leave.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Cyrus do such a mystifying thing? Sybil Braithwaite,
his great-granddaughter, wonders too, there having been no record
of the trip that she is at first aware of, or any family talk of
it, in the succeeding 100 years. So she sets about to write an
account of the voyage, using the ship's log, which turns up, along
with her unusual ability to imagine the past. She will try to clear
up other mysteries as well: why the boys' mother was in a Boston
hospital and the puzzling behavior of their half-brother, Lockwood,
who has somehow displeased Cyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The oceangoing part of ``The Voyage'' is a reckless adventure. A
former reporter who has written eight other books, among them ``A
Rumor of War,'' a memoir of Vietnam, and five works of fiction,
Caputo has mastered nautical terminology and the language of
seascape. The trip starts off slowly, with the boys paying social
calls and picking up a Yale friend, Will Terhune, as their
navigator. But as Cyrus probably anticipated, the boys' restless
spirits get the better of them and they decide to head south to
visit the Florida Keys, where Cyrus once worked in the wrecking
business. They get caught in various storms, visit one of Cyrus'
wrecks with disastrous results and end up shipwrecked off the
northern coast of Cuba, where they undergo their ultimate loss of
youthful illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the deeper you get into Caputo's adventure, the more you
become aware of a second voyage the title refers to: the passage to
understanding why Cyrus acted as he did. This trip is not nearly as
satisfying as the first.
</P>
<P>
   During the sea journey, little light is shed on the mystery.
True, the boys pay a visit to an aunt in Beaufort, S.C., who hints
at something they don't know about their mother. In retrospect you
realize that some of their experiences reflect the family's dark
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   What they go through on their trek could conceivably be what
their father had in mind by sending them into exile, particularly
during one storm when they hear ``a prolonged bass groan, deafening
and demented, as if a lunatic were pounding on the keys of a
cathedral organ.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage continues: ``It was, each of them thought in his own
words, the cry of that power in the universe which hated integrity
and sought disintegration, which despised order, peace and
contentment and sought their opposites. It was the voice of
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of their adventure, however, when they finally arrive
in Havana physically injured, out of money and emotionally
traumatized, and they arrange for the American legation to cable
their father for help, all they receive in return is a telegram
that reads: ``Look not to Isaiah but to Corinthians for passage
home. Stop. C.R.B.'' The mystery is only compounded.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the final 35 pages of ``The Voyage,'' heavy curtains
are torn away, sudden light is allowed to penetrate the darkness,
chambers within chambers are opened. Consistent with what turns out
to be the theme of the novel, skeletons turn up in the closet of a
family ``whose ways and opinions had once been templates for the
nation, whose sovereignty was once unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all a bit too much, absurd in its compression, gothic
in its extremeness and insufficiently connected to the sea journey
that precedes it. It's a little like the moray eel in the Straits
of Florida that lunges out of a little cave in a coral wall _ ``a
hideous, green, eel-like thing as thick as a man's arm and twice as
long'' _ and sucks a chub into its maw and shoots back into its
lair, shocking Eliot Brathwaite over the bestiality of aquatic
life.
</P>
<P>
   Or like one image of a sunrise at sea: ``A golden shimmer
appeared where the horizon was supposed to be, then a red sun
pushed up, like the head of some fiery infant bulging out of the
gray sea's womb _ water giving birth to its opposite element.''
</P>
<P>
   Too sudden, too obvious, too brutal and finally, a cartoon
treatment of a subject deserving of both grander and subtler
handling.

MAKING BOOKS: THEY'RE BIGGER. BUT BETTER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is my intention to inveigh against what seems to be the
gradual (continuing?) publishing practice of making books that are
so fat and windy that they sit, with some exceptions, like hefty
neglected lumps on the shelves waiting for the first clever
marketer to include a backpack with their purchase.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where everything else, except movies, is getting
leaner and faster and miniaturized, there is little question that
books appear to be going in the other direction. Perhaps it's just
perception, and therefore unfair, but look at that bookcase in
front of you and you'll sense that the pursuit of knowledge,
information and pleasure that are the occasions for reading has
become looming.
</P>
<P>
   How many of these plump sentinels, even when purchased, stand
unread or at best only skimmed? Of course, there have always been
long, even very long, books and in certain masterly hands these
sometimes don't seem long enough. Such books are not hard to find.
``War and Peace'' and ``Anna Karenina'' are cliched examples of the
lengthy and wondrous, but those were by Tolstoy, who wrote in a
different dimension from nearly any other novelist. Back in this
realm, Robert Caro's ``Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of
New York'' (Knopf, 1974), the 1,246-page biography of the legendary
city planner, is still selling.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone is a movie critic, and the general criticism seems
to be that movies are too long, that nearly three hours in the dark
has become all too frequent and fidget-manufacturing, while the
especially long film used to be, because of its rarity, a
creatively moving experience. So every moviegoer has an arbitrary
amount that can be cut from a film: 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But can a reader make the same sweeping critique? Will a book be
better if it's 100 or 200 pages shorter or will it seem incomplete?
How many mammoth books are published each year that are bought but
never read? These questions come up mostly in discussing
biographies, particularly literary biographies, but no nonfiction
genre is immune. Nor are novels.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring Avon Books published Neal Stephenson's
``Cryptonomicon,'' which was 918 pages long and weighed in at 3
pounds 5 ounces, was two inches thick and had a jacket price of
$27.50. It was on the best-seller list of The New York Times for
three weeks; perhaps a two-and-a-half pounder would have stuck
around longer.
</P>
<P>
   In nonfiction, Knopf is publishing Nicholas Fox Weber's two-inch
thick ``Balthus,'' the biography of an interesting but relatively
unimportant artist, at 644 pages. It's likely that 400 pages could
easily cover the elderly painter's life and artistic fascination
with young girls.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender for the barbell-weight tome of the year award
is Fred Kaplan's biography of Gore Vidal (Doubleday), at 850 pages.
But Vidal could easily live long enough and cause some new literary
mischief to warrant, by this measure of publishing indulgence, at
least 1,000 pages in a subsequent edition. Or, as his editor,
William Thomas, editor in chief of Doubleday, said: ``Gore's
already lived three or four lives, in different arenas: the
literary, the political, the cultural wars, Hollywood. He's been
influential and provocative.'' Thomas said the first printing was
about 32,000 copies, which is quite a large number for a book of
this bulk.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be an endless list of books this season that
could smite the brain to numbness with their length and physical
heft, even though some of these have real literary and scholarly
merit, if one could just force oneself to read them.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, certainly there are plenty of history buffs and
those enchanted with the lost romance of railroading, so Viking is
gambling that there are enough of them to make David Howard Bain's
``Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad''
viable commercially. It is 797 pages and weighs 2 pounds 15 ounces
and is two inches thick. Could that story not be told in, say, 500
pages? (To be fair, the same publishing complex is producing a
series of 200-page biographies.)
</P>
<P>
   Random House has two fatties on the shelves: Geoffrey Perret's
685-page biography ``Eisenhower'' and, of course, the transgenre
``Dutch,'' Edmund Morris' best-selling fact-and-fiction 874-page
something about Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Many in book publishing will admit privately that they have in a
sense lost control of their writers. One publisher who absolutely
refused to be identified said: ``Writers will not stop writing on a
book. I don't think it's the publishers' desire to publish long
books. It's more expensive, takes more time on the presses, is a
more complicated process.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is technology. Jane von Mehren, associate
publisher of Penguin, said: ``The mechanics of writing is easier.
The Internet has made it easier to do research, and the word
processor has made to easier to write and revise.'' All too true.
When the author had to put fingers to the typewriter and perhaps,
in revising, be forced to retype an entire manuscript without the
easy ability to move paragraphs about the desire to run words on
and on was probably considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and editors like to say that context determines
length. Phyllis Grann, president of Penguin Putnam Inc., said,
``This is our one real hope, that if the book is long, content
justifies it because readers are getting tough on long books.''
Some content is worth the pounds; some isn't. Last year Putnam's
628-page ``Lindbergh,'' by A. Scott Berg, sold about 250,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lined up your best sellers on a bookshelf, they seem to
come in any length from half an inch to an inch and a half,'' Mrs.
Grann said. ``It really varies.'' Obviously she hasn't put ``Empire
Express'' on her bookshelf yet.
</P>
<P>
   One can cringe in a bookstore standing before the obese products
and puzzle about buying one of these biographies or works of
serious nonfiction or overblown novels. Or you could look under F
in the fiction section and maybe buy ``The Great Gatsby,'' which is
200 pages long.

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between St. Louis (No. 1) and Jacksonville (2), but the
difference between Kansas City (3) and Miami (4) is much smaller.

DEMOCRATS CALL FOR HATE CRIMES LAW TO PROTECT HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats on Wednesday urged Congress to approve
new protections for gays and lesbians by expanding federal laws
that already provide harsher penalties for crimes motivated by
race, religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of gay rights and other supporters of expanding the
hate crimes legislation to cover sexual orientation, disability or
gender were outraged to discover last week that Republicans had
deleted the provision from a spending bill funding the Commerce,
Justice and State departments.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a lead sponsor of the hate
crimes proposal, told a news conference that crime triggered by
prejudice ``attack the human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They send a poisonous message that the majority in society can
assault the minority,'' Kennedy said. ``We must act now to give
federal law enforcement the tools it needs to combat these
senseless and violent acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., also speaking at the news
conference, said violent crimes of prejudice are growing at a time
when crime rates in general are falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements of any society,''
Leahy said. ``We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on any
member of society diminishes all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes legislation gained traction earlier this year,
in the aftermath of the beating death in October 1998 of a gay
student in Wyoming and the June 1998 case of a black man who was
dragged to his death in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who oppose expanding the definition of hate crimes
say it would create separate classes of victims. ``A crime is a
crime,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans oppose the move to broaden the law. In the
Senate, Arlen Specter, R-Pa., is a co-sponsor of the hate crimes
bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said he was
outraged that the Republican leaders dropped the hate crimes
provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has been delayed and denied for too long,'' Gephardt
said. ``This is a matter of simple decency and what's right and it
should transcend partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Correia, the White House special counsel for civil rights,
said the provision is ``a high priority and the president urges
Congress to enact it as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a gay rights bill,'' Correia said, ``it's a
human rights bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest advocacy group for gays and
lesbians, urged the Clinton administration to fight for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is near death in a partisan ditch,'' Birch
said. ``The issue is whether the Republican leadership is going to
call an ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, the spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi, said it was doubtful the hate crimes
legislation would be included in any spending legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that happening,'' Czwartacki said.

ALL EYES ARE ON THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday has the makings of another white-knuckle day for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Two economic reports will be out in the morning, both of which
will provide new information about the market's greatest fear:
inflation. If the numbers are god, which is to say, price
pressures are modest, the market may breathe a sigh of relief and
rally. If the inflation news is bad, hang on to your hat.
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index probably has the greatest potential to
spook the market. The index tracks how swiftly wages and benefits
are rising. Since labor costs are a huge piece of any business'
costs, it stands to reason that if pay is on the rise, prices could
be, too.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, despite a booming economy and very tight labor
markets, wages have been climbing an unthreatening 3.5 percent per
year. ``Companies are under competitive pressure to hold down
costs,'' says David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poors DRI
in Lexington. ``In that kind of environment you cannot afford to
give big pay increases.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few hints that wages are rising more steeply.
Last week McDonald's said its expenses rose because it had to pay
more to attract workers. In general, though, analysts are not
terribly concerned about the wage side of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for benefits. ``That is the piece we are
worried about,'' says Wyss. Health costs are the biggest
contributor to benefit costs. Thanks to some good luck and the
impact of managed care, medical costs have barely budged over the
past three years. By all indications, that hiatus from medical
inflation is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going back to the bad old days, but the latest news
is not good,'' says Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State
Street Corp., referring to the sharp increases in health insurance
premiums that have been announced recently.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street expects the employment cost index to rise 0.9
percent Thursday. A gain of over 1 percent will not be looked upon
kindly.
</P>
<P>
   The other key report will be the first release of third-quarter
gross domestic product. Everyone agrees the summer quarter was a
humdinger. The pessimists think the economy expanded at a 4 percent
rate; the optimists predict the number could top 5 percent. The
bigger the number, the more anxious investors will be.
</P>
<P>
   All the gears were clicking in the third quarter. Consumers were
spending, businesses were investing, exports were expanding, and
retailers were restocking depleted inventories. Put it all together
and you get an economy that continues to grow well above the 3
percent pace the Federal Reserve would like to see. ``This is not
where the Fed intended to be,'' says Breimyer.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank did not raise interest rates at its last
meeting, but said it was leaning towards a rate hike. No matter how
the numbers come out Thursday, the Fed is likely to hike rates in
mid-November, say analysts. ``Given their druthers, the Fed would
like to take out a little insurance against future inflation,''
says Wayne Ayers, chief economist at Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is: What happens after mid-November? Or to put
it another way: Will one more rate hike be enough to satisfy the
Fed that inflation is under control?
</P>
<P>
   Ayers points out that inflation, in fact, is under control. The
rise in prices so far this year has been quite modest. ``It has
been the same story throughout this whole cycle,'' says Ayers.
``The economy goes at full tilt, the labor market is tight, and we
have not seen the wage and price pressures we would expect to see.
It leaves the Fed and everyone else in a quandary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reassuring numbers Thursday _ modest wake hikes and a good
but not great economy _ might help ease the nervousness a bit. Keep
your fingers crossed.

CHIC AND GRITTY: A DUTCH TEAM WANTS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP NOBEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Architecture is a fractured field.
There are some architects who build but seldom break new ground,
and then there are the experimenters whose idiosyncratic designs
and arcane language can scare off clients with the power to promote
them.
</P>
<P>
   Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos are succeeding in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance van Berkel, 42, and Ms. Bos, 40, behave just
like other experimental architects: their graphic style, leaning
heavily on computer models, can be slick; their language can veer
close to inscrutable ``archispeak,'' and their designs, many
showcasing novel and fluid forms, can be perplexing even to the
initiated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet earlier this year, following a competition to rethink the
Penn Station rail yards in Manhattan, the chairman of the New York
City Planning Commission, Joseph B. Rose, found himself so drawn to
their entry that he invited the Amsterdam-based husband-and-wife
team to his office to inspire his staff.
</P>
<P>
   In singling them out from three other finalists _ and from the
competition winner, Peter Eisenman _ Rose pointed out that,
surfaces aside, ``they did intelligent, insightful and creative
analysis that was also artistic.'' It was an analysis, he added,
``by people who don't have their heads in the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   In their proposal, a bubbling cluster of work and residential
spaces hovers over a generous park envisioned as a ``lobby'' for
Manhattan. It resulted from a year's study of New Yorkers _ their
cravings for waterfront access, the pressure on waves of commuters
coursing through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gehry, a competition juror, picked up on the rigor in the
architects' work. ``Some of these young people think that they can
do a souffle, and it'll go to the moon, and they're going to be
stars,'' he said. ``For foreign architects to come in and
understand the city like that was very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Berkel and Ms. Bos are building a full-service practice that
they hope can be trusted to tackle everything from boutique private
houses and museums to thornier problems like bridges and train
stations. With a staff of 50, they are trying to project the
competence of a U.S. corporate firm while retaining the star-system
chic that clings to many independent European architects.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of collaboration and seven of marriage, the pair
took their names off the door to form the U.N. (for United Net)
Studio, a network with contractors, engineers and designers, whose
work they say they will synthesize but not dictate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like mixing music,'' van Berkel said, smiling and sliding
the controls of an imaginary recording console. Ms. Bos, the more
grounded of the two, countered: ``It's against the old idea of the
master builder scribbling away on his drawings. If you've built one
building, you know you are only a bit player in the whole
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In their large new office in an old school building just beyond
Amsterdam's outermost ring of canals, the network idea is taking
form: a hotline connects to the offices of consulting engineers
across town; an in-house graphic designer works on architectural
projects as well as the firm's promotional publications.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through their studios last week with a visitor, the
scope of the work was in evidence: A wood and steel bridgelike
table they designed for an office building; a model of a giant
transportation hub under construction in Arnhem, and a
one-of-a-kind ceramic platter. The platter exhibited the spare
folded geometry found in their best-known project, the Moebius
House, completed last year in an Utrecht suburb for a reclusive
family that Ms. Bos called ``the Greta Garbos of architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   As the firm's submission to the rail-yards competition was
turning heads in New York, U.N. Studio was proving itself in a more
rarefied context: the Museum of Modern Art. The Moebius House was
one of 26 projects in the museum's recent ``Un-Private House''
exhibition. Pointing out that the Netherlands has been ``a
peculiarly intense incubator for architectural talent,'' Terence
Riley, the chief curator of the museum's department of architecture
and design, praised van Berkel last week for his handling of the
house's complexity. ``They told Ben, `Don't make it too simple.'''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. The Moebius House is a gorgeous train wreck of
concrete and green-tinted glass that might be easily mistaken for a
study in fragmentation. But as with so much U.N. Studio work,
surfaces are deceiving. The volumes of the house have been set in a
purposeful collision that creates intermingling zones to suit two
work-at-home parents and their two teen-age children. Its amorphous
halls form fluid webs of space that give the house its name.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hard to believe at first that it was not created for
the eye, the seductive masses do seem to be in the service of a
deeper idea: the pursuit of unity through flow.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to achieve an architecture where space and structure
unite to erase all seams, U.N. Studio is heir to a great tradition
of Dutch modernism. In the first decades of the century, the Dutch
were early adapters to the ideas of Frank Lloyd Wright, whose
organic architecture prescribed just this kind of unity, what
Wright saw as aspiring to the principles of nature, not just its
forms. Though the pair bridle politely at this suggestion, their
designs and their new, inclusive practice point at this kind of
organic urge. (When van Berkel is explaining an idea, he invariably
draws figure-eights.)
</P>
<P>
   Add to this inclination a contemporary love of asymmetry and
movement _ they even drive a car with five cylinders _ and you get
U.N. Studio's sweeping design for the central train station in
Arnhem, near the German border. There, working for a constellation
of clients that includes government agencies and the national rail
system, the firm is trying to fashion a transportation complex that
will handle buses, trams, trains, 5,000 bicycles, and 65,000 people
a day. The structure is based on walls that deflect into drooping
ramps and roofs to provide for circulation and shelter within a
unified system.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to express movement seamlessly is also apparent in
their signature public project, the 460-foot tall baby-blue Erasmus
Bridge, spanning the Maas River in Rotterdam. The $342 million
bridge, completed in 1996, synthesizes an amazing amount of
structure and function _ including a section that is the largest
bascule, or counterweighted, drawbridge in the world _ into a
graceful whole that has been nicknamed ``the swan.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sweeping form of the Erasmus Bridge there is evidence of
the influence of Santiago Calatrava, the Spanish architect who
reintroduced lyricism to engineering in the late 1980s. Van Berkel
worked on Calatrava's trend-setting Stadelhofen light rail station
in Zurich in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned everything on that project,'' van Berkel said,
though he did not pick up the decorative tendency in his mentor's
work.
</P>
<P>
   A subtle influence are the interpenetrating forms of Zaha Hadid,
who taught van Berkel at the Architectural Association in London in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if U.N. Studio can transplant its broad
practice from the architectural hothouse of today's affluent and
accepting Netherlands. Rick van der Ploeg, the Dutch secretary of
state for culture and media, thinks that a favorable native climate
is underpinning the success of U.N. Studio and the other firms,
like MVRDV, that make up the current Dutch invasion. ``We haven't
got much land in Holland, so we want to invest more in our
surroundings,'' he said. ``In a way architects and designers are
the heroes of a new age.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Studio's latest building, the Museum Het Valkhof, a
regional museum in Nijmegen, opened its doors in late September to
crowds that dwarfed all estimates. Using very large, very simple
elements that the architects call ``big details'' _ an inexpensive
undulating aluminum-stave ceiling, a raw and beautiful system of
solid wood stair rails _ U.N. Studio devised a strategy to make an
uncompromised building on a very tight budget. On a visit last
week, however, van Berkel found a glaring problem: a giant black
sign that the museum had clamped on to a neat concrete retaining
wall. ``Should we just take it off right now?'' he asked, patting
his pockets as if looking for the right tool.
</P>
<P>
   Van Berkel may be a sort of architect's architect, but Ms. Bos
is the firm's secret weapon. She is thoughtful and serious and,
most important, not trained as a designer. She first studied law
and then turned to architectural history and theory. Her outsider's
course has given her a jaundiced view of the profession; she seems
to have a well-developed sense, visible in a glance, of when her
husband is testing the limits of architectural credulity.
``Sometimes when we're talking about spatial effects and flow
diagrams, she just says, `Who cares?''' van Berkel said.
</P>
<P>
   While at the Villa Wilbrink recently, a modest 1994 residence in
Amersfoort that is a meditation on solidity, built in the form of a
bunker for a privacy-loving client, van Berkel remembered an
epigram he admires: ``Architecture is the mother of every ruin.''
Then he explained its birth: ``I said, `All architecture ends as a
ruin,' but Caroline was reading a lot of Freud at the time, and she
fixed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Berkel and Ms. Bos have a daughter, Emily, 7, whom they
raise while working 14-hour days. They typically have dinner at
their home nearby, on the Amstel River, then they retire to a
basement studio to write, draw and play computer games. Their
favorite is Riven, the sequel to the popular game Myst.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of a taste for the fantastic _ and an expression of the
couple's overlapping relationships _ can also be found on the cover
of their latest book, ``Move,'' a boxed collection of their work.
The jarring cover image, a creature they call ``Manimal,'' merges
head shots of the couple with photographs of a lion and a snake. It
is a suitably fierce mascot for an architectural team trying to be
everything at once.

LAWMAKER SAYS NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS SHOWS NEED FOR NEW CONSTITUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A key lawmaker Wednesday bemoaned the long list
of proposed amendments to the Texas Constitution on next week's
ballot, but said he doesn't believe there is adequate support to
redraft the entire document.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen amendments, none very controversial, are on Tuesday's
statewide ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that every other year Texans have to go to the polls
and vote on 15-20 amendments to the Texas Constitution is a prima
facie case for the need for a new Constitution,'' said Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff joined the consumer watchdog group Common Cause in
lamenting both the length of the ballot and the low projected voter
turnout. But he said his attempt to redraft the 80,000-word
Constitution in the legislative session earlier this year ``didn't
get very far,'' and ``I frankly don't know whether we will try
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically ``tough'' votes on issues such as school finance
make the task unpalatable to lawmakers ``in the absence of
crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its adoption in 1876, the blueprint for state government
has been amended by voters 377 times. This year's propositions
include policy questions, a bond issue and one amendment aimed at
removing useless constitutional provisions. Also included are
proposals impacting gubernatorial powers, judicial pay and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause Chairman Bill Stouffer said ballots too often
include special interest amendment proposals that ``set up special
funds, tax exemptions or other benefits that are not necessarily in
the public interest.'' He said that less than 10 percent of the
registered voters are expected to cast ballots, and some
propositions in 1997 were decided by as few as 4 percent of those
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly not what we usually think when we discuss
majority rule as one of our dearest American and Texas values,''
Stouffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said Texans may be signaling their concern by avoiding
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that one day the people of Texas will simply stop
going to the polls to vote on constitutional amendments until we
fix it. Maybe that's what they've already done,'' Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   Local issues in Houston and San Antonio inadvertently could make
voters there overwhelmingly responsible for the outcome Tuesday,
Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told that in this particular election it's the people in
Houston and San Antonio that are going to decide the constitutional
amendments because they're the only ones that are going to go to
the polls. And the reason is not the constitutional amendments _
it's for arena proposals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a Texas tragedy that we can't seem to come to
grips with the fact that we need a new basic document going into
the next century for Texas government,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Secretary of State Elton Bomer said he, too,
is concerned about a low turnout to address anachronisms in the
``sacred document'' of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing it has been amended many times,'' Bomer
said. ``If it had not been, ministers of the gospel would not be
able to be legislators. If you had ever participated in a duel, you
would not be allowed to hold public office. And indeed, if you had
ever received any kind of public financial assistance, you wouldn't
even be allowed to vote,'' Bomer said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the ballot issues has been the subject of widespread
advertising, either pro or con. But lawmakers who sponsored the
amendments _ and groups that might benefit from them _ have gone on
the offensive in recent weeks to promote expansion of urban
homestead sizes, two mortgage proposals and college student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Few amendments have drawn loud opposition, but Rep. John
Shields, R-San Antonio, has called Prop. 9 a ``Trojan Horse'' and
``smoke screen'' _ a charge its author denied. The proposition,
which would create a commission to recommend judicial salaries,
duplicates the Legislature's functions, Shields said. Voters
probably aren't aware that lawmakers' pensions are pegged by
formula to judge's salaries, he added.

COWBOY COLLECTOR HEARS THE CALL OF THE WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Doug Harman has a collection of cowboy
memorabilia that could knock yer boots off. But the president of
Fort Worth's Convention and Visitors Bureau also has a knowledge of
history and art that would impress the most distinguished
collector-connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Harman can't pass up a good pair of chaps, but he's also the
picture of urban refinement, from his perfectly knotted tie to his
well-shined dress shoes. He is part Wild West, part modern
businessman _ and thoroughly entertaining. Which makes him, in a
sense, the ideal representative of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Harman's collection can be found all over town. Pieces
are on display at the Convention and Visitors Bureau's downtown and
satellite offices, and some of his artifacts were used in an
exhibit about West Texas ranches at the Amon Carter Museum. The
museum also has a large collection of photographs by Erwin E.
Smith, who photographed ranches in Texas and the Southwest during
the early 1900s _ exactly the type of ``everyday life'' details
that Harman studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a good idea to have some objects on
display that were similar to what you could see in the
photographs,'' said Carter director Rick Stewart. ``We had saddles,
and we had cowboy paraphernalia on display in cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug loaned from his collection and talked to people about
it,'' Stewart said. ``If he had the time, it would have been great
to have installed him as a living exhibition in the show.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Harman's collection so valuable is his encyclopedic
knowledge of the items: when they were used, where they could be
found, how they changed through the years. He will share some of
that knowledge this week when he speaks at the recently opened
Carter Downtown museum. As part of the museum's Fall Fridays series
of lunch-hour speakers, Harman will discuss the work of
19th-century American West illustrator Frederic Remington, using
examples of western artifacts from his collection.
</P>
<P>
   In his downtown office, Harman points to the stirrups, hats and
boots in a print of Remington's 1895 painting ``The Fall of the
Cowboy.'' He explains why the items pictured reflect the era the
painting depicts. The style of boot (very plain, like most
turn-of-the-century boots), the type of spurs worn (he has some
that are similar) tell Harman a lot about the cowboys pictured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remington was quite a collector,'' Harman says. ``He often
used the actual artifacts (he collected) in his paintings _ it was
a way for him to make his paintings authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Harman's office looks a little like a western-wear store. The
walls are covered with chaps and spurs, hats and ropes, and
original paintings and postcards. A bookcase holds cascading piles
of postcards and artifacts of cowboy life.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy paraphernalia overpowers the building's interior. A
closet holds a jumble of boots and old stock-show trophies; a back
room downstairs contains more framed newspapers and pictures. Much
of it is from Harman's personal collection.
</P>
<P>
   He gives a brief tour: Here's a rare stirrup marked ``Fort
Worth, Texas,'' made by a local company for Texas Rangers based in
the city. And over here, a pair of chaps with gold studs that spell
out ``Texas'' _ ``The cowboys were real proud of being from
Texas,'' Harman says, ``so Texas things like that got into the
decoration pretty often.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes photographs by Erwin Smith, and loads of
old Texas maps. Harman points to one: ``You've got Marshall,
Athens, Hillsboro, Phantom Hill _ no Dallas, no Fort Worth.''
Hanging on a wall in the visitor's center is another one, dating
from about 1845. State population: 213,000.
</P>
<P>
   And here's something to study: A turn-of-the-century brand
inspector's book that shows the brands of cattle owners across the
state, providing key information about Texas history. ``It's
exciting ... to touch something with that much history,'' Harman
says, knowing how many miles its owner must have carried it on
horseback around Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Harman says he feels fortunate that his interests and hobbies
contribute to his work. Visitors want to know about the city's
western heritage _ and Harman has ``a certain level of knowledge so
I can talk about western lore and the hats and the boots and the
history and things like that in a reasonable way,'' he says. ``I
think the job and the personal interest have really come
together.''

   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A lot of heavy philosophizing goes on about
why people want to see scary movies. Real life is just too
frightening, too unknown, too daunting to deal with, so we run to
the movies to see something far worse. We go for the improbable but
eerily possible set-up and then the tidy close that the world can't
ever seem to get in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Horror films _ whether their leading villain is a sci-fi alien,
supernatural creature, homicidal demon or satanic warlord _ bore
into that primal ooze inside us, reaching into our nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics say horror films rise in popularity at the same
rate of extreme social and cultural stress. They provide a
drug-free adrenaline rush _ violence at a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the indie standout just released on
video, had extraordinary success this year but it is only one of
many terrifying films that can help you mark Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Forthwith, here is a list of the must-see classics, with baby
boomer biases, teen-slasher prototypes, quality British and good
ol' flicks in any genre, conducted from an unscientific poll of
friends, colleagues and those strange slasher-and-horror movie
buffs who tend to glow in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   If there was one trend among them, most were unable to come up
with just one great scary film. They couldn't do it, which goes to
show that our list is for suggestions only, not intended as the
last word.
</P>
<P>
   We left out a lot of the contemporary B, teen-slasher flicks
because frankly they are just not good and seem to go mostly for
the a knee-jerk gore shock value.
</P>
<P>
   If you are Internet friendly, check the www.esplatter.com Web
site for comprehensive lists and reviews of horror and slasher
movies. While you are there, don't miss ``Lucius Gore's'' top six
most disgusting movies ever. (They are not on our list.) Another
great place to explore the Halloween genre can be found at

</P>
<P>
   Still Scary After All These Years
</P>
<P>
   ``PSYCHO,'' 1960. The Alfred Hitchcock thriller with
secretary/embezzler Janet Leigh meeting ultimate psycho and weird
son Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, in the role that
marked his character until his death more than three decades later.
The infamous stabbing in the shower is so terrifying that Leigh was
rumored to avoid showers for years. No blood ever, but everything
seethes. Incredibly charged sex scenes with John Gavin at the
beginning, and not a naked torso in sight. (The Hitchcock runner-up
is ``The Birds,'' 1963, with leading actress Tippi Hedren suffering
nightmares for years after filming.)
</P>
<P>
   ``NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD,'' 1968. Director George Romero's
shaky camera, ``Blair Witch''-style, pseudo-style horror flick
about strange atmospheric changes that cause the dead to rise from
their graves and go on a flesh-eating, murderous rampage across the
Pennsylvania countryside. Within the first 10 minutes, the horror
begins, and there is little let up. Especially disturbing: zombies
tearing apart one victim, piece by piece, organ by organ.
</P>
<P>
   They Couldn't Make It Today
</P>
<P>
   ``FREAKS,'' 1932. The macabre movie using real circus ``freaks''
like Siamese twins, dwarfs, armless and legless men and women that
was one of the last made by director Tod Browning. It was Browning
who nurtured Lon Chaney Sr. and the silent horror film, as well as
launched stage actor Bela Lugosi in the classic ``Dracula'' the
year before. While ``Freaks'' is a compassionate take on the lives
circus people, Browning was accused of exploitation, and the film
went into near-obscurity for decades. Still, stunning and
thought-provoking.
</P>
<P>
   Truly Disturbing
</P>
<P>
   ``ROSEMARY'S BABY,'' 1968. Director Roman Polanski's take on the
unholy conception and birth of the devil, with Mia Farrow as the
unwilling mother married to John Cassavetes, a beguiling and
handsome husband who sells his soul to further his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE EXORCIST,'' 1973. More devil stuff. This time,
Oscar-winning ``French Connection'' director William Friedkin's
shocking, truly thoughtful (if you pay attention to the story and
not just the antics of a spinning neck) film of William Peter
Blatty's story of the devil vs. religion in the body of possessed
13-year-old Linda Blair. Mom Ellen Burstyn brings in a priest,
Jason Miller, and the king of exorcists, Max Von Sydow.
</P>
<P>
   ``HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER,'' 1989. Tough to take,
based on a real-life Texas serial killer. It is scary and can make
you feel you are watching a snuff film. Seering psychological
drama; no kid stuff here.
</P>
<P>
   The Classics _ See Them in Their Pure State
</P>
<P>
   ``FRANKENSTEIN,'' 1931. Director James Whale's adaptation of
Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein and the monster he created made
Boris Karloff a deserved star. This is a treat. (Also delightful,
the 1935 ``Bride of Frankenstein'' with Elsa Lancaster.)
</P>
<P>
   ``DRACULA,'' 1931. Bela Lugosi's breakthrough screen role, as
the Transylvanian vampire who needs to suck the blood of others for
his own eternity. Lugosi, unable to ever really shake off the role,
parodied himself in later years and was buried in 1956 with his
vampire cape.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MUMMY,'' 1932. Boris Karloff again in the title role of
Im-ho-tep, a lost ancient Egyptian magician.
</P>
<P>
   ``KING KONG,'' 1933. Still-terrifying special effects now taken
for granted puts the gorilla monster with Fay Wray in his arms atop
the Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``CAT PEOPLE,'' 1942. Subtle, the first of horror producer Val
Lewton's films. Sexual horror with new bride Simone Simon cursed
with an ancient panther inside her who arises when she is aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BODY SNATCHER,'' 1945. A must for today's genetic
engineers, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi together in a Robert Wise
film, an adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson story on
unethical doctor who doesn't care how he gets the research bodies.
``You can't build life the way you put blocks together,'' says
Karloff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the Top
</P>
<P>
   ``BLACK CHRISTMAS,'' 1974. Presages the ``chick/slasher'' films
of later years, with sorority sis Olivia Hussey, doomed friend
Margot Kidder, weirdo boyfriend Keir Dullea in a Canadian thriller
about a killer hiding in a sorority house attic, making obscene
phone calls and knocking off a few residents at Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   ``HALLOWEEN,'' 1978. John Carpenter's widely imitated genre
teen-slasher film, with psycho killer escaping from mental ward and
returning to the neighborhood where he killed on Halloween 15 years
earlier. Bad girl gets it, leading to a heroic struggle by innocent
baby sitter Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of ``Psycho'' star Janet
Leigh), completely clothed, in her first movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SHINING,'' 1980. It's a Jack Nicholson kind of thing; you
gotta love him to go for this screen adaptation of the edgy Stephen
King novel with all of director Stanley Kubrick's excesses intact.
Shelley Duvall is a kick as his naive wife. Nicholson hits all his
notes, long before the notorious ``Here's Johnny'' ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``SCREAM,'' 1996. ``Nightmare on Elem Street'' director Wes
Craven scored a hit with the high school and 20-something crowd
with this teen-slasher flick about worried good girl Neve Campbell,
daughter of mother killed by a serial killer. Lots of gore,
in-jokes and so much hopeless teen stuff that it's instant camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``RAVENOUS,'' 1999. Cannabalism, the Civil War and Indian
folklore. Scary stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Classy British-style Suspense
</P>
<P>
   ``CURSE OF THE DEMON,'' 1958. Skeptical psychologist Dana
Andrews is invited to England to research the devil cult. The film
opens with shadowy shot of Stonehenge, and then some well-appointed
and articulate men sitting in a lovely parlor sipping brandy and
discussing murder and the occult. Very fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAUNTING,'' 1960. Just one of the many great films by
director Robert Wise an adaptation of the Shirley Jackson story
about young s Julie Harris caught in the spell of a haunted
house. Sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury called this film one of the best,
with Claire Bloom, two classy actresses having such a good time in
the early part of their stunning careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED,'' 1963. Sequel to but better than the
1960 ``Village of the Damned,'' ``Village'' is a Cold War parable
about six alien, highly intelligent children born to earth mothers
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Baby Boomer Biases
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL,'' 1951. Terrific sci-fi with
articulate alien Michael Rennie touching down in Washington to
issue an anti-nuke message to the powers that be, stopping all
machinery on earth to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   ``FORBIDDEN PLANET,'' 1956. Robotic sci-fi, with space travelers
encountering Walter Pidgeon, his daughter and the exacting Robbie
the Robot on a planet he has made his own personal empire, a la
Shakespeare's ``Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE BAD SEED,'' 1956. Talk about challenging children. Patty
McCormack as 8-year-old girl who seems to have inherited her
grandmother's murderous tendencies. Subtle psychological terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TINGLER,'' 1959. This is the famous William Castle flick
that got the director in trouble for rigging some movie theater
seats with electric buzzers to heighten the fear experience. I
``watched'' much of the movie with my cousin's jacket over my head
at a Saturday matinee, but have since seen it again on video, and
swear it is still scary in places and really funny in others. With
the always eloquent and inspired Vincent Price as the doctor who
discovers the source of human fear is a scorpion-like creature that
lives in our spines.
</P>
<P>
   Good Story, Fine Film in Any Genre
</P>
<P>
   ``INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS,'' 1956 and the 1978 remake.
Both very fine, the earlier version with Kevin McCarthy discovering
alien, emotionless pod people, who replicate and take over the
town. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum show up in
the '78 version with pod people in San Francisco, sounding
strangely very Werner Erhard-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE,'' 1962. A fine second act to
their careers, Bette Davis losing her own mind as she terrorizes
her crippled sister Joan Crawford in the lonely old house they
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE,'' 1965. Bette Davis again, this
time as demented spinster haunted by 30-year-old murder and
terrorized by a not-as-sweet-as-she-seems Olivia de Haviland.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE WICKER MAN,'' 1973. Edward Woodward as a straight-arrow,
religious British constable who travels to an island to investigate
the disappearance of a young girl and discovers pagan free love and
sacrifices. Horror star Christopher Lee as the cult leader in
sideburns, long hair and tweed jacket, swaying to ritual Celtic
songs, considered it his best role. Fans of today's ``Burning Man''
festivals will enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Just For the Fun of It
</P>
<P>
   ``TROG,'' 1970. Joan Crawford's last movie, and she tries to
play it straight, but can't help herself, thank goodness, as
accomplished anthropologist and reluctant spelunker who takes in a
prehistoric cave dweller, known as a troglodyte, tames and mothers
him and fights the evil local developer who wants Trog killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HUNGER,'' 1983. Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie and Susan
Sarandon. Kinky vampire Deneuve looking for blood to survive, with
Bowie as her companion and Sarandon the victim. Need we say more?
</P>
<P>
   ``BEETLEJUICE,'' 1988. Outrageous Tim Burton flick with a
fabulous, utterly uninhibited Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse helping
a dead couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) killed in a car
accident get the new people out of their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``ED WOOD'' 1994. One more from Tim Burton, a touching movie
with Johnny Depp as the real-life Ed Wood, who made some of the
worst sci-fi horror flicks of all time. With Martin Landau, amazing
as the aging Bela Lugosi. Fans of the old classic horror and sci-fi
films cannot miss this film.

MELLOWER NOW, A RESOLUTE ROMANTIC KEEPS TRYING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Ann Daly is teaching a seminar on Pina Bausch at the University of
Texas at Austin.  
 By ANN DALY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The reports from Germany confirm it: Pina Bausch has
mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone are the days of the all-too-ugly battle of the sexes,''
announced one critic. Another wrote that the artistic director of
the Pina Bausch Tanztheater Wuppertal ``has become gentle,''
displaying a ``new and almost old-fashioned tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissing couples abound, as do scenic projections of erotically
bursting petals and shivering stamens. Last year's ``Masurca Fogo''
was described as ``an often funny, cheerfully melancholic piece.''
This summer, ``O Dido'' turned out to be more sensual than
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   This ``kinder, gentler Pina'' was glimpsed by New Yorkers as
early as 1994, when the company performed ``Two Cigarettes in the
Dark'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. When the troupe returned
with ``Der Fensterputzer'' (``The Window Washer'') in 1997, the New
York dance press, which had largely dismissed Ms. Bausch's initial
appearances in the mid-1980s as Eurotrash, was quick to note the
production's lighter touch _ its lyrical music, delightful humor
and joyful dancing.
</P>
<P>
   This romantic impulse should come as no surprise, really. The
perpetual yearning, the sublime terror, the mysterious symbolism _
the belief in the possibility of love in the face of
incontrovertible evidence to the contrary _ have always underpinned
the Wuppertal productions, albeit with a post-modern edge. The very
fact that Ms. Bausch continues to probe the human condition, after
having explored its foulest, most malignant territories, bespeaks
the romantic's refusal to surrender to rational argument. What Ms.
Bausch once explained about her dancers applies most of all to
herself: she is not repeating herself; she is trying again.
</P>
<P>
   The Pina Bausch Tanztheater Wuppertal returns to the Brooklyn
Academy for its seventh appearance this week (Tuesday and Thursday
through next Sunday), after a monthlong tour in California, Arizona
and Texas. This time, the company brings the 1995 production,
``Danzon,'' one of only two dances in the repertory that feature
Ms. Bausch onstage.
</P>
<P>
   She performs her pensive solo partnered by enormous and
splendidly colored fish swimming in projection behind her. 
a certain innocence to ``Danzon,'' and Keatsian melancholy. It ends
with a recollection of mortality by the elderly Goethe, who, after
revisiting one of his youthful poems, concludes, ``Now we can
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's cultlike appeal to audiences began in New York
during its debut at the academy 15 years ago. The critical response
was just as strong, but hardly devotional. The formalists accused
Ms. Bausch of being a feminist, and the feminists (myself included)
accused her of being a nihilist.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips with Ms. Bausch's 25-year oeuvre at such a
remove from Wuppertal is difficult. We see only a small selection
from the 33-work repertory every few years, out of sequence and out
of sync with her current work. The density and protraction of each
piece demands repeated viewings, but if you want to study
videotapes, a small monitor in a cramped theater basement in
Wuppertal is your only option.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``Nur Du'' (``Only You''), Ms. Bausch's 1996
co-production with several American universities in the Southwest
and California, that laid bare the fundamental romanticism of her
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Act II opens with a despondent dancer, Julie Shanahan,
approaching the edge of a redwood forest as if she were arriving at
the rehearsal studio _ dressed in her civies, dance bag slung over
her shoulder. Standing with her back to the audience, she is the
lonely figure out of a Caspar David Friedrich landscape, humbled by
the exalted vista spread out before her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shanahan confides to the trees that she doesn't have any
ideas. Or any costume. She's not wearing high heels. But still, she
came anyway. ``I don't have a hairdo,'' she continues. ``I'm not
wearing makeup. I'm sorry. Anyway, I still came.'' And then she
screams.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, just showing up is an act of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Like her mentor, Kurt Jooss, who is best known for his prescient
1932 antiwar masterpiece, ``The Green Table,'' Ms. Bausch connects
most powerfully not with any esthetic tradition or artistic style,
but with her life and times, especially its proliferating
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cafe Muller,'' ``Blaubart'' (``Bluebeard'') and ``Kontakthof''
(``Contact Courtyard'') were created during the worst years of West
German terrorist kidnapping, hijacking and murder. ``Blaubart,''
the choreographer later recalled, dealt with her fear of violence,
and dealt with it in an extreme manner befitting that particular
moment in her life.
</P>
<P>
   When these dances were presented in New York, Ms. Bausch was
roundly denounced for her bleak and brutal vision of humanity.
Perhaps only now, after the accumulated horrors of the Columbine
High School shootings, a Texas lynching and a homophobic murder,
can we appreciate the wonder, even the triumph, of ``going on'' _
in life or in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Bausch, the fact of the theater as a communal space
where feelings can be shared and meaning generated constitutes its
source of strength and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marvel not why someone dies outside his lover's tent,'' says
the actress Mechthild Grossmann in the 1989 film, ``Die Klage der
Kaiserin'' (``The Plaint of the Empress''). ``I marvel though when
someone loves and still goes on with life.'' Ms. Bausch's works
have always addressed the abyss between desire and reality in one
form or another, most often in the crucible of male-female
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We long for love or autonomy or perfection. We rarely, if ever,
get it, but we'll die trying. And in the meantime, we'll make
theater out of its shadows. But instead of smoothing over that
desperate chasm, Hollywood-style, Ms. Bausch adapts its structure _
incompletion, fragmentation, disruption and interruption _ as a way
to inhabit and inspect it more fully.
</P>
<P>
   What diverted our attention from Ms. Bausch's romantic
disposition was the veneer of gritty hyper-realism in her wok. The
dancers share their own memories and stories, manhandle each other
and plow their way across dirt, grass and water. The scenery looks
so real that it's obviously fake.
</P>
<P>
   By playing conspicuously with the open secret of theatrical
illusion, Ms. Bausch overturns the usual presumption that art
mirrors life. Acting becomes the primal behavior and our own
performance anxieties just so many variants on the actor's almost
unbearable vulnerability: the desire to be loved and the fear of
rejection; the desire to be seen and the fear of humiliation; the
desire to show off and the fear of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bausch's art aspires to the condition of poetry in order to
express the inexpressible. Choreography then becomes a search for
the external form _ images and pictures, mostly _ of what she
already knows but cannot yet articulate. There is an exact
knowledge somewhere, she said, circling her hands around her body
and her head during a recent lecture in Austin, ``but I don't know
where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the sightless but insightful princess she portrayed
in Fellini's film ``E la Nave Va'' (``And the Ship Sails On''), Ms.
Bausch gropes toward form and clarity by asking her dancers
questions. When choreographing site-specific commissions, she
begins with several weeks of ``research'' on location.
</P>
<P>
   Her entire career (even she admits that the repertory feels like
one long dance) has been a sustained inquiry into human behavior,
onstage and off. ``It always starts with life,'' Ms. Bausch says.
``Why are we together? Why are people dancing? What does it mean?
Why does it mean?'' Her answers, each one provisional, are
necessarily but not explicitly political.
</P>
<P>
   What few artist-philosophers we have left in this country are
writers or artists, and certainly not choreographers. Bill T. Jones
is the exception who proves the rule.
</P>
<P>
   According to high modernist decorum, choreographers are supposed
to confine their attention to matters of form and style and leave
the muck of human relations to politicians and popular culture. (In
other words, stay barefoot and in the studio.) But hasn't modern
dance always been responsible for rooting out the telling gesture?
</P>
<P>
   Surely Ms. Bausch learned about that when she studied with
Antony Tudor, a 20th-century master of the dramatic ballet. With an
auteur's radically subjective eye, Ms. Bausch has pursued to its
logical extreme Martha Graham's dictum that ``movement never
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s Ms. Bausch was a favored student of Graham's
mentor, Louis Horst, at the Juilliard school in New York. Horst was
a notoriously rigorous composition teacher, and the German exchange
student apparently learned her lessons well. Her Tanztheater is
crammed with telling gestures, arresting images and intense
emotions. But ``in the end,'' she once remarked to an interviewer,
``it's composition.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Study of Modern Dance Forms'' (1961), Horst
included dances of ``introspection,'' ``expressionism'' and
``impressionism,'' which sound remarkably like Tanztheater. ``The
impressionist dance,'' for example, ``has a romantic tone but still
achieves the dissonance that belongs to our time. It arouses an
intensity of attention by its very failure to complete, which is
hauntingly affecting.
</P>
<P>
   The style has been used by contemporary choreographers to create
a poetic mood with a modern texture, removed from any specific
development of a plot.'' He offered as an example Tudor's ``Lilac
Garden,'' whose leading role, the unfulfilled bride-to-be, Ms.
Bausch herself danced under his direction.
</P>
<P>
   It may well turn out, in hindsight, that Ms. Bausch was a
romantic post-modernist after all. (The film director Rainer Werner
Fassbinder called himself a ``romantic anarchist.'') What looked at
first to be clotted angst appears, with some distance, to contain
at least the fantasy of some human solace.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anomie and exhaustion, the Wuppertal productions
have never trafficked in anger, and maybe that's why they've been
able to outpace the despair.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, maybe age is nature's palliative. ``Perhaps the
older we get,'' Ms. Bausch wondered aloud, while still in her early
40s, ``the more we fight for love?'' Now facing 60, she has renewed
her pursuit of the beautiful. Next year she will direct a Wuppertal
production of ``Kontakthof'' _ her most riveting confrontation
between the sexes _ with senior citizens. ``In old age, too, there
is beauty,'' she says.

THE EFFORT OF A LIFETIME FOR BIOGRAPHER AND SUBJECT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, France)   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Norman Sherry, a deeply cultivated scholar of English
literature, has been working for more than 20 years on a
three-volume authorized biography of Graham Greene, and that
otherwise happy fact leads to a melancholy observation. Sherry's
first two volumes have been praised by critics. Yet it is close to
a certainty that a relatively small number of people, including
those who love Greene, will buy any of Sherry's eventual three
volumes, and even fewer will read them.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of massive literary biography in general:
the two volumes on Samuel Taylor Coleridge by Richard Holmes,
Benita Eisler's recent 837-page life of Lord Byron, Phyllis
Grosskurth's earlier 510-page work on the same subject, Kenneth R.
Johnston's 963 pages on ``The Hidden Wordsworth: Poet, Lover,
Rebel, Spy,'' or Richard West's recent ``Daniel Defoe,'' a fine and
relatively slender work at 427 pages with the intriguing subtitle
``The Life and Strange, Surprising Adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   In the publishing industry, literary biographies are generally
not profit-making ventures. The authors spend many years
researching and writing them, testimony to the old adage that the
most honorable work does not always bring the most cash. Yet
massive and less massive biographies of writers continue to be
produced and published. This month there is Judith Thurman's
``Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette,'' nine years after Ms.
Thurman's prize-winning biography of Isak Dinesen. There is Fred
Kaplan's new 850-page biography of Gore Vidal, and recent
biographies of William Styron and T.S. Eliot. Soon to be published
are James Atlas' biography of Saul Bellow, Belinda Jack's life of
George Sand and others.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to wax sardonic about encyclopedia-length literary
biographies, to treat them as strange obsessions, eerie instances
of Freudian transference, or maybe just the underused, academized
products of a literary underworld financed by foundations.
Certainly many of them are too long, and take too long to write. I
can see being Greene, but spending two decades reconstructing his
life seems like the very definition of literary vicariousness.
</P>
<P>
   There is something strange about the genre of literary
biography, something unnerving in the degree of dedication to
another person that it requires. But there is something strange and
unnerving about literature too, and that is the point: literary
biography is an emblem of the strength of our commitment to
literature and hence to civilization. It is a mark of seriousness
at a time that, let's face it, is not very serious.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Sherry, who previously wrote a two-volume
biography of Joseph Conrad and single volumes on Jane Austen and
the Bronte sisters, is an author to be highly regarded. What's
more, his two volumes on Greene are hard to put down.
</P>
<P>
   To put this another way: in the age of ``The X-Files'' and
``Lethal Weapon 9'' (or whatever number we're up to now), it's
reassuring that room can still be made for ancient instrument
ensembles, newly discovered cuts of ``Grand Illusion'' and
prolonged examinations of the lives and works of the writers. That
our culture still produces long literary biographies tells us that
we are not engulfed by junk after all, that the bottom line does
not determine absolutely everything.
</P>
<P>
   Gustave Flaubert once said that he wanted to lead a calm and
boring life so he could be untamed and savage in his novels. The
suggestion is that writers, unlike, say, presidents or explorers of
Antarctica, lead lives of solitude and secondhandness that make
them dull subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not true. Flaubert himself had an eventful life,
which, among many other things, included contracting venereal
disease in Egypt and a tempestuous, letter-producing love affair
with Louise Colet. Greene was a spy for the British during World
War II, which is what brought him to Sierra Leone, the setting for
``The Heart of the Matter.''
</P>
<P>
   For his research, Sherry is said to have visited every place
that figured in Greene's adventuresome life, which makes writing
the biography sound like fun. (Earlier, Sherry duplicated the sea
voyages of Conrad.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, why do some writers devote years of their lives to the
lives of other writers? Why do publishers continue to publish their
sometimes oversize products?
</P>
<P>
   The second question is easier to answer than the first: some
literary biographies do actually earn money, especially in foreign
and paperback sales. Even when they don't, which is most of the
time, literary biographies add luster to a publisher's list and to
the publishing house itself. Besides, editors at publishing houses
are often serious people who wish to do serious work. It is
rewarding to publish a biography of William Blake even if you pay
the rent with vampire novels or the recipes of Oprah Winfrey's
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these motivations apply to the biographers themselves,
especially the concern for literary reputation and literary
seriousness. One could uncharitably say of biographers what
Flaubert uncharitably said of critics: ``One becomes a critic when
one cannot be an artist, just as a man becomes a stool pigeon when
he cannot be a soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   That line, especially the part about the soldier and the stool
pigeon, may be one of the few stupid things Flaubert ever said. But
substitute biographer for critic and there is something to ponder
here. Literary biography is an act of love qualified by envy. It is
estranged identification, or more. Holmes, the biographer of
Coleridge, once said of Leon Edel, the author of the monumental and
magisterial five-volume work on Henry James, that he was ``a
parable of the modern literary biographer's self-immolation in his
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   If writers are the forgers of consciousness, how revealing an
endeavor it is to chronicle the forging. That consciousness is both
public and private, and that is why literary biographers spend a
good deal of time on the private, including the sexual, dimensions
of their subjects. It is interesting to know that the author of
``The End of the Affair'' was at one point juggling a wife and two
mistresses even as he was working for British intelligence. We know
that about Greene thanks to Sherry's indefatigable research.
</P>
<P>
   I myself right now am reading Ms. Thurman's biography of
Colette, a figure who stood at the very beginning of our age of
erotic self-expression and androgynous self-exploration. Ms.
Thurman, an accomplished writer, spent nine years on Colette. From
what I have read so far, it seems to have been worth it.

CHARLES SCHULZ TO BUILD PEANUTS MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE McCOY   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Cartoonist Charles Schulz has finally found
a home for Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus and Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Rosa's most famous resident, who began drawing his
``Peanuts'' strip in 1950, is building a 17,000-square-foot museum
as a repository for his half-century of work _ a career interrupted
by only a five-week vacation two years ago to celebrate his 75th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story museum, replete with several galleries to display
Schulz's mind-boggling body of work and an 11,600-square-foot
courtyard, will be built in Santa Rosa across the street from the
Redwood Empire Ice Arena that Schulz built in 1969. There was no
cost estimate available for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled they're going to build it,'' Santa Rosa Mayor
Janet Condron said Tuesday, just before she and the rest of the
City Council enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed a rezoning
that will clear the way for construction to begin on the 1.6-acre
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of artifacts and art will be on display. It will be a
real tourist attraction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While almost any rezoning or construction project usually
involves some level of public opposition, particularly when four
heritage oak trees are scheduled to be axed as is scheduled as part
of Schulz's project, there were no dissenting voices present to
oppose the city's most celebrated resident.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jack Osborne, a council watcher who routinely voices a
dissenting view on issues before the council at least half a dozen
times per meeting, was in support. ``How can anyone oppose Charlie
Schulz?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old cartoonist is expected to apply for a building
permit within a month, with construction targeted to begin next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Once built, the two-story building will house an array of
galleries to display Schulz's work, a 99-seat theater, an
educational and research center along with offices. But mostly it
will provide plenty of room to display Schulz's work and
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The strip, which began appearing in seven papers including the
San Francisco Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune on Oct. 2, 1950,
now appears in 2,600 newspapers in 75 countries.
</P>
<P>
   It has spawned much more than a daily comic strip. The
``Peanuts'' characters have been the subject of plays, books,
recordings and TV movies. Along the way, Schulz has won five Emmys,
two Peabody Awards and the French Order of Arts and Letters.

FINDING THE REALITY THAT LIES JUST BEYOND THE REAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>

 Miles Unger is the managing editor of Art New England magazine.  
 By MILES UNGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Gregory Gillespie's ``Self-Portrait in a
Black Shirt'' (1968-69) is one of those remarkable paintings that,
if known only in reproduction, creates a startling effect when seen
in person.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing it is surprisingly small, less than one foot
square. For another, even at this scale it packs a wallop. Its
aggressive physical presence is due in part to the subject, which
shows the young artist with a scowl that seems to say he wouldn't
mind socking you one, but it is also conveyed by the obsessive
technique in which every hair and fold of skin is rendered in tiny
strokes of the brush, a technique learned by studying 15th-century
tempera paintings. The intensity of the figure is perfectly matched
by the obsessiveness of the technique; each is a sign of someone
prepared to go to the mat, to take things to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   When Gillespie made this painting, included in his traveling
retrospective of 39 works on view through Jan. 2 at the List Visual
Arts Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it
offered a challenge to both prevailing abstract movements and to
Pop irony. In fact, its assertiveness has more in common with the
contemporaneous works of the Minimalists than it does with the
emotionally distant portraits of Warhol or the chilly precision of
the photorealists.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, now 63 and exhibiting in the flesh none of the
pugnaciousness of that early self-portrait, seems to have accepted
his outsider status. Despite having works in the collections of the
Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, he has never fit comfortably into
any of the movements that have come and gone during his almost
40-year career. His works were tagged early on with the realist
label, but it is a term that he has always rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought of myself as a realist,'' explains
Gillespie, who still sports the droopy mustache and close-cropped
hair, now gray, of that youthful essay in self-scrutiny. ``For me,
when I'm painting an object, if it starts getting distorted, just
when a realist would stop it _ a vase or a face that's getting
lopsided or the nose is getting too big _ I'll say: That's
interesting. Let's go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such distortions apply as much to character as to form. If the
belligerence of ``Self-Portrait in a Black Shirt'' seems in
retrospect less a revelation of personality than a costume tried on
for effect, the passion that Gillespie brings to everything he
paints is genuine. His meticulous trompe-l'oeil technique, coupled
with a willingness to pursue the subconscious twists of his mind,
can take him into strange territory indeed.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Life With Watermelon'' (1986-87), a grotesque little
putto of ambiguous but prominent sexuality peers at a watermelon
with grave suspicion. And no wonder, for the fruit in question
resembles, with its lobes and folds, nothing so much as a great
glistening brain in shades of green.
</P>
<P>
   The creature is one of the many hybrid forms that crop up in
Gillespie's work, derived through a process of automatic drawing, a
technique invented by the Surrealists in which the artist's
meandering hand traces arabesques that presumably reveal the secret
workings of the mind. All pink, fleshy protuberances, this
implausible being, like everything else in his work, is realized
with hallucinatory conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of Gillespie's style can perhaps be traced to the
profound impression left by his Roman Catholic upbringing. ``I've
always thought that in some deep ways Catholicism has had a huge
effect on my art, as it has on my soul,'' says Gillespie,
remembering his childhood struggle with sin and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Works like ``Confirmation Shrine'' (1990) deliberately mimic
altarpieces and other religious furnishings where sacred objects
are gathered together to heal the soul. Gillespie's art exhibits an
emotional response to physical things that recalls the impulse
behind the reliquary and the votive offering. For him, art's
transformations and illusionistic enigmas are sacred stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie has never lost his childhood obsession with sin,
though his religious beliefs have evolved over the years, as the
frequent Buddhist and Hindu symbols in his paintings attest. He
explains, ``Buddhism says there's a reason why you're suffering and
that suffering can be understood through introspection and by
understanding the way the mind works.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of self-portraiture in Gillespie's oeuvre makes
such introspection concrete. It is a process of self-examination
made urgent by the specter of mental illness that has stalked his
family. He is reluctant to talk about this painful history, though
he confesses: ``I walk around with the feeling that things could
fall apart. I allow a lot of chaos in and try to work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than eliminating troubling elements, Gillespie holds them
front and center, the better to tame them. His is an art of
precarious balances: between chaos and order, carnality and
transcendent spirituality, the quotidian and the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   These tensions are perhaps best captured in ``Myself Painting a
Self-Portrait'' (1980-81), which shows the artist in thrall to the
leering twin he is limning, like one of those fabled ventriloquists
possessed by their puppets.
</P>
<P>
   With his haunted look, the ``real'' Gillespie, paint brush in
hand, seems far less in control than his loosely sketched
counterpart. But standing outside the frame is the invisible artist
who, having conjured the scene, is master of all the chaos he has
unleashed.

BRINGING POLISH TO A `PROFANE' MASTERPIECE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Lawrence A. Johnson writes about music for The Chicago Tribune, The
New Criterion and Opera News.  
 By LAWRENCE A. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even amid the dizzying heterogeneity of 20th-century musical
styles, ``Carmina Burana,'' by the German composer Carl Orff,
remains one of a kind. Written in 1936, this ``profane cantata''
sets medieval Latin texts depicting the pleasures of drink,
gambling and divers country matters.
</P>
<P>
   Primitive in its harmonic cast and rhythmic vitality, the music
conveys a raw elemental quality befitting the sensuality of the
texts. If the devil gets the best tunes in opera, the sinners in
Orff's work get the best choruses.
</P>
<P>
   A less jocose factor is the scent of contemporary Nazi strains
lurking in the work, in both the elevation of the primal and the
exaltation of the Bavarian Volk ideal. Early performances were
lavishly staged in the late '30s, and photographs of those
productions bear an unsettling similarity to Leni Riefenstahl
spectacles extolling the robust physicality of National Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   That immutable taint apart, Orff's score remains a glorious
musical achievement, and ``Carmina Burana'' has enjoyed fine
advocacy on disk, with recordings by Eugene Ormandy, Andre Previn,
Herbert Blomstedt and Leonard Slatkin among the most distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Thielemann's new version with the Chorus and Orchestra
of the Deutsche Oper Berlin (Deutsche Grammophon 453 587-2; CD)
finds an admirable balance between refinement and intensity,
avoiding the standard-issue garrulity too common in performances of
this work. For all the high-gloss orchestral sheen here, Thielemann
also uncovers myriad details of scoring and expression.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any lack of drive or fervor, with the orchestral
clarity only adding to the impact of Orff's more uninhibited pages.
Indeed, Thielemann galvanizes his forces to playing and singing of
tremendous dynamism, and the joyous rhythms of ``On the Green'' and
the riotous drinking choruses have rarely registered with such
Dionysian abandon.
</P>
<P>
   There is more here, too, than a fast ride in a monastic sex
machine. The moments of introspection are just as atmospherically
presented, as in the plaintive chantlike section of ``The Merry
Face of Spring,'' where the conductor sensitively details the
sadness underlying the search for ephemeral physical pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Keenlyside, a warm-voiced baritone, contributes more
elegant singing than is usually heard in this music. Perhaps his
``Burning Inside'' lacks something in pointed bitterness, but the
bibulous Abbot's song emerges as genuinely tragic, generously
swathed in angry self-loathing. David Kuebler's rather grainy tenor
arguably fits the song of the roasted swan.
</P>
<P>
   The tender solo ``In trutina'' has become an improbable
classical hit in England, by virtue of the sweet yet
uncomprehending performance by the preadolescent, apple-cheeked
soprano Charlotte Church. Here Christiane Oelze sings more
knowingly and with great feeling of ``submitting to the yoke,'' and
her raptly beautiful reading is one of the finest on disk.
</P>
<P>
   Thielemann elicits superb singing from the Berlin chorus, firmly
pointed yet rich and vividly atmospheric. The engineering
complements Thielemann's precision with striking clarity, although
the wide dynamic range loses focus in the chorus' quieter moments.
</P>
<P>
   This is another impressive outing for Thielemann, who seems
incapable of making a dull recording.

JUST WHERE DOES E-MAIL GO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Where do e-mail messages go between the time the sender sends
them and the recipient turns on her computer and receives them?
</P>
<P>
   L.M., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's how the compugeeks would describe it: ``First you use
PPP and TCP/IP to connect to your ISP. Then you send your message
packets at various BPS using SMTP and receive it using POP.''
</P>
<P>
   In real speak, it goes like this. When you send an email message
and your modem starts going ``EEEEK, HHHSSSSSHHH, BOING BOING''
you're connecting to a company that has an electronic gateway to
the internet. That's your Internet Service Provider (ISP). What
you're hearing is literally an electronic conversation between your
computer and theirs, using standardized programs called PPP (Point
to Point Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol). The conversation between the computers
is so they can see how fast each one is, so they can set themselves
at a mutually agreeable speed of Bytes Per Second (BPS) at which
the information is to be transferred. They're also testing to see
how strong the phone line is, to guard against mistakes in the
message. And of course they're asking each other for identifying
information like passwords and user names, to make sure it's okay
to make the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two systems have electronically agreed on the terms of
their ``conversation,'' your email program gets a signal to start
sending the message. But it doesn't send it all at once. Inside
your computer is a standardized transmission program, called SMTP,
for Simple Message Transfer Protocol. SMTP sends your message out
in chunks, called packets, which are anywhere from 100 to 2,000
bytes (characters) long. SMTP gives each packet a label (the
compufolks call them headers) to identify it. Headers include
information like ``This is packet number X, coming from Y, going to
Z, and has Q numbers of characters in it. Send back a confirmation
that you got it before I send you another packet.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't get a confirmation, it won't send the rest of the
packets. The idea of breaking the message into packets is to catch
any electronic errors that would make the message unreadable,
before the whole thing is sent.
</P>
<P>
   When the packets get to the ISP, the receiving computer
reassembles them into one whole message. A computer looks at the
information on the right hand side of the ``(at)'' symbol, the
domain name. Let's say you sent something to howwhy(at)globe.com.
The ``globe.com'' part is the domain name. It's the post office to
which to send your mail.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a small local ISP company, it may send your message
directly to the domain name computer. More likely it will send your
message to a bigger internet company, run by firms like GTE or MCI,
since they have giant lists of all domain names and know where to
send messages.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally arrives at the domain name post office, the
server (a computer dedicated to one basic use, in this case email)
looks at the address on the left of the ``(at)'' symbol, the
``howwhy'' part, and puts the message into a file with that address
name. It's like your personal post office box. And there it waits
until you turn on your computer and tell it to ``Check Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the ``EEEEK,HHHSSSSSHHH, BOING BOING'' is the Post
Office Protocol (POP client) in your computer, talking to the POP
server holding your message.
</P>
<P>
   The digi-conversation goes like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any mail for L.M.?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' answers the server.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many messages?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is the first one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``4,300 bytes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Send it.''
</P>
<P>
   As best we can tell, computers don't say please or thank you.

that is just the point. After years of being clobbered by Democrats
in the annual budget fight, Republicans are aggressively aiming at

<P>
   BERLIN _ The opening of the 1,000th McDonald's restaurant in
Germany this month was supposed to be a festive occasion, a moment
to toast German-American friendship. Instead, it illustrated the
growing strains in this pivotal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard Diepgen, the mayor of Berlin, rose to speak and,
spotting John Kornblum, the American ambassador, decided to taunt
him over stalled American plans to build a new embassy on the
central Pariser Platz, next to the Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, I see the American ambassador is here,'' said Diepgen.
``Perhaps he should just go ahead and build a McDonald's restaurant
on the Pariser Platz instead of a United States Embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornblum was outraged. For several weeks now, he has been
hearing reports of comments by Diepgen to the effect that the
United States is treating Germany like a ``banana republic'' in
talks over the new embassy, whose construction has been delayed by
a dispute over how large a buffer zone it requires for security.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has had its soap-opera elements, but it is now clear
that its backdrop is serious. A decade after the end of the Cold
War, Germany is becoming extremely sensitive about the scale of the
American presence here and about any suggestion of domineering
American attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some anger over the American desire to organize the
Pariser Platz, a sense that this is still a reflex of the former
occupying powers in Berlin,'' said Peter Strieder, chairman of the
Social Democrats in the reborn German capital. ``And our position
is: No, now we are sovereign.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the United States, whose diplomatic staff is now
scattered in various buildings including the former mission to East
Germany, has been trying to show restraint over the embassy
argument, despite a vigorous feeling that a city protected for
decades by American troops should find a way to give American
diplomats a secure new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been wanting to keep this low key, but we keep getting
these diatribes in the press about arrogant Americans trying to
close down Berlin's front room,'' Kornblum said. ``All we did was
defend this place for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Obliged to function without its planned embassy, the United
States has also faced a string of complaints _ over the 59,000
American troops left in this country (down from close to 190,000 at
the end of the Cold War), over an important communications complex
near Munich, and over spies.
</P>
<P>
   The common theme has been a new German sensitivity to the huge
American presence in Germany, which grew out of the country's
postwar position at the center of the Cold War. Perhaps no other
European country has been so profoundly shaped by American power
and culture, as those 1,000 McDonald's restaurants suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, denied that a Germany now freed of its postwar
tutelage had begun to push back against the weight of the American
presence, although he acknowledged that the embassy issue was
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only be solved with tact on both sides, and I think
the United States is aware that its interests are best served when
it uses its superpower status in the right proportions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new $150 million embassy was supposed to
start this fall, but those plans have been scrapped. American
officials blame Diepgen for showing scant flexibility in trying to
adapt to new security requirements that emerged after the bombing
of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has formally requested a buffer zone of 30
meters, or about 33 yards; the city government has responded by
saying it cannot grant more than 22 meters _ about 24 yards _
without altering the alignment of streets with the nearby
Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag and so changing an important urban
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The German view _ that Washington wants to turn part of the
Tiergarten, an adjacent park, into a buffer zone, organize the
traffic flow in the Brandenburg Gate area and generally make a mess
of the heart of Berlin _ has been amply aired through leaks to the
Berlin press. A visit by Berlin city planners to Washington in
September did nothing to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all the angry words, it seems clear the real issue is
political. American officials say that there is room for some
compromise on the buffer zone, but Diepgen, a Christian Democrat,
evidently senses that standing up to the power that ran a large
part of Berlin for many postwar years now plays well with his
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other recent signs of German restiveness include complaints
about American soldiers in Germany over such issues as their tax
status and plans to drop supply contracts with German concerns in
favor of American companies, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Regular German demands that a major U.S. radar and
communications complex at Bad Ailbling, near Munich, should be shut
down or curtailed now that the Cold War is over have also caused
strains.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the United States was irked by the leaking to the
German press of an affair that the two countries had agreed to
handle discreetly: the withdrawal earlier this year of three CIA
agents in Munich who were running a safe house for Russian
defectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leak comes back to the same recurrent issue _ a German
desire to assert the country's sovereignty after the Nazi cataclysm
and the years as Cold War battleground,'' said one American
official.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new embassy, on land where the Berlin wall once stood and
where the United States had its mission before World War II, was
supposed to be an important symbol of German unification, of the
Western victory in the Cold War, and of America's central place in
the fashioning of the postwar German republic.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of an American Embassy, in an area where the other
powers that ran Berlin _ Britain, France and Russia _ all have
their missions, obviously carries an altogether different message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware that this is the historic place of the American
Embassy, and we want to see it on the Pariser Platz,'' said
Michael-Andreas Butz, a spokesman for Diepgen. ``But we simply
cannot allow the United States to help itself to a slice of the
Tiergarten.''

BUSH FOCUSES ON `BEAUTY OF ADOPTION' AT IOWA PREGNANCY CENTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBUQUE, Iowa _ Feeling his way through the issues of abortion
and adoption, George W. Bush said Wednesday he would use the
presidency to help private counseling centers that urge pregnant
women to reject abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be looking for ways that I can assist and I am open to
suggestions,'' Bush said on a visit to the Tri-State Pregnancy
Center, which counsels women toward alternatives to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In a related campaign development, Republican rival John McCain,
who has been surging in polls nationally and in first-primary state
New Hampshire while Bush's lead has been shrinking, said Wednesday
he is reconsidering his decision to skip campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   As a feature of his Republican presidential campaign, Bush has
said he wants the federal government to fund some of the social
service work of private, religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, he said the Dubuque counseling center, funded by
donations from churches and individuals, might not need or want
federal involvement _ echoing an argument often made by opponents
of government funding for private agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The center's leading staffers told Bush during his visit that
the best role for the government would instead be to encourage
donors to support their cause. Directors of other faith-based
organizations where Bush has campaigned on this theme have
expressed similar reluctance to take federal money and then abide
by federal requirements such as open hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wound up the discussion by stating, ``I don't have a
specific role in mind yet'' for the centers, which he said number
3,000 across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who says abortion should be outlawed, explained that he
came to the center with reporters in tow to highlight ``the beauty
of adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's counselors often recommend adoption as an
alternative to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events show where my heart is,'' he told a news
conference outside the brick, storefront facility.
</P>
<P>
   Bush routinely told Iowa audiences this week that he would
follow principle rather than public opinion in the White House. But
he has also said that he wouldn't be ready to press for a
constitutional amendment against abortion because the conscience of
the nation does not favor such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he rationalizes the two statements, Bush said,
``America will be ready when we value life.``
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's presidential primary caucuses take place Jan. 24, making
it the first state to award delegates for the GOP and Democratic
presidential nominations next year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will participate in at least one early January
debate in Iowa but was ``still discussing'' with advisers how much
other time and effort to expend in advance of the state's Jan. 24
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander, two
centrist GOP figures, McCain is concerned about leaving the middle
of the field to Bush. But Iowa is essentially an organizational
test that requires advanced planning and is not given to late
jump-in candidates.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has bypassed Iowa in part because of his opposition to a
federal subsidy for ethanol, a corn-based fuel additive. He made a
point of that opposition Wednesday at a news conference in New
Hampshire where he appeared amidst dried corn stalks and a black
oil barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator was also implicitly critical of the Iowa
caucuses in which participants go to precinct meetings and declare
their presidential preference when they sign in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be more competitive where there's a secret ballot,''
said McCain, who is hoping to jump-start his candidacy in New
Hampshire and then move on to the primaries in South Carolina and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Although the primary system has not historically been kind to
candidates who were choosy about where they competed, McCain said
he would stick with the old military view: ``You pick your best
ground to fight on.''

ETRADE FOUNDER DONATES $25 MILLION TO BUSINESS SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The founder of the on-line brokerage ETrade, William A. Porter,
has donated $25 million to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management for a new building intended
to foster innovative use of technology in entrepreneurship at the
47-year-old business school.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is the largest the school has received since its
founding in 1952, when Alfred P. Sloan Jr., then chairman of
General Motors, gave a grant that established the MIT School of
Industrial Management, later renamed the Sloan School.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's gift will pay for nearly half of a proposed $55 million
William A. Porter Management Center, which would contain
classrooms, faculty offices and be technologically equipped to
``lead the school into the next century,'' Sloan School dean
Richard Schmalensee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do this right, it will be the first step in moving Sloan
to a higher level,'' Schmalensee said. ``People can say, `It's only
a building.' But we intend this building to shape the way we
operate and the way we function.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, 70, an engineer who was a Sloan School fellow in 1967,
is counted as a pioneer in Internet commerce development. He began
an electronic service for stock brokers that performed the world's
first on-line trade in July 1983, and later founded ETrade
Securities Inc., the first electronically based business allowing
investors to buy and sell stock over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, headquartered in Menlo Park, Calif., now has over 1
million active accounts and a market capitalization of $5.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made some substantial money, and I'm quite wealthy now,''
Porter said in a telephone interview. ``Naturally, we give to a lot
of charities, but in talking it over with my wife, we wanted to
make a substantial gift that would help humanity. I'm a technology
guy. I believe technology makes our lives better and better here on
Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., said he wanted the money
to ``form a stronger fusion'' between the Sloan School and MIT's
scientific and technological departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT is in my opinion the best technological school in the
country, probably the world,'' he said. ``Exploiting technological
innovation requires entrepreneurship and financing and marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT officials said several committees have yet to determine who
will design the building and where it will be built, but that it is
likely to go on the east side of the Cambridge campus, near
existing economics and political science buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After its scheduled completion in 2002 or 2003, the Porter
Management Center would become a central location for faculty and
classes now spread among seven buildings, officials said.

AN EX-SOVIET REPUBLIC WHERE LENIN HAS NOT BEEN TOPPLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan _ For many years, when this Central Asian
capital was called Frunze, the busiest place on Frunze Avenue was
the Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Patriotic observances were held there, visiting dignitaries
solemnly filed by the exhibitions, and groups of schoolchildren
went to learn the values of Soviet patriotism that Frunze
exemplified.
</P>
<P>
   That has all changed. The museum halls are all but deserted, and
most people here now view Frunze, who was an early hero of the Red
Army, as a distant figure at best, an agent of brutal colonialism
at worst.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum is still open, and the street in front is still
called Frunze Avenue. Kyrgyzstan has chosen a middle path in
dealing with its 70 years of Soviet history. Unlike some other
former Soviet republics, it is seeking to overcome its past without
denying it.
</P>
<P>
   This compromise with history is also visible at the city's main
plaza. A towering statue of Lenin remains, but beside it a simple
new monument has been erected to commemorate Kyrgyzstan's
independence. Children practice their skateboard moves on the once
holy pedestal where Lenin stands, but keep a respectful distance
from the independence monument, which is flanked by a permanent
honor guard.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the National Historical Museum, which faces the plaza,
just two of the three floors are open. On the top floor are ancient
artifacts and other relics of the distant Kyrgyz past. The bottom
floor is devoted to exhibitions about the country's achievements
since it became independent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But the middle floor, which was devoted to Karl Marx and the
triumphs of communism, is dark and roped off. Administrators have
not decided what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to eliminate the history of the Soviet period,
because that's history, too,'' said the museum director, Jumaly
Momunkulov, 63, who was a baby when his father was arrested for
teaching the Koran and taken to a prison camp, from which he never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Kyrgyzstan are known for being a bit slow,''
Momunkulov said. ``We like to think for a while before we react.
When we think and go beyond our emotions, we realize that the
record of the Soviet period was not all bad. We're looking for the
right balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to deal with Frunze reflects both the way
history was used in the Soviet era and the way the new government
is dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Frunze Museum is built around a sturdy three-room house
where Frunze is said to have spent his childhood. Some historians
believe that it is not his house at all but an edifice that the
Communists built to resemble what his idealized house should have
looked like.
</P>
<P>
   Frunze became a leading Bolshevik agitator and later commanded
troops that crushed anti-Communist resistance in Central Asia and
the Caucasus. Ten months after Frunze replaced Trotsky as commissar
of war in 1925, Stalin's doctors announced that he was ill and
required an urgent operation. His own doctors protested, but to no
avail, and he died on the operating table. There is no reference to
this at the Frunze Museum.
</P>
<P>
   After having apparently ordered Frunze's murder, Stalin
eulogized him as a hero. His greatest tribute was changing the name
of Frunze's native city, Pishpek, to Frunze. The new government
changed it back to a form of its traditional name after coming to
power in 1991.

MODERN TREATMENT REMOVES THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
WICHITA FALLS, Texas:disobeyed the rules. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Out on the second-story porch, a man looks at the campus below,
his hands grasping the metal lattice that obstructs his view. But
the man's stay is more of a respite than a life sentence _ these
days, more than half the patients are sent home within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment has been progressing for decades, says hospital
Superintendent Jim Smith, and it's time for people to stop thinking
of state hospitals as ``scary places right out of grade-B movies.''
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENT TAKES TIME
</P>
<P>
   It's almost 7:30 a.m., and a daily ritual begins.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wanders over to the closed and locked medication
window in the middle of the hallway, waiting patiently for her
usual dose. Several patients obediently take their place in line
behind her.
</P>
<P>
   It's the medicine, most of which began to be developed during
the late 1950s and early 1960s, that gives patients the key to
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It's the daily dose that helps 41-year-old Kathleen Nunley see
through the fog of mental illness long enough to learn how to
balance a checkbook, plant a flower or eat a nutritious meal.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley, who was found to have an illness with symptoms similar
to schizophrenia, sits quietly in the front row of a recent
living-skills class, learning how to rent an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher is trying to show the patients how to read
classified advertisements, but the discussion is quickly
sidetracked by a woman chomping furiously on a piece of gum as she
tells the class about a big fancy house where she once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley watches the other patients, cowering in her chair as if
she were trying to avoid a blow. Perhaps she's hearing the voices
of the ghosts she believes raped her son.
</P>
<P>
   For Nunley, attending and participating in class is progress.
And every time she cooperates, she earns privileges. It could be a
trip to the canteen for a soda or an excursion off campus.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesdays, it means a chance to dance.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun shines through the stained-glass windows of the
campus chapel, ``We will, we will rock you,'' blares from the disc
jockey's speakers.
</P>
<P>
   A tall man with a white knit cap stomps around the dance floor,
weaving in and out of the other dancers, acting out every word of
every song.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crow, a handsome 23-year-old, lounges on a metal folding
chair, his baseball cap pulled down, hiding most of his face.
</P>
<P>
   But when the disc jockey plays the ``The Electric Slide,'' Crow
lifts his head as if someone had just flicked his ``on'' switch,
and walks out to the dance floor. In the middle of the song, Crow
stops dancing, returns to his chair and goes back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Life changed dramatically for Crow about three years ago. It was
then, he says, that a friend who was a witch put a curse on him,
``then turned into freakin' Satan and tried to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not believe that he has schizophrenia, rather that he
is undergoing a supernatural experience that others simply cannot
understand,'' doctors wrote in a December 1998 evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Crow's father, Denton resident Robert Crow, desperately wants
his son to heal and dutifully makes the frequent drive to Wichita
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his devotion turns to frustration, and he accuses his
son of not taking enough initiative to get better. But he hasn't
given up hope that his son will escape the demons that torment him.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING PROGRESS
</P>
<P>
   Joel Inman walks along the rows of the buried, stopping
occasionally to dust dirt off a marker or two, as if he were
brushing hair from a child's face.
</P>
<P>
   A third-generation hospital employee, Inman remembers hearing
about when his grandparents worked as attendants in the 1940s and
1950s. Inman began his career at the hospital as a teen-ager, when
he mowed the grass of the hospital cemetery. Now, he directs the
hospital's program for recent patient admissions. He believes that
it was ignorance, not cruelty, that left No. 965 and the others
like him alone in a world of anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Inman has attended a few funerals at the cemetery, but not so
many anymore. Now, families aren't afraid to bury their loved ones
with the rest of the relatives. They aren't afraid to say that the
mentally ill are beloved mothers, brothers and sons.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun peeks through the cedar trees, casting rays of light
here and there, Inman stops to pull a couple of weeds that have
covered one of the newer grave markers.
</P>
<P>
   Etched in stone, surrounded by the thousand or so markers
bearing nothing more than a number, is a name.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Nestled in the grass among a cedar grove,
the marker bears no name, no ``In loving memory of,'' no dates of
birth or death.
</P>
<P>
   It says ``965'' and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old man buried beneath the marker, alongside more
than 1,000 others interred beneath anonymous markers, suffered from
manic depression, and his illness earned him a stay at the Wichita
Falls campus of the North Texas State Hospital. Admitted in 1931
and dead by 1957, he was buried in a coffin that other patients
built.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in the era of ``lunatic asylums,'' when mental illness
was an embarrassing family secret and most patients were admitted,
abandoned and left to die.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his days shuffling aimlessly through the halls,
watching as the men and women around him babbled incoherently,
responding to the voices no one else could hear.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was electroshock-treatment day, when patients lined up
and waited to have electrodes attached to their bodies. The
electrodes delivered the electric current that made them jerk, jolt
and _ for a little while _ forget.
</P>
<P>
   No. 965 understood the consequences of uncontrollable behavior
when fellow patients returned from a frontal lobotomy, brain
surgery performed with little more than a mini pickax and a hammer,
that left them emotionless shells.
</P>
<P>
   For 26 years, No. 965 lived in a warehouse for the demented,
amid the chaos of mental illness, which few understood and almost
everyone feared.
</P>
<P>
   When hospital staff members gathered as his body was lowered
into the ground, No. 965 was, perhaps for the first time, in a
place where he could rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   A TIME OF FEAR
</P>
<P>
   Although public opinion remains mired in the past to some
degree, the subject of mental illness has grown from a family's
whisper to Tipper Gore's recent public revelation about her battle
with depression.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1922, when the Wichita Falls institution opened, people
were openly hostile and fearful of the mentally ill. So the
hospital was built on isolated land, with a trolley as the only
connection between it and the nearby town of Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's Hollywood building, which now sits vacant in the
middle of the campus, is a harsh reminder of those times. The
exclusive Hollywood facility offered a few more luxuries to its
residents _ private rooms, a beauty parlor _ but the feeling of
hopelessness remains palpable in its deserted hallways.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the hospital's 300-acre campus is not a formidable
place. It has a cottage for the family members who constantly visit
their loved ones among the 365 patients. Some patients have checked
in at the urging of relatives; others are committed by judges
because their families can no longer care for them, or because they
committed a misdemeanor and are not competent for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is no longer a prerequisite for a stay at the state
hospital; with insurance limits on mental health care, even
patients from midincome levels wind up in Whichta Falls. With the
daily cost per patient averaging $284, and a staff of 1,000, the
hospital runs a high tab of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of electroshock therapy, patients today are given
freedoms and punished with restrictions. The list of infractions is
long: hitting another patient, sneaking a cigarette, leaving the
building without permission, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent summer day, a thirtysomething woman sits on the
floor at the end of a hallway, cross-legged, facing the window, her
purse on one side, a bottle of Gatorade in hand. She sits there for
hours conversing with the voices in her head, unable to leave the
building for a group meeting because she has disobeyed the rules.

 COKE TESTS VENDING UNIT THAT CAN HIKE PRICES IN HOT WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking full advantage of the law of supply and demand, Coca-Cola
Co. has quietly begun testing a vending machine that can
automatically raise prices for its drinks in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is something the Coca-Cola Co. has been
looking at for more than a year,'' said Rob Baskin, a company
spokesman, adding that it had not yet been placed in any consumer
market.
</P>
<P>
   The potential was heralded, though, by the company's chairman
and chief executive in an interview earlier this month with a
Brazilian newsmagazine. Chairman M. Douglas Ivester described how
desire for a cold drink can increase during a sports championship
final held in the summer heat. ``So, it is fair that it should be
more expensive,'' Ivester was quoted as saying in the magazine,
Veja. ``The machine will simply make this process automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The process appears to be done simply through a temperature
sensor and a computer chip, not any breakthrough technology, though
Coca-Cola refused to provide any details Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept might seem unfair to a thirsty person, it
essentially extends to another industry what has become the
practice for airlines and other companies that sell products and
services to consumers. The falling price of computer chips and the
increasing ease of connecting to the Internet has made it practical
for companies to pair daily and hourly fluctuations in demand with
fluctuations in price _ even if the product is a can of soda that
sells for just 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for other types of innovations is great. Other
modifications under discussion at Coca-Cola, Baskin said, include
adjusting prices based on demand at a specific machine. ``What
could you do to boost sales at off-hours?'' he asked. ``You might
be able to lower the price. It might be discounted at a vending
machine in a building during the evening or when there's less
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Vending machines have become an increasingly important source of
profits for Coca-Cola and its archrival, Pepsico. Over the last
three years, the soft-drink giants have watched their earnings
erode as they waged a price war in supermarkets. Vending machines
have remained largely untouched by the discounting. Now, Coca-Cola
aims to tweak what has been a golden goose to extract even more
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of initiatives under way in Japan, the
United States and in other parts of the world where the technology
in vending is rapidly improving, not only from a
temperature-scanning capability but also to understand when a
machine is out of stock,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst
for Morgan Stanley. ``The increase in the rate of technology
breakthrough in vending is pretty dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hurley, a spokesman for the National Automatic
Merchandising Association in Washington, added: ``You are only
limited by your creativity, since electronic components are
becoming more and more versatile.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Machines are already in place that can accept credit cards and
debit cards for payment. In Australia and in North Carolina, Coke
bottlers use machines to relay, via wireless signal or telephone,
information about which drinks are selling and at what rates in a
particular location. The technology is known as intelligent
vending, Baskin said, and the information gathered and relayed by
Internet helps salespeople to figure out which drinks will sell
best in which locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all feeds into their strategy of micro-marketing and
understanding the local consumer,'' Conway said. ``If you can
understand brand preferences by geography, that has implications
for other places with similar geography.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and its bottlers have invested heavily in vending
machines, refrigerated display cases, coolers and other equipment
to sell their drinks cold. Over the last five years, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, Coke's biggest bottler, has spent more than $1.8
billion on such equipment. In support, Coca-Cola has spent millions
more on employees who monitor and service the equipment. In 1998
alone, it spent $324 million on such support to its biggest
bottler.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Coke's chief marketing officer unveiled the
company's plan to pump more sales of its flagship soft drink,
Coca-Cola Classic. The program includes a pronounced emphasis on
Coke served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of soft drinks from vending machines have risen steadily
over the last few years, though most sales still take place in
supermarkets. Last year, about 11.9 percent of soft-drink sales
worldwide came from vending machines, said John Sicher, the editor
of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. In the United States,
about 1.2 billion cases of soft drinks were sold through vending
machines.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, some vending machines already adjust their prices
based on the temperature outside, using wireless modems, said Gad
Elmoznino, director of the Trisignal division of Eicon Technology,
a Montreal-based modem maker. ``They are going to be using more and
more communications in these machines to do interactive price
setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry reactions to the heat-sensitive Coke machine ranged
from enthusiastic to sanctimonious. ``It's another reason to move
to Sweden,'' one beverage industry executive sniffed. ``What's
next? A machine that X-rays people's pockets to find out how much
change they have and raises the price accordingly?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pecoriello, a stock analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein,
applauded the move to increase profits in the vending-machine
business. ``This is already the most profitable channel for the
beverage companies, so any effort to get higher profits when demand
is higher obviously can enhance the profitability of the system
further,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a possible downside as well. ``You don't want to
have a price war in this channel, where you have discounting over a
holiday weekend, for example,'' he said. ``Once the capability is
out there to vary the pricing, you can take the price down.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pepsi spokesman said no similar innovation was being tested at
the No. 2 soft-drink company. ``We believe that machines that raise
prices in hot weather exploit consumers who live in warm
climates,'' declared the spokesman, Jeff Brown. ``At Pepsi, we are
focused on innovations that make it easier for consumers to buy a
soft drink, not harder.''

COMMENTARY: THE LONG DARK NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was peculiar. The women kept pointing to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask if they had any health problems,'' said Zohra
Rasekh, a senior health researcher for Physicians for Human Rights.
``They would not mention anything specific. But they would point to
their heads. Some would say, `Yes, right here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I would ask, `What do you mean?' And after a couple of
interviews I was really shocked to see how everybody would say the
same thing over and over. They would say, `Well, I'm going crazy. I
have bad dreams. I don't want to live anymore.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so easy to notice this prevalence of depression, even
if you weren't trained to recognize it. The women were very down.
Some would start crying. They felt they were without hope. Some
said they wanted to kill their children and then kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rasekh, who has interviewed more than 160 Afghan women, said
she believed the majority of the women living under the viciously
oppressive rule of the Taliban were now caught in the long dark
night of severe depression. They are not permitted to work or go to
school. For the most part they must remain at home, indoors, as in
a prison, their windows covered or painted black. If they do go
out, it must be in the company of a close male relative, and within
the claustrophobic confines of the all-encompassing burqa.
</P>
<P>
   They must remain quiet. Their footsteps are not to be heard.
Their breathing is only grudgingly tolerated. These are women who
barely register on the most fundamental gauges of existence. They
are not alive in any real sense. They are there but not there.
Barely there. How could they not be depressed?
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing fear among top officials of Physicians for
Human Rights and other groups that recent overtures to the United
States by Taliban officials, including offers to discuss the status
of the terrorist Osama bin Laden, will undermine efforts to bring
some kind of real relief to the suffering women of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban control nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan, but
because of opposition from the United States and other countries
they do not hold Afghanistan's seat at the United Nations. And, in
fact, the United Nations has threatened to impose economic
sanctions against the Taliban if their leaders continue to harbor
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Feminist Majority
Foundation, which has been trying to focus international attention
on the conditions faced by women in Afghanistan, said she feared
``there will be a peace negotiation'' that could lead to an
agreement under which the hideous treatment of women by the Taliban
``will become accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``If this can be accepted, just passed off as culture
or religion, then there are no human rights for women that could
ever be guaranteed. The United Nations has declared that women's
rights are human rights. If you can take away the right to
employment, the right to education of any kind, the right to move
about freely, then what rights do you have? What are the
inalienable rights that women have?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rasekh acknowledged that everyone in Afghanistan had been
affected by the devastation wrought by so many years of warfare and
religious fanaticism. But the conditions that currently prevail for
women are ``so terrible, so horrible,'' she said, that they cry out
for special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the Taliban it wasn't the best health system in
the world,'' she said. ``But there were trained doctors, male and
female, and women could visit male doctors, specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, most of the experienced doctors have left. Women
doctors for the most part are barred from practicing. And women
patients, with very few exceptions, cannot be treated by male
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   She said a few decrepit facilities had been set aside,
ostensibly for the treatment of women patients, but they were not
even minimally adequate. She mentioned a diabetic woman who died
because she couldn't get insulin shots, and a woman who was in an
automobile accident and died because a hospital wouldn't admit her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rasekh spoke of her own sadness and sense of helplessness as
she continues to try to do what she can to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you hear these sad things,'' she said. ``You see
them and you feel helpless. I am not the same person that I was.''

INDONESIA REVIVES INVESTIGATION INTO SUHARTO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The new Indonesian government said
Wednesday that it would reopen a corruption inquiry into former
President Suharto that was dropped as one of the final acts of the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
   But President Abdurrahman Wahid said that while he approved the
renewed investigation, he would ultimately prefer a negotiated
settlement with Suharto. ``That would be better than getting all
excited in court, while scores of years go by without the case
being settled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said the decision was in the hands of the new
attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, a former human rights
commissioner who was an opponent of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to foreign businessmen Wednesday, Marzuki said, ``The
intention is to reopen the case and have it brought to court.'' He
said this would involve either reopening the previous investigation
or targeting different areas of Suharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In another move to pursue corruption and reopen cases stalled
under former President B.J. Habibie, who was Suharto's vice
president and who succeeded him after his ouster last year, the
attorney general said he would press ahead with an investigation
into a bank scandal that had tainted Habibie and his close
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is crucial that these two issues are resolved properly and
transparently so that the message is clear,'' Marzuki said. ``We
will not tolerate any monkey business any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki's announcement Wednesday was a first step toward
defining the new government, which has not yet won the confidence
of foreign investors. The Cabinet is too diverse and its top
officials too untried to allow firm assessments to be made about
the country's future policies and stability, investors and
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in Jakarta continued a four-day slide Wednesday,
falling 3 percent, and Indonesia's currency dropped against the
dollar after nine days of gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian press mixed praise for the government with words
of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are still coasting on the euphoria of the change
to a new government, the mood could easily swing to widespread
dissatisfaction if the government fails to deliver in meeting
public expectations,'' said the English-language daily The Jakarta
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki's move to investigate Suharto addresses one widespread
public demand. Wahid's attitude seemed to reflect his desire to
address difficult issues with a minimum of the confrontation that
has battered Indonesia for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, we investigate,'' he told local editors. ``From the
result of that investigation, we then decide how much has to be
returned by Mr. Suharto to go towards efforts to improve the
economy and overcome the food crisis. That is better than if we
quarrel or go to court.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of its most damaging self-inflicted wounds, Habibie's
government closed an investigation into Suharto's wealth on Oct.
11, only days before an electoral assembly in which Habibie was a
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie never overcame the stigma of his close association with
Suharto and he withdrew his candidacy on the day before the
assembly's vote on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong investigation, which had already aroused anger
through its evident half-heartedness, had focused on a complex of
charitable foundations controlled by Suharto. Critics charged that
he had laundered huge payoffs as part of a corrupt regime that
earned him many billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto and his children have been accused of stashing billions
of dollars overseas, a charge Suharto has denied. Corruption by
Suharto, his children and his cronies during his 32 years in office
distorted the Indonesian economy and contributed to a wave of anger
that drove him from office in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the focus of a new investigation, Marzuki said, it
would remain a corruption case. He said the government was obliged
to proceed because of an overwhelming public clamor for an
accounting of the widespread corruption of the Suharto years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political will has to be there because of public
pressure,'' he said. ``Short of that, there will be great
skepticism out there and it will only lead to a secondary crisis if
the government is not seen to be serious in ending this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank scandal centers around 546 billion rupiah in government
bailout funds siphoned out of Bank Bali to a company affiliated
with associates of Habibie. Critics say the money was used in
Habibie's election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among other
international lenders, have suspended further loans to Indonesia
until an audit of the transaction is made public and anyone guilty
of wrongdoing prosecuted.

JUST WHERE DOES E-MAIL GO? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Corrects byline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Where do e-mail messages go between the time the sender sends
them and the recipient turns on her computer and receives them?
</P>
<P>
   L.M., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Here's how the compugeeks would describe it: ``First you use
PPP and TCP/IP to connect to your ISP. Then you send your message
packets at various BPS using SMTP and receive it using POP.''
</P>
<P>
   In real speak, it goes like this. When you send an email message
and your modem starts going ``EEEEK, HHHSSSSSHHH, BOING BOING''
you're connecting to a company that has an electronic gateway to
the internet. That's your Internet Service Provider (ISP). What
you're hearing is literally an electronic conversation between your
computer and theirs, using standardized programs called PPP (Point
to Point Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol). The conversation between the computers
is so they can see how fast each one is, so they can set themselves
at a mutually agreeable speed of Bytes Per Second (BPS) at which
the information is to be transferred. They're also testing to see
how strong the phone line is, to guard against mistakes in the
message. And of course they're asking each other for identifying
information like passwords and user names, to make sure it's okay
to make the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two systems have electronically agreed on the terms of
their ``conversation,'' your email program gets a signal to start
sending the message. But it doesn't send it all at once. Inside
your computer is a standardized transmission program, called SMTP,
for Simple Message Transfer Protocol. SMTP sends your message out
in chunks, called packets, which are anywhere from 100 to 2,000
bytes (characters) long. SMTP gives each packet a label (the
compufolks call them headers) to identify it. Headers include
information like ``This is packet number X, coming from Y, going to
Z, and has Q numbers of characters in it. Send back a confirmation
that you got it before I send you another packet.''
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't get a confirmation, it won't send the rest of the
packets. The idea of breaking the message into packets is to catch
any electronic errors that would make the message unreadable,
before the whole thing is sent.
</P>
<P>
   When the packets get to the ISP, the receiving computer
reassembles them into one whole message. A computer looks at the
information on the right hand side of the ``(at)'' symbol, the
domain name. Let's say you sent something to howwhy(at)globe.com.
The ``globe.com'' part is the domain name. It's the post office to
which to send your mail.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a small local ISP company, it may send your message
directly to the domain name computer. More likely it will send your
message to a bigger internet company, run by firms like GTE or MCI,
since they have giant lists of all domain names and know where to
send messages.
</P>
<P>
   When it finally arrives at the domain name post office, the
server (a computer dedicated to one basic use, in this case email)
looks at the address on the left of the ``(at)'' symbol, the
``howwhy'' part, and puts the message into a file with that address
name. It's like your personal post office box. And there it waits
until you turn on your computer and tell it to ``Check Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the ``EEEEK,HHHSSSSSHHH, BOING BOING'' is the Post
Office Protocol (POP client) in your computer, talking to the POP
server holding your message.
</P>
<P>
   The digi-conversation goes like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any mail for L.M.?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' answers the server.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many messages?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long is the first one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``4,300 bytes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Send it.''
</P>
<P>
   As best we can tell, computers don't say please or thank you.
</P>

 &HT;    Atlanta visitors bureau maps out bigger presence on Internet
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau plans to get more cyber
active in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau plans to increase its presence on the Internet next
year. A revamped ACVB Web site will allow online visitors to book
hotel reservations, buy tickets to city events and make restaurant
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is shifting to the Web and we don't intend being
left behind,'' said Gregory Pierce, ACVB vice president of finance
and technology. The site will get help from several corporate
partners and sponsors including BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The ACVB has had a Web site since the mid-1990s. The site gets
about 4 million hits a month. Pierce said the files downloaded most
are maps of the airport, downtown and its hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The upgraded site could also include merchandise sales, though
Pierce said it may not be a huge revenue generator. ``We're not a
retailer and won't keep inventory,'' he said. ``We would look for a
partner to handle those pieces. We'll basically be an order
taker.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site could generate up to $500,000 a year in revenue, in
part through reservation booking fees or a percentage of business
generated from the site. Details are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said the bureau is also working with BellSouth on a pilot
project to have sites geared toward specific conventions. The site
would offer a daily schedule of the convention and a calendar of
events for the city.
</P>
<P>
   The ACVB could be ahead of many bureaus across the nation in
using the Web. Most convention and visitors bureaus have Web sites,
said Michael Pina, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based
Travel Industry Association of America. ``The issue is what are
they doing special with their Web sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sites are becoming more popular, said Pina, whose
association will soon release a report on travelers' use of the
Internet. Preliminary findings indicate that 20 percent of
travelers who use the Internet have used it to make online
reservations. That percentage has doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Of frequent travelers, those who have taken five or more trips
within the last year, 22 percent say they have used the Web for
reservations. That's up from 13 percent in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ Ukraine, which often boasts of being the first
post-Soviet society to freely elect its president, could soon
become the first post-Communist society to re-elect one. This time,
however, don't expect much bragging.
</P>
<P>
   With the first of probably two elections to chose its next
leader looming on Sunday, Ukraine's 1999 presidential campaign
already is being judged a political and democratic disaster.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely that the incumbent and favorite, President
Leonid Kuchma, is running on a five-year record of economic
decline. Nor is it just the grenade attack on one candidate, this
month, or the fatal stabbing of another candidate's senior aide
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Far more dismaying is the extent to which the campaign seems to
have been rigged to favor Kuchma _ sometimes with a brazenness that
would have made a Soviet autocrat turn an even deeper red.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the dirtiest election in the history of modern Ukraine,''
said Nikolo Tomenko, the nation's most respected political analyst.
``In a nutshell, democratic elections in Ukraine aren't happening
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactics include blizzards of phony leaflets promoting stands
that opposition candidates say they have not taken, the emergence
of a radical populist candidate who has split the two leading
opposition candidates and retribution against private media that
have given favorable coverage to the president's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma's rivals have been all but ignored by the state-run
television and the major independent channels, largely controlled
by pro-Kuchma tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of private stations that have covered the opposition
have received such a hail of government harassment that one owner
finally sold his stake to Kuchma's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The major newspaper in Kiev, run by a man said to be Kuchma's
son-in-law, ran a hagiographic serial of the president's life
story.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Russian singers are barnstorming the countryside,
staging free concerts punctuated with Kuchma endorsements, which
are then replayed on the evening news broadcasts as news.
</P>
<P>
   Tax police officers, fire inspectors and other bureaucrats have
been pressed into campaign service, with the result that shops and
offices across the nation are plastered with Kuchma posters _ ``a
kind of card for tax inspection,'' one analyst joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are phenomenal shenanigans and accusations, including
even this so-called assassination attempt,'' said Bohdan
Krawchenko, a democratic activist who founded the Ukrainian Academy
for Public Administration in the hope of raising the quality of
government.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign enters its last week, the share of undecided
voters is high _ 25 to 30 percent, by some counts _ in part out of
disgust. ``For most people there is no one they want to vote for,''
Krawchenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma may need all the extra help he is getting. Until now, he
has prospered by casting himself as a pro-Western bulwark against
Communists who want to trash his market-oriented economic programs
and merge Ukraine back into Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But those arguments have lost potency this year. For one thing,
Kuchma's economic program has balked at basic reforms like selling
off big state-controlled industries. Foreign debt has ballooned,
corruption is endemic and, except among the young, disillusionment
with the West is high.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Ukraine's Communists are moderating their own
economic program and pledging to leave existing businesses more or
less alone. As Russia's tin-cup economy staggered and Belarus'
freedoms shrank this year, the Communists have mostly shelved the
notion that Ukraine should reunite with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   That has left Kuchma in something of a jam. Opinion polls
indicate that he can count on about 25 percent of the vote, far
less than the 45 or 50 percent of the electorate that is loyal to
the left. To win re-election, he must finish among the top two
vote-getters on Sunday and then win a majority in the November
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy, analysts say, has been to deftly split the left
and to run a scorched-earth campaign of government pressure against
those candidates who pose the greatest threat.
</P>
<P>
   The left has been divided by the emergence this year of a
hard-hitting populist, Natalya Vitrenko, who is running the most
radical campaign of any serious candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vitrenko's throw-the-bums-out campaign _ she would eject the
International Monetary Fund from Ukraine and send the government's
economic reformers to work in uranium mines _ have won the loyalty
of nearly a fifth of the electorate. But her platform makes her
unpalatable to the remaining 80 percent, and probably unelectable
in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   It is taken for granted by Tomenko and most other experts, but
never proven, that Kuchma's supporters jump-started Ms. Vitrenko's
campaign with cash donations. Regardless, her candidacy has
crippled the two leftists most likely to rival Kuchma, Petro
Simonenko of the Communist Party and Oleksandr Moroz of the more
centrist Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Politics since then have only gotten stranger and more savage.
On Oct. 2 someone tossed a hand grenade at Ms. Vitrenko during a
rally, wounding her and 33 others, some seriously. Hours later, the
government said it had arrested two Russian assassins _ and traced
the grenades to Moroz's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vitrenko and Moroz both recovered, one physically, the other
politically. ``Practically no one in the elite believes it,''
another prominent political analyst, Mikhailo Pohrebinsky, said of
the accusation. ``As for the voters, for a short period Moroz's
ratings dropped, but then they returned.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroz's aides assert that is but one of hundreds of instances in
which the press has been used against their man and other Kuchma
critics. Statistics suggest that they have a point.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An independent analysis of political news on the three state-run
television channels during August and September counted 184
positive references to Kuchma and one negative one. Moroz, in
second place, received 28 favorable mentions and 21 unfavorable
ones. Ms. Vitrenko was mentioned but eight times, five of them
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   Tomenko, the analyst, says media manipulation goes beyond
control of air time. The tax police seized the bank accounts of
STB, an independent national television channel, after it covered
opposition candidates favorably; eventually, controlling interest
was sold to businessmen friendly to Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
   Tax inspectors visited another station in Cherkasi after Moroz
appeared on a program there. The station director was shortly
fired. Similar instances have occurred in the Crimea and elsewhere.
Last month, Kuchma ended national radio broadcasts of sessions of
Parliament, which is dominated by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Tomenko has his own political bent. For a while, he advised a
band of four centrist candidates, including Moroz, who were
considering uniting behind one of their own. But he insists that
the evidence of campaign abuses speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some do not entirely agree. Pohrebinsky, the analyst, says much
of the media manipulation in this campaign differs little from the
last presidential campaign in Russia, when the state television and
private networks launched a pro-Yeltsin blitz to prevent a
Communist victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine's media tycoons ``put their money on Kuchma just as in
'96 with Berezovsky and Yeltsin,'' he said, referring to the
Russian financier Boris Berezovsky. ``The West was happy then; now
they criticize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another well-known journalist, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said
Westerners unreasonably demanded a robust and open democracy in a
nation that was still learning the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Polish standards, the situation with freedom of
the press here is lower, though not that much lower,'' said
Tkachenko, the head of a new private channel, Noviy Canal. ``By
Belarus standards we have complete freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '94 campaigns there wasn't a single private national TV
channel. Now there are three or four. We had no private national
newspapers. Now we have many. Again, the question about Ukraine is,
`Compared to what?'''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma took a step on Monday that emulated more robust
democracies and, surely, was aimed at silencing carpers. He
appeared briefly, beamed in remotely from his hometown of
Dnipropetrovsk, in the first of five nationally broadcast
presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Most Ukrainians still may not know that the debate started at
10:45 p.m. but was not reported in the next day's newspapers. The
government later postponed the remaining debates until further
notice. The moderator, officials said, developed heart trouble.

 &HT;    Delta's Mullin likely to add loftier title today
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines President and Chief Executive Leo
Mullin will likely get a third title today.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's board of directors, at the annual shareholders
meeting in Boston, is expected to name Mullin chairman of the
board.
</P>
<P>
   The additional title would have little practical effect. But it
would be an affirmation by the board of Mullin's leadership after a
little more than two years at the helm of Atlanta's biggest
corporate employer.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Grinstein, a longtime director who lives in Seattle, has
been Delta's ``nonexecutive'' board chairman since Mullin was hired
in August 1997. Grinstein is expected to relinquish that role but
remain on the board as an outside director.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the meeting, shareholder votes will be tallied on two
proposals backed by Delta's pilot union. One links executive
bonuses to employee satisfaction measures, while the other calls
for shareholder approval of any executive severance packages worth
more than $2 million. The latter is in reaction to the
multimillion-dollar package given Mullin's predecessor, Ronald
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   The Grinstein-Mullin title shuffle is no surprise. Grinstein
said in an interview in March that he planned to hand Mullin the
chairman post this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A more significant question is whether Mullin will pick a clear
second-in-command from his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Maurice Worth, who retired in September,
had occupied the No. 2 position on the flow chart since Mullin's
arrival. But Mullin has said he has no immediate plans to fill that
slot. The next management layer consists of five executive vice
presidents, all of whom report directly to Mullin.
</P>
<P>
   Today's shareholder meeting, at the pricey and elegant Boston
Harbor Hotel, will mark the second straight year Delta has held the
gathering in a major Northeast city rather than its corporate
birthplace, Monroe, La.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was picked because of the city's importance in Delta's
route network, airline spokesmen said. Also, Delta may use the
event to tout plans for a new terminal at Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's meeting was at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New
York. Previously, Delta held its meetings at a Holiday Inn in
Monroe _ an annual nod to the carrier's crop-dusting roots that was
deemed outdated by Mullin, a Massachusetts native.
</P>
<P>
   Those ties will be further thinned by today's retirement of
board member Henry Biedenharn, a Monroe businessman and the last in
a long line of family members to sit on Delta's board.

 &HT;    Firms making room for religion at work
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a spiritual revival going on in America. The
real news is that it's taking place on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (Nov. 1) takes a look at the phenomenon in its
cover story.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine offers a number of reasons why there's more
religion in the workplace. One is simply that it makes sense, given
the time people spend at their jobs. After all, work is where more
and more people eat, date, use on-site day care and in some
offices, even take naps, the magazine notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But perhaps the largest driver of this trend,'' Business Week
says, ``is the mounting evidence that spiritually minded programs
in the workplace not only soothe workers' psyches but also deliver
improved productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies made room for religion long before productivity
became part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask S. Truett Cathy of Atlanta, chief executive of
Chick-fil-A, which is closed on Sundays and offers prayer service
for employees on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Sunday school boys would think I'm a hypocrite if I'm up
there teaching while my cash register is jingling,'' he told
Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   STILL A BELIEVER
</P>
<P>
   John Neff, former manager of the Windsor Fund, offers his voice
in favor of low-P/E value investing in the November Bloomberg
Personal Finance.
</P>
<P>
   His verdict? Investing in stocks with low P/Es is not a thing of
the past. Excesses in the market ultimately ``hand low-P/E
investors the chance to capture extraordinary gains, when worthy,
out-of-favor stocks regain the market's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the magazine: a look at the possibilities that the
Internet brings to bond investing.
</P>
<P>
   ARE THE BIG STOCKS BETTER?
</P>
<P>
   Smart Money (November) tries to answer that question in a report
on the 10 most valuable stocks in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The 10, in order, as of Sept. 10: Microsoft, General Electric,
Intel, IBM, Cisco Systems, Wal-Mart Stores, Lucent Technologies,
Exxon, Merck and Citigroup.

 &HT;    Chocolate's boastful nickname doesn't quite fit the real man
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As rare sights go, this one was as uncommon as
seeing Halley's Comet pass overhead or Big Foot standing out in the
open. I saw Sexual Chocolate melt.
</P>
<P>
   Saw him shrink from this mountainous masher right down into a
``yes ma'am,'' ``no ma'am,'' ``please excuse me ma'am'' sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in a private dressing room just before a recent
World Wrestling Federation show in Dayton, Ohio. But to get the
picture, you need some history.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual Chocolate is the stage name of Mark Henry, the 380-pound
former Olympic weightlifter turned WWF star. His moniker _ as the
storyline goes _ comes from his condition. He's supposed to have an
insatiable appetite for women. So much so that he sometimes is
accompanied to the ring by his own therapist, who is trying to calm
him down, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest nemesis is the Godfather, who in stereotypical WWF
fashion is a flamboyant pimp. He comes to the ring accompanied by a
bevy of scantily clad women called the ``Ho Train.'' And in more
than one match, they have driven Chocolate to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   So when I spotted Henry backstage, I asked him if we could talk
about ``his condition,'' the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympic Games,
growing up dirt poor in Silsbee, Texas, and if he's still glad he
chose pro wrestling over the NFL. He agreed and we stepped into the
first empty dressing room we found.
</P>
<P>
   Henry admitted that while most people understand he's laughing
all the way to the bank, few of the folks back in his hometown _
which took up collections to help him train for the Olympics and
send his mom to both Games _ are a little shocked at his wolfish
WWF persona. They know him for his down-home charm. And they also
remember what his no-nonsense mom, Barbara Moss, did to a Sexual
Chocolate-type at work one day.
</P>
<P>
   At the time she was raising her kids on her own by working two
shifts a day at a local sawmill. Pretty soon a flirtatious male
co-worker was harassing her and when no one would help her out, she
simply picked up a board and walloped the guy upside the head. He
went to the hospital and she ended up fired.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she worked as a maid and a baby sitter to try to
make ends meet. Still, times were hard and Henry told of days when
there was no food in the refrigerator and the electricity was shut
off because the bill wasn't paid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that was lacking materially, Henry was physically
gifted. Even though he was 6-foot-3 and pushing 400 pounds, he
could dunk a basketball and do the splits. He was a standout high
school football player and then a champion weightlifter.
</P>
<P>
   With little training, he finished 10th at the 1992 Games in
Barcelona. A back injury caused him to end up a disappointing 14th
in Atlanta four years later. Right after that, he ignored overtures
from the NFL and signed a 10-year contract with the WWF estimated
to be worth $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the move surprised some people, those who knew Henry best
knew wrestling had been his love since an uplifting day in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom took me to one of my first matches ever at the old
Beaumont Civic Center. Andre the Giant was on the card and when he
came down the aisle, everybody was afraid of him 'cause he was a
bad guy at the time. No kids would reach out, but I did. I wanted
to touch him. All of a sudden he stopped, reached right over and
lifted me straight up in the air. I was only 10, but I weighed 220
pounds then. He held me like I was a doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks me right in the eye and says, `Stay off the rail,
kid.' When he put me down, it was like, `Oh my God, he touched me.'
From that day on, I watched wrestling almost every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a champion weightlifter, he added a little wrestler's
panache. Yet going from being an Olympian to a pro wrestler was not
easy. A lot of wrestlers who had spent years paying their dues on
small-dollar shows resented his big contract and his shallow
resume. Many flat out snubbed him. Then he broke his ankle in a
training accident.
</P>
<P>
   Time healed most of the wounds, but the big boost came when he
dropped the tag ``World's Strongest Man'' and took up the Sexual
Chocolate nickname.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he said, he's really a one-woman man. He's engaged to
Jana Perry, a former Academic All-America gymnast at West Virginia
who now teaches seventh and eighth grade in Cincinnati. She was
with Henry at the Dayton show and thinks his Sexual Chocolate
reputation is hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry was expounding on the nickname _ and how it really is
just an exaggeration of his real nature _ the real occupants of the
dressing room showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the Hoes are here!'' someone yelled into the room as four
buxom women from two Dayton strip clubs filed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You the Godfather?'' one asked a startled Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaahh no ... no ... I'm Sexual Chocolate,'' said Henry,
pulling himself up from his chair. ``And eerh, I gotta go. Yeah, I
better go get ready for my match.''
</P>
<P>
   With that he excused himself in the politest of terms and
lumbered off to his distant quarters to put on his striped
wrestling tights and those black patent leather, size 16 EEEEE
boots. In the ring, he would end up doubled-teamed by the Hollys
and suffer a pinfall.
</P>
<P>
   As the match unfolded, his fiancee stayed backstage and read a
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends all love his name, but my parents, well, that's
another story. They're both educators, a little more serious. They
say, `Couldn't he just be Chocolate? Couldn't he just drop the
Sexual part?'''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad they weren't back at the dressing room a few minutes
earlier. They, too, would have seen Sexual Chocolate melt.

 &HT;    Wrestling grapevine: Rumors, gossip from the industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the bigger rumors this week had the WWF making a move to
sign Randy ``Macho Man'' Savage and announce it in Toronto, just
days before WCW's ``Mayhem'' pay-per-view. WWF honcho Jim Ross has
already said the WWF is not interested in Savage, whose WCW
contract ends in December.
</P>
<P>
   Did Jeff Jarrett get a bonus for dropping the Intercontinental
belt to Chyna before leaving for the WCW? Some say yes, to the tune
of $100,000-plus. Others say he got the money, but it was money
owed to him. His WWF contract ran out the day before the ``No
Mercy'' PPV.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF will get back one star sooner than expected. The
Undertaker will return from a series of injuries by the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bischoff was spotted with Hulk Hogan at the Tyson fight on
Saturday in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   WWF's stock has leveled off since its dramatic opening last
week. The stock, which opened at $21 per share and has jumped as
high as $34, is currently trading around $24.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the WCW wrestlers and personalities released over the
past few weeks: Johnny Attitude, Mike Enos, Arturo Flores (Eddie
Guerrero's LWO bodyguard), Bret Hamner (one of the Master Blasters
in WCW), Barry Horowitz, Hard Body Harrison, Scott Norton, Sick
Boy, Barry Darsow, Chad Fortune, Hak, Marcus Johnson (NWO referee),
Robert Smedley and Eric Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Fabulous Moolah in the record books as the oldest
women's champion. Moolah, believed to be 69, has the belt back. She
first held the WWF Women's title in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Internet sources say Stone Cold Steve Austin has agreed to turn
heel in the next few months and probably feud with the Rock. Triple
H's return to the Degeneration X stable Monday night opens the door
for Austin and the Rock to be the main focus soon.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet report says the WCW has plans to bring back the
Hardcore division. Of course, it's strange that they would after

 &HT;    Havoc signals bloodier WCW
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   World Championship Wrestling's latest pay-per-view, ``Halloween
Havoc,'' was the beginning of a new era for the wrestling
organization in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   The first pay-per-view put together by the writing duo of Vince
Russo and Ed Ferrara had more violence and muddled endings than
previous WCW shows. It also boasted a couple of unique twists.
</P>
<P>
   The show started with the Filthy Animals being stripped of the
tag team titles because one of four members was unable to wrestle.
That was done to change the basic tag-team title match into a
three-team, six-man tag that Harlem Heat won to become 10-time tag
champions.
</P>
<P>
   A crowbar then became the weapon of choice in a series of
matches _ Ric Flair beating Eddy Guerrero to end his match with
Saturn, Diamond Dallas Page returning the favor in his match with
Flair.
</P>
<P>
   There was more violence as Flair cut himself open during his
match and the Sid Vicious-Goldberg match resulted in a bloody
ending. The match was stopped when it was decided Sid had lost too
much blood.
</P>
<P>
   There were also some big gaffes in the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the Flair-DDP match the referee only counted to two but gave
DDP the win.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, titles change hands only if there has been a pinfall or
submission, but Goldberg got the U.S. title after Sid was declared
too bloody to fight. During the Sting-Goldberg match, announcers
Tony Schivone and Bobby Heenan made it clear that it was a
non-title match. Yet when Goldberg pinned Sting, he was awarded the
World Title.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest gaffe, or maybe the biggest work, was Hulk Hogan
laying down to allow Sting to pin him in what was to be the main
event. On air, Hogan has voiced his displeasure with the changes in
WCW.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest rumors circulating in wrestling circles is
that Hogan has talked with Fox officials about starting another
wrestling group. This past spring, Hogan had NBC set to buy into a
Saturday night WCW show. The deal fell apart when Bret Hart took
time off to mourn his brother and WCW's ratings continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with Hogan and Fox makes sense because Fox head man
Rupert Murdoch would love to battle WCW's Ted Turner in another
arena (the two moguls already battle with baseball teams and media
companies). With Murdoch's money and Fox's network status, Hogan
would be able to raid the WCW and WWF, where wrestlers might sign
deals not to compete in the WCW.

PHARMACEUTICAL GIANT SETS GENOMICS PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Hoechst Marion Roussel, which this month
gained control of its joint venture with Cambridge-based Ariad
Pharmaceuticals Inc., will establish a local genomics presence and
expand employment at Ariad to 100 from 65 here by late next year.
</P>
<P>
   The German pharmaceutical giant is merging with Rhone-Poulenc
SA, the large French chemical and pharmaceutical company, and next
month will change its name to Aventis Group. It will have its
largest genomics operations in Cambridge, said Dr. Harvey J.
Berger, Ariad's founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The combined companies, he said, will have smaller genomics
facilities in Vitry, France, and Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Ariad sold its 50 percent interest in the Hoechst-Ariad Genomics
Center LLC to Hoechst Marion Roussel and received $40 million in
cash along with the rights to all its drugs created during the
nearly five-year collaboration. Ariad also got back 3 million
shares of its stock, for which Hoechst Marion Roussel had paid $30
million plus $2 million in forgiven loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have cash for the next 2 1/2 years,'' Berger said,
``and will focus (at Ariad) on getting drug products into the
clinic, while (Aventis focuses) on genomics research.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, sources said Wednesday that London-based Wellcome
Trust, part of the British pharmaceutical giant Glaxo, is
considering Cambridge as a site for its genomics laboratory. The
trust is reportedly seeking a facility that could accommodate up to
1,000 people and is also looking at sites in Maryland and near
Glaxo's US headquarters in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   If Glaxo joins Hoechst in Massachusetts, it would be part of a
booming biotech research enclave. Already here are BASF, which is
conducting biopharmaceutical research in Worcester, and
Astra-Zeneca, a Swedish firm building a facility in Waltham. Bayer
has a joint research program with the German company LION at the
Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, and Worcester-based Athena
Diagnostics is owned by Elan PLC of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Already, several US pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer
Inc. and American Home Products, have biotech research facilities
in Cambridge, and Amgen is slated to break ground Nov. 11 for an
eight-story building in Kendall Square. Merck &AMP; Co., meanwhile, is
about to locate near Emmanuel College in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bulk of the local expansion is by US companies, ``I
am getting about four calls a month from groups representing
European pharmaceutical companies looking for space between
Cambridge and Worcester,'' said Joseph Donavan, director of
emerging technologies at the Massachusetts Department of Economic
Development.

   NEW YORK _ Same story, different season.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Big East coaches predict will happen this
basketball season as they overwhelmingly selected the defending
national champion UConn Huskies as their preseason favorite, while
they predicted Boston College would finish in 13th and last place.
</P>
<P>
   UConn received 10 first place votes, while Syracuse (2) and
Miami (1) received the other first place votes.

BOSTON COLLEGE EXPECTS NO SYMPATHY FROM SYRACUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sure, Syracuse might have an insight into how it feels
to suffer a devastating loss after absorbing a humiliating 62-0
thrashing two weeks ago at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston College safety Pedro Cirino does not expect the
Orangemen _ who will play host to the Eagles at noon Saturday at
the noisy Carrier Dome _ to have any sympathy for the Eagles, who
squandered a 28-0 lead in a 31-28 loss last Saturday against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they?'' Cirino said. ``They're coming off a tough
loss against a damn good team and they've had an extra week to
prepare for us. So they have to be looking forward to this game to
make a statement and to make amends for what happened against
V-Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni said during Monday's
teleconference, ``I'd still rather be coming off BC's (loss) than
ours,'' because, ``to me, they played a heck of a game and we did
not play well.''
</P>
<P>
   The words came as no consolation to Cirino. ``I don't find
either way (to lose) to be acceptable, regardless if you go down
fighting, especially when you have a lead like we did,'' Cirino
said. ``That makes it even tougher. I know Syracuse had a tough,
tough, tough time against V-Tech, and a lot of people will. I just
watched the tapes of that game Wednesday and V-Tech looked scary on
defense. They were out there pounding on Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   So what was his initial reaction upon hearing Syracuse's
staggering final score from Blacksburg, Va.? ``I was like, `Damn,'
'' Cirino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syracuse just doesn't get beat like that. V-Tech made a
statement. Syracuse will bounce back, but hopefully not against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That explained why Cirino's only concern, really, was how the
Eagles respond after their killer loss. ``I think it is a major
concern for us,'' he said. ``We have to put that game behind us,
but we let that game get away ourselves. There was nothing that
Miami did. We beat ourselves at the end when we had too many missed
assignments and too many missed tackles in the fourth quarter. They
made us pay for them, and that's something we have to work on and
continue to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we won't put ourselves in that situation in the
future and we won't have a letdown like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino reiterated the vow he made to do everything in his power
as a senior defensive co-captain to prevent what transpired in the
second half Saturday _ when the Hurricanes rallied for 31
unanswered points in the final 17:11 _ from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not going to,'' Cirino said. ``If the guys can't make
the adjustments and if the coaches can't make the adjustments, then
we're not going to be in the game, period. So it's something we
have to learn from and something we have to take into account. We
have to go out there, and when the coaches draw something up on the
board, we have to know what the hell they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes for everyone, including myself. I saw things out
there that didn't seem to make sense _ and they didn't make sense _
and it caused me to make a couple of mistakes. It's a team defense
and everybody has to play their part, and that wasn't the case in
the fourth quarter against Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of three quarters, BC's defense dominated
Miami. Until, that is, the Hurricanes came roaring back and
capitalized on several miscues, including the winning 30-yard field
goal by Andy Crosland with seven seconds left. After gaining just
101 yards total offense and four first downs in the first half,
Miami finished with 396 yards and 20 first downs, gaining an
average of 7.0 yards per play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   So how will the Eagles bounce back against Syracuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be another emotional game for us, really,''
Cirino said. ``It's definitely going to be a gut-check for this
team, considering what happened to us last week. It's going to be
the same for them coming off the drubbing they came off of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect them to come out fired up, because they're at home,
so I don't see why not. We just have to make sure that we match
their intensity and, hopefully, come out with the victory.''

 &HT;    Bush has work to do in New Hampshire, poll shows
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush maintains a solid lead over
nearest rival John McCain in New Hampshire, but a new poll
indicates Bush may have some work to do there.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Herald survey released Wednesday showed Bush is backed
by 44 percent of the 362 respondents who identified themselves as
likely voters in the New Hampshire GOP primary. McCain was second
at 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted Sunday through Monday, carries a margin of
error of five percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But, in what McCain trumpeted as a seminal moment in the race,
67 percent of the respondents said they have a favorable impression
of him, while only 12 percent said they had an unfavorable
impression of him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got a favorable rating from 64 percent, down 10 points from
August. Nineteen percent said they view Bush unfavorably.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Kelly Myers, who did the research for the Boston
newspaper, said Bush is finding out that New Hampshire residents
make candidates work for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said from the beginning that George Bush is in the very
awkward position of being such a strong front-runner,'' said Myers.
``It is inconceivable that he would ride easily to victory in New
Hampshire. It rarely turns out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said Bush, who has spent nine days in the Granite State,
needs to make more trips to New Hampshire to stop the slide in his
favorable ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has gotten bashed upside down for not being here as part of
the series of debates,'' said Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, as the other major GOP contenders gather at Dartmouth
College for the second New Hampshire debate, Bush again will be
absent. After campaigning today in North Dakota, he heads to Dallas
to join his wife Laura as she is honored by Southern Methodist
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is George Bush skipping a debate for the second
consecutive time but he's thumbing his nose at the people of New
Hampshire,'' said McCain spokesman Dan Schnur.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will participate in a Dec. 2 debate in New Hampshire,
will be interviewed live this evening on a Manchester TV station to
discuss his absence from tonight's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to explain to the people of New Hampshire why he
isn't going to be there and to answer questions that might have
been asked at the debate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Myers noted that Bush is still well-positioned to undo
any damage he has incurred in New Hampshire. Each Bush visit is
received as a celebrity event, and he has the backing of U.S. Sen.
Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who has the state's best political
organization. Bush, who campaigned Wednesday in Iowa, returns to
New Hampshire next week to deliver a major policy address on
education.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is now on a three-day bus tour of New Hampshire, which
holds the nation's first primary next Feb. 1. The Arizona senator
has more time to spend there because he is ignoring Iowa, where the
first major battle of the presidential season happen at Jan. 24
caucuses.

FALUN GONG DEVOTEES CONVERGE ON BEIJING IN BID TO END GOVERNMENT
BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a mass act of civil disobedience, thousands of
members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement have descended
on Beijing in recent days and weeks, hoping, they say, to press the
government to reverse its condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   The government outlawed the movement, which it has called an
``evil sect,'' on July 22 and has mounted a relentless campaign to
discredit its leaders and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of leaders are being held for trial, while thousands of
disciples in cities around the county have been briefly detained,
some repeatedly, as they refuse to disavow a method they fervently
believe has brought them physical and spiritual well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, developed in 1992 by a former clerk named Li Hongzhi
who now lives in New York, combines traditional Chinese exercises
and meditation with elements of Buddhism and Taoism. The group
claims to have tens of millions of followers, mostly in China,
while the government puts the number at 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for the third straight day, small groups of
unrepentant Falun Gong devotees trickled onto the vast expanse of
Tiananmen Square, staging silent, almost private protests. They
were hard to discern among the tourists and local people who always
fill the area, but patrolling plainclothes police officers stopped
and questioned suspicious people. Dozens who admitted that they
were Falun Gong adherents were quickly led away to buses.
</P>
<P>
   But a far wider and more profound confrontation appears to be
building between clearly unnerved authorities and an uncrushed
movement that with astonishing speed drew in millions of ordinary,
seemingly nonpolitical Chinese _ creating an unexpected challenge
to Communist authority.
</P>
<P>
   The followers' sense of injustice was deepened when Wednesday
night's television news described the unyielding new commentary to
appear in Thursday morning's edition of the Communist newspaper,
People's Daily, calling Falun Gong a ``true cult'' that
``brainwashes'' followers with ``heretical ideas'' and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the government intensified its attacks on the group,
large numbers of followers were hiding in the capital and
preparing, for example, to petition the National People's Congress,
China's parliament, or mount further demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are practitioners all over Beijing now _ under the
bridges, in the alleyways, everywhere,'' said Qu Dehong, a farmer
from Yongan Township in northeastern Heilongjiang province, who is
now in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to stay until Falun Gong is rehabilitated,'' he said.
``We are here to appeal to the central government. The ban on Falun
Gong will be regretted by history.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday and early Thursday morning, groups of followers
were on edge around the city, wondering how to present their
appeals and dodge the stepped-up police presence. Extra vans of
police were visible overnight not only around Tiananmen Square,
where larger protests were predicted for Thursday, but along roads
and near parks in some areas.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A 38-year-old Beijing woman, who works as a clerk in a state
conglomerate and has been a practitioner of Falun Gong for two
years, said: ``We are good people, and we are not interested in
politics. We have to convince the authorities not to brand good
people as evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who would give only her surname of Zhang, said that
her home was raided on Wednesday and that she expected to be
detained Thursday when she and several other adherents planned to
try to present a statement to the Congress, which on paper is the
country's supreme legal authority. The Congress' Standing Committee
is currently considering a law intended to crush ``religious
cults.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other followers, she has made previous efforts to
petition authorities to reverse their verdict, and has been
detained more than once as a result, she said in an interview
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Some devotees said that tens of thousands or more of Falun Gong
members from other provinces were now in the city, but the numbers
could not be confirmed. Some outsiders have hidden in and around
the city for weeks, searching for ways to petition or convince
authorities that the ban was a terrible mistake. Many more have
come from outlying provinces in recent days, followers said.
</P>
<P>
   One farm outside Beijing, without heat or electricity, was
serving as temporary quarters for at least 50 visiting members,
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   The migration into the capital and the protests of recent days
were not organized, members insisted, but rather were a largely
spontaneous display of frustration by practitioners who are
unwilling to give up Falun Gong and have faced building harassment
from police or in their workplaces since July.
</P>
<P>
   Some followers from outside Beijing said they have had so much
trouble with the police since the July ban that they intended to
continue their furtive lives and appeals in Beijing until the
government sees the light.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dare to return to Liaoning'' said a 36-year-old
believer named Wu of her home province in northeastern China. Ms.
Wu, who spoke early Thursday morning, was part of the group that
intended to present a statement to the congress later Thursday,
with her arrest virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the congress' deliberations on new restrictions
on ``cults,'' Falun Gong members said they were incensed by
President Jiang Zemin's statement in France on Monday that their
group was ``an evil cult threatening the Chinese people and
society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang Zemin declared it an evil cult, so people from different
provinces are coming independently,'' said Zhou Li of the
Microbiology Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
who said that 1,000 out-of-town followers were detained in Beijing
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to demonstrate how good the Falun system is,'' she
said. ``They're all prepared to be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong first provoked the ire of the government on April 25,
when 10,000 members staged a silent vigil in the heart of Beijing
around Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leadership compound, seeking
official recognition for the group. The ease with which the
movement was able to assemble so many protesters, without warning,
in such a sensitive site, clearly stunned China's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the government and the group has increased
steadily since that time. Even before the July ban, the government
forbade Party members from practicing, harassed members, and closed
down bookshops that sold Falun Gong materials.
</P>
<P>
   Since July the government has waged a strident vilification
campaign, suggesting that Li is a common scoundrel out to bilk the
naive and that thousands of people have died because they put their
faith in Falun Gong rather than seek medical care. The group says
that its exercises are so beneficial that followers may not need
medical care, although it does not forbid it.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also accused the group of propagating
superstition. Li's books do combine relatively straightforward
spiritual and exercise advice with discussions of topics like time
travel and achieving X-ray vision.
</P>
<P>
   But the savagery of the campaign seems to have backfired to some
degree, appalling many Chinese who regarded Falun Gong primarily as
a health movement, favored especially by middle-aged and retired
people who performed the exercises in groups in urban parks.
</P>
<P>
   Qu, the farmer now hiding in Beijing, said that since he began
practicing Falun Gong two years ago he has quit smoking, drinking
and gambling, and that his goal now was simply to lodge a protest
with someone in authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have slogans and we won't stage demonstrations,'' he
said, noting that in his township alone, there were 400
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Yuan P. Li, a Chinese-born practitioner in Atlanta, said that it
was ``impossible'' that this week's protests were centrally
organized, given the months-long crackdown including large-scale
detentions and surveillance. ``All the old lines of communication
are broken,'' he said. ``And the international web sites are
blocked from entering China.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the police presence in and around Tiananmen
Square increased as more practitioners, learning about the People's
Daily editorial, vowed to make a public statement.
</P>
<P>
   One student named Cai at Qinghua University said: ``I'm going
down to Tiananmen. Maybe I won't be coming back. I don't know. But
I'm prepared for that eventuality.''

BUSH'S `SCIENCE' HARDLY EXPERIMENTAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every record Bush makes is a two-star record, a disc that would
be completely empty if it weren't filled with so much unoriginality
_ but they're not without scarce moments of shallow luxuries. You
cringe while hitting the track-repeat button.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes on effort No. 3 from Bush, the criminally popular
English rock band that has come to represent everything that's
wrong and wronger with modern rock. Specifically, they've sold
millions of copies of their first two CDs, ``Sixteen Stone'' and
``Razorblade Suitcase,'' if only because they came along with the
perfect sound at the perfect time: They mimicked Nirvana as Nirvana
was leaving us.
</P>
<P>
   The guitars roar like Kurt Cobain's did. Gavin Rossdale moans
and mourns like Cobain did. The group even enlisted renowned studio
whiz Steve Albini to give his Midas touch of abrasiveness to
``Razorblade.'' (Albini tweaked Nirvana's final studio disc, ``In
Utero.'') Bush has mindlessly followed in Nirvana's footsteps _ and
you've rewarded them for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Nirvana gone, Bush was on its own for this, its third
effort. But it's bad-business-as-usual here, a repeat of everything
Bush has tried to pass off as its own. Drum loops and digital
pulses turn up sporadically, perhaps trying to prove the band is
going in a new direction, which, in case you haven't noticed,
everyone else is going in, too. If the occasional flash of aptitude
weren't here, ``Science'' would be Bush's worst album yet _ and
those first two are pretty tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments of skill: the opener ``Warm Machine'' and
``Prizefighter'' are two relatively simple songs that somehow come
off dramatic. There's nothing really special about either track,
but the band _ guitarist Nigel Pulsford, bassist Dave Parsons and
drummer Robin Goodridge _ plays so ferociously, and Rossdale sings
with such verve, that you actually obsess over them. It's as if you
hear them in your sleep, in your car; you get up to turn them down
and realize your CD player's not even on. These two songs are that
good.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad those feelings don't last. The rest of ``Science'' is as
mechanical as it is predictable _ a blatantly noisy song here
(''English Fire''), a soft one there (''40 Miles from the Sun''),
the in-between singles (''The Chemicals Between Us, Spacetravel'').
</P>
<P>
   Going through the motions, spinning their wheels, been
there/done that _ no cliche I could write is half as cliched as
this _ most of this, anyway.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: STRAWMEN NEVER DIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It would be easy,'' said the president, ``easy
for a president of the United States to buy some popularity by
going along with the new isolationists. But I submit to you that it
would be disastrous for our nation and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was Richard Nixon in 1969, asserting his
internationalism at an Air Force Academy graduation even as he
began withdrawing troops from Vietnam. I wrote that speech, toning
down an even tougher anti-appeasement draft from Pat Buchanan. The
``new isolationist'' label infuriated protesters against the
Vietnam War, linking them with the appeasement of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   That same rhetorical device _ bunching all opposition into an
extremist straw man and then knocking it down _ is back with us
today.
</P>
<P>
   In his tele-tantrum after the Senate rejection of his test ban
treaty, President Clinton made the Nixon phrase his own, direly
warning of ``signs of a new isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   That evocative theme and phrase was amplified last week by his
national political-security adviser, Sandy Berger. ``The
internationalist consensus that has prevailed in this country for
more than 50 years,'' he told the Council on Foreign Relations,
``increasingly is being challenged by a new isolationism. ...''
</P>
<P>
   How does the new New Isolationism differ from the old New
Isolationism? Nixon's straw man had no faith in American strength;
Clinton's straw man has no faith in treaties and multilateral
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wanted to avoid Senate rejection of his flawed
agreement, he was offered an honorable way out: Simply agree in
writing not to bring it up next year. But he refused, demanding a
loophole enabling him to spring it at election time. Because
experience taught senators his word is not to be trusted, his
treaty was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new New Isolationism charge has a second leg: The
United States has not paid its U.N. dues. But the Helms-Biden deal
to pay those dues pegged to U.N. bureaucratic reform has long been
struck. What's holding it up is Clinton's debt to abortion
absolutists: he wants our U.N. dues to support Planned Parenthood
abroad, and a majority of Congress does not. The United States is
being made to look like a deadbeat because Clinton is in thrall to
a domestic lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third thesis of the new isolationism,'' cries Berger, is
``if it's over there, it's not our fight.'' He claims credit for
stopping the war in Bosnia and Kosovo despite sniping from the
dangerous ostrich element.
</P>
<P>
   But for years Clinton and our European allies were hand-wringing
appeasers in the face of Serbian aggression, abdicating to a
feckless United Nations. Only massacres shown on TV aroused public
opinion and shamed Western leaders into halfhearted action. The
lack of internationalist leadership invited the self-doubt and
derision that nourished isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Clinton was the most reluctant interventioneer.
Thousands of Kosovars died before counter-punishment rained down.
Even then, with tactical airstrikes needed to take out rampaging
tanks, fear of risk in Clinton's Sit-room sitzkrieg kept NATO
bombardiers three miles high _ and the ethnic cleansing was carried
out. Only when NATO became serious about massing troops near
Serbia's border to back up the air war, as Sen. John McCain had
urged, did the resolve of Slobodan Milosevic crack.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Clinton's political hatchet man gets mean.
``Serious people actually lamented that we did not have enough
casualties in the Kosovo conflict,'' Berger told the Establishment.
Only the most partisan Clintonite would charge that critics of a
delayed operation that failed to stop the slaughter were
``lamenting'' that more Americans had not died. That's below the
Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything new to the newest New Isolationism? The
lunatic fringe of Festung Amerika will always be with us,
embarrassing more responsible skeptics of intervention. Nothing new
there, and not a growing movement; it's only a reconstituted straw
man.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the pervasive distrust of our politicized
national security leadership. That raises suspicion of poll-driven
policy, of half-measured responses to crises and of commitments
grandly announced that may not be kept. That _ and not the latest
new isolationism _ is the danger to internationalism today.

MAKING AN AUSTEN HEROINE MORE LIKE AUSTEN  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Barbara Kantrowitz is a senior editor at Newsweek 
 By BARBARA KANTROWITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fanny Price, the heroine of ``Mansfield Park,'' should have been
one of Jane Austen's most memorable creations. Fanny is a Regency
Cinderella, a poor girl shipped off to live with ill-tempered
wealthy relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She ultimately wins her prince _ in this case, her cousin Edmund
(nobody worried too much about genetics in those days). Fanny
always takes the high road; she's the only character who sticks to
her principles and resists all temptation to change.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her considerable virtues, Fanny just can't get any
respect. Most readers find her irritatingly prissy and passive.
Even Austen's own mother pronounced Fanny ``insipid'' when
``Mansfield Park'' was first published, in 1814. More than 100
years later, the British writer Kingsley Amis called her ``a
monster of complacency and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it's taken so long to produce a feature-film
adaptation of Austen's most complex and controversial novel.
Patricia Rozema took on the challenge two years ago, after she got
a call from Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films. He was
convinced that somewhere in the dense shrubbery of ``Mansfield
Park'' there was a story that could rival the success of recent
versions of ``Pride and Prejudice,'' ``Sense and Sensibility'' and
``Emma.'' Weinstein already had a screenplay of the novel under way
and wanted Ms. Rozema to take over the project.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had read Austen's novels, she was far from an
expert on period pieces; one of her most recent works was a sextet
of short films inspired by the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. She didn't claim
to be a fan of ``Mansfield Park,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dare I say it? I don't think it's a perfect novel,'' she said
by telephone from Toronto, where she lives. Her first question to
Weinstein was: ``Why me?'' She says he told her he wanted ``someone
very visual'' to give the film a distinctive look. With that
mandate, Ms. Rozema proceeded to create a radically new Fanny, one
who will undoubtedly shock Austen purists when the film opens, on
Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Jane Austen film,'' says Ms. Rozema, the writer and
director. ``It's a Patricia Rozema film. My job as an artist is to
provide a fresh view.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired of what she describes as ``polite'' Austen
interpretations, Ms. Rozema infuses the character of Fanny with the
spirit of the author herself. Using Austen's letters and other
writings as a source of dialogue, she turns the hapless young girl
into a reasonable facsimile of what Ms. Rozema imagines the young
Jane was like. Ms. Rozema's Fanny (portrayed by the Australian
actress Frances O'Connor) is a budding writer, witty, lively,
surprisingly modern and eminently likable.
</P>
<P>
   She's a decidedly feminist Cinderella. That transformation alone
would be heresy enough for the Austen purists, but Ms. Rozema has
added a few more startling revisionist touches _ like sex.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most graphic moment in an Austen adaptation was a
relatively chaste kiss. Ms. Rozema says she set out ``to make a
movie that was emotionally charged.'' In one scene, Fanny and the
urbane Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz) appear to be on the verge of
a lustful lesbian embrace. At another point, two adulterous
characters romp naked in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rozema defends these scenes _ which are certainly not in the
novel _ as historically accurate. ``I don't think blood temperature
has changed, especially among the young and free,'' she says. ``I
was almost required to show them having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking liberties with an author as revered as Austen is always
risky, but Ms. Rozema says she's not afraid of the critics.
``Whenever you turn a novel into a movie, you're changing form,''
she says. ``I felt fairly free to make changes as long as I felt I
could face Austen if I met her.''
</P>
<P>
   She did extensive research, reading a number of scholarly
studies and Austen biographies, as well as just about every
surviving word the author wrote. She concluded that Austen intended
Fanny to be strong and tough, the only character in the novel
willing to stand up for her principles.
</P>
<P>
   To convey that image in a modern context, Ms. Rozema felt Fanny
had to be much more active, even bold. Fanny's interior life is
largely hidden in the novel. Ms. Rozema gives it a voice in the
film through letters Fanny sends to her sister Susan. She also has
Fanny write a farcical history of England, just as Austen did when
she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   Turning Fanny into Jane Austen is not as outrageous a leap as it
might seem. Some scholars consider ``Mansfield Park'' Austen's most
autobiographical work. It was her third published novel, written
after a difficult period in her life, and it is much darker than
the witty, lighthearted visions in ``Pride and Prejudice'' and
``Sense and Sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling of oppression, even doom, about the
characters. Fanny is a captive of forces she can't control. Her
only weapon against the tumult around her is perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Austen places her in a cold room apart from the rest of the
Mansfield Park family, a symbol of her emotional exile. She is an
observer and chronicler of human frailty. It's easy to imagine
Austen identifying with her heroine, as she struggled to stick to
her writing while her family sought a safe harbor after her
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years, Austen and her mother and sister shuttled
from home to home before finally settling at Chawton in Hampshire,
where all three would live until Austen died (probably of Addison's
disease, a failure of the adrenal glands) in 1817, at the age of
41. Neither Jane nor her sister, Cassandra, ever married, although
there is some evidence that the writer did suffer through at least
one failed love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rozema believes the popular image of Austen _ a prim
spinster writing witty repartee between teas _ is a distortion.
``If you met her as a teen-ager, you would have typed her as a
revolutionary by nature,'' she says. ``She had an almost surrealist
bent at the beginning.'' But like many writers, she did what she
had to do to get published. In the novels, her nonconformist spirit
is still discernible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rozema decided to emphasize the political overtones of
``Mansfield Park.'' The family patriarch, Sir Thomas Bertram (the
playwright Harold Pinter), is more clearly presented as a
slaveholder, a role only alluded to in the novel. In one scene,
Fanny discovers a portfolio of drawings by the dissolute oldest
son, Tom (James Purefoy), showing slaves being beaten and tortured.
The implication is that his decadence results from his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bertrams are an aristocratic family (besides Edmund
and Tom, Fanny's rich cousins include the marriageable Maria,
played by Victoria Hamilton, and Julia, portrayed by Justine
Waddell), they are far from admirable in the novel. Ms. Rozema's
screenplay ratchets up their flaws, so that only Fanny _ and, to
some degree, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) _ are worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rozema also decided to dramatize the class differences
between Fanny's family and the Bertrams. At one point in the story,
Fanny is sent back to Portsmouth, where her mother and father
preside over a chaotic household filled with badly behaved children
of various ages. In some other Austen adaptations, poor people _ if
they are shown at all _ are depicted as plain, honest and
good-hearted. Fanny's home is deliberately miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rozema says Austen was always worried about money, perhaps
because of her nomadic life in the years after her father's death;
she and her mother and sister were often dependent on the charity
of relatives, especially her brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to show poverty as unpleasant,'' Ms. Rozema
says. ``I think she was terrified of poverty and completely at the
mercy of the men around her. That must have made her crazy.'' Ms.
Rozema rendered Fanny's suitor, the unscrupulous Henry Crawford
(Alessandro Nivolo), more charming than he appears in the book so
that Fanny's rejection of him would appear even more dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Marrying a rich man would have provided an easy way out of
Fanny's situation, but she would have been betraying herself by
settling for someone she didn't love. The scene echoes one in
Austen's own life: when she was nearly 27, she accepted a marriage
proposal from a younger man but changed her mind a day later.
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly two years bringing ``Mansfield Park'' to
the screen, Ms. Rozema says she has a greater insight into Austen's
genius. ``I came to admire her much more in the course of writing
it,'' she says, especially ``her ability to define character with
effortless grace. She was brilliant, just brilliant.''

A CLOSER LOOK REVEALS A DUTCH MICHELANGELO  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Theodore K. Rabb is a professor of history at Princeton University.
A new edition of his ``Renaissance Lives'' will be published next
year. 
 By THEODORE K. RABB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Michelangelo, who was uniquely qualified to
judge, sculpture was superior to painting. And yet it is rare for a
sculptor other than Michelangelo himself, Donatello or Bernini to
be included among the many heroes of Renaissance and Baroque art.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of painters is not, of course, just a matter of
taste. By and large, sculptors' works take longer to complete, cost
far more, are more awkward to place and are more difficult to look
at closely and grasp in totality.
</P>
<P>
   They are, as a result, fewer in number. Moreover, they often are
unnoticed because they tend to be part of the scenery. To see a
painting we have to go to a gallery, and once there we feel obliged
to concentrate. But very few of the millions who each day walk past
them give heed to the statues and fountains that adorn our cities'
streets and squares, let alone stop and view them as works of art.
</P>
<P>
   If statuary is the glory of classical Greece, this glory is the
exception that proves the rule, because a disproportionate number
of sculptures, saved by their materials, have survived from
antiquity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite these extenuating circumstances, however, it is clear
that major injustices have been done, notably to the artist who is
the focus of ``Adriaen de Vries, Imperial Sculptor,'' a show at the
J. Paul Getty Museum through Jan. 9. Although he was said to have
done for bronze what Michelangelo did for marble, de Vries was not
even mentioned by name when a traveler described one of his
masterpieces, only 60 years after his death, in terms usually
reserved for the ancient Greeks. Such cavalier treatment of
Tintoretto, Annibale Carracci or Guido Reni, his contemporaries, is
inconceivable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet de Vries (1556-1626) was clearly their equal as a
master, first of the twisting, straining style of the Mannerists
and then of the grandeur, the ornament and the emotional drama that
we associate with the Baroque. It is true that many of his works
are off the traditional tourist track, in Prague and Stockholm, and
thus did not receive the sustained interest that travelers
lavished, for instance, on the Berninis in Rome.
 &UR;  &LR; Nevertheless, the long neglect of this artist has been lamentable,
though redeemed somewhat by a turnaround in the last 10 years or
so, prompted by forces political and economic as well as esthetic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Vries gained new recognition, first, because two of his
bronzes, both now in the Getty, sold for huge sums in the 1980s:
``Rearing Horse'' for more than $1 million in 1984 and ``Juggling
Man'' for $10.7 million in 1989; second, because his chief patron,
the Hapsburg Emperor Rudolf II, attracted intense interest (and two
major exhibitions) after Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution of
1989, when admiration for the newly liberated Prague helped draw
attention to the city's golden age under Rudolf; and third, because
the Dutch, led by Frits Scholten, the curator primarily responsible
for assembling this exhibition and editing its splendid catalogue,
were delighted to add a new star to their artistic heritage.
 &UR;  &LR; Whatever the reasons, however, it is cause for rejoicing that the
Getty, collaborating with the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the
National museum in Stockholm, has brought to an American audience
38 bronzes and 6 drawings by de Vries along with 27 related
sculptures, engravings and paintings, all of which offer a rich
introduction to his extraordinary oeuvre. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To work in bronze is to tempt fate. It was hard enough to
uncover the form that Michelangelo described as ``hidden'' in
marble, or to transform its surfaces as he and Bernini did. But
bronze called on the metal founder's art to complement the
sculptor's; the disasters that always lurked when metal was heated,
poured, shaped and cooled could defeat even the greatest virtuosos,
as Leonardo and Cellini discovered.
</P>
<P>
   It was not much consolation for de Vries that the fault was the
founder's, not his, when the mold cracked and the molten bronze was
lost while he was casting one of two grand fountains for the city
of Augsburg, Germany, in the 1590s. The successful recasting is
stunning: a group of relaxed figures around flowing water,
surmounted by a monumental Hercules killing a fearsome Hydra _ an
ensemble that united charm and narrative force with a power never
before seen in a mere fountain.
</P>
<P>
   This colossus could not be moved, but the exhibition does have
five elements from another fountain, celebrating Neptune, displayed
as individual pieces of sculpture. One of them, a languid Triton
worthy of Bernini, embodies the movement and the surface glow that
was de Vries' hallmark. That these bronzes blend skill in
engineering with high art makes the results all the more
remarkable, and the Getty has provided, as an adjunct to the show,
a fascinating demonstration of the casting techniques that produced
the sculptures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main revelation of the exhibition, however, is the variety
of effects a great artist could summon up from this cold metal
medium. Although the statuary for the garden of one of de Vries's
most discerning patrons, the military commander Albrecht von
Wallenstein, was confiscated by a Swedish army, replicas adorn his
palace grounds in Prague to this day, and suggest the paradisiacal
setting, full of the figures of myth, that the sculptor could
create.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of these pieces is at the Getty, a tender, relaxed portrayal
of a life-size Adonis, his dog at his feet, carrying across his
shoulders a deer, the trophy of his hunt. He looks fondly down at
Venus, who opens her arms and delicately touches his side. It is a
group that evokes bucolic pleasure and young love, wonder and sheer
delight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a late work, completed two years before de Vries's death
at age 70, but his skills had been apparent long before. Born to a
prosperous family in The Hague, he went to Florence in his mid-20s
to work in the studio of a fellow northerner, Giambologna (two of
whose elegant sculptures are also on view at the Getty). By his
early 30s, after a stint in Milan, he was the court sculptor to the
Duke of Savoy in Turin, but soon he was ``borrowed'' by Rudolf II
and taken to Prague.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, where Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler studied the
heavens, where the fantasies of Giuseppe Arcimboldo took root,
where artists from all Europe found encouragement, that de Vries
spent most of his remaining years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His first commissions were small sculptures for Rudolf's
collection. Among the examples at the Getty are a heroic bust of
the emperor, finely detailed horses in different postures and a
dazzling group of Hercules holding up his wife Deianeira as the
dying centaur Nessus, from whom he has just saved her, lies in
agony between his legs.
</P>
<P>
   This last is an essay in movement and emotion, form and feeling,
in which de Vries captures not only the loving looks that flow
between Hercules and his wife but also the contrast between their
embrace and the torment of their foe.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life de Vries returned to the Nessus theme, on a larger
scale, at the moment when Hercules attacks the centaur and his wife
finally breaks free. Both the complexity and the intensity are
heightened: Nessus is now more monstrous, Hercules murderously
intent as he yanks back the centaur's head, and Deianeira in active
flight. Circling the sculpture, we have to work harder to decipher
the unfolding story.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the bronze has an almost impressionistic surface,
with muscles and features suggested rather than elaborated. De
Vries, maybe aware of his advancing years, has abandoned the
meticulous detail of his earlier work and creates his effects with
almost nonchalant grace.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ease and mastery he achieved as he entered his
60s, de Vries could dare to take on a classic from antiquity, the
Laocoon, which he had sketched on a visit to Rome. His version,
created for Wallenstein, is upright and columnar, unlike the
friezelike ancient monument. And his bravado in attempting one of
the icons of the sculptor's art was again matched by his style, in
which he almost sketches the subject, undistracted by ornament or
unnecessary detail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was fortunate for de Vries that, after the travels, the
shifts of patronage and the disruptions of war that were the lot of
the sculptor in his age, he was able to settle down and bring his
talents to this remarkable culmination in his last years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch were not wrong to describe him, in the publicity for
the Amsterdam exhibition, as their Michelangelo. And perhaps our
century, when sculptors have more often matched painters as
cultural heroes, may at last give him his due.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Getty's superb natural lighting, and the close
examination its display allows, we can at last see for ourselves
why, in recent years, de Vries' rising reputation has prompted
comparisons with the leading figures of Western art.

IT'S ALL IN JOHN MALKOVICH'S HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: For use Friday, Oct. 29 or thereafter) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Cusack calls it ``the craziest piece of
writing'' he has ever read. Cameron Diaz has never quite been able
to figure out what it's about, while Orson Bean thinks he knows the
secret but doesn't want to share for fear of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   And John Malkovich?
</P>
<P>
   Let us just borrow a quote from Cusack and call him ``sportsman
of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie producing all the head scratching is ``Being John
Malkovich,'' the strangest film to hit theaters in, well, a century
of cinema. Written five years ago by a first-time screenwriter and
directed by MTV auteur Spike Jonze, ``Malkovich'' is a
one-of-a-kind wonder that defies easy description. R.E.M.
singer/movie producer Michael Stipe, whose Single Cell Pictures
developed the film, probably comes closest to being the movie's
most coherent spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about an out-of-work puppeteer who takes a job in an
office and finds a membranous tunnel which, when you crawl through
it, emerges into the soul of John Malkovich for 15 minutes and then
spits you into a ditch by the New Jersey turnpike,'' Stipe says.
``Chaos ensues.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple, huh?
</P>
<P>
   The movie slyly spoofs our fascination with celebrities, but
underneath all the weirdness, ``Malkovich'' is really about human
needs, both desperate and despairing. Nobody here seems happy in
their own skins _ or, sometimes, in their own gender _ and the
portal into Malkovich represents a logical escape hatch,
particularly for a generation weaned on ``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the film's writer, Charlie Kaufman, will cop to none
of this. Heck, he won't even reveal his age, let alone whatever
peculiar place in his head that this idea came from. What Kaufman
will say: He is not interested in being a social critic. He wrote
the movie without an outline and with no sense of direction or
purpose. And he is not obsessed with, nor is he stalking, John
Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   That latter point is rather important because when Malkovich
came across the script, shortly after Kaufman had written it, he
was more than a little curious about the individual who would dream
up such a fantastically personal scenario. Thus, he dispatched his
business partner, Russell Smith, for a meeting with Kaufman. The
following exchange ensued:
</P>
<P>
   Smith: What is your relationship with John Malkovich?
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman: Um ... I ... um ... admire him greatly as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: So why did you set part of the movie on the
seventh-and-a-half floor of an office building?
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman: Um ... (Kaufman pauses frequently in conversation) I
... um ... thought it was funny visually.
</P>
<P>
   Smith: Well, did you know that John's apartment in New York is
number seven-and-a-half?!?
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman says a chill went down his spine at that moment and he
figured the jig was up. No one, particularly Malkovich, would
believe the whole thing was coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Says Smith, (somewhat) facetiously: ``I thought he was a stalker
and he thought I was there to kill him. I mean, there were just a
lot of coincidences in the script that made you a little
suspicious. I thought maybe John slept with his wife and this
screenplay was his revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kaufman didn't know anything more about Malkovich than
``your average moviegoer'' and chose the actor and his name because
``it just seemed right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my theories about why,'' Kaufman says, ``but they all
came after I chose him. This was something I just wrote for myself.
I never figured it would actually be made into a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else did, either. Kaufman's screenplay was one of the
most popular reads in Hollywood, but no one offered to produce it.
Kaufman didn't even get a meeting for it. What he did get was a lot
of work (screenplays, the television sitcom ``Get a Life''), so he
figured the script had served its purpose. Besides, Malkovich
himself _ despite the coincidences _ loved it and his praise
(received secondhand) was reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe and his producing partner, Sandy Stern, thought
``Malkovich'' was too good to sit on the shelf, however, and, two
years ago called Jonze, asking if he would consider directing it.
Jonze loved the script and found a kindred soul in Kaufman, a man
whose absurdist take on life closely matches his own. (``Neither of
them are easy reads,'' Stipe says. ``They tend to hold their cards
close to their chests.'')
</P>
<P>
   The two spent nine months revising Kaufman's original draft. All
the while, the great unanswered question hung in the air: Would
Malkovich agree to ``Being John Malkovich''? Alternate names were
proposed _ William Hurt was a front-runner _ but no one seemed as
right as Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with Malkovich was set, and Jonze jetted off to Paris
to pop the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some doubts,'' Malkovich admits, ``but they had nothing
to do with the material, which I thought was fantastic, and nothing
to do with making fun of me. They had to do with this: I have tried
to construct my life so whatever public notoriety I have doesn't
become invasive. And this movie crosses that line. So, I had to
decide if I wanted to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I had said no,'' Malkovich continues, ``it would have
been for all the wrong reasons, and this really original, inventive
thing wouldn't have been done. So Spike and I worked it out.
Ultimately, what I'm doing is playing the character of John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Cusack interjects: ``And I think he got it all wrong.
He's too close to the character to do it justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusack, naturally, is kidding. He agrees with Stipe, who says it
took incredible nerve for Malkovich to portray himself in this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The persona he's presenting is clearly not himself, but the
public's idea of what it's like to be a famous movie star _
arrogant, misogynistic, ordering towels out of a catalog for your
kitchen,'' Stipe says. ``It's completely banal. And it points out
how absurd our notions of celebrity are.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Jonze: ``He was a trouper. Every day, John would come in
and laugh and say, `I thought yesterday was the most humiliating
thing I'd ever shot, and it just keeps getting more humiliating.'
But he'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which surprised some of Malkovich's fellow cast members, who,
fittingly, had their own ideas about what the actor would be like.
Catherine Keener, playing one of the characters who enters
Malkovich's head, calls it a mystique; co-star Diaz says he's
initially ``a little intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured he was a weird guy,'' says Orson Bean, who
plays the owner of the company that resides on the
seventh-and-a-half floor. ``You know, he plays wackos so well, he'd
be a little wacko himself. He isn't. He's a swell guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkovich doesn't really care how he's perceived, which is good
because otherwise he could never have done this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much know what I am, and I pretty much always have,''
Malkovich says. ``But in Hollywood, you're a kind of product.
They'll give you so much money to play a bad guy and the other
scripts don't come in because that's your `product,' your
identification. But I know I can do other things. I've done it my
whole life. Maybe people haven't seen it, but I don't really care.
It's more a loss for others than it is for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Will people go see Malkovich in ``Malkovich''? Stipe, for one,
thinks the public is ready for such a wacky challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick to death of movies that are the same story
they've seen and heard for the past 40 years,'' Stipe says. ``If
Kevin Costner makes another baseball movie, I will personally
throttle the man. Maybe this film can help chink away the armor a
little bit and get people in this business (away) from thinking
about the lowest common denominator.'' &QL;

 &HT;    BellSouth buys license for Guatemala wireless
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth has continued its march through Latin
America, buying a $26 million license Wednesday to provide wireless
phone service in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   The license will extend BellSouth's presence to 14 countries
outside the United States, including 10 in Latin America and three
in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guatemala is relatively small _ with a population of 11
million _ it represents another link in a chain of BellSouth
investments that now reach from Guatemala's border with Mexico as
far south as Argentina and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   International business is, with wireless and local service in
the United States, a leg in BellSouth's strategic tripod. During
the past quarter, international operations reported revenue of $749
million, mostly from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, whose local partners own 40 percent of the venture,
aims to have its Guatemalan service running next year, said
spokesman Kevin Doyle. BellSouth will have three competitors in
Guatemala, including the national company and a venture dominated
by Telefonica de Esapana.

TAKING CUE FROM DEMOCRATS, GOP SEEKS TO CAPITALIZE ON SOCIAL
SECURITY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.D., Nev., Kan., Conn.)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Earl Pomeroy, an earnest Democrat from North
Dakota, was able to go to college after his father died only
because of Social Security benefits for survivors. And he has
devoted his six years in Congress in large part to pension issues
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   So he finds it particularly galling that he is one of seven or
so House Democrats from swing districts in states like North
Dakota, Nevada, Kansas and Connecticut who are being hit this month
with Republican commercials that portray Democrats as thieves or
wild revelers who want to fritter away Social Security reserves
``on big government programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington has gotten to the point where the sessions between
the elections are kind of like the setup period for the next
election,'' Pomeroy complained. ``These ads have certainly made
this October feel like an election year October, and triggered
every competitive instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota Democratic Party, in fact, has fired back with
commercials of its own quoting a newspaper editorial calling the
Republican ads ``a new low in the campaign gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   The air war shows that as much as this end-of-session budget
battle is about the nitty gritty of federal programs and policy,
both parties also consider this a pivotal moment that could shape
next year's struggle for control of the House. And after years of
losing each such faceoff with President Clinton, the Republicans
are fighting this fall to define the terms of the budget debate to
their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Each day they hold news conferences to hammer home the theme on
Social Security that is amplified through their ads. And
Republicans say this concerted campaign has legislative and
political goals.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that the ads may cause some conservative or marginal
Democrats in Congress to vote with them as the budget battle goes
on. And politically, the commercials are designed to inoculate
Republicans on an issue that is traditionally a Democratic strength
by painting the GOP as the party trying to protect the popular
retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Republicans call the commercials a warning that
some Democrats will pay a price if their party prolongs the budget
fight for partisan advantage in hopes that the Republicans once
again will look as if they want a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican leaders suggested this week that they could
expand the campaign to other districts. ``The main thing is we just
need everyone to understand _ it could be your place next,'' said
Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats complain bitterly about the Republican ads. But
it was Clinton who pioneered the technique.
</P>
<P>
   At this very moment in his first budget struggle with the new
Republican Congress in 1995, Clinton used the Democratic National
Committee to run commercial after commercial hammering Republican
leaders for their proposal to slow the growth of Medicare by $270
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That television campaign, which cost at least $35 million , paid
huge political dividends. Clinton's aides said the commercials gave
the president the public support to stand up against the
Republicans in the budget battle that led to the government
shutdown. Some of his political strategists said those early ads so
shaped public thinking that they essentially won him the
presidential election the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican House campaign is tiny compared with Clinton's.
The Democrats, who are monitoring the ad campaign closely, say it
is now hovering around $500,000 and that few of the commercials are
running in prime time. The Republicans predict that before it is
over their campaign will cost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties disagree strongly about whether the ad campaign
_ or the entire Republican posture on Social Security _ is having
any effect on the public. A Gallup poll of 1,005 adults conducted
in recent days for CNN and USA Today suggested it is not. Asked who
they trust more to act responsibly with the government funds set
aside for Social Security benefits, 38 percent of those polled said
the GOP in Congress while 50 percent chose Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' focus on Social Security has put the
Democrats on the defensive. Day after day, Democrats have had to
stand up and argue in their own news conferences that the
Republicans' spending bills are really using up billions of dollars
of Social Security money. Mustering evidence, they say that the GOP
is using every accounting trick and gimmick possible to be able to
make their claim that they are protecting the Social Security
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been putting out false information,'' Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said on Wednesday.
``They've been saying for weeks now that they're not spending
Social Security money,'' he said. ``This is the big lie. It's the
big fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   But a scuffle over which party is telling the truth over Social
Security degenerates into a confusing argument that does not draw
bright lines of distinction between the parties. And attempts to
explain budgetary gimmicks can quickly become mind-numbingly
complicated. Knowing this, Republicans are guardedly optimistic:
Given their past record, for them it is a win even to fight the
Democrats to a draw on budget matters.
</P>
<P>
   So the Democrats are looking for ways to change the dialogue.
``We are not just arguing about Social Security for this year, but
who's going to strengthen Social Security for the long term,'' said
Geoffrey Garin, who conducts polls for the Democratic congressional
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in recent days sent lawmakers a proposal that would use
federal budget surpluses to keep the retirement system solvent
through 2050. And he proposed Medicare legislation that he said
would save money and enhance care by steering Medicare patients to
certain doctors and hospitals that offered discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said it was too late to take up the Medicare
legislation this year. And they pronounced the president's Social
Security plan dead on arrival, arguing that it does nothing to
narrow the mismatch between the program's revenues and the benefits
that will have to be paid out when baby boomers start retiring in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   For Pomeroy, meanwhile, this first session of the 106th Congress
has felt like a wasted opportunity, since the focus on whether
Social Security reserves are left untouched has little to do with
any efforts to guarantee the system's long-term health. He had
hoped that this year, before campaign 2000 went into full swing,
would provide breathing room to make progress on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office this week, he said with a sigh, ``This has
been a very dysfunctional session.''

ANDRAS HEGEDUS, HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER TURNED DISSIDENT, DIES AT
76  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, Hungary)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andras Hegedus, a former prime minister of Hungary whose
political odyssey transformed him from a dogmatic Stalinist
apparatchik into an outspoken _ and barely tolerated _ dissenter,
died on Saturday. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting from Budapest, The Associated Press said he had a
heart ailment in recent years and was hospitalized weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hegedus, who was born into rural poverty, turned to communism in
his youth and swiftly rose in the party and the government after
World War II. He became minister of agriculture in 1953 and held
full membership in the Politburo. In 1955, at age 33, he became his
country's youngest head of government.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his country's periodic policy swings and shake-ups at
the top, he replaced Imre Nagy, who had steered a new economic
course to placate unhappy farmers and consumers. Hegedus
represented Hungary when the Soviet-bloc states entered into the
Warsaw Pact in response to West Germany's re-armament and admission
to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hungarian uprising began in October 1956, Hegedus ceded
the post of prime minister back to Nagy. The Soviet military
stamped out the rebellion, and Nagy was later convicted of treason
and executed in 1957 under the rule of Janos Kadar.
</P>
<P>
   Hegedus went into hiding in Moscow. As he observed the Soviet
system, he began a conversion to what he later called revisionism.
He was allowed to return to Budapest in 1958 and to work at the
economic institute of the Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of his growing disaffection appeared in the numerous
articles he contributed to publications as the Kadar government
relaxed economic and political controls. In 1968, for instance,
Hegedus called for an end to the powers of the secret police,
which, he wrote, rested on a myth of capitalist encirclement of the
Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   He fell out of favor that year when he protested the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia, in which Hungary took part. He was
fired from his academic post and expelled from the Communist Party
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As he became one of Hungary's best known dissidents, he wrote
several books, some of which were published abroad and circulated
underground in Hungary. Until the collapse of communism, he also
lectured to groups in private homes.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his six children, The Associated Press
reported.

CANDIDATES HIT THE STREETS OF COLLEGE TOWN

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ It was hurry up and wait Wednesday as the two
Democratic candidates killed time, browsed on Main Street, and met
the students here.
</P>
<P>
   The Dartmouth College campus swarmed Wednesday with a sea of
television trucks, reporters and volunteers waving signs and
chanting for Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Bradley took a walking tour of Hanover, his
6-foot-5-inch frame bobbing above more than 60 reporters and
cameramen. Inside Lou's Restaurant, a favorite local spot for
breakfast, Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, chatted with customers.
The Bradleys seemed in a jovial mood, with the former senator
calling out for his wife, ``Where's Ernestine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mixing,'' Mrs. Bradley responded, somewhat indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley spied an enormous apple pie on the counter, he
motioned to his wife and said, ``She could eat all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In return, when Mrs. Bradley saw her husband approach a baby,
she called out, ``Don't hurt the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was trailed by an enthusiastic group of students, some
of whom were spreading a rumor that Bradley hadn't really wanted to
go to Princeton. ``Dartmouth was his first choice,'' one sign said.
Wednesday, at least, that was true.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began Wednesday morning in the southern town of Bedford,
where he jogged for about 45 minutes with the cross-country team
from Souhegan High School. Later in the day, he strolled down Main
Street in Hanover, dressed in a blue blazer and khakis, shaking
hands along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Dartmouth Bookstore, Gore stopped at the information
desk to ask for Jimmy Carter's new book, ``Sources of Strength.''
He wandered through the aisles, introducing himself to shoppers and
employees until he discovered a 6-year-old, Nikkita Gottling,
sitting on a captain's chair with a book in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knelt down on one knee and asked if he could read to her.
Picking up ``Tikvah Means Hope,'' by Patricia Polacco, the vice
president read in a gentle voice the story of a cat who survives a
fire. Gottling sat quietly, her hands in her lap, occasionally
glancing up quizzically at all the people snapping her photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley supporters began massing outside the
bookstore, waving their signs and shouting, ``Give me a B, give me
an R . . .'' Gore's student backers quickly assembled in response,
and the result was a chanting match that could be faintly heard
inside the store.
</P>
<P>
   When he finished reading the story, Gore thanked the little girl
with the navy tights and the Mary Janes for letting him read her
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have three little girls and one little boy and a
grandson,'' he said. ``And I have to practice reading to him.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sally Gottling's request, Gore signed the book for her
daughter, Nikkita. (Gottling is a Democrat who has not decided whom
she is supporting in the primary.)
</P>
<P>
   After walking away, Gore turned back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on Nikkita, let's go buy your book,'' he said, leading
her over to the cash register where he paid for it along with the
Carter book. Before leaving, Gore gave Nikkita a hug and said
goodbye.

LINDA F. PEZZANO, PROMOTER OF `TRIVIAL PURSUIT' GAME, DIES AT 54  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Linda F. Pezzano, a marketing consultant who helped
what was then an obscure Canadian board game, ``Trivial Pursuit,''
achieve sales totaling more than $1 billion, died Tuesday at a
hospice in Manhattan. She was 54.
</P>
<P>
   She died of cervical cancer, said her brother David.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pezzano's ``Trivial Pursuit'' campaign changed the way game
makers do business. Dorothy Crenshaw, who worked with Ms. Pezzano
in marketing games and other products, said the approach was based
on drumming up favorable word-of-mouth comments, or ``buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Trivial Pursuit,'' she sent 1,800 top buyers who would be
attending the 1983 New York Toy Fair a series of teasing messages
in the months before the event. She also sent the game to Hollywood
stars whose names were mentioned in its trivia questions. When some
stars, including Gregory Peck, James Mason, Pat Boone and Larry
Hagman, wrote letters of thanks, she used them in her promotions.
</P>
<P>
   She also staged game-playing events at parks, bars, restaurants
and ski clubs to stimulate conversation.
</P>
<P>
   One virtue of her campaign was that it was cheap. By giving away
a few hundred games at a $12 wholesale cost, a fad was started.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew nobody would play a board game without getting their
hands on it,'' said Chris Byrne, who in 1985 worked with Ms.
Pezzano in selling the game Pictionary, a way of playing charades
on paper. ``She took games to the people,'' said Byrne, who is now
editor of Toy Report, an industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said her direct approach to potential players contrasted
sharply with what was then the standard _ and expensive _ practice:
relying on television, movies and licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``She created the model that everyone now uses,'' he said.
``Today we call it `viral marketing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Giving games away was a major part of the strategy, and she and
Byrne would sometimes pass out free Pictionary games to every
passenger on a flight they were on. ``We estimated that for every
complete Pictionary we gave away, we sold between five and 12
more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pezzano was born and raised in Schenectady. She came to
Manhattan at 17 to become a folk singer. She attended Elmira
College without obtaining an undergraduate degree but later earned
a master's degree from Columbia Business School while working full
time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her brother David of Schenectady, she is survived by
another brother, Michael of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   After a short stint with a public relations firm in the early
1980s she founded her own company, which took on ``Trivial
Pursuit'' as one of its first projects. After her company was
acquired by Dorf &AMP; Stanton in 1986, she moved to Italy, where she
advised businesses on international ventures. In 1995, she returned
to New York and started a new company, Pezzano Inc.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to work on games, including a new sports trivia
game called ``Rules of the Game.'' Among her ideas was to sell it
in sporting goods stores rather than toy stores, where board games
are traditionally sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could go to Harvard Business School and learn how to do
that,'' Byrne said, ``but to Linda it was always just common sense,
and fun.''

   ONE SNEAKY WITCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kids love to hear scary stories. And Keith Grimwood and his
friends at Baba Yaga Records think their 19-minute recording of the
story of Baba Yaga the Witch is just perfect for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   This story of a sneaky witch who lives in a hut that turns
around on chicken legs is based on a Russian fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   A young girl sent on an errand for her stepmother is captured by
the witch, who makes her cook and clean. The girl's only salvation
is the kindness she shows to the cat, dog and a birch tree.
</P>
<P>
   The entire recording is done as a radio play complete with
bouncy songs such as ``Baba Yaga Song,'' ``What Is That Smell?''
and ``Happily Ever After.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baba Yaga the Witch'' is available on CD for $8 or cassette
for $5. To order by phone, call (877) 302-1739. On the Internet:

SWISS VOTERS, TILTING RIGHT, UNSETTLE TRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Outwardly, the strong gains posted by fervent
nationalists in weekend elections were about refugees and the
country's place in Europe. But the voting was also very much about
Swiss identity, shaped by the recent furor over Switzerland's role
in World War II and its uncertainty over what path to take in the
future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After four decades of national consensus, the gains made by the
right in the parliamentary elections have upset governing
traditions and thrown the political landscape into chaos. The tilt
to the right places Switzerland firmly in the conservative camp
currently led by neighboring Austria, which recently gave its own
far-right party a resounding electoral victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amassing nearly 23 percent of the popular vote, the Swiss
People's Party greatly increased the number of its seats in
Parliament and made an open bid to strengthen its role in the
Federal Council, Switzerland's governing body. That threatens to
undo the ``magic formula'' of coalition rule among the four biggest
parties, which has existed since 1959. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This `magic formula' is as good as dead,'' the newspaper Blick
said of the current division of council seats to balance parties
and regions and its four language groups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Peoples Party, whose most visible spokesman is a millionaire
industrialist, Christoph Blocher, appealed to voters worried about
taxes, immigrants and closer ties with the rest of Europe. With its
clear answers _ which some critics call simplistic and dangerous _
the party consolidated support from smaller right-leaning parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blocher has built a bridge between the democrats and those on
the extreme right,'' said Frank Meyer, editorialist for the weekly
Sonntags Blick in Zurich, who has frequently written in opposition
to Blocher's politics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blocher appealed to ``those who have fear of too many
foreigners, fear of globalization and fear of Europe,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a simple message,'' the writer said. ``No.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The party campaigned on contentions that too many people were
abusing asylum laws by seeking refugee status. Accusations of crime
and drug dealing and fears that jobs were being lost to foreigners
were fueled by a large influx of Kosovars who fled the war in that
Yugoslav province. Many of the Kosovars had relatives who have
worked here for decades, often as laborers. But the influx of tens
of thousands more led to an anti-foreigner backlash and calls for
tighter asylum laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those fears are linked to fears of closer relations with the
European Union, where members have to allow free movement of people
across borders.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to close the borders,'' Felix Mueller, a
commentator for the daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung, said. ``There will
be some tightening. But basically this is about Swiss identity. It
boils down to sending your kids to school and finding out that 60
percent of the other children can't speak German. There's a feeling
that there are just too many to integrate.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beat Kappeler, who writes for a Zurich weekly, Weltewoche,
agreed. ``It's a problem in the schools and at work,'' Ms. Kappeler
said. ``I don't agree with all his solutions, but Blocher asked the
right questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote also reflects a continuing reaction to disclosures
about Switzerland's role as a banker for some Nazis _ and for some
Jews whose assets seemed to disappear after in World War II,
Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is greatly underestimated, especially for the elderly,''
he explained. ``There is great anger over this, and that generation
helped Blocher build a solid base.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Tuesday in the Israeli newspaper
Yediot Aharonot and quoted by Agence France-Presse, Blocher said:
``As far as Switzerland is concerned, the threat to boycott Swiss
banks in America is pure extortion. The boycott is exactly like the
boycott which the Nazis used in the past against Jews, when they
said, `Don't buy from Jews.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said his party was ``opposed to any manifestation of
anti-Semitism and racism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blocher has been outspoken against using Swiss funds to
establish a foundation for the needy, including Holocaust
survivors, Ms. Kappeler noted, ``which helped his popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry announced that it planned to set
up a relief fund from selling its gold reserves. Bolcher said the
proceeds should go only to the state pension fund, not to a broad
category of needy people.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Peoples Party's strong showing will remake the 200-member
lower house of Parliament, where it will be the second largest
party, with 44 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is undoubtedly the most important shift in the vote and,
possibly in parliamentary seats, in Swiss political history since
the introduction of the proportional system 80 years ago,'' Le
Temps, a daily in Geneva, said in a front-page article alongside a
large photograph of Blocher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The future of the seven-member Federal Council is also at stake.
Blocher said Sunday that his party should receive a second position
in addition to the one it has.

 &HT;    Gore moves closer to voters
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Retirees can be a rowdy crowd. Impatient for Vice
President Al Gore to show up last week at a forum organized by the
AARP, a room full of gray-haired voters guffawed when Ron Tornow
sprang to his feet and gave a rendition of the White Rabbit's song
from ``Alice in Wonderland'': ``I'm late! I'm late! For a very
important date!''
</P>
<P>
   Tornow, 62, a potter from Merrimack, was hardly more reverent
after the vice president had arrived and made his pitch to this
crucial audience, but he was more impressed with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came today to see how boring you could be, and I must say
I've been thoroughly disappointed,'' he told Gore after listening
to him respond to questions about prescription drugs, Medicare and
Social Security, as well as crime and education. Afterward, Tornow
said he would even consider changing party registration to vote for
Gore in the Feb. 1 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for the presidency, Gore has indeed been late.
</P>
<P>
   Only this month, losing ground to Bill Bradley in this key state
and continuing to lag behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the
polls, did the vice president move his headquarters from
Washington, D.C., to Nashville, Tenn., and take sharper aim on
Bradley in an attempt to change the chemistry of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that effort has been the decision to ``roll the dice''
and put Gore closer to the voters he has to win back, said Michael
Whouley, who is directing the vice president's ground operation in
New Hampshire and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   So at the AARP meeting Friday and a gathering of about 200
mostly undecided voters last Thursday night in the gym of Dover
Middle School, the vice president stood surrounded by voters,
dressed in khakis and boots with a Palm Pilot V electronic
organizer on his belt. He answered questions on topics from Web
pornography to UFOs and stayed a long time afterward talking with
voters about whatever subjects were on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of open-ended forum Bradley and Republican John
McCain have been successful with this year, but Gore has been
understudy to a master of the town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gore doesn't have the raw appetite for human contact and the
sense of political timing that made Bill Clinton such a hit in the
gymnasiums of New Hampshire in 1992, but like Clinton he's
conversant with an impressive array of issues. He isn't exactly a
stand-up comic, but he could mix some humor with a message, as he
did when a youngster at the Dover meeting told him about his
schoolmates printing pornography off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the idea is not to look too much like the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there any grandparents here? Can I see a show of hands?
Anybody got 10 grandchildren?'' Gore did the same crowd-loosening
routine at four New Hampshire stops last week, to environmentalists
and veterans as well as retirees and undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the 51-year-old vice president talked about his joy
over his first grandson, born to daughter Karenna on July 4. He
spoke of his pride in his father, the late Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee, and his mother, Pauline, who got through college with
her blind sister and went on to become a pioneering lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He wove in threads of his own biography _ of his disillusionment
after his tour in Vietnam and his father's defeat, and how he
learned a new admiration for public service covering local
government for the Nashville Tennessean newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparent count is a device for reassuring audiences about
Gore's maturity, as compared to the president he serves. Tellingly,
he worked it into his answer when a young mother at the Dover
meeting asked him about his moral principles, which, in light of
Clinton, is a question he has become practiced at answering.
</P>
<P>
   The issues he focused on should appeal to traditionally liberal
New Hampshire Democrats. He declared in Dover that his first act as
president would be to resubmit the nuclear test ban treaty, and he
vehemently denounced the GOP senators who voted against it two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He told environmentalists he would fight new oil drilling off
Florida and California, even on existing leases, and he told a
teacher he favors tripling federal funding for special education.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire will be critical for Gore, both in terms of the
nomination and his general election prospects. Bradley is not
mounting as serious a challenge to Gore in Iowa, the other early
state. If Gore beats him here, he can turn his attention quickly to
the Republican nominee. If he stumbles in New Hampshire, he faces a
longer, more costly and distracting battle, even if he goes on to
win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore returned to New Hampshire this week to campaign before his
Wednesday night television debate with Bradley in Manchester. Over
the weekend, his wife, Tipper, led a big vote-canvassing drive in
the state. There are plans in coming weeks for several more town
meetings like the one in Dover.
</P>
<P>
   This week there was good news for the campaign in a USA
Today-CNN-Gallup Poll that shows Gore cutting substantially into
Bush's lead and maintaining a strong lead over Bradley among
Democrats nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the effort to fashion a ``new Gore'' has anything to do
with the poll numbers can't be known, but it coincides with his
campaign's shift in emphasis from contributors to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Mason, Gore's Georgia chairman and a former Clinton White
House staffer, said the move to Nashville and the other changes
have helped Gore be ``a little bit more unrestrained'' in his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the vice president, there's a system for making
decisions and doing things that doesn't necessarily apply well to a
political campaign,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach has helped Gore act more decisively, he said,
changing his schedule and going to Rhode Island to visit a school
Bush didn't get to, and deciding to take an outspoken stand on the
nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If it was not a ``new Gore'' who engaged in closer encounters
with the voters last week, it was a seasoned campaigner prepared to
roll up his sleeves and battle for votes in a more direct fashion
than he has been able to so far. He's late, but he has the power of
his office and a stolid determination to catch up.

BOND PRICES RISE SHARPLY FOLLOWING RELEASE OF A WEAK REPORT ON
DURABLE GOODS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prices of Treasury securities were up sharply for the first time
in a week Wednesday following the release of a weaker-than-expected
durable goods orders report for September.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said, however, that prices were gaining even before the
report was released. Early in the session dealers cited
short-covering and technical buying as contributing to the gains
once the December bond contract broke above the resistance level of
111 8/32. Gains in the European bond market sparked the initial
rally here on expectations that the European Central Bank will
raise interest rates to stifle inflation when it meets on Nov. 4.
The move is expected to benefit American Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the 30-year Treasury bond had gained 22/32,
to 97 12/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, fell to 6.32 percent, from 6.37 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the day's gains were limited ahead of Thursday's
third quarter GDP data coupled with the release of the September
Employment Cost index report. Many were also waiting for a speech
in the evening by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to the
Business Council, an organization of top corporate chief
executives, in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Also factored into Wednesday's trading activity was the
Treasury's $15 billion auction of new two-year notes, which saw
decent investor demand and may have even helped perk up buying
interest in other maturities as well. Dealers had expected a high
yield of about 5.95 percent for the new note, which was awarded at
5.935 percent and slightly below the when-issued yield. Fear that
the note auction could fall victim to continuing bearish sentiment
over Fed policy concerns, especially with critical economic data to
be released later this week proved unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly larger-than-expected 1.3 percent decline in
September new orders for durable goods buoyed the bond market, but
since this was the first drop in five months, it was not considered
worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase
Asset Management, ``durable goods orders during the third quarter
rose 8.5 percent above a year ago, which was the strongest pace
since the end of 1997 and a rather clear indication that the
current level of interest rates is not suppressing growth in a
major interest-sensitive sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's scheduled third quarter GDP release and its attendant
benchmark revisions, along with the release of the September
employment cost index, Fine quipped, ``inundate market participants
with a torrent of data which can only be described as a pure case
of statistical sadism.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects the GDP to demonstrate the economy's continuing
momentum, as growth over the past few years is likely to be revised
noticeably higher, while the employment numbers will be carefully
studied for signs of a pick up in labor cost pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations of a further round of Fed tightening at the
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Nov. 16 is now fully
incorporated into bond market thinking and rate levels,'' said
Fine, ``and another quarter point must be deemed the most likely
monetary policy scenario at this point barring any evidence of a
sudden, substantial slowdown in the economy or an imminent, severe
contraction in the stock market.''

ESCALATION BY EXTREMISTS HAS RESEARCHERS ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alicia Karas, a veterinary anesthesiologist at Tufts
University, gingerly went through her mail Wednesday as she does
every morning, checking each envelope for a return address that she
recognized before opening it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Karas is not a primary researcher, she is not taking
any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is to improve pain relief in all animals,'' including
laboratory animals used in veterinary medical research, Karas said.
``But I worry very much when I get an unfamiliar envelope or
package. If I can't work out who it is from, I throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from news that an extremist animal-rights group has sent
booby-trapped letters to a dozen Harvard researchers who use
primates in experiments, Karas and others are feeling the fallout
of a fight between the animal-rights movement and biomedical
research that might be getting uglier.
</P>
<P>
   The letters, which contained a razor blade taped inside the
envelope, were sent to 84 researchers nationwide. They follow a
string of raids and other efforts by animal-rights extremists to
destroy research labs, hunting clubs, and other places they say
exemplify animal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   What is beginning to frighten researchers is an escalation of
methods reminiscent of antiabortion extremists: targeting specific
physicians by sending them harassing letters, placing their names
on Web sites, and even protesting outside their homes. Widely used
by animal-rights activists in Britain and other European nations,
these tactics are relatively new to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an escalation in the past few months,'' said
Debra Higgins Cavalier, president of the Massachusetts Society for
Medical Research, which upholds the use of animals in research and
produces educational materials about it for schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most who are in the field are very much aware of the organized
opposition and take precautions,'' she said. ``But those coming
into the sciences may be more fearful and individuals starting work
with higher-learning species may question whether they have to''
use the animals for their work.
</P>
<P>
   In July and September, the Animal Liberation Front _ a radical
international group that opposes using animals for fur, food, or
research _ took credit for wrecking three hunting and fishing clubs
in Maine and has said it will carry out more raids against other
targets in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The group also took credit for firebombing four vans belonging
to a furrier in Warwick, R.I., last Friday. On Sunday, other ALF
members broke into a university laboratory in Washington state and
stole rabbits and white mice.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, eight of the 12 targeted Harvard researchers
had received the razor-blade letters, which were sent by a small
British-based group called the ``Justice Department.'' Only one
researcher had opened the letter, and the university handed the
letters over to the FBI, said Harvard Medical School spokesman Don
Gibbons. The FBI has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The intended targets were listed in a communique posted on an
animal-rights Web site by the ``Justice Department'' group, which
says it sent the letters to more than 80 scientists at schools
including Tulane University, and state universities in California,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is impossible to count exactly how many attacks and
incidents of harassment have taken place recently in Massachusetts
or nationwide, both sides agree that such raids have been more
frequent. The reasons behind the increase are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   David Barbarash, a spokesman in Vancouver for the ALF, said the
increased activity may be due to media coverage, which influences
other advocates to act, or to the return to campuses of students,
the backbone of many such groups. He noted that the ALF's
``economic sabotage'' has so far not led to the injury of a human
or animal.
</P>
<P>
   Barbarash said he has no direct contact with ALF members, but
publicizes the group's actions after receiving mail and video
footage of raids.
</P>
<P>
   Established animal-rights groups Wednesday condemned the
harassment and terrorism. They said the animal-rights movement is
being buoyed as more researchers themselves take up the cause after
discovering other ways to test, for example, new surgical
techniques or the toxicity of new chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marginal people who may be engaging in extremist
activities are not the majority of the animal-rights movement,''
said Dr. Theo Capaldo, president of the New England
Anti-Vivisection Society. ``But they grab the attention.''

EEOC TO EXTEND ANTI-BIAS RIGHTS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced this week
that it would for the first time extend broad anti-discrimination
rights to workers who are illegal immigrants, a policy that some
lawyers said might be hard to enforce because immigrants might fear
deportation if they assert these rights.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC said Tuesday that illegal immigrants who are dismissed
or discriminated against because of their race, sex, age or
religion should enjoy the same remedies as legal workers _ back
pay, punitive damages and even reinstatement, but reinstatement
coming only if they have first obtained legal work papers.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy faces several enforcement problems, among them
that illegal aliens might be too scared to file discrimination
complaints with the EEOC and are likely to have difficulty
obtaining official work documents.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC said it issued the new policy because it wanted to
ensure that employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens were not
free to discriminate against them without facing any penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the Clinton administration's immigration policies
attacked the decision, insisting that extending remedies like
reinstatement and back pay to illegal immigrants would only
encourage more such immigrants to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole policy is creating an atmosphere hostile to
removing illegal immgrants from the labor force,'' said Daniel
Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group pushing for stricter
limits on immigration. ``The EEOC is putting itself in the position
of a mother superior seeking to gather and protect the undocumented
flock.''
</P>
<P>
   EEOC Chairwoman Ida Castro asserted that without the policy
announced Tuesday, unscrupulous employers would feel encouraged to
hire illegal aliens with an eye to exploiting them. She said the
policy would discourage such discrimination and exploitation by
guaranteeing illegal aliens the same anti-discrimination
protections as U.S. citizens and resident aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro said, ``If you let employers just breach civil rights
requirements for a group of workers such as undocumented workers,
then you're indirectly supporting the hiring of this group and the
violation of our laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics suggested that the Clinton administration pushed
the EEOC to embrace this new policy as a way to win support for
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign among three
important Democratic constituencies: labor unions, minorities and
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, which endorsed Gore two weeks ago, has pushed hard
for the EEOC to adopt this policy, arguing that failure to enforce
discrimination laws for illegal aliens encouraged employers to hire
them and undercut workplace conditions for all workers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and EEOC officials said politics had nothing to
do with the new EEOC policy.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO general counsel John Hiatt said the labor federation has
long pushed for this policy partly because of concerns that failing
to crack down on discrimination against illegal workers can create
an atmosphere that allows discrimination of documented workers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very welcome set of guidelines,'' Hiatt said. ``The
exploitation of undocumented workers lowers wages, benefits and
conditions for documented workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new policy continues a trend in which the federal government
has extended more and more protections to illegal immigrants. They
are covered by minimum-wage and occupational-safety laws. And The
National Labor Relations Board has ruled that employers who
knowingly hire illegal aliens are prohibited from dismissing them
if they support unionization.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted in part by contingency fees and attorneys fees, some
lawyers have moved aggressively to file suits charging that
employers have violated minimum wage laws for undocumented workers.
Some business organizations voiced fears that lawyers might seek to
do the same in filing discrimination claims on behalf of illegal
aliens.
</P>
<P>
   One fear that some business executives expressed is that if they
hire illegal aliens without knowing of their undocumented status
and later dismiss those workers upon learning of that status, the
angered workers might file discrimination suits, charging that they
were fired because of their race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said they adopted the new policy after
encountering what they said were horrific examples of
discrimination against illegal immigrants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These officials described one illegal immigrant who was
dismissed after refusing to provide sexual favors to her boss. EEOC
officials also described a group of Vietnamese workers who were
illegally segregated from other workers on a fishing vessel. These
officials also described instances in which managers retaliated
against illegal aliens by dismissing them after they sought to
report racial discrimination or sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unauthorized workers are especially vulnerable to abuse and
exploitation,'' Ms. Castro said. ``It is imperative for employers
to fully understand that discrimination against this class of
employees will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid a clash with the nation's immigration laws, the
EEOC said it would push for reinstatement for illegal aliens who
had been discriminated against only when those aliens have first
obtained papers authorizing them to work in the United States. But
the EEOC said it would recommend back pay whether or not the
immigrants had working papers.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said the new policy would help not just illegal
aliens, but also their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers were not held responsible for discriminating
against unauthorized workers, it would create an incentive for
unscrupulous employers to employ and exploit these workers,'' the
commission said. ``It would also harm authorized workers who might
be denied these jobs or be subjected to a workplace which tolerated
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration has been a controversial issue in recent
decades, as many Americans insist that illegal aliens are an
unwanted public charge, while others say they are hard workers who
contribute to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration
Forum, a Washington-based group that promotes immigrants' rights,
praised the EEOC, saying, ``This new policy says that if you're
working, we're not gong to be complicit in giving employers an open
door to using your illegal status to hit workers over the head with
discriminations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharry acknowledged that many illegal aliens might be too
timid to file discrimination charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sharry said the new policy was bound to stir controversy because
it pits two fundamental concerns against each other: the desire to
limit illegal immigrations and the desire to combat discrimination
on the basis of race, sex, age or religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mismatch between the debate and the reality,'' he
said. ``Lots of workers who some people say are criminals because
they entered illegally are actually hard-working, tax-paying
immigrants who are working hard to make a better lives for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in one of the strongest backlashes against illegal
immigration, Californians passed a proposition that barred state
money for education, health care or other services for illegal
aliens. A U.S. District Court in Los Angeles has partially enjoined
enforcement of the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   John Findley, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, one of
the initiative's main sponsors, criticized the EEOC's new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it should be a nonstarter because an illegal alien by
definition is in the country unlawfully,'' he said. `That
individual has no right to the job in question. To force an
employer to rehire an individual with back pay and subject the
employers to sanctions seems to me ridiculous.''

 &HT;    Gingrich signs deal with Fox as analyst
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How utterly right it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker who led the Republican
Revolution of 1994, signed Wednesday to be a political commentator
with Fox News Channel, the cable outlet that is trying to start a
revolution to topple cable news king CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News Channel is battling CNN on every front: for ratings, in
its behind-the-scenes business plans, and, some think,
ideologically. Although executives at Fox and CNN downplay it,
there is a widespread perception among conservative viewers that
CNN has a liberal bias, and among liberal viewers that Fox has a
conservative tilt.
</P>
<P>
   Fox plays to this with its slogan ``We Report. You Decide.''
This is conservative code, as surely as ``law and order'' in the
late '60s implied ``won't go too fast on civil rights.'' Fox's
slogan is aimed at the other television networks, including CNN,
implying they're too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Into this battlefield where viewer feelings are heated _ but
hard data is virtually nonexistent _ comes Gingrich, who's
certainly been known to generate, and take, plenty of heat. But
Gingrich joining forces with Fox was not purely a political
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't looking in regard to ideology,'' Gingrich's New
York-based agent, Sandy Montag, said Wednesday. ``We talked to a
number of people, including some talks with CNN. Newt knows (CNN
NewsGroup Chairman) Tom Johnson well and he knows (Fox President)
Roger Ailes well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt just felt this was the right fit,'' Montag said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is the latest crossover between government and TV news,
joining a field that has been growing for years. The most spins in
the revolving door go to Pat Buchanan, for his forays between CNN's
``Crossfire'' and GOP presidential primaries, but Buchanan is
joined by Jesse Jackson (who has his own CNN show), George
Stephanopolous (former Clinton aide now with ABC News), former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro (hired Tuesday by Fox
News), and many others.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich is the highest profile crossover ever, and the
political perceptions give his move to Fox an extra edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Fox has people at the top who have Republican
backgrounds and CNN has people at the top with Democratic
backgrounds,'' said S. Robert Lichter, executive director of the
nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``But my sense is
that both Fox and CNN are mainstream news organizations, as opposed
to opinion-oriented news.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN's talks with Gingrich about possibly joining forces indicate
that the issue is more about ratings than ideology. Although CNN is
still the leader in cable news by any measure _ viewers, personnel,
prestige, international awareness _ Fox News has been gaining
ground steadily on CNN in its three years in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich will not have his own show on Fox, but will be an
on-air analyst, said Chet Collier, senior vice president of Fox
News. He may be deployed similarly to CNN's Jeff Greenfield,
analyzing politics, although Collier said Gingrich may discuss
international affairs. Most of the logistics of Gingrich's air time
on Fox are still being worked out, Collier said, but he expects
Gingrich to appear ``within a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier said the linking of Gingrich's politics and Fox News'
perceived politics is ``kind of an easy thing to jump on,''
pointing out Fox's hiring of Ferraro. ``We're giving voice to
different points of view,'' said Collier.

   TV-SOPRANOS (subslug) (Undated) _ ``The Sopranos,'' shown
earlier this year as what was, in effect, a mini-series, was
produced in the hope that it would become a continuing HBO series
if successful, which it was. Thirteen new episodes have already
been filmed, to be broadcast starting in January, after a possible
rerun of the original show the last week in December. ``Berlin
Alexanderplatz,'' ``The Singing Detective'' and ``The Sopranos''
are something more than miniseries. Packed with characters and
events of Dickensian dimension and color, their time and place
observed with satiric exactitude, each has the kind of cohesive
dramatic arc that defines a work complete unto itself. No matter
what they are labeled or what they become, they are not open-ended
series, or even mini-series. They are megamovies. By Vincent Canby.

   MANSFIELD-PARK-FILM (Undated) _ Fanny Price, the heroine of
``Mansfield Park,'' should have been one of Jane Austen's most
memorable creations. But despite her considerable virtues, Fanny
just can't get any respect. Most readers find her irritatingly
prissy and passive. Even Austen's own mother pronounced Fanny
``insipid'' when ``Mansfield Park'' was first published, in 1814.
More than 100 years later, the British writer Kingsley Amis called
her ``a monster of complacency and pride.'' No wonder it's taken so
long to produce a feature-film adaptation of Austen's most complex
and controversial novel. Patricia Rozema, the writer and director,
took on the challenge two years ago. Her new Fanny, will
undoubtedly shock Austen purists when the film opens, on Nov. 17.

   HARRELSON-THEATER (New York) _ Woody Harrelson, 38, is in many
ways the boyish, free-wheeling bartender _ the role that made him
famous on the successful sitcom ``Cheers.'' In a recent interview
he admitted to a long-running problem with punctuality (``I was
born two months early and have never been early since'') and
clearly has a strong carpe diem streak. Even more resonant,
Starbuck, Harrelson's character in ``The Rainmaker,'' is a rootless
wanderer, a dreamer who charms people into believing he can bring
rain, then cuts out with their cash. So it is tempting to see all
sorts of links between the actor and his latest acting job. ``The

Brooks Atkinson Theater on Nov. 11. By Robin Pogrebin. (Moved).

wrote that the artistic director of the Pina Bausch Tanztheater
Wuppertal ``has become gentle,'' displaying a ``new and almost
old-fashioned tenderness.'' Kissing couples abound, as do scenic
projections of erotically bursting petals and shivering stamens.
The Pina Bausch Tanztheater Wuppertal returns to the Brooklyn
Academy for its seventh appearance this week (Tuesday and Thursday
through next Sunday), after a monthlong tour in California, Arizona

Thursday at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City. Those performances
will be the orchestra's first of the work. But they are by no means
the first for its principal guest conductor, Sir Colin Davis, who

   CARMINA-BURANA-MUSIC (Undated) _ Even amid the dizzying
heterogeneity of 20th-century musical styles, ``Carmina Burana,''
by the German composer Carl Orff, remains one of a kind. Written in
1936, this ``profane cantata'' sets medieval Latin texts depicting
the pleasures of drink, gambling and diverse country matters.
Christian Thielemann's new version with the Chorus and Orchestra of
the Deutsche Oper Berlin (Deutsche Grammophon 453 587-2; CD) finds
an admirable balance between refinement and expressive intensity,
avoiding the standard-issue garrulity too common in performances of
this work. By Lawrence A. Johnson. (Moved).

<P>
   GILLESPIE-ART (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Gregory Gillespie's
``Self-Portrait in a Black Shirt'' (1968-69) is one of those
remarkable paintings that, if known only in reproduction, creates a
startling effect when seen in person. For one thing it is
surprisingly small, less than one foot square. For another, even at
this scale it packs a wallop. When Gillespie made this painting,
included in his traveling retrospective of 39 works on view through
Jan. 2 at the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, it offered a challenge to both prevailing
abstract movements and to Pop irony. By Miles Unger. (Moved).

   DEVRIES-SCULPTOR (Los Angeles) _ ``Adriaen de Vries, Imperial
Sculptor,'' is now being shown at the J. Paul Getty Museum through
Jan. 9. Although he was said to have done for bronze what
Michelangelo did for marble, de Vries was not even mentioned by
name when a traveler described one of his masterpieces, only 60
years after his death, in terms usually reserved for the ancient
Greeks. Such cavalier treatment of Tintoretto, Annibale Carracci or
Guido Reni, his contemporaries, is inconceivable. And yet de Vries
(1556-1626) was clearly their equal as a master, first of the
twisting, straining style of the Mannerists and then of the
grandeur, the ornament and the emotional drama that we associate
with the Baroque. By Theodore K. Rabb. (Moved).

   TV-WOMEN-SUFFRAGETTES (Undated) _ Ken Burns usually prides
himself on the wide scope of his historical knowledge. But it
wasn't long ago that the director of ``The Civil War'' made a
humbling discovery: He knew next to nothing about Elizabeth Cady
Stanton and only slightly more about Susan B. Anthony, the two
19th-century women who campaigned longest and hardest for a
constitutional amendment that would give women the right to vote.
He now regards them as, hands down, ``the two most important women
in American history.'' After three years of working on his new

 &HT;    Clinton to push hate crime legislation during Atlanta visit
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton will use a speech Friday in Atlanta
to advocate tougher laws against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth visit to Atlanta this year, the president will
address the Anti-Defamation League's annual meeting. His remarks
will center on hate crimes, a central theme of the meeting, a White
House spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of 10 states that do not enhance penalties for
hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   American Jewish leaders are concerned about recent cases of
anti-Semitic violence, including a shooting at a Jewish community
center in Los Angeles. In addition, three California synagogues
have been attacked by two brothers linked to white supremacist
groups, and two people were killed and nine wounded in Illinois and
Indiana by a man linked to an anti-Semitic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics of Clinton's remarks on the subject were not available
Wednesday. The White House said the president also would address
foreign policy issues that concern the American Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   The speech will follow Clinton's appearance at a fund-raising
dinner for the Democratic National Committee at a residence in
Buckhead. Almost 100 people are expected to attend the
$5,000-a-couple event at the West Paces Ferry Road home of
Democratic donor Larry Cooper, said John Kirincich, executive
director of the Democratic Party of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner will raise about $350,000. It is part of a ``DNC
fund-raising sweep'' the president is making in several states,
Kirincich said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope to minimize the effect that Clinton's visit will
have on metro Atlanta traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One is scheduled to touch down about 3 p.m. at Dobbins
Air Reserve Base in Marietta. He will briefly greet base workers.
Then his motorcade will travel south on Interstate 75 to take the
president to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead. The Secret Service
declined to release the motorcade's exact route. But Special Agent
Jim Cool said no other expressways would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be driven to the fund-raising dinner at 7 p.m.
About 8:40, he'll return to the Grand Hyatt for the speech to the
Anti-Defamation League. His motorcade is scheduled to depart about
10 p.m. for Dobbins, where he will board Air Force One to fly to
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Officials will try to create the ``the least congestion, the
least discomfort to the public,'' Cool said. ``Hopefully, we can do
our security thing and not inconvenience the public too much.''

REPUBLICANS PLAN TO GO AT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Thursday night brings Act II of the Dartmouth
``debates,'' though the television audience will likely thin and
expectations diminish as five Republican presidential hopefuls but
not the GOP front-runner take the stage.
</P>
<P>
   They will participate in same sort of discussion, taking
questions from voters at a town hall-style gathering, that
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley engaged in Wednesday night. But
the focus of the forum may be as much on who is absent _ George W.
Bush _ than on five who plan to attend: Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes,
Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes, and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Of these McCain seems to have the most to gain or lose from his
performance. Keyes, Hatch and Bauer capture less than 10 percent _
combined _ in some polls. Forbes is more formidable, but has also
struggled for a foothold in the race. But McCain's poll numbers and
public profile have been decidely on the upswing, and he is eager
to emerge as the clear and plausible alternative to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for McCain to really shine,'' said Dean
Spiliotes, a government professor at Dartmouth. ``I think people
are looking at this to see what McCain has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McCain tried to make the most of the brightening
spotlight by challenging his opponents to support his idea to kill
federal subsidies for the ethanol, sugar, gas and oil industries in
order to fund a nationwide test of a school voucher program. And
Friday his campaign will begin broadcasting a 60-second
advertisement on New Hampshire television that focuses on the major
moments in his personal story, from his long captivity as a Vietnam
POW to his service in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will continue to tell the John McCain story, which connects
the dots and shows why he's so believable when he says he'll take
on the special interests and shake up Washington,'' said John
Weaver, McCain's national political director.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's event also offers McCain and the other four
Republicans a chance to rough up Bush, the Texas governor and clear
leader in the GOP race thus far. This is the second New Hampshire
forum Bush has skipped in a week, and his competitors want the
world to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Governor Bush is diminished as a candidate by not
being willing to appear before the voters and make his views known
to them,'' said Richard Lessner, the senior adviser to Bauer.
``He'll suffer as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush declined to attend a forum at the University of
New Hampshire even though he had spent the day campaigning in New
Hampshire. Instead, he attended a fund-raiser for himself and a
second one for the Vermont Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Bush is attending a ceremony at Southern
Methodist University where his wife, Laura, is being honored. Bush
said last week that his wife is more important to him than a
debate, and if the voters take it out on him then ``so be it.''
(Bush, perhaps to soften the impact of his absence, has made
himself available for a local television TV interview Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In New Hampshire, voters are savvy enough to recognize an
excuse when they hear one,'' said John J. Pitney, a political
science professor at Claremont McKenna College who specializes in
Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain has recently emerged as a threat to Bush here, the
Forbes campaign is still fighting for similar stature.

PRESCRIPTIONS FOR A TROUBLED PATIENT: THE THEATER  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 31)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month, nine American playwrights gathered in
Provincetown, Mass., to discuss the future of American theater. The
meeting, organized by the Provincetown Repertory Theater, was
recorded before an audience in the town hall. The moderator, Steven
Drukman, who is writing a history of American avant-garde theater,
began by asking whether there are two separate theater cultures in
the United States: nonprofit and commercial Broadway. Here are
edited excerpts from the session.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN GUARE. Broadway has always been the marketplace. It was
where ``Death of a Salesman'' was done, where O'Neill worked, where
``The Glass Menagerie'' and ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' came. And
then suddenly there was an Off Broadway, which became a much more
viable place for serious plays.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway is the place where tourists come. When I was a kid at
Yale Drama School back in the '60s, you dreamed about having a play
on Broadway. I don't think anybody dreams that today. You dream of
having a play at the Seattle Rep, or Louisville, or the Goodman or
Trinity Rep. That's where the theater is, and that's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The only dangerous thing about it is that so much of the
for-profit theater is learning to use the not-for-profit theater as
a way of developing for-profit pieces. Another major problem is
that so many producers are becoming fearful. The question is not
where are the new playwrights? Or where are the new actors? It's
where are the new producers who know how to produce a play,
understand the writer's intention and protect that?
</P>
<P>
   TERRENCE McNALLY. I do dream of having a play on Broadway, John.
It doesn't mean my dream is going to come true. But it's a valid
dream. Broadway theaters are still the best real estate in
Manhattan in which to have our plays performed. It's easy to bash
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think we have two theaters. What has happened is that
the plays that used to be done on Broadway, by writers of my
generation, we've taken over Off Broadway. There was room for us
when I began writing. Now, the younger generation finds it very
hard to get established even Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The Off Broadway movement was a significant change in our
theater. But something has to be done about the economics of all
theater, where they are less and less willing to take chances on
the Terrence McNallys.
</P>
<P>
   LANFORD WILSON. I have a play that could possibly come to
Broadway from the Hartford Stage and it terrifies me that theater
people seem to know more about West Ireland than they know about
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   PAULA VOGEL. When we talk about the future of the American
theater we have to talk about the future of our economic structure.
There is none supporting the theater. And that is becoming an
increasing concern. Not only is it exorbitant to produce in New
York, it's exorbitant everywhere. And the funding is tied up with
the attitude of government officials, who can do a kind of benign
censorship. So I think the whole economic infrastructure is at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   JON ROBIN BAITZ. I was having breakfast recently with someone
who's a rock star and he's a friend. And he was sort of stoned. He
looked at me real queer and said, ``Why would a young person become
a playwright?'' He just didn't understand it. It had no context.
</P>
<P>
   People are making little movies now for very little money. When
you can make a smart, sexy movie for under $100,000 on digital
video, it becomes what the theater might have been. It is evidence
that the culture might have moved past the theater for now, to some
extent. And maybe it will come back to the theater.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER DURANG. As long as I've been around the theater,
which is 25 years, everyone is always saying the theater is dying,
blah-blah-blah. And yes it is. On the other hand, will it really
end? If somebody wants to make a movie, maybe they're not meant to
be a playwright.
</P>
<P>
   BAITZ. I'm not saying it's over. I'm saying that this priesthood
of being a playwright is sort of straining to survive.
</P>
<P>
   DRUKMAN. But are you making a smart, sexy little comedy for
under $100,000?
</P>
<P>
   BAITZ. I can't write about sex. I would if I could. There's just
a white noise in here.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY KESSELMAN. But Robbie, if you have to write about
something, you have to write about it. For many people, the theater
is the only way to really write that. It can be put into a film but
it's never quite the same. And I agree with Terrence about the
dream _ now, having been on Broadway (as the adapter of ``The Diary
of Anne Frank,'' revived in 1997), I can't wait to go back.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. Having had six plays on Broadway, I would hate to
see playwrights abandon it. I think it's vital, primarily because
the American people see it as the mecca and because the straight
play, or the honest, serious playwright, should be represented
there.
</P>
<P>
   However, when you talk about the future of the American theater,
the question that comes to my mind is what is American about the
American theater? We have, in American theater, an art form that is
based on European dramatic values, an age-old dramaturgy that is
handed down from the Greeks. That is the art form that I work in
and one that I embrace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   America is a society that is multiracial and multicultural. Yet
the values of the American theater are based on European-American
values. Values of other cultures are not seen as valid.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the theaters that seek to preserve and promote
the values of African-Americans do not have relationships to the
funding sources because they do not meet the sociological criteria
of being European-American. If we're going to have something that
is called an American theater, then we have to allow room for the
esthetic values of Hispanics, for Asians, African-Americans, for
all the racial and cultural groups that make up this society, as
well as for the age-old tried-and-true values of the
European-American.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is a tool by which one makes a speech, if you will.
And you can look at it in terms of the First Amendment right to
free speech and the constitutional guarantee of that. But the lack
of access to funding that will allow you to make that speech can be
considered a prior restraint.
</P>
<P>
   DRUKMAN. That point is indisputable. But I think what Robbie was
getting at is that this new, disaffected youthful artist will get
together a group of people, a camera and a sound person. There
isn't a comparably active, new avant-garde theater culture that is
getting into the theater, which is reflected in Robbie's friend's
comment, ``Why would you ever be a playwright?'' I'm not sure
that's only a question of access.
</P>
<P>
   VOGEL. Playwriting isn't a calling as much as it is a hazing
process, in which one is actively discouraged by lack of funding,
by poverty, by lack of access. Off Broadway is an impossible goal
for playwrights who do not fit the mold of, yes, European
dramaturgy.
</P>
<P>
   DRUKMAN. How experimental are we allowing ourselves to be? And
are plays getting edgier, or are they becoming more homogenized?
</P>
<P>
   A.R. GURNEY. All really good theater has an element of anarchy
underneath it, of chaos, of real darkness. I think that's why we go
to the theater, to see people put on masks and try to put shape on
that darkness. And that can be frightening not only to the standard
bourgeois audiences that go to plays, but to the people who fund
plays. And that's a serious thing. When a play becomes too
dangerous, too tricky, then the odds are it might not be produced.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. We are all contemporary playwrights and the plays
we write are much different from plays that were written in, say,
1930 and 1949. That is because we have built on the tradition of
American theater, which was at one time experimental. So the
experiment proves the value of the tradition: the playwright sits
down and uses or discards at will that which he is given by his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at American society in the last 30 years, we have
made tremendous changes from the time when I was a young man until
now, when I am in my middle age. I don't think there is a theater
that has kept up with that change.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that playwrights wrestle with, to my mind, is
the influence of television. We cannot go backward. Television is
here. I think that playwrights are in the process of trying to
figure out how to absorb that influence and to make dramatic art
out of an influence that wasn't there in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE. I was teaching at a university a few years ago and there
were two people in the class who were remarkably talented, where
you just say, ``Ah, there is a future for the theater.'' They had
gone so far into debt to take this writing program that when their
two years were up, both of them went out to California just to get
work in episodic television to pay off the enormous debt they had
incurred. And they are lost because they are both now very
successful.
</P>
<P>
   They have learned to work in a corporate voice and feel that the
theater is elite because it's the voice of one playwright. They
like the comfort of working on a half-hour comedy that goes into 50
million homes. Those two people will never come back to the
theater. Now the amount of money that it costs just to go to Yale
or NYU makes your future impossible, because you incur an
extraordinary debt that then paralyzes your life paying that off.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. There is something disturbing about what you're
saying.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE. Which is?
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. I never took a course, for instance, or went to
school. I think there is something called an artist and either you
want to be an artist or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   GUARE. But what I'm saying is I don't think we live in a society
that gives people the confidence to be an artist. I think that
you're very, very, very rare.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. It's something that you have to claim though. And
you pay your dues or you do whatever is necessary. I'm sure that
Picasso could have made more money in graphic art, but he was an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   VOGEL. It's still a matter of access. I don't think that film is
necessarily the enemy. A while ago I had probably the most
extraordinary teaching opportunity I'll ever get. I did a
playwriting workshop for women in maximum security at an adult
correctional institution. Those women did much better than my
graduate playwrights. They had to. They wanted to. But they had
never seen a play. They had never gone to the theater. We could
only approach what theater was by talking about television and
film, which was storytelling they know. So a lot of this to me is
access.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Theater is unmediated between a living and breathing audience
and a living and breathing actor on the stage. There are no lenses
in between us. There is no director's cut. It's really about a
community dialogue and that is why I think that access is made
difficult in this society. Those women in maximum security don't
become playwrights because they would tell us a thing or two about
realism.
</P>
<P>
   GURNEY. I think it has again to do with funding, but a different
kind of funding, namely funding for our schools. Just the way the
symphony orchestra is having a great deal of trouble now, because
the high schools are not able to fund school orchestras and kids
don't get a chance to pick up an instrument and learn what it is to
be a part of an orchestra. It's the same thing with school drama
programs. Somehow the schools have got to introduce the arts.
</P>
<P>
   DRUKMAN. Are there ultimate taboos in American playwriting? Are
there things you feel you shouldn't or mustn't _ _
</P>
<P>
   DURANG. No elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. I can't think of a taboo I would impose upon
myself. If I did, I'd write a play about it.
</P>
<P>
   BAITZ. I think race is still a taboo. Even though people do
write about it, it's very, very difficult, because there is so much
rage and guilt. It's the great subject in this country, this race
rage on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   KESSELMAN. There is another interesting taboo I've come up
against and that's children. If you portray children as having
deep, serious emotions, you are absolutely lambasted.
</P>
<P>
   LANFORD WILSON. Children know that they are lying and performing
for their parents. But we can't write that.
</P>
<P>
   KESSELMAN. The play I'm talking about involved a brother
tormenting his little sister. When we had discussions with children
in the audience _ ``Have you ever done such a thing?'' _ they were
just thrilled to tell how they put their sisters in trunks and
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. I want to get back to something that Jon Robin
Baitz said. I agree with you. I think race is a great subject and
an important subject because it deals so much with the history of
this country and the aftermath of that history, which we are all a
living part of. Obviously I don't find it a taboo.
</P>
<P>
   BAITZ. For me, I guess, the question is, Am I qualified to know
what's in my heart? Am I qualified to speak for myself, even?
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST WILSON. When you say race, you are not just talking about
African-Americans. You are a member of a race also.
</P>
<P>
   VOGEL. When we talk about writing about race, I keep going back
to when Anna Deavere Smith told me that strangers are much more
likely to talk to each other about sex than race. It's absolutely
true. In another conversation she said white writers have to do the
race work. It can't just be writers of color, in terms of reading
and thinking it through. And that is when I started thinking about
this. It's not a matter of research. It's a matter of thinking it
through carefully so that you can stand on the ground from where
you write in terms of race. I think that white writers _ whether
it's guilt or not wanting to go through that journey _ we're in the
state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   BAITZ. To me, I feel that black people and white people in this
country are still terrified of one another on a basic, almost a _
to steal a David Hare phrase _ mineral level. I want to write about
that. I think we understand one another even less as the century
ends. And the divide becomes even bigger. So, as a taboo, the
longer you're silent, the harder it is to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   LANFORD WILSON. Well, art is born out of, among other things,
necessity. Writing a play for me is like walking down this
landscape of the self. Many things that you confront sometimes are
not the best parts of yourself. But you have to be willing to deal
with them so that you emerge at the end with a brighter and
stronger spirit, ready to go through the next journey.

RUSSIANS UNLEASH DEADLY BARRAGE ON CHECHEN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With thousands of civilians trapped in Chechnya's
capital Grozny, Russian warplanes and artillery Wednesday unleashed
the heaviest bombardment on the city since federal troops entered
the separatist republic last month, Chechen and Russian sources
said. The toll from the barrage was put at 100 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops closed in on Grozny from three sides amid heavy
fighting, and President Boris N. Yeltsin vowed to rid Chechnya of
``terrorism'' and ``return peace and calm'' to the rebellious
Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   There was little of either in Grozny on Wednesday. Officials of
Chechnya's separatist government said 100 civilians were killed and
more than 200 were wounded in Wednesday's attacks. It was
impossible to confirm the totals. Russian commanders said 100 rebel
fighters were killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces bombarded the capital three days after Russian
paramilitary police blocked traffic on the main routes out of
Chechnya, halting a flow of refugees that had reached 190,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off from escape, panicked Grozny residents hid from the
bombs in cellars, according to news-agency reports from Chechnya.
Western leaders and international aid agencies expressed alarm at
the escalation of Moscow's offensive, but Russian leaders firmly
fended off criticism of what they called an internal affair.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says it is fighting Islamic militants who invaded a
neighboring region last summer and whom Moscow blames for a series
of deadly bombing attacks in September. The Chechens deny
involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do away with terrorism, to get rid once and for all
of the center of terrorism, international terrorism in Chechnya,''
Yeltsin told an award ceremony in Moscow before departing for a
vacation in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68 and ailing, has stayed out of public view since the
fighting began, leaving the job of leading the Chechen conflict to
his prime minister, Vladimir Putin. Putin has repeatedly said that
Russia would avoid a full-scale military assault on Grozny, where
hundreds of Russian troops and thousands of civilians died in
Moscow's disastrous 1994-1996 war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russian troops pressed Wednesday toward the capital from
the north, east and west, a new assault on the war-devastated
capital appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Arkady Baskayev, commander of the Moscow district of Russian
forces, said troops should move in and take the capital despite
fears of repeating the mistakes of the earlier Chechen campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary to take Grozny, and not just Grozny,''
Baskayev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wednesday's strikes appeared to be aimed at the homes of
rebel leaders in Grozny. Russian rockets hit what military
officials described as the headquarters of Shamil Basayev, whose
forces have twice invaded neighboring Dagestan. They also hit the
homes of the Arab-born commander who goes by the name Khattab, and
Chechnya's informal spokesman, Movladi Udugov.
</P>
<P>
   As Grozny shook under the air assault, Chechnya's separatist
president, Aslan Maskhadov, said the death toll from a rocket
attack on a crowded outdoor market in the city last week had risen
to 282, twice that of earlier reports. Russian leaders have denied
firing rockets at the market and have blamed the deaths on a
shootout among rival Chechen factions.
</P>
<P>
   Ilyas Akhmadov, foreign minister in the government of the
self-proclaimed independent region, called on the West to halt aid
payments and loans to Russia, saying the money was being used to
help finance its military offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bullet and every shell being used by the Russians is
being backed up by money from the West,'' Reuters quoted Akhmadov
as telling a news conference in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee agency called on Russia to reopen
Chechnya's border with the Russian republic of Ingushetia to
Chechens fleeing the fighting.

 &HT;    CARE readies workers with mock disasters
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 8:20 a.m., heavy gunfire and explosives erupted at
the National Assembly. Jet fighters were flying overhead. Then came
loud explosions near the president's residence.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embassy warned us: The situation was extremely
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   And that _ as about 50 relief workers and I were soon to
discover _ was an extreme understatement.
</P>
<P>
   We did not know yet. But before this day would end, we would
have to cope with a coup and counter-coup; ethnic strife; refugee
crises in our own country and a neighboring one; a flood caused by
a dam break; the threat of cholera; abductions, rapes and other
human rights abuses; and _ when it seemed nothing else could go
wrong _ an outbreak of a rare disease attacking small sausagelike
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For most anyone, this could go down as the ultimate day in hell.
</P>
<P>
   For the staff of CARE USA, the Atlanta-based relief and
development agency, it was all in a day's work _ a day of training
to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is pioneering this kind of education for its staff,
according to Paul Giannone, deputy director of the CARE USA
Emergency Group. The aim, he explained, is to ensure that a core
group of employees has basic knowledge of how to cope with the
complex issues that aid workers in the field face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is CARE saying we're really serious about this
business,'' said Giannone, who has been involved in relief work
since he began helping refugees during the Vietnam war. ``We're
trying to make sure our employees are as top notch as they can be.
We put a lot of time into it.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE has run similar disaster-training sessions in England,
Cambodia and Kenya. The current session began a week ago and ends
today at Callaway Gardens, southwest of Atlanta. Similar training
is already scheduled in South Africa next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the Callaway Gardens workshops, 19 of the 53 participants
came from CARE offices in Central and South America. Others, such
as Sherine Jayawickrama and Megan Meyer, came from Atlanta
headquarters. Karen Moore and Gaelle Nizery represented
Brussels-based CARE International. And still other trainees such as
Howard Standen of Britain and Eirik-Jarl Trondsen of Norway work
for other major CARE country offices.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the training focuses on specific aspects of emergency
work: how to assess damages and needs or what to do about health
care or water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   But the mock emergency experience is central to the training.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency scenarios are developed by Rob Stephenson, who has
a doctorate in emergency management from Kings College of London
University. An Englishman with a devilish sense of humor,
Stephenson confided that he sometimes wishes he could write a
science-fiction novel.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has wide experience in relief work in such far-flung
locales as Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Thailand. Now 49, he is
also working with CARE on an analysis of its flood control projects
in India and will head to Nepal for a meeting on those projects
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson was ``brought up in a world where people were nice''
to relief workers. But he said conditions have changed dramatically
in his two decades-plus in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the altered landscape, he said, ``The thing that
still stands out to me is the sheer expectation of violence _ what
will happen to you. ... Some of the people we are dealing with are
some of the most unpleasant people on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In structuring the training, Stephenson said he wants the
sessions to be realistic enough to create stress even for
experienced staff. In the evaluations that have followed every mock
training so far, including the one at Callaway, the staff members
agree that he has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario for last weekend's drill was set in Nigeria and
neighboring Benin, not because CARE expects such tragedies to
unfold there, but because the participants had little experience in
the area and were expected to have fewer preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew a disaster of some unspecified kind would occur
Sunday. But on Saturday the participants, meeting in a Callaway
Gardens conference center, were divided into four groups and told
to organize themselves to carry out typical CARE development
programs in nonemergency situations.
</P>
<P>
   One group set up a Benin office in what was normally a pizza and
sub shop. I joined a group establishing a country headquarters in
Abuja, Nigeria's capital. Two other groups set up satellite offices
elsewhere in ``Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Real-life Nigeria is twice the size of California. These
satellite offices were just down the hall. But we still had to
figure out how to communicate with the other offices and coordinate
activities, while learning everything we could about the country _
from its culture to its transportation systems. That took a while.
But after a relatively intense 12 hours, everyone had assigned
roles from budgeting to logistics and finding donors to finance
projects. Detailed maps were on the walls. Stock rooms held office
supplies. And a filing system was in place.
</P>
<P>
   Mock programs in forestry, water quality and health care were
also set up, and we were even considering a pest management program
near Kano in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Martinez, who normally works for CARE in Guatemala, had
been named country director for Nigeria, and Mike Godfrey, just
back at the Atlanta headquarters after a stint in Kosovo, headed
the Benin operation.
</P>
<P>
   CARE staffers also had been assigned to represent the Atlanta
headquarters, the Brussels offices of CARE International and home
offices of other CARE countries. Still others represented other
humanitarian agencies, the United Nations and its food-aid branch,
the World Food Program. Two CARE public information officers were
designated to represent the media. And Bob MacPherson, the former
Marine colonel who is CARE's top security analyst, would play dual
roles _ as U.S. Army Col. Hamilton and Nigerian Gen. Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set.
</P>
<P>
   After winding up its work around 8:30 p.m. Saturday, the Abuja
group agreed to meet again at 7 a.m. Sunday to go over the maps
again and make sure all systems were ready.
</P>
<P>
   Once the simulated sounds of firing started, however, there
seemed no way to have prepared fully.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly little time to ponder decisions. For
purposes of the training, Sunday was not a mere day. It was 21 days
of varying lengths _ each lasting from 10 to 45 minutes and
covering a span from Sept. 5, 2000, to Sept. 25. Sandwiches were to
be brought in, but there would be no break for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Each office received a scenario at the start of each day
describing conditions in that area _ conditions all of us hoped
could not grow worse but that constantly did.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the airport in Abuja and other cities closed. The
trains stopped running. And the roads that weren't clogged with
refugees _ whose pictures we saw _ were blocked by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30 a.m., Sept. 11, 2000, was turning into Sept. 12. The
United Nations was warning us about ``an increasingly desperate
situation.'' The authorities would allow us to travel only after
obtaining security clearances from the military faction in control
of Abuja. Ethnic conflict was increasing _ 950 people had already
been killed in a single incident. Our Lagos office had been
evacuated. And CARE headquarters in Atlanta wanted us to make one
of our senior staff available for an extensive interview with a BBC
World Service reporter on how humanitarian agencies coordinate
their services.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at a surprisingly still-cheerful Cynthia Ford, from
CARE's human relations staff in Atlanta, and said we would never
make it through this day.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterwards, our Abuja team survived a scare: Our office
was surrounded by Nigerian soldiers, offended by our
``inflammatory'' questions about the burning of a refugee
encampment, and our programs were temporarily halted by the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon, Marc de Lamotte, a Frenchman who ordinarily
serves as CARE's Honduras country director, was taken hostage and
gagged. De Lamotte and some of the other CARE staffers in the
exercise had experienced real-life difficulties almost as severe.
But, in this case at least, I was envious of the hostage: He got a
break from hard decisions.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jaime Stewart, a reproductive health specialist at
Atlanta headquarters, told me we had only two hours to go, I wasn't
the only one beginning to feel a little giddy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the day's tension, however, the drill's participants
still found time to laugh. I was delighted to discover, for
instance, that I did not absolutely have to have a visa to enter
``Benin.'' My Visa card proved perfectly acceptable. And how can
you not laugh when donors are offering water beds and Slinky toys
for desperate refugees?
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson later said he liked the laughter and had injected
some of the humor deliberately. Even though their work is
critically serious, relief workers often laugh to reduce the
stress, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson took a little ribbing himself when the trainees met
Tuesday for what turned into intense self-evaluations of the
experience. ``I told you you were going to be really impressed with
the kind of mind that put this together,'' said Frank Powell, a
Nairobi-based, Emory trained consultant who led the debriefings.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no one was totally satisfied with his or her performance
during the drill.
</P>
<P>
   By its end, CARE and all other humanitarian agencies were forced
to leave ``Nigeria.'' And as Jan Schollaert _ the CARE country
director in Bolivia and a veteran of truly disastrous situations
from Somalia to Bangladesh _ explained sincerely to the mock BBC:
``CARE always hates to leave people in need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Powell told the group at Tuesday's debriefing that
perfection was not the point of the exercise: ``If you make a
mistake and you learn something from it, it's not a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in truth, the CARE staffers had reasons to be proud of
their performance. They had managed to work miracles amid the
chaotic circumstances _ not only finding donors for fictional
millions of dollars but developing and supplying four huge refugee
camps in Nigeria and another in Benin.
</P>
<P>
   Carsten Voelz, a German who set up real-life CARE refugee camps
in Albania and who now works in Kosovo, put the day into
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he said, ``we got some programs started, and we
helped hundreds of thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the people and the circumstance were fictional. But
tomorrow, for these staff members of CARE, they may be all too
real.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, as Iowa voters were preparing to elect a U.S. senator
and an assortment of state and local officials, the Steve Forbes
organization flooded the state with money for a lucky bunch of
Republican statehouse candidates in order to gain their support.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sexton of Rockwell City, who heads ``Farmers for Bush,''
received $1,000. In Cedar Rapids, Ron Corbett got $5,000 from
Forbes, even though he was a Lamar Alexander supporter. David
Miller of Libertyville got a $1,000 check _ ``with no questions, no
strings attached,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the Midas touch of Forbes, a publishing executive whose
net worth of $440 million puts him in the top ranks of wealth in
this nation. And he is not shy about sharing that wealth in pursuit
of his long-shot bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his business savvy and a seemingly bottomless pool of
assets, Forbes is engaging in politics in ways that are influencing
the Republican field far beyond his standing in the polls. His
spending is running neck-and-neck with that of the front-runner,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is bracing for the possibility
that Forbes might unleash a television campaign against him, much
like he did against Bob Dole four years ago. Already, Forbes has
hurt one Republican candidate, Elizabeth Dole, who cited Forbes'
``unlimited resources'' when she abandoned her presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Including his 1996 campaign, Forbes has spent $53,745,000 of his
own money in his quest for the White House, and he is expected to
spend another $20 million to $30 million in the months head. This
means that by the time this presidential race is over, Forbes could
well have spent $80 million or more from his own pocket on his
political dream. Ross Perot spent $63.5 million in his two
presidential bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am prepared to spend what it takes to go the distance,''
said Forbes in an interview while campaigning in Iowa last August.
``But I'm not going to put out a figure. I want to keep other
candidates scratching their heads. But be assured, I will be very
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   To be so, Forbes is quietly selling off shares in his family's
privately held publishing empire, so much so that he is no longer
its majority shareholder _ a position he inherited as the eldest
son of the late Malcolm Forbes. And in March, he relinquished his
position as editor in chief of Forbes magazine, a business
publication run by his brother, although he still writes a column
twice monthly that reads like one of his conservative stump
speeches of less government and a flat 17 percent income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes left the magazine, he said, in the belief that ``I can
get my issues across,'' even if he does not win his party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Forbes' financial holdings _ and the private way he
turns them into campaign cash _ makes them difficult to scrutinize
and turns the traditional way of looking at campaign finance on its
head.
</P>
<P>
   How, for instance, can the government measure his wealth when
the most it asks of candidates on federal disclosure statements is
whether their assets are ``over $1 million?'' How can voters ask
questions about financial interests that Forbes might be beholden
to when Forbes, mainly, is picking up nearly all of his campaign
expenses? And how can voters take a financial measure of Forbes
when the bulk of his net worth is in a private business, with few
details made available on how money moves from his business to his
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``The troubling aspect has to do with the fact that Steve Forbes
is extraordinarily wealthy,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a nonprofit group advocating campaign finance reform,
``and extraordinarily wealthy people should not have an
extraordinary advantage in seeking the presidency. I don't know why
Mr. Forbes would not be willing to make clear to the public what
the basis is for obtaining the resources he is using to run for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing that Forbes does in his campaign that can be
described as less than first class.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign bus, for instance, is an electronic marvel capable
of beaming campaign photos and sound bites to his Web site for the
press and supporters to download. Digital photos taken of Forbes
and his supporters at campaign stops are processed in the bus and
available instantaneously.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Iowans still remember the colossal air-conditioned tent with
French doors he provided to cool voters at the straw poll in Ames _
in contrast to other candidates whose campaign tents, without air
conditioning, baked in the August heat. And, he arranged for former
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain to visit Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Even his staff is color coordinated: Woman in matching white
polo shirts, blue for the men of his national staff, grey for the
local workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All this has money gushing from Forbes' pocket to his campaign.
On Sept. 15, for instance, he gave his campaign $300,000, another
$500,000 on Sept. 20, another $300,000 three days later, $1.5
million on Sept. 27 and $700,000 on Sept. 28. Since January, he has
spent $16.3 million of his money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of Forbes' free-spending ways, it is difficult to
determine exactly how all that cash gets into his pockets. Even
though the Forbes publishing empire's annual revenues exceed $1
billion and even though his family's homes spread from London to
Tangier to the French countryside, Forbes is asset rich, but cash
poor.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual income of about $3 million and potentially $80
million in campaign costs, Forbes does not have enough cash on hand
to foot his enormous bills. Even the sale last year of five
publicly traded stocks of other companies from his investment
portfolio was hardly enough, bringing in $680,000 to $5.6 million,
according to his campaign disclosure forms, which permits a wide
range in values.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes magazine shares, valued in the hundreds of millions,
are where Forbes' big money is. Yet these sales are taking place
with such secrecy that it is impossible to determine if they are in
line with campaign finance laws or could be illegal campaign
contributions from the buyers of Forbes shares to him. Citing his
family's privacy, Forbes has refused to disclose information about
these sales.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance law requires that such sales be at fair market
value. But there is no obligation for Forbes, or any candidate, to
provide the financial information to determine if that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Forbes has proved to be adept at mixing his business
and public lives to his advantage. Using $14 million in donations _
along with $100,000 of his own money _ Forbes founded a nonprofit
corporation, Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity, to promote
himself and his agenda in nonelection years. The corporate
structure he chose for this advocacy group allowed him to legally
skirt individual contribution limits and accept large undisclosed
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Until he announced his candidacy, he also maintained an active
speaking business, charging $20,000 to $32,000 to deliver what, say
those who heard him, was a variation of his stump speech now heard
for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say Steve Forbes spends $50 million or $100 million in
running for president,'' said Stephen Moore, a director at the Cato
Institute, a Washington research group. ``That will not break him.
Lots of people will give that money to philanthropy. But the truth
is that if you wanted to force America to focus on your ideas, the
single best way to spread them is to run for president. It's money
well spent, even if he loses.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the language of accounting, Forbes' federal disclosure
statement lays out his cash squeeze. His main asset is his large
stake in the Forbes global publishing empire that accounts for the
bulk of his net worth, valued at $440 million by Fortune magazine
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this stake in the family business throws off little actual
cash. This is because most of Forbes Inc.'s annual profits, by
corporate policy, are reinvested into the business rather than paid
out as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Forbes' reported income last year was around $3.3
million _ $2.3 million from Forbes Family Holdings Inc., and the
rest from his speaking tour and investment dividends and interest.
He also had the one-time capital gains from public stock sales.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a man with such a high net worth and who is spending
with such abandon, he owns a relatively modest personal investment
portfolio: He valued his stocks and bonds at $5 million to $13
million on his disclosure forms. The New Jersey farm where he lives
and nearby investment properties are valued at $11 million and $55
million. As for Forbes' share of the family business, all he would
tell the government is it has a ``value over $50,000,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to some $4 million in donations, there are three
ways Forbes can raise campaign money: He can take it from current
income, he can take out commercial bank loans or he can sell
assets.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes has not reported any banks loans, and he is required
to do so by federal campaign law. His $3.3 million annual income
and his one-time investment gains fall far short of the $54 million
he spent already and the millions ahead. And, as of last March, he
has taken an unpaid leave from Forbes Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can he call on his four siblings or his wife, Sabina, for
help. Federal election law prohibits anyone from giving a candidate
more than $1,000. And the law prohibits loans from the Forbes
family or from Forbes Inc. to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So, Forbes is following the third option _ selling his shares.
In doing so, he has quietly slipped from being Forbes Inc.'s
majority shareholder _ he had held 51 percent of the voting shares
and 35 percent of the capital stock _ to a major shareholder. He
said the buyers are Forbes' existing shareholders who, by all
accounts, are Forbes' four siblings.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The main question, from a campaign law perspective, is whether
the shares in Forbes Inc. were sold at fair market value. If not,
any amounts above the market price would be an illegal campaign
contribution. Nor can buyers of Forbes' shares agree to sell them
back to him when the campaign is over _ that would constitute an
illegal loan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Forbes declined to say how much of Forbes Inc.
he has sold, what price was paid, what process was used to value
the Forbes shares, what percentage he currently owns or who
specifically purchased the shares. But he said he abided by all
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a privately held company,'' Forbes said. ``I've
said I've sold personal resources and that we followed tried and
true methods that will withstand scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no agreements to repurchase his shares at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said that all his sales had been to existing shareholders
and hinted that there might be shareholders other than his three
brothers and one sister, by saying that his father might not have
owned all of Forbes Inc.'s shares at his 1990 death. But Leonard H.
Yablon, the company's executive vice president, says that only
Forbes and his siblings are shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' explanations, say campaign finance experts, fall short.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't say that this is a private company and,
therefore, there need not be any other eyes looking at this,'' said
Larry Makinson, who heads the Center for Responsive Politics, a
research group. ``You are looking at transactions worth tens of
millions of dollars and you need something other than the word of
the candidate. You have to have extremely sharp antennae to make
sure someone is not making a back-door contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said: ``This is unprecedented. I can't recall of a
similar financing scheme. Forbes is nothing if not unconventional.
His supporters would call it creative, his opponents would call it
a violation of the spirit of campaign finance laws. But the
important point Forbes hasn't seemed to grasp yet is that the
president of the United States is public property. If his campaign
goes anywhere, he will be forced to tell some of this information
whether he likes it or not.''

   The magazine that put Forbes on the map _ financially and
politically _ caters to a business elite of 785,000 readers and has
corporate advertisers who flock to its pages. This, along with
Forbes' lavish parties for readers and advertisers, gives Forbes
stature in business, a chance to rub elbows with world leaders and
the column to spread his political and social views.
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis for The New York Times, James Kobak, a magazine
consultant, estimated that Forbes Magazine, which is debt-free, has
gross annual revenues of around $260 million and pretax profits of
around $70 million. He estimated the magazine's market value at
about $1 billion _ up from Fortune's $750 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This magazine is very profitable,'' Kobak said. ``It's a
special e. It's the kind of magazine that if you own it and
call the president, the president would answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other candidates who try dearly to get positive press
coverage, Forbes has made the magazine part of a never-ending
political campaign. His column, ``Fact and Comment'' is a
compendium of key campaign themes _ so much so that the Federal
Election Commission filed a 1996 complaint against it, which
Forbes' campaign manager William DalCol said had been successfully
fought ``tooth and nail'' on First Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Steve Forbes ever stopped running for
president,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, a Wall Street banker and a
Forbes adviser.
</P>
<P>
   To keep his candidacy alive after the 1996 election, Forbes set
up the nonprofit corporation, Americans for Hope Growth and
Opportunity, financing it with $100,000 of his own money and the
$14 million from 150,000 others. The group spent all the money and
ceased operations last year; its officers now work for Forbes'
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the group ran 72 radio campaigns and five
television campaigns in 27 states, featuring Forbes and his prime
political issues. In addition, the group set up a leadership
political action commmittee, which raised $100,464 for donations to
candidates in key primary states, including Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike a partisan political committee that must identify
donors and limit contributions to $1,000, this group was set up as
a nonprofit corporation, allowing it accept unrestricted and
anonymous donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was always a questionable operation to promote Forbes in
key presidential primary states,'' said Wertheimer of Democracy 21.
``While technically it may not have come under the coverage of the
campaign finance laws, it certainly appeared to evade the spirit of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this group allowed Forbes to amass a core of
supporters for his 2000 campaign _ even sending them his columns
from Forbes Magazine. Alpha E. Knapp, a retiree in Chandler, Ariz.,
said his involvement in the nonprofit group started with a donation
to Forbes' 1996 campaign. ``My name got picked and I started
getting more mailings,' Knapp said. ``I take Forbes Magazine, so
what he says shows up in editorials there, too. I got a lot of
mailings _ his speeches, his Forbes editorials.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grantham, N.H., William R. Putnam, another retiree, made
donations to Forbes' campaign and the group. Asked why, Putnam
said, ``I don't want him to have to spend himself to welfare.''

HOUSE PASSES BILL OUTLAWING DOCTOR-ASSISTED SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Okla., Ill., Wash., Conn.) (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed by an Oregon law allowing
physician-assisted suicide, the House of Representatives passed a
bill Wednesday that would make it a federal crime for doctors to
prescribe drugs to help terminally ill patients end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 271-156. Seventy-one Democrats joined 200
Republicans in supporting the legislation. Twenty Republicans, 135
Democrats and one independent voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   Like many state laws that ban assisted suicide, the House bill
makes a sharp distinction between the use of prescription drugs to
control pain and the use of such medications to hasten death.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says that the use of controlled substances to alleviate
pain or discomfort is a ``legitimate medical purpose,'' even ``if
the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.'' But
under the bill, a doctor who prescribes drugs ``for the purpose of
causing death'' would be subject to criminal penalties _ 20 years
in prison for prescribing the drugs most commonly used to aid a
suicide, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Oregon law, which was enacted in October 1977
following a statewide referendum, doctors may, in some
circumstances, prescribe drugs to enable terminally ill patients to
end their lives. In June 1998, Attorney General Janet Reno said the
federal government would not take action against Oregon doctors who
assist in a suicide and fully comply with the procedures of the
state's law, the Death With Dignity Act.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Wednesday by the House would, in effect,
overrule Reno. It says that in deciding whether to issue or revoke
a doctor's license to prescribe potentially dangerous drugs, known
as controlled substances, the attorney general shall not recognize
any state law permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill, introduced in the Senate by the assistant
Republican leader, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, has 31 co-sponsors, but
has not reached the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is still working out its position.
The Justice Department told Congress last week that it opposes
physician-assisted suicide, but dislikes provisions of the House
bill that would ``interfere with state policy-making in a
particularly heavy-handed way.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House bill said that Congress had authority to
legislate on this issue because it can regulate the use of
potentially dangerous drugs. The bill would amend a 1970 federal
law, the Controlled Substances Act, which sets uniform national
standards for the control of morphine and other narcotics. The use
of hallucinogens, stimulants and depressants is regulated under the
same law.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Oregon expressed outrage at the legislation,
saying it was the height of hypocrisy for conservative Republicans
_ usually staunch advocates of states' rights _ to overturn a law
twice approved in referendums by the voters of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats and some Republicans said the bill would put
federal drug agents in hospital rooms to judge the intent of
doctors prescribing pain-relief medicines in the final days of
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said
they were trying to protect the sanctity of life by forbidding
doctors to prescribe drugs for the purpose of hastening death.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the bill promoted the uniform application of federal
drug laws. ``Oregon,'' he said, ``decided to change the
time-honored professional purpose of medicine and give doctors the
option to serve no longer as healing forces, but as social
engineers, messengers of death. Doctors are authorized by the
Oregon law to put down the stethoscope and pick up the poison pill
and assist in the execution of their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said Congress was arrogantly
setting standards for the practice of medicine. ``We, the great
board of medicine in the sky, will decide what goes on between
doctors and patients'' in the last days of life, said McDermott, a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., said: ``This is a day of shame for the
U.S. Congress. In addition to overturning Oregon's law, this bill
authorizes the Drug Enforcement Administration to second-guess
physicians all across America, and its effect on pain management
will be devastating. Few, if any, members of Congress even read the
Oregon law they voted to overturn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said that technically it would not
overturn the Oregon law. But, they said, it would severely hamper
patients' ability to invoke the state law, because doctors could
not legally prescribe lethal doses of controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, a Republican who voted
against the House bill, said, ``DEA agents will have to decide
whether the doctor's purpose was to alleviate pain, even at the
risk of death, or to hasten death.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a physician who supported the House
measure, insisted, ``This bill does nothing to disturb the proper
doctor-patient relationship in Oregon.'' A doctor who would take a
patient's life ``no longer has an ethical right to care for that
patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the first year of its assisted-suicide law,
Oregon said that 15 people ended their lives with lethal
medications in 1998. Thirteen had cancer, one had a chronic lung
condition and one had congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association supported the House bill and
supports Nickles' bill too.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yank D. Coble, secretary-treasurer of the association, said
the bills would provide ``a new and important statutory protection
for physicians prescribing controlled substances for pain,
particularly for patients at the end of life.'' The AMA has long
opposed assisted suicide, on the ground that it is ``antithetical
to the role of physician as healer.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the House bill, as stated in the legislation, is
``to promote pain management and palliative care without permitting
assisted suicide and euthanasia.'' Palliative care alleviates pain
and distress, but is not meant to hasten death or cure disease.

 &HT;    Fiorentina edges Arsenal
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Giovanni Trappatoni's resignation could have been
sincere or a clever ploy to get struggling Fiorentina off the mat.
Either way, after the Italian club's clutch 1-0 win at Arsenal on
Wednesday, the second-year coach will be sticking around for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Fiorentina clinched a spot in the next round,
thanks to a dazzling 75th-minute goal by Gabriel Batistuta, giving
a badly needed lift to a club in 11th place in Serie A.
</P>
<P>
   After a dismal loss over the weekend to lowly Piacenza,
Trappatoni said he was quitting. The club rejected the resignation
and asked him to make the trip to London.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal, which has won only three of 13 Champions League matches
at Wembley Stadium the past two years, outplayed Fiorentina much of
the game. But it could not stop Batistuta when the Argentine
streaked down the right side of the box and hammered an 8-foot shot
from a sharp angle into the far side of the net. The Gunners'
consolation is a spot in the next round of the UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other clubs advanced this week, but six spots are still up
for grabs going into next week's first-round group finales.
Defending champion Manchester United moves on after earning a 2-1
victory at Croatia Zagreb Wednesday in Group D on goals by David
Beckham and Roy Keane. Marseille lost a chance to clinch by losing
3-2 to Sturm Graz.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up Bayern Munich and three other German clubs could be
eliminated if they don't finish well. Bayern lost 2-1 to PSV
Eindhoven, setting up a must-win situation against equally
desperate Rangers in Group F (2:30 p.m. Wednesday, ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, near the bottom of Spain's Primera Division, took away
an impressive 2-1 win Tuesday in Glasgow on goals by Gaizca
Mendieta and Claudio Lopez to dash Scottish hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Porto and Real Madrid won easily on Tuesday to qualify out of
Group E, and Group G favorites Bordeaux and Sparta Prague also have
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has earned the top spot in Group A after drawing 1-1 with
Bayer Leverkusen, which will battle Dynamo Kyiv for the other
place. Norwegian side Rosenborg moves out of Group C after beating
Boavista 2-0, leaving Borussia Dortmund and Feyenoord in limbo
after they drew 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mess is in Group H, which Hertha Berlin failed to
sew up after dropping a stunning 4-1 decision at home to previously
winless Galatasaray. Hakan Sukur had two goals for the Turkish club
in a four-goal outburst in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea is tied at the top with Hertha after earning an
impressive 1-1 draw at AC Milan. Oliver Bierhoff struck in the 74th
minute for the Italian side, but Dennis Wise equalized three
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona, which won Group B last week, whipped AIK of Stockholm
5-0 on Wednesday, getting two goals from striker Patrick Kluivert,
whose league play has been less than impressive.
</P>
<P>
   EVERTON DRAWS LEEDS
</P>
<P>
   A goal by David Weir in injury time gave surging Everton a 4-4
draw with Leeds, which still leads the Premier League by a point
over Arsenal. Everton led 3-2 before Jonathan Woodgate got the
equalizer for Leeds with 18 minutes left. Weir's goal left Everton,
which has finished in the upper half of the table only once since
1992, in eighth place.... Nwankwo Kanu scored a hat trick in the
last 15 minutes as Arsenal rallied to top Chelsea 3-2. The Nigerian
striker banged in the winner from a sharp angle on the touchline
from 16 yards out after pulling out Chelsea keeper Ed de Goey....
Manchester United's Premier League free fall continues, as the Red
Devils dropped a 3-1 decision to Tottenham, their fourth winless
contest in their last five outings. The injury news got worse at
Old Trafford, with the loss of midfielder Nicky Butt for six weeks
after he underwent a hernia operation.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: AMERICA CANS KIESE
</P>
<P>
   Last week's humiliating 3-1 loss to Cruz Azul did not put a
critical dagger into Club America's playoff aspirations, but it was
enough for club officials to lose their patience with coach Carlos
Kiese. The club is the richest in Mexico, and a first-place Group 3
tie with Atlas isn't good enough. The Paraguayan was the seventh
coach to lose his job during the Torneo Invierno. On Sunday, with
new man Roberto Alderete in charge, America needed an 87th-minute
goal from Joel Sanchez to beat lowly Santos 1-0.... Jose Cardozo
scored his ninth goal in Toluca's 1-0 victory over Guadalajara.
While Toluca is well in command of Group 1, Chivas are tied for the
lead of Group 4 with Necaxa, which defeated Atlante 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   FIRECRACKER HURTS PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   A vital game in the Peruvian Clausura championship was postponed
Sunday when a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded on the
field. German Pinillos, a defender for the Sport Boys club, was
said not to be injured seriously after the object detonated near
his legs. The incident occurred in the contest between Sport Boys
and Alianza Lima, which are separated by a point at the top of the
table.

 &HT;    AP voters needn't rubber-stamp No. 1
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ According to the rules of the Bowl Championship
Series, the teams that finish 1-2 in the final rankings, issued
Dec. 5, will play in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship.
It is assumed the winner will be declared the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   But as ESPN's Lee Corso would say: ``Not so fast, my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Sugar Bowl will be declared the national
champion in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll. The National Football
Coaches Association made that decision last year when the BCS was
established.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters in The Associated Press media poll are not
obligated to vote for the Sugar Bowl winner. Thus, a team such as
Virginia Tech has hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies (6-0) are third in the BCS standings, behind Florida
State (8-0) and Penn State (8-0), because their strength of
schedule is rated 42nd in Division I-A. (Florida State's is 21st,
Penn State's eighth.) Everyone who has crunched the numbers agrees
that Florida State and Penn State will meet in the Sugar Bowl if
both teams win the rest of their games. That could leave an 11-0
Virginia Tech team on the outside looking in.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this: Suppose Florida State and Penn State play an
unspectacular Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4? Suppose that a couple of days
earlier, Virginia Tech dominated somebody in the Orange Bowl to
finish 12-0? The writers would be free to vote for the Hokies, and
there would be split national champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have this thing worked out well enough where the
two best teams will play for the national championship,'' Virginia
Tech coach Frank Beamer said. ``We don't talk about it. What
concerns us right now is Pittsburgh.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   JUST THINKING
</P>
<P>
   _ Folks in Tallahassee say that Peter Warrick's return to
Florida State hurts quarterback Chris Weinke. Why? Weinke tends to
focus on No. 9 when the receiver is on the field, and that makes
the passing game easier to defend. Against Miami _ one of the two
games in which Warrick did not play because of his suspension for
his theft arrest _ Weinke completed passes to 11 receivers. Against
Clemson, 18 of Weinke's 24 completions were to two receivers,
Warrick and Ron Dugans.
</P>
<P>
   _ After tough games against Ohio State and Purdue, Penn State
had better be ready to play Illinois, which stunned Michigan 35-29
last week. Both of Joe Paterno's quarterbacks, Kevin Thompson
(shoulder) and Rashard Casey (chest), are sore.
</P>
<P>
   _ After beating Alabama for the fifth consecutive year,
Tennessee broke out its rendition of the Lynyrd Skynyrd tune
``Sweet Home Alabama.'' The Volunteers' version? ``We Own
Alabama.'' I imagine that one will get put on the Crimson Tide's
bulletin board next year.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Georgia assistant Mickey Matthews will be the Atlantic
10 Conference Coach of the Year. His first James Madison team is
6-1, with the only loss coming to No. 3 Virginia Tech in the
opener. A year ago, the Dukes were 3-8.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stanford and Washington, picked to finish sixth and eighth,
respectively, in the Pac-10 during the preseason, play Saturday in
a game that could be for the conference championship and a spot in
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boston College had a problem with geese landing and living on
Alumni Field. So the school bought an English bird dog named
``Blaze'' to police the field and keep the geese away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nebraska coach Frank Solich has backed off after ripping the
officials who worked the Cornhuskers' 24-20 loss to Texas last
week. During his Sunday television show, Solich used words such as
``horrendous'' and ``ridiculous'' to describe some calls. By
Tuesday he had calmed down. Still, he sent a videotape of some
calls to the Big 12 office.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH QUOTING
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had me down, he twisted my ankle. If I was him, I
probably would have done the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   KENNY KELLY, Miami quarterback, who said Boston College tackle
Chris Hovan intentionally tried to hurt him last week.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   1967: The last time Michigan lost three consecutive
regular-season games. The Wolverines have lost two in a row, to
Michigan State and Illinois. They face Indiana on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   483: Yards needed by Wisconsin's Ron Dayne to break the NCAA
career rushing record of Texas' Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   21: The lead Southern California had in its games against Notre
Dame and Stanford, only to lose both.
</P>
<P>
   5: Consecutive games in which Texas A&AMP;M has had a kick blocked.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Gunmen proclaiming a coup d'etat stormed the Parliament
in Armenia's capital city of Yerevan on Wednesday, killing the
nation's prime minister, Parliament speaker and a number of senior
legislators before seizing about 50 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The police sealed off the building, and President Robert
Kocharian rushed there to negotiate with the assassins, who said
they might release a videotape detailing their demands.
Negotiations continued through the evening as two armored personnel
carriers took up positions on the Parliament grounds and the
president directed security operations.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports as to the number of gunmen, and
their motive was not immediately clear. An Armenian journalist who
was in the chamber at the time said one of the men cried that they
had ``come to avenge those who have drunk the blood of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said the group, who were reported to
number from two to six men, were mentally unstable terrorists
without known political ties. But others said the slogans shouted
by the attackers suggested they were nationalists opposed to peace
negotiations over a tiny Armenian enclave in Azerbaijian that has
been the focus of Armenian-Azeri warfare and politics for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than many fragments of the old Soviet Union, tiny Armenia _
with a population of about 3.8 million people _ has had an uneasy
transition to the post-communist era, and the struggle with
Azerbaijian has kept the Armenian government in turmoil. Just last
year, the president was forced out of office because critics
believed he was making too many concessions in peace negotiations
with Azerbaijian.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting on Wednesday, one of the assailants, speaking
to local television, said, ``This is a patriotic action. This
shake-up is needed for the nation to regain its senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of witnesses and a grainy Armenian television tape of
the shootings appeared to show that the gunmen, clad in trenchcoats
which hid Kalyshnikov automatic rifles, burst into the chamber as
three government officials _ Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian,
Speaker Karen Demirchian and possibly Finance Minister Levon
Barkhudaryan _ were at the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
   As people in the chamber fled or ducked for cover, Sarkisian was
repeatedly shot at close range. The gunmen then turned their
weapons on top government officials who had been sitting in the
front row of the Parliament's seats. Apparently, many top officials
were present for a question period in the Parliament involving the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian television channel A1Plus said eight people had
died in the attack, including Sarkisian; Demirchian; his deputy,
Yuri Bakhshian, and the energy minister, Leonard Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's health minister, Gike Nikogosian, was quoted as saying
that the finance minister and another deputy were likely dead as
well, but that could not be confirmed. The number of wounded was
also uncertain, but some reports put the number at 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, the attacks began about 5:15 p.m, (9:15
a.m., ET) and journalists in the chamber were later ordered outside
by one gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister, quoted by a Moscow television reporter,
described the gunmen as in a state of possession. And the Russian
minister for relations with former Soviet states, Leonid
Drachevsky, said he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a psychiatrist is needed _ professional
negotiators from the special services who would calm them down,''
he said on Russian television on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials nevertheless speculated that the killings were
related to reports that a bitter territorial dispute between
Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan is about to be settled. The
territory, called Nagorno-Karabakh, is part of Azerbaijan but has
been under the rule of Armenian separatists since an ethnic war
there in the late 1980s and early 1990s killed 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1 million Azerbaijani refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh
still live in poverty, mostly in tent cities and shanties near the
Azeri capital of Baku.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations have been deeply
involved in talks to settle the dispute, and the United States is
reported to have promised Azerbaijan political support and foreign
aid in exchange for settling the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, President Clinton's principal troubleshooter in the
former Soviet Union, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was
in Yerevan on Wednesday for consultations on the Karabakh dispute.
He left the country about an hour before the shootings occurred and
was seen off at the Yerevan airport by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At least one indicator bolstered speculation that the attack was
aimed at destablizing the talks between the two nations over
Nagorno-Karabakh. Reporters identified the gunman who escorted them
from the Parliament as a member of an extreme nationalist party,
the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, whose goals are said to
include restoring Armenia's borders to their historic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago, an Armenian empire stretched from the Caspian to
the Mediterranean seas. One U.S. official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said reports of slogans shouted by the gunmen and
information on their backgrounds also tended to suggest that they
are nationalist extremists. But he was unable to be more specific.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officials of the leading nationalist organization in the
country, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation known as the Dashnak
movement, disassociated themselves on Wednesday night from the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Khachatryan, an adviser to the interior minister, said in
an interview on Russian television that three of the attackers had
been identified as two brothers and their uncle, one of whom lived
in Ukraine's Crimea before returning to Armenia in 1998. But he
offered no clue as to why they had made the attack.

MARKET PLACE: NATWEST BID FOR BANK OF SCOTLAND TURNS INTO A LONG
SOAP OPERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The hostile bidding war for National Westminster Bank
that the Bank of Scotland started last month is turning out to be
not much of a war at all.
</P>
<P>
   No other suitors have emerged to help heighten the drama of what
now seems to be an overly long soap opera with hardly any of the
plot twists that had been foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   The story line, however, shifted ever so slightly Wednesday as
Natwest announced its defense strategy, hoping to thwart the Bank
of Scotland's $34 billion hostile bid and any other bid from
friendlier suitors that have been taking a wait-and-see approach.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, which the British bank had publicly hinted at in
fits and starts, includes a plan to sell assets that analysts
estimate could raise the equivalent of $6.6 billion as it
desperately tries to remain independent. Natwest said it would sell
its fund management unit, Gartmore Investment Management; its
investment banking unit, Greenwich Natwest, and its venture capital
unit, Natwest Equity Partners, as well as Ulster Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If shareholders squashed the Bank of Scotland's bid, Natwest
would return the proceeds from the sales to its shareholders. As
part of its defense, Natwest also said it would cut 1,650 jobs,
beyond the 10,000 job cuts already announced.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting its defense plan, David Rowland, chief executive of
Natwest said: ``Bank of Scotland is attempting to hijack cost
savings that belong to Natwest shareholders and is claiming
unrealistic merger benefits. I urge Natwest shareholders to reject
the offer which is ill-conceived and significantly undervalues
Natwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland was appointed chief executive two weeks ago to succeed
Derek Wanless as part of an interim defense strategy. Ron Sandler,
the former chief executive of Lloyds of London, also joined the
company then as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Natwest's plan was a bit contradictory, because in
many ways it mirrors the Bank of Scotland's plan to squeeze $1.7
billion in savings and value out of the bank, Britain's third
largest, by selling off assets and laying off employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt overall that there are still a lot of question marks,''
said Tom Rayner, an analyst at SG Securities in London. ``The
strategy looks like a lot of backtracking. There's a lot more
convincing needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Natwest's defense strategy, the Bank of Scotland
seized on the concept that the strategy is a copycat plan, that
Natwest's latest ideas concede the merits of key elements of the
Bank of Scotland's proposed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burt, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, continued
the verbal sparring. ``Natwest's corporate memory is either very
short or highly selective,'' he said. ``The facts are simple:
Natwest's track record is one of change, failure and
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt's assertions aside, Natwest shares remain higher than the
Bank of Scotland's original bid. Shares of Natwest closed Wednesday
at an 8.3 percent premium over the Bank of Scotland's offer price,
dropping 2.6 percent, to 1,374 pence, or $22.67.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said shares of Natwest were trading at a premium
because investors were still hoping for another suitor to emerge.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has been watching and may soon pounce,
executives close to the company said, though the company has not
made its intentions clear. Abbey National is also said to have an
eye on Natwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has decided the Bank of Scotland's bid is not
enough,'' Rayner said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that both of the companies have publicly issued their plans,
analysts expect another player could join the bidding because it
now has the advantage of knowing what it is playing against.
Investors, however, remain a bit skeptical that anyone else will
emerge with a higher bid for Natwest, as reflected by the 14
percent drop in shares of Natwest since the Bank of Scotland
formally announced its bid on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   A number of analysts privately questioned whether the Royal Bank
of Scotland would be making a bid, considering the amount of time
it has already had to do so and the way that the shares of Natwest
have performed. One analyst said that newspaper reports that Royal
Bank was planning a bid several weeks ago were simply a way for the
bank to dip its toe into the market to test interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rayner said the Royal Bank of Scotland might just be waiting for
Natwest shares to drop a little further. ``I don't think they can
afford to do nothing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   International health officials and scientific experts say that
strains of tuberculosis resistant to various drugs are spreading
faster than anticipated overseas and that a new treatment strategy
is needed to prevent what has already become an epidemic from
spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the World Health Organization has recommended
that patients with ordinary tuberculosis take up to four drugs,
every day, for six to eight months, and that doctors and health
workers watch them take their medicine and monitor them to ensure
that they are cured. The strategy has become widely known as DOTS,
or Directly Observed Therapy Short-Course.
</P>
<P>
   But in a new report, doctors from the Harvard Medical School and
the Open Society Institute, a foundation financed by George Soros,
say more intensive treatment is needed in the former Soviet Union
and other areas where rates of TB are relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   In the intensive regimen, patients are required to take many
more expensive drugs, over a longer period of time.
Multidrug-resistant TB strains afflict on average 2 percent of
victims, and nowhere more than 30 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation has been endorsed by the World Health
Organization, whose director general, Gro Harlem Bruntland, is
scheduled to be present Thursday when the 408-page report is made
public in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But some health experts fear that new approach could make the
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the new treatment strategy, called DOTS-Plus, doctors watch
patients take up to seven drugs daily, for 18 to 24 months, at far
greater cost per cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landmark shift by the WHO, the most exciting step
forward in the global effort to control TB in 25 years,'' said
Michael D. Iseman, director of TB services at the National Jewish
Medical and Research Center in Denver, a leading expert in TB
treatment and research and a member of the advisory board of the
Harvard group which wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``The Global Impact of Drug-Resistant
Tuberculosis,'' contains a foreward offering an unusual endorsement
from the WHO's leading specialists of the new treatment strategy.
``In our zeal to implement DOTS everywhere,'' said Mario C.
Raviglione, the WHO's coordinator for bacterial and viral diseases,
who signed the preface, ``there was no clear policy in the program
to take care of multidrug-resistant TB. Now we realize that
something more must be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Raviglione said he does not know how much more the new treatment
strategy would cost since his world health group is only starting
to study the issue. But he conceded that the expanded strategy will
almost certainly cost hundreds of millions of dollars, ``perhaps a
billion dollars more'' than the currently recommended treatment,
which is already underfunded, many doctors complain.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, several experts said that the WHO's
recommendations were likely to intensify an already emotional
public health debate about the wisdom of expanding recommended
treatment for some TB patients at a time when two million people
throughout the world die each year for lack of adequate care.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting September in Madrid, Spain, opponents of the
expanded strategy argued that emphasizing the treatment, would
shift desperately needed public health resources away from curing
patients with nondrug-resistant tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WHO declared TB a global emergency in 1993,'' said Thomas
R. Frieden, the WHO medical officer for TB for Southeast Asia, in a
telephone interview in New Delhi. ``But six years later fewer than
20 percent of patients get even basic treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Frieden said efforts to combat multidrug-resistant TB should
focus on its cause, inadequate treatment of ordinary TB.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis is known to acquire resistance to drugs that are
being given patients inefficiently. If the wrong drugs or doses are
given for too short a time, or if the patients stop taking them,
the TB bacteria that survive may become resistant to the drugs.
Frieden and other experts fear that if new, more highly effective
drugs are also given inappropriately, the multidrug-resistant TB
strains will eventually become unresponsive to these drugs too,
making an already bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Farmer, director of the Program in Infectious Disease
and Social Change at Harvard Medical School, the report's primary
author agreed that poor treatment has led to many cases of
multidrug-resistant TB. But he said inadequate treatment was no
longer the only cause of such strains. He said new data suggest
that in some areas drug-resistant strains are now spreading on
their own, person-to-person, even in countries with good TB control
programs.
</P>
<P>
   He said multidrug-resistant tuberculosis now threatens not just
poorer countries, but Europe and, eventually, the United States as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that multidrug-resistant TB has now been
reported in 100 countries and that its rates are rising faster in
some countries than public health officials anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Russia's Ivanovo region, a poor province with a
vast prison population and shoddy public health, the WHO reported
in 1997 that 4 percent of TB patients had multidrug-resistant
strains. According to the new report, such cases now total 8.9
percent of people with TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figures like these show that multidrug-resistant TB in some
places is now out of control, and it shows we were doing something
wrong, that more than DOTS is needed in such areas,'' said
Raviglione.
</P>
<P>
   But Frieden, who was New York's TB control director between 1992
and 1996, points out that two-thirds of people with
multidrug-resistant TB developed it because the Ivanovo province
program did not ensure that patients' took their medication. ``If
medicines aren't being taken, it doesn't matter if you're being
given two or four or seven drugs,'' he warned. ``And if resistance
to reserve drugs emerges, our last line of defense against TB will
be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer agreed that failure to take drugs was still a major
problem in Russia and elsewhere. But, he added, the Ivanovo study
had also shown that ``the drugs patients received were
inadequate,'' which is primarily why only 5 percent of
multidrug-resistant cases were cured.
</P>
<P>
   Raviglione said adoption of a DOTS-plus strategy would not mean
the WHO would abandon its current DOTS strategy. In fact, both
stressed the need to ensure that doctors everywhere make sure
patients take their drugs. Rather, they said, the report stresses
the need for supplemental drugs and therapy where
multidrug-resistant strains already exist.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said that his medical team began to question the
currently recommended therapy about five years ago after a relief
worker colleague died in a Massachusetts hospital after contracting
drug resistant TB in Peru, which has an excellent DOTS treatment
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made us think that the one-size fits all treatment
approach was not universally effective,'' Farmer explained.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the scientists agreed, there would be no competition
between resources for treating nondrug-resistant and drug-resistant
TB. But given world's indifferent response to the threat, said Lee
B. Reichman, executive director of the National Tuberculosis Center
in Newark, N.J., some doctors feared there would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dots-Plus is a sexy new strategy with Harvard behind it, and
like any sexy new strategy, there is some fear of it,'' said
Reichman, who contributed to the report. ``But I'm on the WHO's TB
working group, and we've made it clear that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study shows that multidrug-resistant TB emerged in
Peru, despite the fact that it had an excellent control program. In
Peru, Farmer and his colleagues were able to cure 85 percent of
supposedly incurable multidrug-resistant patients by giving them up
to seven drugs over 24 months. The treatment cost between $280 to
$4,900, higher than the cost of the currently recommended therapy,
but far less than what such treatment would cost in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Reichman estimates that it costs his center in Newark, N.J., an
average of $4,800 per patient and six months to cure normal TB
without hospitalization, as opposed to $200,000 and up to two years
of treatment, including lengthy hospitalization, to cure patients
with multidrug-resistant strains. In New York City in the early
1990s, an outbreak of multidrug-resistant TB cost up to $1 billion
in extra health care costs, said Reichman.
</P>
<P>
   Because New York and other major cities have bolstered TB
surveillance, treatment and control, rates of multidrug-resistant
TB cases have recently been declining in the United States. In
1998, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, only 1.1 percent of American TB cases were
multidrug-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation overseas has grown far more dangerous,'' said
Alex Goldfarb, a microbiologist at the Public Health Research
Institute, a private health group in New York and a co-author of
the report. ``Because there are ever more drug-resistant TB cases
in hot zones, ``each case is a walking time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   In one of its many ominous predictions, the study warns that
even if the recommended DOTS treatment strategy is implemented, 171
million new cases and 60 million deaths can be expected between
1998 and 2030. The worst case scenario predicts 249 million new
cases and 90 million deaths, even with the currently recommended
treatment.

CLEAN AIR PLAN MAY HELP HOUSTON CUT SMOG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas' environmental commissioners Wednesday
approved an outline for a sweeping new effort to slash air
pollution so Houston can comply with a federal cleanup deadline in
2007.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which Gov. George W. Bush will submit for federal
approval next month, defers key decisions and rule adoptions for
several more months. A final version is not due until December
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bush the Republican presidential front-runner,
Houston's chronic smog violations and the state's efforts to stop
them have drawn national attention and critical comment in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling at what he called unfair and incorrect charges, the
environmental commission's top staff official said the nation's
most stringent controls for one key group of smog-forming
pollutants will be imposed on Houston-area industries.
</P>
<P>
   This 90 percent cut in all industrial emissions of nitrogen
oxides _ the new smog plan's primary target _ is ``unprecedented,''
said Jeff Saitas, executive director of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Los Angeles area, long noted for having the most
aggressive air-quality program, industries don't have such a strict
mandate, Saitas said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan approved by the three TNRCC commissioners, all Bush
appointees, indicates new pollution cuts are also in store for
private vehicles, construction equipment, marine vessels and
others.
</P>
<P>
   They would add up to major reductions from all those sources,
though not nearly as large as industries' 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State calculations indicate the Houston area must erase up to 85
percent of its combined nitrogen oxide emissions to bring levels of
ground-level ozone, a respiratory irritant and smog's chief
ingredient, below the Clean Air Act's national health standard.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC commissioners will not formally select and propose the
measures to achieve those reductions until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But the document approved Wednesday indicates a strong
likelihood they will include a stricter tailpipe-testing program
for cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a program was included in the collection of potential
measures that computer modeling showed would reduce ozone levels
the most, though still not below the health standard.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits the TNRCC from restoring the stricter
tailpipe test that legislators junked four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But TNRCC and local air-quality planners are studying the
possible introduction of a cheaper, though similar, test that could
achieve comparable pollution reductions.
</P>
<P>
   This new test, like the one that lawmakers abandoned and banned,
would measure vehicle emissions of nitrogen oxides. The current
test in Houston's Harris County does not do so, measuring only
other smog-forming pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Because even the framework plan's most stringent set of possible
measures appears to fall short of the health standard, the TNRCC is
committed to bridging that gap by choosing additional actions,
TNRCC Chairman Robert Huston said .
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials say more measures must be identified to achieve
reductions from vehicles and from so-called ``off-road sources,''
principally construction equipment and marine vessels.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility for additional cuts in vehicle pollution,
mentioned in the plan, is a program of voluntary measures such as
new carpooling and vanpooling programs.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC has asked local officials to specify which measures
they should adopt to reduce vehicle use, and therefore vehicle
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   To lower emissions from construction equipment, the TNRCC staff
has been studying a required shift in construction activity to
nighttime hours, because ozone forms when various pollutants react
in sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Business officials have already criticized that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials could activate a ``sanctions clock'' leading
to economic penalties for Houston if they reject the plan approved
Wednesday because it did not actually choose enough measures to
meet the ozone standard.
</P>
<P>
   But Commissioner Ralph Marquez said he believes that is not a
``fatal flaw,'' because the TNRCC is promising to complete that job
next year.
</P>
<P>
   A former chemical industry official, Marquez said he now sees
greater cooperation to improve Houston's air quality than ever
before, involving federal, state and local government officials
along with business leaders and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Although the framework plan's strictest scenario doesn't yet
meet the standard, computer studies found it would shrink the
geographic area affected by ozone violations and the length of time
when readings that high occur, he said.

U.S. TO HELP IRAQI OPPOSITION DEVELOP MILITARY CADRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has authorized the first
direct military training for opponents of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, said senior officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, four Iraqi rebel leaders, including two
former officers in Iraq's armed forces, will attend a 10-day
training course at the Air Force's special-operations headquarters
near Pensacola, Fla., where U.S. officials will school them on how
to organize a military in an emerging state. Other courses are
being prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has also approved its first contribution of
surplus Pentagon equipment intended to help foster the overthrow of
Saddam, offering the main Iraqi opposition groups $2 million worth
of office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While the initial assistance is modest _ and, the officials
emphasized, ``nonlethal'' _ it reflects the sharp shift in policy
toward overt support of what amounts to an insurgency against
Saddam's government. In that sense, it recalls U.S. support in the
1980s for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and for the mujahedeen
guerrillas who resisted the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The training and equipment, which includes computers, fax
machines and file cabinets, represent the first portion of $97
million in aid authorized by Congress last year to bolster the
fractious groups intent on deposing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion here is to help people associated with the
opposition to think about a plan for the country after Saddam
Hussein,'' a military official who has worked closely with the
Iraqi opposition said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since four days of U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq
last December, the administration has openly stepped up contacts
with Iraqi opposition leaders. So far, those efforts appear to have
had little impact on dissent inside Iraq, and officials at the
Pentagon, in particular, remain deeply skeptical of the viability
of Saddam's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has been under increasing pressure from
Republicans and even some Democrats in Congress to do more to
support the opposition with equipment and possibly arms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, on Wednesday accused the
administration of having ``a lethargic approach'' and called for
more significant assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that Saddam Hussein would be worried about
being overthrown by Iraqi exiles trained in civil affairs
brandishing fax machines,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi opposition leaders, however, strongly welcomed the
support. Dr. Salah Shaikhly, a spokesman for the Iraqi National
Congress, a coalition of exiles, said the equipment and training
would be ``vital to our work in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Nonlethal' doesn't mean not useful inside Iraq,'' he said in
an interview Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and military officials said they hoped that this
first installment would strengthen the credibility of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The administration made its decision on the eve of a large
gathering of opposition groups in New York City this weekend. They
are looking to the gathering as a chance to forge a unified front
against Saddam, something that has been sorely lacking because of
infighting among his many opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States government wants to hear from a unified
Iraqi popular leadership just how it can proceed to support the
people of Iraq in promoting the change of regime, as it is the
right of you, the Iraqi people, to do,'' wrote undersecretary of
state for political affairs, Thomas Pickering, to the leaders of
seven opposition groups Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The aid comes during a troubling period in the administration's
handling of Iraq. There have been no inspections of Iraq's reported
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs since the
government expelled United Nations inspectors 15 months ago,
leading to December's punitive attacks. And while the
administration says Saddam remains isolated, diplomatic efforts to
set up a new inspection system, as called for under the terms of
the cease-fire that ended the gulf war in 1991, have foundered.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials also fear that Iraq has quietly
rebuilt much of what U.S. and British warplanes destroyed in
December, including missile factories. And while U.S. and British
jets patrolling ``no flight'' zones over Iraq regularly attack
Iraqi air-defense sites, including a strike Wednesday against
missile sites in northern Iraq, those attacks have not put an end
to Saddam's defiance nor eroded his grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of significant diplomatic progress, the main
focus of administration policy on Iraq has become fomenting
opposition inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   The first military training will take place at Hurlburt Field,
near Pensacola, where the four Iraqis will attend a regular Air
Force course for officers from Arab and Central Asian countries.
Officials emphasized that the course does not include combat
training.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and Iraqi opposition groups declined to
identify the four Iraqis. ``They are going to go back into Iraq,''
Shaikhly said. ``We don't want Saddam Hussein to know who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The four include a former captain and a former major in the
Iraqi armed forces who defected after the gulf war and took part in
the failed uprisings that followed. The other two also took part in
those uprisings and are now civilian members of opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pentagon provides training to scores of officers from
around the world, it is highly unusual to offer courses to people
who are not backed by sovereign governments. The officials said
they expected to offer space to more Iraqis in other Pentagon
courses.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they are considering additional equipment,
including communications gear. While the CIA has provided covert
support to Iraqi dissidents in the past, this is the first overt
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had not ruled out providing
weapons, but they said they want to move slowly to be sure that
Saddam's opponents build a viable foundation before attempting a
military challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not ruled out future lethal assistance,'' said State
Department spokesman James Rubin on Wednesday. ``But at this time,
we believe that providing such assistance would do more harm to the
Iraqi opposition than to the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The wariness reflects the history of infighting among the
opposition groups, which include Kurdish factions in northern Iraq,
Shiite rebels in southern Iraq and exile groups like the Iraqi
National Congress, which is based in London.
</P>
<P>
   While the groups share the objective of overthrowing Saddam,
they have been torn by their own rivalries. What unity did exist
collapsed completely in 1996, when Iraqi forces pushed into
northern Iraq on behalf of one Kurdish faction, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, fighting another, the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan. That operation also allowed Saddam's forces to crush a
cell of dissidents supported by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they welcomed the groups' progress
in renewing the common cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started near zero,'' a senior administration official
said. ``A year ago there were only the remnants of the Iraqi
National Congress, and those remnants could not and would not meet
with each other. They've come a long way from that point.''

 &HT;    Web wars: Scouting made easy
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Florida Gators didn't have to wait
for Georgia defensive stars Marcus Stroud and Will Witherspoon to
return to the practice field to know they would be playing in
Saturday's crucial game in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   All the Gators had to do was point a mouse and click.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find out just about anything you want about a team on
the Internet,'' said Jamie Speronis, UF's director of football
administration who surfs the Net for such information. ``Things
that used to take us several days to find out through newspapers
that were mailed to us, we can now learn almost instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Bulldogs haven't also added cyberspace to their
scouting report. They, too, know Florida offensive stars Travis
Taylor and Earnest Graham are expected to return for the game that
should decide which school will be playing in the SEC Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a guy who's responsible for scouting the other team
through the Internet,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``He uses it
to read newspapers and check out Web sites for things like
injuries. There's a lot of information out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But is there too much information out there in dot-com land?
Some college coaches think so. Just ask LSU coach Gerry DiNardo.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, DiNardo closed his team's practices after
Georgia team video personnel told their LSU colleagues the Bulldogs
were able to access information about the Tigers' practices on
unofficial Internet sites. DiNardo said this information included
practice video and lineup changes as well as a tip that LSU was
working on a fake on-side kick. This disclosure, of course, came
after Georgia beat LSU 23-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were getting a lot of things. It's more serious than
depth chart movements,'' said DiNardo, who admitted he's looked at
opposing team Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   While some dismiss DiNardo's actions as a desperate move by a
coach trying to save his job (LSU has lost five in a row), he
insists the Internet has become as big a problem in college
football as bad officiating and four-hour games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is not just the info that gets out there,
it's also the speed with which it gets out,'' DiNardo said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNardo isn't the first SEC coach to complain about the
Internet. Two years ago, then-Auburn coach Terry Bowden asked one
of his school's unofficial Web sites to limit some of the
information they were putting on there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those Web sites are a great service for the fans,''
Bowden said. ``But they were putting up the kind of information
that our opponents wanted to know, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially critical when some Web sites willingly post
inaccurate information. For example, two weeks ago, a Web site out
of Tallahassee posted a story that said Florida coach Steve
Spurrier was considering taking the Notre Dame job.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous? ``Not when we got a call from the South Bend (Ind.)
paper wanting to know if there was any truth to it,'' said Norm
Carlson, a UF football publicist since 1963. ``That's the problem
with the Internet. You don't know if it's factual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet seems to be a bigger issue at programs with large,
loyal and passionate followings, such as Florida and Georgia. While
each school has its own official Web site _ Gatorzone.com and
Georgiadogs.com _ there also are several unofficial sites that are
more popular with fans because they provide chat rooms and they'll
post information such as rumors and recruiting updates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful Web sites in the nation is
GatorCountry.com, which gives Florida fans stories from every major
newspaper in the state, as well as a chat room and the popular
Swampie's Rumor Mill. Raymond Hines, who co-owns the site with Gus
Garcia, said Gator Country receives up to 300,000 hits a day during
the season and more than 1 million hits a day during recruiting
season.
</P>
<P>
   While Hines says he and Garcia make a profit off the site,
they're not getting rich from it. Moreover, almost all of the
writers who contribute do so for free or a nominal fee. They add to
the site out of their loyalty to the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Says Hines, ``Call us a virtual tailgating party where we all
chip in on the grill.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines said neither Florida officials nor Spurrier has asked
Gator Country not to put anything on the site. Hines disagrees with
the theory that sites like his hurt the Gators because it provides
too much, or inaccurate, information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all reported one way or another; we just beat most to the
punch because of the nature of our medium,'' Hines said. Most
coaches have adopted Lou Holtz's philosophy about the Internet:
``Love it or hate it, but get used to it,'' he said. ``Because it's
here to stay.''

 &HT;    Father of kidnapped kids takes crusade to Congress
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A kidnapper hid John LeBeau's infant
twins somewhere in Europe three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To get them back, the Palm Beach Gardens businessman traveled
30,000 miles on six trips overseas, hired lawyers and investigators
in three countries, learned international law himself, incessantly
badgered the U.S. government for help, spent at least $150,000, and
ultimately, with no small amount of luck, found the children living
in Britain with their abductor.
</P>
<P>
   She was also their mother and his estranged wife, Mette LeBeau.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon John LeBeau made another trip _ this time to
Washington _ where he described his ordeal to a U.S. Senate
judicial subcommittee that is studying international parental
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thought to be 10,000 of these cases now, but mine is
the only known one in which an arrest and extradition has been
upheld,'' LeBeau said. ``What I'm trying to accomplish is to show
the Congress someone who this problem has actually affected _ show
them a real parent who lost his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), is
considering whether foreign governments should be pressured to
return children abducted by parents. A spokesman for Thurmond said
the United States returns 90 percent of kidnapped children to other
nations but only 30 percent are returned here.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators have threatened to block foreign nations'
extradition requests unless they honor U.S. requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, the issue hasn't gotten much more than the old
Washington two-step,'' LeBeau said. ``We've had enough studies and
reports. What we need now is action and results.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1998, LeBeau's children, Luke and Ruthie, were
discovered with their mother in Portsmouth, England. A Danish
citizen, she had first taken them to Denmark. The three were
returned to Florida in December by British authorities after LeBeau
agreed to seek dismissal of the federal criminal kidnapping charges
against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Mette LeBeau gave up her fight for custody of the children in
Palm Beach County last spring and returned to Denmark, leaving them
with their father.
</P>
<P>
   John LeBeau, 40, an insurance agent and owner of a small medical
supplies company, has criticized federal officials for their
reluctance to treat parents who kidnap as criminals and pursue
their prosecution aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never did I encounter more hostility, ignorance, incompetence,
deceit and blatant unwillingness to protect our youngest American
citizens as I did with our own Department of Justice,'' LeBeau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has told the Senate Judicial
Committee her office often is hamstrung by the sovereignty of
foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the international arena, custody orders entered by state
courts in the United States are not enforceable outside of the
United States,'' Reno said. ``Furthermore, state or federal
criminal warrants reach only as far as our extradition treaties
take us and as far as the domestic law of our extradition treaty
partner permits.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 5, the twins turned 4 years old and LeBeau marked the
day by founding a nonprofit corporation that bears their name.
Working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children, the Ruth and Luke LeBeau International Child Rights
League will attempt to assist other left-behind parents through the
political and legal morass that LeBeau conquered with
two-and-a-half years of dogged persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome I had is virtually unheard of,'' he said. ``I want
to change that.''

3 LEARJET CRASHES EXAMINED AFTER GOLFER, 5 OTHERS, ARE KILLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Ohio, Mich., Ky., Fla., Kan., Texas)   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials investigating the mysterious
crash of a Learjet in South Dakota said they were scrutinizing
three other Learjet crashes in which the passengers and pilots may
have been incapacitated by a loss of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   No cause has been determined in Monday's crash, which killed the
golfer Payne Stewart and five other people, but investigators are
speculating that all on board were rendered unconscious, or even
killed, by a lack of oxygen. The plane, a Lear 35, flew 1,400 miles
on autopilot before nose-diving into a South Dakota hay field.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators gingerly removed debris Wednesday, the National
Transportation Safety Board's investigator in charge, Bob Benzon,
said in a telephone interview from Aberdeen, S.D., that his agency
was looking into the 1983 crash of a German-owned Learjet that flew
1,600 miles from Vienna, Austria, before crashing into the Atlantic
about 200 miles off Iceland, and into a crash in Mexico that
appeared to have been similar.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said its records showed that
a Learjet crashed on Jan. 18, 1980, in Ohio, on a flight from
Ypsilanti, Mich., to Louisville, Ky. Controllers reported that the
crew's speech had been slurred, a sign of oxygen deprivation.
Everyone on board was killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Though he acknowledged these similarities, Benzon cautioned that
``it might behoove us to note that oxygen deprivation isn't the
only thing that could have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Robert T. Francis, vice chairman of the safety
board, had said no one could recall a similar crash. But Wednesday,
Benzon said, ``It is interesting that in current memory, at least
for folks here, we couldn't think of any, and now a couple have
popped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash of the German plane seemed eerily similar. The Lear
25B belonging to a West German charter company, Air Traffic, took
off on a flight to Hamburg, but kept going. As the plane flew over
northern Europe, air traffic controllers were unable to make
contact with the pilots, and British, Dutch and U.S. military
planes were sent up to intercept the plane. Two Royal Air Force
jets caught up with the plane over Scotland, according to an
Associated Press report at the time, which quoted one pilot, Lt.
John Marr, as saying ``there was certainly no one in the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart's Lear 35, which left Orlando, Fla., on a flight to
Dallas, the German plane had enough fuel for four hours of flight
and crashed when that was gone.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said at the time that they believed that the crew
had probably been rendered unconscious or had died from oxygen
deprivation. U.S. officials said Wednesday that they had no
jurisdiction in the European case and that the plane had probably
not been recovered. A spokesman at the German embassy in Washington
said he could not determine Wednesday whether an investigation had
reached any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Benzon said that aviation experts were ``vaguely aware'' of a
similar case, in Mexico, involving a Learjet, but that he did not
know the date or other circumstances. A Learjet hit a mountain near
Hermosillo in January 1993, killing all seven people on board. But
an FAA spokesman, Eliot Brenner, said that that crash might have
been due to a loss of control unrelated to cabin atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner added that agency records showed that a Lear 23 had
crashed in Ohio on Jan. 18, 1980, and that the cause was probably
loss of air pressure in the cabin. The accident is too old to be
online at the safety board. The board keeps paper records on those
crashes but was unable to provide details late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Benzon said the German and Mexican accidents would be ``well
worth looking at,'' although he said that the crashes, especially
the German one, might not have been investigated thoroughly enough
to be of much help. He said that he had asked Learjet, one of
companies assisting in the investigation, to provide details on the
earlier crashes. A spokesman at Learjet's headquarters in Wichita,
Kan., David Franson, said that the only person in the company who
could answer the question was already at the crash site in South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Benzon said a valve that was part of the cabin
air supply system for the plane that crashed on Monday had been
replaced on Saturday. Investigators did not know whether Monday's
flight had been the first since the replacement, or whether the
maintenance had anything to do with the crash. ``It's a routine
maintenance type thing,'' Benzon said. ``We cannot make anything of
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have recovered about 25 percent of the wreckage,
Benzon said. They have not found the cockpit voice recorder.

PORTUGUESE RECALL AID TO SPANISH REFUGEES DURING CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMPO MAIOR, Portugal _ The long line of people, film extras
portraying refugees from the Spanish Civil War, filed into the
17th-century square of this Portuguese village of whitewashed
houses and secrets kept for six decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after so many years, we are trying to deal with our
ghosts,'' said Francisco Moita Flores, the scriptwriter for a
13-part Portuguese television series that deals with a little known
chapter of Portugal's role in the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene being filmed, the refugees are being gathered for
deportation to Spain and certain death. During the war, Portuguese
dictator Antonio Salazar supported the fascists led by Gen.
Francisco Franco.
</P>
<P>
   But despite great risks, many Portuguese in villages along the
750-mile border with Spain helped the refugees who fled the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stories of these events, whispered for decades in the
villages where they happened but little known in large cities like
Lisbon and Oporto, are being re-enacted for Portugal's state
television. The series, ``The Border of Fear,'' is scheduled to be
broadcast early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Moita Flores, who is also a sociology professor at the
University of Lisbon, grew up in the border town of Barrancos
hearing tales of Portuguese valor and deceit during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years he has interviewed 200 people for the
series, which portrays as heroes those who helped some of the
estimated 30,000 Spaniards who fled to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In Campo Maior, six miles from the border, Spanish refugees
arrived in August 1936, shortly after Franco's troops captured the
nearby city of Badajoz and executed many people who had fought for
Spain's elected republican government.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Silveira, 36, a co-owner of the Central Pharmacy in
Campo Maior, said her family furtively gave food and clothing to
the refugees, who sometimes hid in large ceramic tanks used to hold
wine or olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   A great-uncle, the late Joaquim Nabeiro, who Ms. Silveira said
made a living smuggling coffee into Spain, was the inspiration for
the main Portuguese hero in the series, although she said he never
used his talents to help Spaniards reach Portugal, as the
television hero does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here many people helped, although there was also a lot of
fear,'' Ms. Silveira said. ``But the human instinct to help was
what prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid was perhaps all the more surprising because of the long
history of rivalry and bloodshed between Portugal and Spain. But
the border areas had long been linked by family ties and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese who took risks to provide assistance did not
worry about the political affiliations of the refugees, said Ana
Nascimento, 66, a municipal employee. ``Everyone was helped,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred local people have worked as paid extras for the
crowd scenes, including a few who actually aided the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But Filomena Goncalves, an actress who stars in the series and
who is married to Moita Flores, said not all local residents were
enthusiastic. ``Some didn't want to work as extras because they
refuse to relive those things that hurt them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moita Flores hopes that the series will help young people in
Portugal learn a part of their history neglected even after the
military rebellion that overthrew Marcello Caetano, the successor
to Salazar's dictatorship, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But Jorge Paixao da Costa, the director of the independent
production, said it would not necessarily make a huge impression on
the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewers are going to get some more information,'' he said,
``but I don't know if they will be touched. Nowadays people are
into the Internet. If the series is interesting and entertaining,
they will think about it a little.''

   `The Legend of 1900' sails along &QL; 
with intriguing shipboard tale &QL; 
By Valerie Kuklenski, Staff Writer
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain probably would have liked ``The Legend of 1900.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest from Giuseppe Tornatore (writer-director of the
Oscar-winning ``Cinema Paradiso''), ``The Legend of 1900'' is a
mostly upbeat story with the kind of tall-tale embellishments and
maritime setting Twain would spin.
</P>
<P>
   The numerical title is not only the year the film's story begins
but also the name of the main character.
</P>
<P>
   An infant boy born aboard a trans-Atlantic ocean liner in
January 1900 is abandoned in a lemon crate in the ship's ballroom.
He's discovered by a stoker, Danny Boodman (Bill Nunn), who
informally adopts the baby, gives him the cumbersome name Danny
Boodman T.D. Lemon 1900, and raises him in the sweltering, sooty,
noisy belly of the Virginian.
</P>
<P>
   After Danny dies in an accident, the captain learns about 1900
and considers turning him over to the authorities. But one night,
the 8-year-old boy wanders up to first class and reveals himself to
be a piano prodigy. Instead of being kicked off the liner, he's put
to work playing in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, an American trumpeter named Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince),
who has been narrating the story, joins the band. His first few
nights on board are turbulent ones, but 1900 (by now played by Tim
Roth) relieves Max's misery with what may best be described as a
(BEGIN ITAL)pas de piano(END ITAL). It's a whimsical scene aided by
Tornatore's creative camera angles and Ennio Morricone's wonderful
music.
</P>
<P>
   Max and 1900 become best friends, with an awestruck Max watching
as 1900 improvises everything from rags for the first-class
passengers and tarantellas for steerage to a haunting melody
inspired by 1900's first glimpse of a captivating young immigrant
woman (the very appealing Melanie Thierry).
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Ragtime''-style twist, Tornatore has added a historic
figure for extra spice. Jelly Roll Morton, the self-proclaimed
inventor of jazz, has heard the Virginian's pianist described as
the world's greatest, so he books passage and smugly challenges
1900 to a piano duel. That scene is a real show-stopper, and
Clarence Williams III is great as the fuming, egomaniacal Morton.
</P>
<P>
   All this time, 1900 never has left the ship. Contrary to the
common view, he feels continents are infinite (``Did you see the
streets? There were hundreds of them. How do you choose just
one?''), while the open sea represents security, even familiarity.
The faces of the passengers and crew change, but at least there are
only 2,000 of them at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Max is destitute in London, reluctantly selling his
beloved trumpet. In the music shop, he comes across 1900's only
recording, a now-cracked platter of his haunting love song. Max
starts to tell the shopkeeper about 1900, and in the process learns
that the Virginian, used as a hospital ship during World War II, is
now a rusted-out hull slated for imminent demolition.
</P>
<P>
   Max tries to halt the blasting of the ship, certain that his old
friend is hiding on board.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Legend of 1900,'' Tornatore has risen to the challenge
of his first English production, masterfully handling a script
peppered with Jazz Age vernacular and the witty profundities that
translate into any language.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, best known for playing heavies in ``Reservoir Dogs'' and
``Pulp Fiction,'' does fine work in this understated role. Vince, a
familiar face from ``Heavy'' and ``Nobody's Fool,'' plays Max with
the right mix of vulnerability and courage. While he cuts an Oliver
Hardy-type figure, there's no buffoonery about him.
</P>
<P>
   The only major shortcoming in the performances by Roth, Vince
and Williams is that they might have worked harder to fake playing
their instruments, or Tornatore and his editor might have given
them a break with fewer shots of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the real star of the film is the music,
most of it composed by Morricone. He previously collaborated with
Tornatore on ``Cinema Paradiso,'' but his work has been familiar to
American audiences since Sergio Leone's 1960s spaghetti westerns
such as ``A Fistful of Dollars'' and ``The Good, the Bad and the
Ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   The music of ``The Legend of 1900'' is so rich with rag tunes,
lively early jazz and mood-setting ballads that the film truly can
be enjoyed with eyes closed. But keep them open the first couple of
times. &QL;

 &HT;    Borland's integrity stood out in personal life, courses
 &HT;    By Alan Tays
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the fairways, pro shops and 19th
holes of South Florida's golf courses, Bruce Borland's name didn't
often come up in conversation. But in the offices of the area's
many golf course designers, he was well-known and well-respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the top professionals in our industry,'' said
Gene Bates, a Palm Beach Gardens-based course designer.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County is home to some of the most famous names in
golf course architecture, including Tom and Jim Fazio, Pete Dye and
Joe Lee. Then there are the player/designers: Jack Nicklaus, Greg
Norman, Gary Player _ all have offices here.
</P>
<P>
   But golf course design isn't a one-man business. Behind the
famous names are dozens of others who do the same work but don't
shine in the spotlight. They're called design associates. Within
the business they get plenty of respect. Bruce Borland of Jupiter,
one of six people killed in a plane crash Monday that also took the
life of PGA Tour player Payne Stewart, was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the Fazios and you have Greg Norman and you have
Nicklaus,'' said Bates, who works with Johnny Miller and Fred
Couples, ``but there are a lot of other guys who are not that well
known, but they do just as good work and do work in as broad a base
as the big guys do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the Tom Fazios that haven't been recognized yet. They
probably fit in the same profile as what Tom Fazio did 15 years
ago. When Tom Fazio worked for George Fazio (Tom's uncle), nobody
knew who Tom was, although he was kind of the guy behind the scenes
doing all the leg work, all the detail work and putting together
plans and specifications. He's really the technician. He's the guy
who makes the boat float.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland, 40, was a senior design associate at Nicklaus Design in
North Palm Beach, where he had worked since 1990. Chris Cochran,
another Nicklaus senior design associate, knew him all that time,
``and I shared an office with Bruce or sat next to Bruce for the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took no shortcuts,'' Cochran said. ``He was very, very
thorough, excellent with the client. Everybody he worked with knew
they were dealing with someone with a lot of integrity, and you've
got to have that. You've got to win people's trust out there.
They've got to believe in you. They've got to believe in your
motives. He was a very good architect, really good with people. He
loved the game and he understood shot values and strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he and Borland used to travel to Asia quite a bit
for the company. ``I had the work in Thailand and China and Bruce
did a lot of the Indonesian work,'' he said. ``And he did some
excellent work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran cited two of Borland's projects, new courses in Orlando
and Missouri, as evidence of his expertise. The Missouri course, he
said, ``is going to win a lot of kudos. Bruce's work, although it
was always very good, was getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Whitten, golf course architecture editor for Golf Digest and
Golf World magazines, said he was impressed by a course Borland did
at Hilton Head, S.C., called the Golden Bear Golf Club at Indigo
Run. ``The one that impressed me the most,'' Whitten said, ``is the
one that he did with (PGA Tour player) Glen Day a couple of years
ago called Salem Glen. ``It was really, really well done and it
showed a lot of talent for fitting something into a tough site.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland was known in the business for having been one of the
first to utilize computers in golf course design.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in getting into CAD _ computer-aided design _ was
just starting to surface when I left Nicklaus Design in 1988,''
Bates said. ``And they really needed somebody who could grab hold
and implement it, somebody who had the knowledge and the patience.
That's where I think Bruce really stood out, because he was a very
patient person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates left Nicklaus two years before Borland was hired, but the
two ran into each other often. ``We've traveled on the same
airplanes several times,'' Bates said. ``We had a lot of
opportunity to share time on the airplane and talk about our
projects. We talked about how good a man Nicklaus is and how good
he was to me, and Bruce was really excited about how he was treated
in the Nicklaus organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel is the common denominator for course designers, no matter
which company they work for. Jason McCoy, president of Greg Norman
Golf Course Design, ran into Borland recently while having lunch
near his office in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just talking about the amount of travel that we have
to do in our business,'' McCoy said, ``and how that was the only
drawback to it. Pretty ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland learned to play golf as a boy, practicing his swing in
the backyard of his Peoria, Ill., home, said Lee Antonio of
Chicago, sister of Borland's wife, Kate. Cochran said he and
Borland used to play together at the Golden Bear Golf Club at
Hammock Creek in Palm City and Bear Lakes Country Club in West Palm
Beach. ``Bruce was anywhere between an 8 and an 11 handicap,''
Cochran said. ``He was a lot of fun to play with.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio recalled meeting Borland while at the University of
Illinois. He was a waiter for Alpha Phi, the sorority house to
which Lee and Kate belonged in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Waiters were chosen by the sisters of Alpha Phi, and candidates
had to go through rigorous interviews to get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was charming, driven and confident,'' Antonio said.
``That's why we chose him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Kate met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a terrific love affair,'' Antonio said. ``And I never
had a brother, so he was the brother that I never had.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his busy work schedule, Antonio said Borland still found
time to be a wonderful father to sons Daniel, 13, Thomas, 12, and
Benjamin, 10, and daughter Elizabeth, 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embraced his family,'' Antonio said. ``He would go to all
of his children's after-school activities, like their diving meets.
And he's taken them golfing since they could hold a stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Borland had planned to fly commercial as late as Sunday night,
Antonio said, but switched plans to fly with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services will be held at 4 p.m. Thursday at the First
United Methodist Church, 815 E. Indiantown Rd., Jupiter. Gifts in
lieu of flowers may be sent to one of three funds: Palm Beach
Community Church, Bruce E. Borland Building for Life Fund, 3970 RCA
Blvd., Suite 7009, Palm Beach Gardens, FL 33410; First Union
National Bank, Memorial Fund for the Benefit of the Bruce E.
Borland Children, 2000 PGA Blvd., Suite 2200, Palm Beach Gardens,

TEAR GAS AND A SHOOTING IN BETHLEHEM CAST A SHADOW ON MILLENNIUM
PLANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank _ Street battles engulfed the entrance to
Bethlehem Wednesday for the third day in a row, casting a shadow
over preparations for millennium celebrations in the town revered
as the birthplace of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   From morning until dusk, Palestinian youths enraged by the
killing of a local man by an Israeli soldier on Monday hurled
stones at helmeted troops guarding Rachel's Tomb, a holy site on
the outskirts of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses carrying Christian pilgrims were turned back and
forced to take circuitous routes into the Palestinian-ruled city as
the main road into town became a rubble-strewn battleground
shrouded with clouds of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen Palestinians were reportedly injured by the gas and by
rubber-coated bullets fired by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been rising in Bethlehem in the past week, fueled
by concerns that Israel is trying to spoil Palestinian plans to
make the city a showcase for the millennium celebrations _ a claim
strongly denied by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli plans to build a new checkpoint at the entrance to town
with a separate entrance for Palestinians set off a student protest
last week that turned violent when it was repelled by Israeli
soldiers who fired tear-gas to disperse the march.
</P>
<P>
   The students complained that the beefed-up checkpoint would cut
off Bethlehem from the rest of the West Bank while segregating
Palestinians from Israelis and foreign tourists. Israeli officials
said that the new arrangements were merely intended to ease tourist
traffic into the city and the passage of Palestinian laborers
through the checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting on Monday of a local souvenir vendor by a
soldier at Rachel's Tomb set off the latest unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said the man had tried to stab the soldier, but
Palestinians who said they had witnessed the shooting asserted that
it was unprovoked and that the soldier was visibly distraught after
firing the fatal shot, apparently in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Nabeel Kassis, the coordinator of the Palestinian Authority's
Bethlehem 2000 Project, accused the Israelis of setting off the
unrest at a time when they should be trying to lower tensions,
weeks before the start of the millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel should have considered measures to eliminate sources of
friction,'' he said. ``If Israel keeps reacting in that fashion,
this can be interpreted as an attempt by the Israeli side to spoil
the Bethlehem 2000 celebrations for us. How else can we see it? The
millennium celebrations are not only for us. Israel also stands to
gain from the influx of tourists to the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephraim Sneh, the Israeli deputy defense minister, accused the
Palestinian Authority of failing to curb the street riots, which
have gone unchecked by the Palestinian police. The televised scenes
of unrest will only drive away potential pilgrims, hurting the
Palestinians most, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they cancel their trip, tell me who will lose more?'' Sneh
said. ``If there was a strong will on the part of the Palestinian
Authority, they would stop it. Believe me, they know how to do it
better than we do. They have to explain to their people that they
are shooting themselves in the leg. This is a test of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   The clashes Wednesday began after a crowd returning from the
funeral of the man killed, Musa Abu Hilayel, 29, pelted soldiers
with stones. Hundreds of chanting mourners had marched behind the
flag-draped body of Abu Hilayel, who was buried as a martyr while
Palestinian officers fired a salute.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of his death remained in bitter dispute. The
commander of Israeli forces in Bethlehem, Col. Marcel Aviv,
asserted that Abu Hilayel was shot after he lunged at a soldier
with a knife that was later found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   But Imad Madbuh, who owns a garage across the street, said that
the soldier had called over Abu Hilal and asked for his
identification card, and as the Palestinian reached for his back
pocket he was shot. The soldier looked stunned, Madbuh said, and
shouted ``What have I done!'' as he was led away by his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence Wednesday at the entrance to Bethlehem, it
was business as usual downtown. Groups of pilgrims walked through
Manger Square as work continued apace on new road-building and
construction projects for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Workmen swept freshly-laid flagstones on Milk Grotto Road, which
has been transformed into a picturesque lane lined with quaint
street-lamps and turquoise shop shutters and doors. Cranes towered
over building sites, including a new multi-tiered parking lot and a
central bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Walking with her husband in a group of American pilgrims, a
visitor seemed unfazed by the trouble at the entrance to town. ``We
just trust Him to take care of us,'' she said.

HOUSE OK'S BAN ON DOCTORS PRESCRIBING DRUGS FOR SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doctors would be banned from prescribing narcotics
to help patients commit suicide, even if their state laws permit
it, under a bill approved by the House on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 271-156, effectively would overturn an
Oregon law allowing doctor-assisted suicide, and would supersede
similar provisions being considered in other states. Its passage
irked officials in Oregon and was fought by several medical
associations, which oppose federal involvement in defining medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters in Congress hailed the bill as a victory in the
battle to guarantee respect for human life. The House Judiciary
Committee chairman, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, said the bill
``emphasizes the alleviation and management of pain, not reversing
the role of doctor from healer to hangman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to add executions to the list of healing services
they provide?'' said Hyde, who sponsored the bill. ``Should Oregon
law trump federal law?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will take up a similar measure in coming weeks if its
schedule permits, and several key Republican senators have given it
their support. Supporters of the measure, including the American
Medical Association, favor provisions that would encourage doctors
to use narcotics to ease the pain of dying patients, including a $5
million grant to medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill would encourage pain management, even if the use''
of narcotics ``to do so unintentionally hastened death,'' said
Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who is a
physician.
</P>
<P>
   That provision is a variation from a bill introduced last year,
which some opponents said would make doctors afraid to prescribe
any narcotics to ease pain. To allay those fears, the House bill
explicitly states that doctors would not be punished for treating a
patient with controlled drugs, even if the patient died.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Justice Department have also endorsed the
bill's efforts to promote better patient care. But the department,
which officially opposes doctor-assisted suicide, denounced a
portion of the legislation that would criminalize the practice. In
an Oct. 19 letter, an assistant attorney general, Robert Raben,
said the bill ``would unquestionably make physician-assisted
suicide a federal crime with harsh mandatory penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Raben said in the letter, ``would affirmatively
interfere with state policy-making in a particularly heavy-handed
way, using 20-year mandatory prison sentences (as well as civil and
administrative sanctions) to effectively preclude states from
adopting any policy that would authorize physician-assisted
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon became the first state to permit doctor-assisted suicide,
but only after a lengthy court battle, two public referendums and a
1998 decision by Attorney General Janet Reno to allow the use of
certain controlled drugs for euthanasia. Oregon's law went into
effect almost two years ago, and 15 people used the provision to
commit suicide within the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, several other states, including California, have
debated similar legislation. But the Hyde bill would make such
state laws irrelevant, because it would forbid doctors from
prescribing lethal doses of federally controlled substances, which
are the most common drugs patients use to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors found guilty of prescribing such doses, if the bill
becomes law, could face criminal sanctions, including long-term
prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law already forbids the use of federal funds to pay for
doctor-assisted suicides, and most doctors and medical associations
say they are opposed to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of organizations object to what they said was an
unnecessary intrusion of the federal government in medical
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael D. Cantor, the chairman of the compassionate care
committee of the Massachusetts Medical Society, said the
organization opposes the bill because it would have a ``chilling
effect on prescribing adequate medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We object to the federal DEA intruding into the practice of
medicine and defining what is good medical care,'' Cantor said of
the Drug Enforcement Agency. ``The DEA should not be regulating
medical practices in Massachusetts, and I think other states agree
with us.''

 &HT;    Trilogy sues online car-sales rival
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Competition for online car sales has been fierce
so far. It could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Trilogy Software Inc. is suing a rival of its
CarOrder.com subsidiary, accusing the company of using a method of
doing business it invented three years ago and patented last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a suit filed in federal court in Austin, Trilogy claims
patent infringement and asks for a permanent injunction and damages
from CarsDirect.com Inc. of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and one of its
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the latest in a string of business method patent
disputes between big-name companies with competing e-commerce
sites, but this one has a distinctly Austin flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Trilogy launched CarOrder.com in January and is investing $100
million in the company. CarsDirect.com is backed by several big
names _ including Michael Dell, who invested $10 million in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   CarOrder.com plans to buy up failing auto dealerships and turn
them into distribution centers. CarsDirect.com works with existing
dealerships to fill online orders for new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trilogy's patent covers a method by which online shoppers choose
the features and options they want when ordering a car from
CarOrder.com. The system, the patent states, functions as an online
auto salesperson, helping buyers choose the configuration of their
next car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is technology that Fortune 500 companies pay $50 or $100
million for,'' said Brian Stafford, CarOrder.com's president. ``We
want to make sure that we're doing whatever we can to protect and
enforce that.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CarsDirect.com was not available for comment
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Trilogy claims CarsDirect.com improperly used
methods covered by its patent. Trilogy claims it warned the company
that it was infringing on its patent, but CarsDirect.com did not
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford would not discuss the details of the lawsuit other than
to say that the patent ``is in regards to the way a vehicle is
configured.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to gain an edge on their competitors, Internet companies
have overwhelmed the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with patent
applications in the past two years, causing the agency to hire
hundreds of new patent examiners. The earliest of the patents that
were granted are now being asserted and in some cases litigated.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, e-tailing giant Amazon.com filed a suit alleging that
rival bookseller barnesandnoble.com had copied a feature on its
site that saves shoppers' billing and shipping information so they
don't have to re-input it on return visits. Earlier in the month,
airline-ticket auction site Priceline.com sued Microsoft Corp. on a
similar patent infringement claim.
</P>
<P>
   While patents for Internet business methods are fairly new, one
Austin attorney who isn't connected to the suit said Trilogy's case
could be a strong one. Not only does its patent include 85 specific
claims on its patent, it appears to cover more than just methods
for selling cars on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of leverage put on the defendant to settle the
matter by ... taking a license on the patent and paying a royalty
to the patent holder,'' said Kelly Kordzik, a patent attorney at
Winstead, Sechrest &AMP; Minick in Austin.

Ben Crenshaw arrived at Champions Golf Club on Wednesday morning,
as planned.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what he hadn't planned on were the circumstances under which
he would arrive. This was intended to be a grand visit, the
triumphant Ryder Cup captain getting together with a majority of
his team to rehash and relive the greatest Ryder Cup comeback in
the history of golf.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a chance for Crenshaw to mingle with the
masses who weren't fortunate enough to be at The Country Club last
month, and soak up the glory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Crenshaw spent his morning standing on the Champions
driving range, talking quietly with his fellow PGA Tour players,
exchanging hugs and handshakes, and trying to cope with the
stunning news one of his boys was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be with these guys,'' Crenshaw said. ``I wanted to
talk to them. The best we can do is talk and be with one another.
We need to talk about it. I know I think about it every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw was in his car in Austin on Monday when his cell phone
rang. It was Crenshaw's wife, Julie, who told Ben he needed to come
home. The news, she said, was not good. Someone in a private plane
was in trouble, and she believed it was somebody they might know.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Crenshaw returned home, he had learned Julie was
right. Payne Stewart, a member of Crenshaw's 1999 Ryder Cup team,
was on the plane that eventually would crash into a field in South
Dakota. All six people on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Crenshaw has been in a daze, not sure what to do or
how to cope. Except he instinctively knew he needed to be with his
other family, the golfers on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens this close, we don't know
what to do,'' Crenshaw said. ``It was so sudden. This guy was a big
part of our lives. I can't believe we're not going to see him
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So Crenshaw headed to Champions to see those who would
understand his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a family,'' he said. ``We play an individual game,
but we're with each other all the time. And when something like
this comes around, we support each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said he was having trouble believing he wasn't going to
turn around somewhere and see Stewart, decked out in his knickers,
grinning at him. And yet the reminders that he was gone were
everywhere, from the black ribbons on the caps of the players to
the piles of flowers at Stewart's parking spot in the Champions
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, for one, couldn't imagine having to play a golf
tournament this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be so rough, from focus to concentration to
everything,'' he said. ``It's bewildering. You have a tournament of
this importance, and yet you are fighting such a lot of things.
It's going to be a search out there for these guys. I know every
one of these guys is thinking about Payne every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said two incidents always will stand out in his mind as
examples of the kind of golfer, and kind of man, Stewart was, and
both came from last month's Ryder Cup. One was when Stewart
conceded the final hole to Colin Montgomerie after the United
States already had won the Ryder Cup. And the other came before the
Sunday round started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the match even began, Payne told Colin that if he could
help him out in any way with the fans, he wanted to,'' Crenshaw
said. ``That shows how considerate he was.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Crenshaw said, is what he will remember most when
thinks of Stewart.

BRAZIL WANTS MCI TO PAY $550 MILLION IN BACKTAXES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a clash that is heightening concern over
Brazil's treatment of foreign investors, the government is seeking
to levy hundreds of millions of dollars of back taxes and fines on
the Brazilian unit of MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's tax agency told MCI that Embratel, a long-distance
company it acquired last year for $2.3 billion when Brazil
privatized its telecommunications monopoly, was responsible for 1.1
billion reais, or about $550 million, in back taxes. The liability,
it said, came from tax money due on international calls made when
the company was still controlled by the government.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom replies that it received assurances from
authorities before it purchased Embratel that it would not be
responsible for its tax liabilities as a state company. Brazilian
officials acknowledge this was how they advised the company at the
time, but they say tax authorities have since interpreted the
matter differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were specifically told in writing that the taxes would not
be an issue,'' said Daniel Crawford, MCI Worldcom's vice president
for ventures and chairman of Embratel. ``So sure, we are
disappointed. We're taking the issue to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the tax bill, following a recent move by a
Brazilian state government to reverse the $1 billion privatization
of its electric utility in a dispute with two U.S. utilities,
Southern Co. and AES Corp., has generated anxiety over Brazil's
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
   Itamar Franco, an outspoken former president of Brazil and these
days governor of Minas Gerais, Brazil's second-largest state, won a
legal victory on Tuesday after a state appeals court upheld an
earlier ruling stripping AES and Southern of their ability to veto
some decisions by the management of Companhia Energetica de Minas
Gerais, the utility in which they are minority partners. The case
is expected to reach the highest appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   After the events in Minas Gerais, the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia
issued a statement saying that investor confidence in Brazil could
be shaken. Although the incidents there seem somewhat isolated, and
related to the political style of Franco, who shook the markets at
the beginning of the year when he declared a debt moratorium, the
American government has intervened to try to solve the problem of
MCI Worldcom's tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil's communications minister, Joao Pimenta da Veiga,
questioned recently by Commerce Secretary William Daley, said the
government's hands were largely tied. ``I told him, like I'm
telling you, that there can be no doubt we acted in good faith in
the entire process of selling Embratel,'' Pimenta da Veiga said in
a telephone interview. ``We are so convinced of this that if MCI
doesn't want Embratel anymore, we'll buy it back from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But selling Embratel back to Brazil could be more costly than
paying taxes because the currency in which MCI paid for Embratel,
the Brazilian real, has since weakened significantly against the
dollar. ``This isn't a serious option,'' Crawford, the MCI vice
president, said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the conflict between MCI Worldcom and Brazil is a
government hungry for tax revenue as it grapples with a estimated
budget deficit of 100 billion reais, or $50 billion. Tax
authorities, led by Everardo Maciel, the head of the revenue
service, have even fined large state-controlled financial
institutions to show that they mean business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tax and political concerns, the appetite for
Brazilian state assets still appears healthy, judging from the
results of a privatization auction conducted here today.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly undaunted by its problems in Minas Gerais, AES Corp.
agreed to pay about $470 million for a controlling stake in
Companhia Geracao de Energia Eletrica Tiete, an electricity
generator sold by the state of Sao Paulo. AES exceeded a bid of
$381 million by the Belgian utility Tractebel.

DOW AND S&AMP;P BOTH RALLY BUT NASDAQ FALLS SLIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After slumbering through much of the session, stocks
sprang to life in the final hour Wednesday to carry two of the
major averages to solid gains.
</P>
<P>
   There was no particular development to touch off the rally,
which left the Dow Jones industrials with a 92.76-point gain, to
10,394.89, but analysts said strength in the bond market seemed to
suddenly stimulate bargain hunters as the market awaited two
crucial economic reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling around that the bad news on the bond market
may be over, with the yield on the long bond contained under 6.5
percent,'' said Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment strategist at
S.G. Cowen Securities. The rate on that benchmark eased to 6.32
percent from 6.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 did even better than the Dow, climbing
14.80, or 1.15 percent, to 1,296.71. The Nasdaq market, however,
slumped on weakness in Internet and other computer-related shares.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, the biggest Internet auctioneer, dropped 13 5/16 to 138
11/16 following its profit report late Tuesday that some found
disappointing. Amazon.com, which reported after Wednesday's close,
lost 5 5/16 to 75 15/16 during normal trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks led the rally in blue chips, with J.P. Morgan
up 7[ to 128{, American Express up 5~ to 150| and Citigroup up 2
13/16 to 51 5/16, accounting for the bulk of the 0.9 percent
advance in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But investors also found value in some heavy-industry stocks
that offset a 9|-point plunge, to 67, for Hewlett-Packard on
analysts' concern that the computer maker's sales and profits will
be shy of forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these groups have been beaten up pretty badly,'' said
Timothy M. Stevenson, a portfolio manager at Meridian Investment in
Malvern, Pa. He said bargain-seekers were prominent in betting on
financial stocks in advance of the government's reports Thursday on
third-quarter employment costs and gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas M. Galvin, chief strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said the markets are braced for another hefty rise in the
Employment Cost Index and contended that, if it proved benign for
inflation, stocks could rally further.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy soon shows further signs of slowing from the
unsustainably rapid third-quarter growth rate of about 4{ percent
expected to be reported Thursday, the Federal Reserve might even be
dissuaded at its Nov. 16 policy meeting from raising short-term
interest rates for a third time since midyear.
</P>
<P>
   Home sales have already softened, consumer confidence has
slipped and Wednesday the government reported the first decline in
orders for long-lived factory goods in five months.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock group that bargain-hunters fastened on was the
airlines, which also benefited from a Wall Street prediction that
Continental Airlines will curb its growth next year, reducing an
oversupply of seats. UAL jumped 3{ to 65\, AMR 3] to 59 11/16 and
Continental 1} to 38 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Of the stocks to be removed from the Dow industrials on Monday,
Sears, Roebuck and Union Carbide rose by fractions, Goodyear Tire
and Rubber lost another 15/16 to 40 5/16 and Chevron surged 1~ to
89~ after raising its dividend.
</P>
<P>
   CVS, the drug chain, slumped 4{ to 39 after disclosing lower
profit margins while the JNI Corp., which makes computer equipment,
soared to 42 from 19 in its initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 950.1 million
from 878.4 million as advancing issues led declines by 1,739 to
1,311. New 52-week lows, however, swamped new highs by 248 to 30.

 &HT;    New BellSouth service keeps unwanted callers at bay
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth today will start offering Atlanta-area
customers what the company says is the ultimate weapon in the arms
race between consumers and unwanted callers.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Privacy Director,'' telemarketers phoning at dinner,
unwanted relatives and office calls to vacationers may no longer
get through _ in fact, they won't even ring the consumer's phone _
unless callers either identify themselves or their number.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of new technologies for phones in the past few years
has spurred a competition between consumers wanting to know who's
calling and callers trying to slip in under the radar.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the phone companies are arming to collect from both
sides, but Privacy Director could provide the impenetrable defense,
said Terry L. Yarbrough, BellSouth assistant vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' he said. ``This product finally puts the
customer totally in control of incoming calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is intended for people to use with caller ID, which
identifies the number of most callers _ but not all. Many consumers
rely on caller ID to screen calls or at least to prepare them for
whoever is on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me, I always answer a call, but I want to
know who is calling,'' Yarbrough said.
</P>
<P>
   But callers using phones in large companies, callers who have
blocked the ``delivery'' of their phone numbers and some others _
especially those on wireless phones _ will often be listed by a
caller ID device as ``unknown'' or ``private number.'' About 9
percent of residents have their numbers blocked _ which can be done
for free _ often because they do not want their number picked up
when they call a business.
</P>
<P>
   But a resident who picks up the phone is deprived of the
knowledge that caller ID is meant to provide.
</P>
<P>
   So Privacy Director is engineered to stop callers with private
or unlisted numbers. Because the call is stopped at BellSouth
central offices, the consumer's phone hasn't even rung as the
electronic sentry asks the caller to stand and identify himself. If
the caller has a number that has been blocked, he or she is offered
the option of unblocking it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone rings and the consumer hears the caller's
recorded identification. If it is an unwanted telemarketer, the
consumer can press a button sending a recorded message that asks to
be added to the telemarketer's ``no call'' list. Or the consumer
can convey a recorded announcement that says, in effect, not now,
call later.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the consumer can also accept the call and only then
is the caller connected.
</P>
<P>
   Other regional phone companies, including Ameritech and US West,
have versions of the service. BellSouth, which now offers it in
South Florida, plans to extend Privacy Director to the rest of its
nine-state region next year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that offer competitive local service, like MGC
Communications in metro Atlanta, already match most features
offered by BellSouth. They are likely to add this one, too, either
by building their own systems or, more likely, reselling the
BellSouth version.
</P>
<P>
   The features themselves account for an increasing portion of
phone company revenues. Customer demand is clearly strong. Nearly
30 percent of Georgians have the $34-a-month Complete Choice
package, which includes 22 services, Yarbrough said.
</P>
<P>
   Installation of Privacy Director costs $20. After that, it is
$5.95 a month _ but with Complete Choice, it is only a penny per
month. BellSouth prices services to make the package more
attractive. By itself, Caller ID costs $7.50 per month, and call
waiting is $4.50.
</P>
<P>
   Most people still answer their phones the old-fashioned way _
without knowing who is calling. But the trend is swinging toward
knowledge. About 1.1 million lines _ 40 percent of BellSouth's
residential customers _ now have caller ID in Georgia, Yarbrough
said. ``This underscores how important privacy is to customers and
that is what this is all about.''

 AMAZON.COM SAYS ITS LOSSES MAY GROW IN 4th QUARTER  
 (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.Com, by far the biggest merchant on the Internet,
reported Wednesday that its losses in the third quarter were
slightly less than analysts had expected. But the company also
warned that it planned to lose far more than it had previously
indicated in the fourth quarter, as it tripled its spending on
marketing and advertising to compete vigorously this Christmas
season.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy indicates how quickly Amazon has moved from David
to Goliath. When it started in 1995, it was an upstart bookseller
taking on Barnes &AMP; Noble. Now it offers a wide range of
merchandise, including electronics, and it hosts auctions and
storefronts for other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it is now hearing footsteps. Jeff Bezos, the
company's founder and chief executive, said Amazon had to defend
itself from the hundreds of newer Internet stores, flush with cash
from venture capitalists and public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is watch ``Alie McBeal'' to see that every
commercial is a dot-com company,'' Bezos said in a conference call
Wednesday with analysts. ``We don't know if we need to triple our
marketing spending, but we know we don't want to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon declined to reveal how much the marketing blitz would
cost, but analysts estimated it would be well in excess of $100
million in the next three months. Much of the spending, Bezos said,
would be in the form of discount coupons, typically in the form of
electronic mail messages, inducing its customers to make purchases
in its newer product areas.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Amazon has become the archetype of the classic Internet business
model: Lose lots of money to grow very quickly. But even as other
Internet pioneers, like Yahoo, have started to make a profit,
Amazon's losses have continued to widen _ even as its sales and
customer base make it a big business in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the company lost $197 million on sales of
$356 million. A year earlier, it lost $45 million on sales of 154
million.
</P>
<P>
   This year's third-quarter loss included $111 million in costs
the company said were one-time charges related to acquisitions,
investments and stock-based compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding these charges, on an operating basis, the company lost
26 cents per share. That is slightly better than the 28 cent loss
that analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts Wednesday expressed frustration that Amazon
had significantly changed its forecast for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had indicated that their losses would decline, ever so
slightly going forward,'' said Lauren Levitan, an analyst with
Robertson Stevens. ``Now they tell us that won't be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's stock, which fell $5.31 to $75.93 in trading Wednesday
on the NASDAQ, fell even further in after-hours trading, to $72.75.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with repeated questions by analysts about why the company
was not moving more quickly toward profitability, Bezos said that
the company keeps discovering new business lines it wants to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we go into this, the more we find new things to
do,'' he said. ``We think it would be really foolish to slavishly
commit to plans we made in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company did say that, in the fourth quarter, it expected its
book business in the United States to become profitable for the
first time, and that products other than books would likely
approach half of all sales.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts seized on that prediction _ the first ever in which
Amazon used the word ``profit'' _ as some consolation to investors
who are wearying of Amazon's ever widening losses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If you can see books are profitable, you may be willing to
believe the model works and they will be able to duplicate this in
other areas,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget said he expected the company's shares to decline
further, as all but the true believers among investors get out of
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have said from the very beginning they are going to
invest everything for the long term,'' he said. ``If you think this
is just words, then sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon said it expected sales to increase ``significantly'' in
the fourth quarter, but it also predicted that that gain will be
entirely offset by the increase in marketing spending and
additional increases in the cost of inventory, warehouses, and
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon is spending more than $300 million to build seven
automated warehouses around the United States. Bezos conceded that
warehouses would not be operating at peak efficiency and that the
company would have to cover the delays by paying for express
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it had nearly quadrupled its inventory
from the beginning of the year, to $118 million, and would increase
it even further to make sure it had goods on hand for the Christmas
peaks.
</P>
<P>
   While Bezos conceded that if the company's forecasts were wrong,
it might have to take big mark-downs to sell excess inventory, he
added, ``We want to minimize the risk we will let down customers.''

final details for a special command post in Colorado to insure that
potential Year 2000 computer glitches in either nation's missile
warning systems do not lead to an accidental launching of a nuclear
warhead.
</P>
<P>
   After suspending cooperation to protest the U.S. bombing of
Yugoslavia this spring, Moscow relented and has agreed to cooperate
on the command post at Peterson Air Force Base, in Colorado
Springs, where Russian officers will sit side-by-side with U.S.
colonels to read data flowing in from U.S. radar sites and
satellites around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be feeding the data straight back to Russia and the
Russian officers will be in direct contact with their leadership
back in Moscow,'' said Air Force Maj. Perry Nouis of the U.S. Space
Command.
</P>
<P>
   The post will be ready in November, said Nouis, and 20 Russian
officers will arrive for duty Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The final details on the joint operation were worked out in
September, when Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev signed a
statement of intent with Defense Secretary William Cohen to set up
the Joint Strategic Stability Center during the Year 2000
transition period.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem refers to computers programmed to read only the
last two digits of a year, which could malfunction when they
misinterpret computer commands for 2000 as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Pentagon reviewed all of the potential Y2K
problems that Russia might encounter and decided that the greatest
danger lay with the country's deteriorating early warning system.
In the worst case, Russia's outdated computer technology might send
a false alarm that the country was under attack, leading to a quick
nuclear retaliation, according to Defense Department officials and
Russian nuclear experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia is on a hair trigger with a very short period of time
to assess information coming from their radars and satellites,
which are notoriously unreliable,'' said Bruce Blair, an expert on
Russian nuclear command at the Brookings Institution. ``We don't
want that to happen and we want them to have an alternative source
of information.``
</P>
<P>
   Peterson Air Force Base is in the shadow of Cheyenne Mountain
Operations Center, where the United States tracks missiles around
the world through radar and satellites. The highly classified
information will be fed into the new center for Russians and
Americans to view together on large monitors 24 hours a day, seven
days a week at least through the middle of January, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The central question is whether the Russians will believe the
data from Colorado if it conflicts with information coming in from
their own systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, my concern is that this is too little, too
late,'' said John Pike, the director of programs at the American
Federation of Scientists. ``The Russians had asked that the data be
fed directly to Moscow and not through the new joint center in
Colorado to make sure the information isn't somehow massaged.
That's a question of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even before concern over the Y2K problem arose, the Russian
early warning system was in disrepair and falsely interpreted an
innocent launch as an attack. In 1995 Norway launched a scientific
rocket that was misinterpreted by the Russian early warning system,
and President Boris Yeltsin was notified that a nuclear attack was
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were eight minutes into this scenario of a countdown _
that's two minutes away from their deadline to decide whether to
retaliate against the United States,'' said Blair of Brookings
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the same thing happened during the turnover into the year
2000, the question of trust will be paramount, according to Blair,
who has conferred with the Russians who will participate in the
joint center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize how perverse it will be if their system says
they are under attack but the information from the United States _
the adversary _ says they are not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No other country will be involved in the joint center, since
Russia and the United States are the only two countries that
operate elaborate satellite and ground radar systems to track
missile launchings worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The joint center at Peterson Air Force Base could continue
through the spring if both countries believe that computer problems
remain unsolved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After that, the two countries plan to set up a permanent center
for collaboration outside Moscow where they will continue to share
early warning data to avoid a ghastly nuclear mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided it's a good idea to be talking face to face
during this period and in the future,''` said Nouis.

 &HT;    Special probe in Ramsey case turned down
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Colorado Gov. Bill Owens announced Wednesday he will
not appoint a special prosecutor in the JonBenet Ramsey case, but
he had harsh words for the girl's parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could speak to John and Patsy Ramsey,'' Owens said at a
news conference, ``I'd tell them to quit hiding behind their
attorneys, quit hiding behind their PR firm, come back to Colorado,
(and) work with us to find the killers, no matter where that may
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter whether he believes the Ramseys are
responsible for the death of their daughter, the governor
responded, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Some remarks left the Ramseys shocked and disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just in shock. I can't even think,'' Patsy Ramsey said,
according to her friend Linda McLean. ``Now who's going to catch
the killer of my daughter?''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after a Colorado grand jury completed its probe
without issuing indictments, Owens said the case remains in the
right hands. So it will remain the responsibility of the police
chief and district attorney in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Owens added, ``There is reasonable belief that more than one
person was involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments by the governor infuriated people close to the Ramseys,
who saw the remarks as veiled indications that the state's chief
executive sees the Ramseys as responsible for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   McLean, who lives in Patsy Ramsey's hometown of Parkersburg,
W.Va., took exception when Owens said: ``The killers in this case
made some serious mistakes, but they are also very smart. They have
stonewalled effectively and covered their tracks well.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean felt Owens purposefully linked his remarks on the
Ramseys' resistance to those of the killers ``stonewalling
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Branding Owens ``a slanderous jerk,'' McLean said, ``I don't
have nasty enough words in my vocabulary for him.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean said she spoke to Patsy Ramsey after the televised news
conference. ``She said she had not watched it, so I told her,'' she
said. ``I just slapped her in the face with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Ramsey was speechless at first, McLean said, adding that
the Ramseys had high hopes that Owens would intervene to straighten
out the case. McLean asserted that the Ramseys have cooperated in
the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Six-year-old JonBenet was found dead in her family's Boulder
home Dec. 26, 1996. Investigators identified her parents as being
under suspicion. No arrest was made.
</P>
<P>
   Owens acknowledged that early mistakes in the investigation
would make any case ``harder to prove in court.'' But he added that
``substantial new evidence'' is currently being analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   But William Pizzi, a University of Colorado law professor,
thinks the investigation has reached the end. ``I think it will
remain unsolved,'' said Pizzi, a former federal prosecutor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Until last month, Michael Loebl greeted his
monthly electricity bill in much the same way as his taxes: too
high, yet beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. After being bombarded by television commercials and
billboards from aspiring competitors, he dropped Frankfurt's
longtime electric monopoly, Mainova AG, and signed up with an
upstart, Yello Strom. He expects the annual power bill for his
modest row house to drop from about $860 to less than $700.
</P>
<P>
   But that is peanuts compared with the possible savings at his
sporting goods store, Sport Loebl, in downtown Frankfurt. Hamburg's
city-owned utility, as part of a direct attack on rivals in
Frankfurt and other cities, is promising to slash the store's
annual bill by around 40 percent, from $18,000 to $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is not the first country to open its electricity market
to competition. But nowhere has the deregulation been as radical or
the resulting price wars as fierce as here.
</P>
<P>
   A number of American states, including California and New York,
have deregulated electric power in ways that primarily benefit big
corporate customers, but competition for residential customers
remains minimal.
</P>
<P>
   And while most countries that have opened their markets have
done so gradually, Germany abolished all its restrictions in a
single move, in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the most brutal and maybe chaotic development
in the marketplace I have ever seen,'' said Heinz Dieter Waffel, a
managing director at Preussen Elektra AG, a unit of Veba AG and
Germany's second-largest utility.
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale electricity prices _ the prices that local utilities
pay for power _ have plunged as much as 60 percent in the last
year. Corporate customers are getting reductions of 30 percent and
more, often without even switching providers. But the most
surprising competition has been for ordinary household consumers
like Loebl. Electric companies are marketing electricity in
department stores, on television and over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil is all the more unusual because Germany has been
known for rigid regulation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, prices here had a long way to fall. Before the price
cuts began, German electricity was more than twice as expensive as
in the United States and pricier than any other European country
except Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The price wars have been compounded by other factors. For one
thing, Germany is awash in excess generating capacity. And its
central location in Europe has made it a magnet for imports of
cheap power from France, Scandinavia and Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany is like a copper plate _ electricity flows in all
directions, and there are no bottlenecks,'' said Lynn Reinhardt, an
energy analyst at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Though customers receive electricity over only one set of
electric lines, they can order their power from more than a dozen
different companies, which pay transmission fees to various
electrical grids and deliver it from their generating plants to
specific customers.
</P>
<P>
   The competition in Germany has already ignited several huge
mergers, and more are on the way. Veba is merging with Viag AG of
Bavaria, the nation's third-largest utility, in a $14 billion deal.
RWE AG, Germany's biggest power company, is negotiating to acquire
a big regional provider called VEW AG. Both Veba and RWE are on the
prowl for more acquisitions in Germany and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The shockwaves are reverberating across Europe. Electricite de
France, owned by the French government, is aggressively exporting
electricity to Germany from its low-cost nuclear plants and is
seeking to acquire German utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's big power producers are returning the favor. Desperate
to offset steep price declines with higher exports, they are
setting up shop in neighboring countries and hunting for foreign
companies to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts predict a painful shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ruinous competition,'' said Ms. Reinhardt of Merrill
Lynch. ``They are all talking about increasing revenues and market
share, but market share is irrelevant to shareholders. What matters
to shareholders are profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil will almost certainly force utilities to shut some
of their unneeded power plants, and labor union leaders have warned
that as many as 40,000 jobs could be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The competition may also accelerate a shift from coal-fired
plants to natural gas and other sources. German coal, still
protected by subsidies, is more expensive than many other sources.
</P>
<P>
   One particular problem is eastern Germany, where the government
prodded west German utilities to build huge, ultra-lean coal-fired
power plants after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. But those
plants are being financed in part by higher electricity prices,
which are now unsustainable. In a compromise reached this week, the
big West German utilities pledged to buy up excess eastern
electricity while the eastern plants pledged to cut costs and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The competition also complicates the country's desire to abandon
nuclear energy. Although the government has vowed to shut down its
nuclear plants at some point, the deregulation appears to have been
a bonanza for imports of cheap electricity from French nuclear
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Even Germany's biggest power companies are scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   RWE predicts that its prices will decline 10 percent next year;
that translates into a $1 billion reduction in revenue. Just to
make up lost revenue on the household side of the business,
analysts estimate, RWE would have to add six million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is overcapacity in the German market of about 30
percent,'' said Michael Zerr, chief executive of Yello Strom, a new
consumer-marketing subsidiary formed by Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg,
the nation's fourth-largest power company. ``At that level, you
have two possibilities: you can hold on as long as possible with
higher prices and just let the business decline, or you could be
proactive.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Smaller utilities are worried that they will be forced out of
business. Many have already urged both the courts and the
government to shield them _ so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   At a street protest in Duisburg last month, utility workers
donned skeleton masks to dramatize their fears.
</P>
<P>
   The big producers have been worrying, too. Aghast that rivals
were wooing some of its biggest industrial customers, RWE offered
all its midsize customers an automatic price reduction of 30
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and analysts say Germany's deregulation was
more radical than that in any other country.
</P>
<P>
   Though American consumers have far lower rates than their German
counterparts, prices in states proceeding with deregulation
continue to be inflated by surcharges demanded by state regulators.
The surcharges, which have been applied in most other countries,
too, are intended to let utilities recover ``stranded costs'' _ the
costs of power plants built when prices were regulated that could
not operate profitably in an open market. By contrast, German
officials did not bother, deciding instead to let all utilities
sink or swim on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The German utilities' first big battle was for big industrial
customers, much like what had occurred in the United States,
Britain and Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   But then something very different took place: an outbreak of
competition for ordinary household consumers as bloody as the
battle in the United States for long-distance telephone customers.
</P>
<P>
   RWE, based in Essen, introduced the first nationwide sales
campaign for household consumers on Aug. 1, offering a flat rate of
22.3 pfennigs (12.1 cents) a kilowatt hour for those willing to pay
a monthly fee of 9.97 marks ($5.42). This was a small reduction for
RWE, but well below the going rates for some of the new territories
it hoped to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Zerr, who had quietly begun organizing Yello Strom in April,
fired back a few days later, offering a rate of 19 pfennigs a
kilowatt hour with a 19-mark monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Zerr also started an eye-catching advertising blitz proclaiming
that the ``color'' of electricity was yellow. Playing off the
English word ``yellow,'' Zerr promoted Yello's image as a bright,
quirky upstart that would also deliver a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   RWE responded with advertisements contending that the color of
electricity was blue _ the color of its logo.
</P>
<P>
   The German word for blue _ ``blau'' _ is also slang for
``drunk,'' however, and Yello gleefully responded with ads that
essentially said: ``I know the color of electricity is yellow. I'm
not yet drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Since August, other utilities have dropped their prices and
started rival offers that quickly became as confusing as the claims
of American long-distance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are offering ``green'' electricity, which
costs more but is supposed to come exclusively from renewable
energy sources like hydroelectricity and windmills.
</P>
<P>
   Mainova, which serves Frankfurt, is among those offering a
``green plan''; it also has a ``classic'' plan for light users and
a ``plus'' plan for heavier users. Elektra Direkt, a new retailing
arm of Preussen Elektra, offers both a ``family'' plan and a
``single'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   Early evidence suggests that only a small percentage of
household and commercial customers are switching electric
companies. But that is partly because of the pre-emptive price
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell where the money will be made _ in households,
industrial or commercial establishments,'' said Waffel of Preussen.
But ``to optimize your portfolio, you have to be present in all
those segments.''
</P>
<P>
   Several American companies have taken an active interest in all
this. One is the Enron Corp., a big wholesale trader of electricity
in Europe that helps procure power for industrial customers and
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who have really taken advantage of the choice in the
market have seen prices fall by well over 30 percent and frequently
as much as 50 percent,'' said John P. Thompson, Enron's general
manager in Frankfurt. ``Everybody, even us, has been surprised by
how swiftly this market has moved.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the search for salvation through expansion into other
markets, the fierce race is on among big German companies to buy up
private and state-owned utilities, both inside and outside the
country. And the rush is on to set up sales offices in countries
like Poland, Italy and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   A major source of tension is France, which actively exports
inexpensive electricity but has so far defied a directive from the
European Union to open its own market to competition.
</P>
<P>
   That is not likely to last long. Most analysts expect that
cross-border competition in electricity will only increase. ``This
is not just a German issue,'' Thompson of Enron said. ``This is now
very much a European picture.''

SPENDING BATTLE CONTINUES AS CLINTON TAKES CREDIT FOR RECORD
SURPLUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government posted a record $123 billion
budget surplus this year as President Clinton and the Republicans
continued their battle Wednesday over Year 2000 spending
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the upper hand in budget talks with GOP leaders, Clinton
claimed credit for the surplus _ the largest in real dollars terms
since 1951 _ in a White House announcement.
</P>
<P>
   He cited his 1993 deficit reduction program as the catalyst for
what has become the largest economic boom in U.S. history. Not a
single Republican in Congress voted for that package of tax
increases and spending cuts, which Clinton insisted was necessary
to help retire the national debt, which at that time was about $260
billion.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president's 1993 program kicked
off seven straight years of gradual deficit reduction, making it
the longest sustained economic recovery in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   But despite claiming most of the credit, Clinton also praised
Republicans for their contributions to the 1997 budget agreement,
which led last year to the nation's first balanced spending plan
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have closed the book on deficits and opened the door on a
new era of economic opportunity,'' Clinton said, noting that U.S.
workers and businesses have benefited from lower interest rates and
a reduced national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, eager to claim their own share of credit, cited
their efforts to cut federal spending and reduce taxes as a major
contributing factor to the government's black ink this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when Republicans take care of the
government checkbook and hold the line against tax hikes and more
spending,'' said House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked the first time since the Eisenhower
administration that the government had posted back-to-back annual
surpluses. The last time was in 1956-57. The 1998 surplus was $69.2
billion and this year's figure of $123 billion exceeded the Office
of Management and Budget estimates by nearly $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly all the surpluses have come from Social Security
taxes paid by working Americans. Only about $1 billion in surpluses
have been generated from other sources, although $14 billion more
is expected from other revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   The government now has more money on hand than at any time in
history, Clinton and Republicans are having a hard time spending
much of it because of their pledge not to raid the Social Security
Trust Fund. If they leave the huge pension account alone this year,
it would be the first time in decades that at least some government
programs have not been financed by Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Congress borrowed $30 billion from a
Social Security surplus of $99.2 billion. After that money was
earmarked to other government programs, the surplus entered into
the books at the end of the year was $69.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats accused the Republicans again Wednesday of
producing appropriations bills for fiscal year 2000 that will spend
about $18 billion in Social Security money, despite the fact that
they are borrowing from future budgets and using accounting
techniques to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been putting out false information about not using
Social Security money,'' House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., complained to reporters Wednesday. ``This is the big lie
...They are using Social Security ... and they know it.``
</P>
<P>
   To make good on their promise not to raid Social Security, House
Republicans plan to vote today on a bill to fund education, labor
and health programs that contains a one percent across-the-board
cut in spending. It also includes a one percent reduction in the
$8,000 pay hike lawmakers gave themselves earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had proposed to cut spending 1.4 percent
across-the-board without reducing their own salaries. But they
changed that idea after Clinton said he would veto it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans plan to delay the release of about $7.5
billion to the National Institutes of Health until Sept. 29, the
day before the fiscal 2000 year ends.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, who serves on the Appropriations
Committee, criticized that move as ``unacceptable and unworkable''
because it would interrupt or kill the release of much-needed NIH
grant money to a number of Texas medical facilities, universities
and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, he said the delay could affect up to 40,000 NIH
grants that are normally awarded early in the year, leading to
layoffs and delays in time-sensitive research programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen called the delay ``typical of the gimmicks the
Republican majority is using to evade the 1997 spending caps and
conceal the fact that they are spending Social Security
surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican leadership aide, however, labeled the complaint
``complete hogwash'' and noted that NIH officials had ``signed off
on it.``
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically putting controls on when they can award grants
to control the rate of spending. What's wrong with that? The
money's still going to be there, it just won't be there when
they're used to having it,'' the aide said.

GOVERNOR SAYS RAMSEY CASE WILL STAY IN LOCAL HANDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Colo.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ After consultation with the officials investigating the
1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey, Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
Wednesday that ``substantial new evidence'' had convinced him that
there was no need to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the
case from the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the investigators are moving closer to proving
their case,'' Owens said in explaining why he believed that a
special prosecutor would prove disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   His decision came as something of a surprise in that efforts to
solve the crime seemed to stall two weeks ago when Alexander M.
Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, said evidence
presented to a grand jury was not strong enough to bring charges
and dismissed the grand jury after 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking at a news conference outside his office, Owens
offered new insights into the investigation, saying the new
evidence had not been presented to the grand jury and that the
authorities were ``targeting the right suspects,'' the first
official confirmation that investigators believe more than one
person might have been involved in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also became the highest-ranking public official to
criticize JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, for resisting
efforts seeking their cooperation in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After characterizing the killers as ``very smart'' in that they
have ``stonewalled effectively and covered their tracks well,''
Owens was asked what he would say to the Ramseys, who now live in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``If I could speak to John and Patsy Ramsey, I'd
tell them to quit hiding behind their attorneys, quit hiding behind
their PR firm, come back to Colorado, work with us to find the
killers in this case no matter where that trail may lead.''
</P>
<P>
   After a reporter suggested that those were strong words for the
Ramseys, whom Hunter has identified as suspects, Owens said
sharply: ``While, in our system, they are innocent until proven
guilty, as a parent, as the father of a youngster who is the same
age as JonBenet, I think that they could have and should have been
more helpful than they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor was then asked, if he was ``implicitly saying John
and Patsy Ramsey, in your view, are in all likelihood responsible''
for their daughter's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' Owens replied.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response, the Ramseys accused the governor of
grandstanding. They said: ``Owens' slanderous remarks pander to the
fringe lynch mob which long ago cast aside the time-honored
presumption of innocence. Coming from a public official elected to
the highest office of this state, his comments are
unconscionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys asserted that they had offered to provide
information to Owens and his legal advisers but that the offer was
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, a 6-year-old veteran of beauty pageants, was found
strangled and beaten in the basement of her home in Boulder on Dec.
26, 1996. Her death became an instant worldwide murder mystery, the
subject of several books and a television movie now in production.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have conceded that the investigation was
compromised, in large measure, by mistakes the police made in the
early hours after the girl's body was found. Hunter said as much
the day he dismissed the grand jury, and Owens repeated the point
today, saying the case would be ``harder to prove in court because
of the initial mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was chiefly for those reasons that the governor brought
together a team of seven legal experts, including the Colorado
attorney general, Ken Salazar, to consider the option of appointing
a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting that option in favor of local investigators, he
addressed the killers directly and said: ``They will keep pursuing
you. And I am confident that each day brings us closer to the day
when you will reap what you have sown.''

SPEEDING UP THE FIBER-OPTIC HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., N.Y., Ill.)   (af)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the race for greater bandwidth and faster Internet access,
fiber-optic lines have been hailed as the ultimate speedway, able
to transmit information at virtually the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   But there has always been one problem. Whenever that information
moves from one computer or network to another, it runs into an
electronic bottleneck. The switches that route the information are
not based on optical technology, but instead use electrical
components. To move through the switches, the signals carried by
photons must be converted into electronic signals and then
converted back to photonic signals to continue along the fiber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you convert backward and forward, you lose
information, and it costs money,'' said Lawrence Gasman, president
of Communications Industry Research, which follows trends in fiber
optics. ``The goal of everyone now is the all-optical network.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies have been working for years to
create switches that will make that all-optical network possible at
low cost. Getting light to change direction precisely and without
losing energy is one of the technical hurdles. Size and scale also
pose problems.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a switch that moves light from one channel to another
is easy compared to the challenge of switching light at different
wavelengths through thousands of different channels.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, new technological breakthroughs appear to be
bringing researchers closer to a practical solution. Bell
Laboratories, the research arm of Lucent Technologies in Murray
Hill, N.J., is using microelectricalmechanical systems, known as
MEMS.
</P>
<P>
   Its optical switches use silicon chips tiled with micro-mirrors,
each one small enough to fit on the head of a pin. When a voltage
is applied to the chip, the mirrors are pulled up or down in
response. The result is a tilting motion that can redirect light in
three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can steer the light from any input fiber to any output
fiber,'' said Dr. David Bishop, head of MEMS research at Bell Labs.
The device carrying the switches, Bishop added, could be the size
of a grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., is also developing optical
switches. Its prototypes include liquid crystal displays that can
be turned on and off to route light from one fiber to another.
``Liquid crystal technology has no moving parts, which is big
advantage,'' said John Bayne, product-line manager for optical
switches at Corning.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Corning demonstrated a device based on this
technology that could route information between as many as 80
channels at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a new company called Nanovation stepped into the
ring. It introduced a line of optical-switching components that are
based on research conducted at Northwestern University. Its
switches, it says, are the smallest yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about devices the size of a human hair,'' said
G. Robert Tatum, the company's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic switches could be created in bulk at very low cost,
Tatum said, because only small specks of material would be used in
manufacturing each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our devices will allow immediate access to the fiber at much
faster speeds,'' Tatum said.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation's technology has some skeptics, however. Engineers
for other companies say privately that they will believe it when
they see it; they are not convinced that the wave-guide technology
will actually work.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation has not given any public demonstrations, officials
say, because the switches are too tiny to see without specialized
equipment. But they add that the company has given demonstrations
to clients and investors in its nanofabrication laboratory at
Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind the switches is based on channels for the
passage of photons called wave guides. In the laboratory,
Nanovation engineers use an electron-beam lithography system to
etch these wave guides onto tiny wafers made of indium phosphite or
gallium arsenide, substrates that are commonly used in optical
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The wave guides look like deep ravines arranged in patterns of
circles and straight lines. The circles act as exit ramps that
redirect the light and create, in essence, an optical switch.
</P>
<P>
   One critical element of these wave guides, Nanovation's
engineers say, is the smooth surface of the walls. As long as the
surface is smooth, light is not deflected in the wrong direction
and lost during its movement through the channel.
</P>
<P>
   Two researchers at Northwestern _ Seng Tiong Ho, a engineering
professor, and Mee Koy Chin, who is now Nanovation's director of
technology _ invented this approach, which they call ``strongly
guided'' wave-guide technology.
</P>
<P>
   Nanovation licensed the technology and produced its first
optical chip in April. The chip includes 16 switches etched upon a
wafer that measures less than 250 microns, or about the size of a
few strands of human hair, on each side. Since these switches are
so minute, thousands of them can be integrated within a chip the
size of a thumbnail.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which approach wins in the battle for best optical
switch, consumers may be reaping the benefits in the next few
years, analysts say. Bandwidth may become wide enough and fast
enough to make Internet multimedia like video teleconferencing
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now, we'll be switching huge amounts,
mind-boggling amounts, of bandwidth,'' said Bishop of Bell Labs.
``There are untold riches to be made for the company that figures
out how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of optical switches could also clear vast amounts of
space in the equipment closets at traditional phone companies.
Currently, phone companies are saddled with cabinets full of
equipment to switch signals among copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they may be able to go to completely optical
networks, depending instead on devices the size of breadboxes, or
smaller. That is, once they are willing to dispose of the bulkier
switches they have relied on for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will cut down on costs,'' said Sean Buckley, an editor of
optical newsletters published by the Information Gatekeepers Group.
But, Buckley said, it may not happen right away: ``Local phone
companies don't just want to rip out what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatum of Nanovation is more optimistic. In a few years, he said,
the all-optical network could be a reality, with fiber running
straight into homes and onto desktops. ``We're making it efficient
enough,'' Tatum said, ``to have fiber optics go straight to the
PC.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Gunmen proclaiming a coup d'etat stormed the Parliament
in Armenia's capital city of Yerevan on Wednesday evening, killing
the nation's prime minister, Parliament speaker and other officials
before claiming to seize about 50 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The police sealed off the building, and President Robert
Kocharian rushed there to negotiate with the assassins, who said
they might release a videotape detailing their demands.
Negotiations continued through the night as two armored personnel
carriers took up positions on the Parliament grounds. The president
directed operations.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports on the number of gunmen, and
their motive was not immediately clear. Nor were there any
indications that a coup had actually taken place. An Armenian
journalist who was in the chamber at the time said one of the men
cried that they had ``come to avenge those who have drunk the blood
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said the group, said to number from two
to five, were mentally unstable terrorists without known political
ties. But others said the slogans shouted by the attackers
suggested they were nationalists opposed to peace talks over a tiny
ethic Armenian enclave in neighboring Azerbaijan that has been the
focus of Armenian-Azeri warfare and politics for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than many fragments of the old Soviet Union, tiny Armenia _
with a population of about 3.8 million and about twice the size of
Connecticut _has had an uneasy transition to the post-Communist
era.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle with Azerbaijan has kept Armenia in turmoil. Just
last year, the president was forced out of office because critics
believed he was making too many concessions in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting on Wednesday, one of the assailants, speaking
to local television station, said: ``This is a patriotic action.
This shake-up is needed for the nation to regain its senses.'' He
added that the country ``is in a catastrophic situation, people are
hungry, and the government doesn't offer any way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts of witnesses and a grainy Armenian television tape of
the shootings appeared to show that the gunmen, clad in trenchcoats
that hid Kalashnikov automatic rifles, burst into the chamber as
three government officials _ Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian,
Speaker Karen Demirchian and possibly Finance Minister Levon
Barkhudaryan _ were at the rostrum. As people in the chamber fled
or ducked for cover, Sarkisian was repeatedly shot at close range.
The gunmen then fired on top government officials who had been
sitting front row. Many top officials were apparently
present for a question period involving the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Armenian television channel A1Plus said eight people had
died in the attack, including Sarkisian, Demirchian, his deputy,
Yuri Bakhshian, and the minister of operative management, Leonard
Petrosian.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia's health minister, Gike Nikogosian, was quoted as saying
that the finance minister and another deputy were likely dead as
well, but that could not be confirmed. The number of wounded was
also uncertain, but some reports put the number at 50.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 hours after the shooting, according to reports by The
Associated Press, the gunmen released three hostages _ two members
of Parliament and a member of the cabinet _ apparently for medical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the attack began about 5:15 p.m. (9:15 a.m., ET).
Journalists in the chamber were later ordered outside by one
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister, quoted by a Moscow television reporter,
described the gunmen as in a state of possession. And the Russian
minister for relations with former Soviet states, Leonid
Drachevsky, said he agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a psychiatrist is needed _ professional
negotiators from the special services who would calm them down,''
he said on Russian television on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much speculation centered on the likelihood that the
killings were related to the bitter territorial dispute between
between Armenia and Azerbaijan and possibility of a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The territory, called Nagorno-Karabakh, is part of Azerbaijan
but has been under the rule of Armenian separatists since an ethnic
war there in the late 1980s and early 1990s killed 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence in 1988, and separatists
drove out Azerbaijan troops. In 1994, a truce was signed, but
sporadic fighting has continued.
</P>
<P>
   President Kocharian's predecessor, Levon Ter-Petrosian, won
office in 1996 in a suspect election, then tried to consolidate his
power by arresting opponents and banning some opposition parties.
It was Sarkisian _ then the defense minister _ who helped him by
sending tanks into the streets to put down post-election protests.
</P>
<P>
   Ter-Petrosian was forced to step down last year because critics
believed he was making too many concessions in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian, a nationalist and Karabakh political leader, named
Sarkisian as the prime minister, vowed to stiffen Armenia's stance
in peace negotiations, and pledged to move the nation toward a
market economy. But in the minds of many citizens, the reverse has
happened: the economy has staggered and peace negotiations have
progressed under his rule.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and the United Nations have been deeply
involved in talks to settle the dispute, and the United States is
reported to have promised Azerbaijan political support and foreign
aid in exchange for settling the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's principal troubleshooter in the former
Soviet Union, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was in
Yerevan on Wednesday for consultations on the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute. He left the country about an hour before the shootings and
was seen off at the Yerevan airport by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At least one indicator bolstered speculation that the attack was
aimed at destabilizing peace negotiations between the two nations.
Reporters identified the gunman who escorted them from the
Parliament as a member of an extreme nationalist party, the
Armenian Revolutionary Federation, known as Dashnak, whose goals
are said to include restoring Armenia's borders to their historic
boundaries. Centuries ago, an Armenian empire stretched from the
Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation
disassociated themselves on Wednesday night from the massacre. They
said one of the gunmen, who identified himself on local television
as Nairi Unanian, worked in the party's press office in 1990 but
has not been there since.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Khachatryan, an adviser to the interior minister, said in
an interview on Russian television that three of the attackers had
been identified as two brothers and their uncle, one of whom lived
in Ukraine's Crimea before returning to Armenia in 1998. But he
offered no clue as to why they made the attack.

HELMS ORDERS 10 WOMEN FROM HOUSE OUT OF A SENATE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jesse Helms, the hard-nosed chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, ordered Capitol police officers
Wednesday to remove 10 female House members from a Senate hearing
after he said they were disrupting the meeting by trying to present
him with a letter supporting an international treaty against the
discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., has blocked a Senate vote on the 1979 U.N. accord
and declined to meet personally with treaty supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The minor uproar began when Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California led
the group of women, all House Democrats who were accompanied by
some aides, from a Capitol Hill news conference to Helms' Senate
office and then to a nearby hearing room, where he was leading a
meeting on the Clinton administration's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   The group entered quietly, seeking to give Helms a placard-size
letter signed by 100 members of Congress in support of the
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
Against Women. The pact has been ratified by 165 countries, but not
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, Helms gaveled the hearing to a halt and scolded Ms.
Woolsey _ ``Please be a lady'' _ before ordering uniformed officers
to ``Escort them out!''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the women expressed shock at the treatment from
Helms, who is notoriously tough but also assumes a courtly air with
women who appear before his panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he was asking us to be ladies, he could have been more
gentlemanly in treating us like colleagues in Congress,'' said Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of California.
</P>
<P>
   The tempest marked the latest episode in a rocky week for Helms.
Last week, he made clear that he opposed the nomination of Carol
Moseley-Braun to be ambassador to New Zealand. Democrats seized on
the comments about Ms. Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected
to the Senate, to accuse Helms and others of racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, decried the
chairman's actions, saying, ``If they were kicked out of a hearing
of the Congress, that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms, Marc Thiessen, disagreed, saying, ``They
came into a Senate hearing and disrupted it, holding placards and
yelling across the room at the chairman, and so they were removed
like any other protester would be.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the hearing showed Helms halting the testimony
from Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hearing on China and we have guests who are not
interested in that,'' said Helms, who seemed unsure who the House
members were. ``They want to demonstrate on another issue. I hope
the security people will escort them out in the corridor and let
them wait there.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, Ms. Woolsey asked the chairman to
accept their letter, but he cut her off with a bang of his gavel.
</P>
<P>
   She tried again, but Helms gaveled her silence. ``I would not be
discourteous to you where you work,'' he said. ``Now you please be
a lady. Escort them out! Escort them out!''
</P>
<P>
   After the women filed out, Helms turned to Cox and chortled,
``Heh, heh, some of your colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Not missing a beat, Cox responded: ``I thank you, senator. It's
much easier to get order in this hearing than it normally is on the
floor of the House of Representatives.''

<P>
   &LR; CAMARILLO _ Ever have one of those days when no matter what you
do, it just isn't enough?
</P>
<P>
   Officers of Camarillo-based Power-One Inc. had one Wednesday,
when their company reported a 165-percent jump in sales and
earnings 2 cents higher per share than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, their company's stock took a huge hit on the
apparently favorable news, losing more than 36 percent of its value
in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst J. Keith Dunne of Robertson Stephens Securities in San
Francisco attributed the stock slide to ``a little bit of an
overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of an understatement, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said the market reacted to the projection that Power-One's
scheduled sales in the fourth quarter will be $1.7 million less
than the $61.2 million the company sold in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of shares outstanding, the price drop
represented a $225 million reaction to a projected $1.7 million dip
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get for setting sales records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplistically speaking, the investors apparently wanted every
quarter to be better than the previous quarter,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark is whether Power-One's turns business _
its unscheduled sales _ will make up the difference, Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Schnopp, Power-One's chief financial officer, said the
company told analysts and investors during its earnings conference
call it expected sales in the fourth quarter to be flat or slightly
down compared with the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that was a very conservative estimate for the fourth
quarter,'' Schnopp said. ``Maybe we were too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company plans to give the market time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at some point in time, it will come to its senses,''
Schnopp said.

   &LR; CAMARILLO _ Ever have one of those days when no matter what you
do, it just isn't enough?
</P>
<P>
   Officers of Camarillo-based Power-One Inc. had one Wednesday,
when their company reported a 165-percent jump in sales and
earnings 2 cents higher per share than analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, their company's stock took a huge hit on the
apparently favorable news, losing more than 36 percent of its value
in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst J. Keith Dunne of Robertson Stephens Securities in San
Francisco attributed the stock slide to ``a little bit of an
overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of an understatement, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne said the market reacted to the projection that Power-One's
scheduled sales in the fourth quarter will be $1.7 million less
than the $61.2 million the company sold in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of shares outstanding, the price drop
represented a $225 million reaction to a projected $1.7 million dip
in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get for setting sales records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplistically speaking, the investors apparently wanted every
quarter to be better than the previous quarter,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark is whether Power-One's turns business _
its unscheduled sales _ will make up the difference, Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Schnopp, Power-One's chief financial officer, said the
company told analysts and investors during its earnings conference
call it expected sales in the fourth quarter to be flat or slightly
down compared with the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said that was a very conservative estimate for the fourth
quarter,'' Schnopp said. ``Maybe we were too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company plans to give the market time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at some point in time, it will come to its senses,''
Schnopp said.

RESEARCHERS DECODE HUMAN GENOME REGION RELATING TO DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Researchers have decoded a region of the human genome
that may prove to be one of the main repositories of disease genes.
</P>
<P>
   This area of the genome has been the focus of intense research
as scientists have sought to unravel the secret of why some people
get certain diseases and others don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three decades, (researchers) have been studying this small
part of the genome,'' said geneticist Dan Geraghty, a researcher at
Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and co-author of
the paper. ``It's so important in that it (governs) one of the
body's frontline defenses against pathogens.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequencing information, which is being published in
Thursday's journal Nature, was done by a consortium of scientists
who had been competing with each other to be the first to publish
the sequence, but elected instead to publish as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists in the consortium included Lee Rowen, Marta
Janer and Leroy Hood at the University of Washington, H.Inoko of
Tokai University School of Medicine in Japan, and Stephen Beck of
The Sanger Centrein England.
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of more than 300 genes, called the MHC, is located
on a tiny fraction of the body's sixth chromosome, but it is one of
the most densely loaded with genes that help protect or predispose
the body to disease.
</P>
<P>
   The MHC is associated with more diseases than any other region
of the human genome, including most, if not all, autoimmune
conditions, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be many people looking forward to having
that whole sequence in the public domain,'' said Rowen, research
scientist in the Multi-megabase sequencing center at the UW .
``It's so gene-rich, it will allow people to do further biology.
There's quite a gold mine of discovery still to be had there.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions believed to be influenced by genes in the MHC region
range from cancer and autoimmune diseases to reading and sleeping
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new knowledge should rapidly lead to straightforward and
accurate diagnostic tests based on actual gene sequences,''
Geraghty said. ``This should make it easier for doctors to
influence the progression of some diseases by giving lifestyle
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Such genetic testing will give doctors the means to tell people
in advance whether they are predisposed to get certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetic testing is going to be one of the most important
diagnostic tools that a doctor has in a matter of one to two
decades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raises social questions. Privacy experts are
concerned, for example, that such information could lead insurance
companies to exclude people from coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, society is going to have to deal with the
privacy issues, Geraghty said. ``People will have to find a way to
separate an individual's medical record from insurance company
calculations.''
</P>
<P>
   An individual's genetic information belongs to the individual,
he said. ``It should be used by them for their own benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the sequencing information gives
researchers a powerful new tool for developing better treatments
for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to certain disease-predisposition genes, for
example, the MHC region also contains the key genes that determine
whether two people are compatible for an organ or bone marrow
transplant, leading researchers to believe they will be able to
fine-tune and improve the matching process.
</P>
<P>
   And about 40 percent of the MHC genes are believed to be
involved in regulating aspects of the immune system, including the
body's ability to distinguish between its own tissues and foreign
pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   Without that fundamental ability, the body turns on itself,
creating a host of ``autoimmune'' diseases, ranging from rheumatoid
arthritis to multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the way the MHC genes help control the immune
system could help researchers tailor better, cheaper, faster ways
to fight disease, Geraghty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is digital medicine, versus analog.''

A COURTLY AFFAIR BY TWO SEEKING TO BE THE NEXT THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Bang! Pow! Wham! Thud! Slam!
</P>
<P>
   Dud.
</P>
<P>
   The first confrontation between Vice President Al Gore and
former Senator Bill Bradley was a calm and courtly affair, with
sound and fury suppressed by the makeup of the candidates and
forum. And if this muted struggle, staged in a college theater amid
the brilliant foliage of October, also wound up seeming to signify
nothing _ or not enough _ it was because the major player in the
Democratic field wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors called it a ``town meeting,'' the candidates called
it a ``debate,'' but what unfolded at Dartmouth College Wednesday
evening was something else entirely. It was a reminder that the two
contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are competing
not so much for policy advantages but for something far more
subtle: the chance to be the Next Thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Thing, that is, after Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the hour-long session staged here underlined, that's a very
difficult proposition to define _ and to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in a debate setting where the premium often is on
pugilism, not subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats at century's end are struggling with a challenge
no party has faced in modern history. When Vice President George
Bush sought the GOP nomination in 1988, for example, he implicitly
ran as a candidate offering a continuation of the Ronald Reagan
years. Indeed, right after the election, a top Bush adviser and
future White House chief of staff, Governor John H. Sununu of New
Hampshire, declared that the presidential transition was not a
``hostile takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Gore's predicament was clear: He wanted to be
the logical next Democratic step after Clinton, and yet he could
not afford to suggest that he might want to extend the Clinton
years, which brought with them scandal and impeachment. He told one
questioner he understood the ``disappointment and anger you felt
toward President Clinton and I felt it myself,'' adding, tellingly:
``I also feel the American people want to move on and turn the page
and focus on the future and not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment, coming in the first quarter of the session,
underlined the challenge facing the vice president: how to persuade
the country to move on and turn the page, but to keep one of the
principal characters of the Clinton drama _ and one of the
president's chief defenders during the Monica Lewinsky episode _ on
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's difficulty was on full display as well. He couldn't
afford to suggest that he differed on the economic policies that
have brought surging prosperity to New Hampshire (which was in
economic despair at the beginning of the decade) and the rest of
the country, and yet he could not appear merely to sound a ``me,
too'' tone.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Thing is a hard thing to define, and right now the
Democratic race is a laboratory for concocting it.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly the two candidates urged the audience, as Bradley put
it in response to an education question, ``to look to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because the past, even in a time of prosperity, is a
painful place for Democrats _ far more painful than the past seemed
when, at a time of more economic strain, a gaggle of Republicans
struggled to win the nomination to succeed Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's election seven years ago ended a generation-long
Democratic drought; with the exception of the post-Watergate
administration of Jimmy Carter, the Republicans controlled the
executive branch between 1969 and 1993. But the administration
repeatedly stumbled, its relations with Congress were contentious
even when the Democrats controlled both chambers, and the party
relinquished its four-decade hold on power in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are ready to move on, but even as the party is
preparing to choose a successor to Clinton, the shadow of the
president was all but visible on the Dartmouth stage.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't only the shadow of Bill Clinton that hung over the
proceedings. The shadow of Governor George W. Bush was there, too _
though his name never passed the candidates' lips.
</P>
<P>
   The two areas where the two candidates sparred most spiritedly
were areas that Democrats plan to emphasize in the fall campaign,
which they now calculate will be against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' emphasis on health-care insurance was in part a
response to Bush, who has not yet made a comprehensive health-care
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The other major subject of domestic-policy friction between the
two candidates was school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of the hour, the two men spoke of the essence
of leadership. By speaking of the need for ``clear goals'' and
``values'' (as Gore did) and by speaking of the need for ``absolute
integrity'' (as Bradley did), the two candidates showed they are
seeking to define a post-Clinton politics. But the poll results,
which show a virtual dead heat, indicate that the party hasn't yet
settled on what it believes is The Next Thing.

 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With deep-pocketed bidders competing to outspend one
another, the carefully preserved baubles and treasures of Marilyn
Monroe went up for auction Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Christie's auction house in Manhattan applauded as
spirited bidding carried the prices of Monroe's belongings into the
stratosphere, well beyond what the auction house had estimated _
even before the bidding began on the final item in the sale, the
dress she wore at Madison Square Garden when she sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to President Kennedy on May 19, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Adlai E. Stevenson described that show-stopper by
remembering that Monroe was ``dressed in what she calls `skin and
beads.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the beads,'' Stevenson added.
</P>
<P>
   Auctions have become a popular way to dispose of belongings that
celebrities' heirs no longer want. In the last couple of years,
fans have paid handsomely for the not-necessarily handsome discards
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Leonard Bernstein and Academy
Award-winning actresses _ everything from dog-eared sheet music to
furniture to old LPs to grand pianos to necklaces to evening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indication of how much people will pay for
celebrities' possessions began when Lord Hindlip _ the chairman of
Christie's International and the auctioneer who gaveled away 79
dresses belonging to Diana, princess of Wales, in 1997 _ faced the
standing-room-only crowd Wednesday night in the sale at Rockefeller
Center. Among those in the audience were the actress Stephanie
Seymour, Tony Curtis and Massimo Ferragamo, the chairman of the
Ferragamo shoe company, who wanted to buy back a pair of red
stiletto heels that the company made in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good form of reinvestment,'' said Ferragamo, who said
he wanted the shoes for the company's museum in Florence. ``The
estimate on those shoes was 1,000 times more than what the original
price was. Plus, Marilyn Monroe is an icon for all the reasons I
don't need to go into.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bidding began, Ferragamo settled into a stiff chair in
the 1,000-seat sale room _ a room filled through a lottery among
would-be bidders whose first purchase was the dictionary-thick
catalog, which cost $85 ($95 by mail). Christie's installed 100
telephone lines to handle prospective buyers who were not in the
room for the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were there clutched copies of the catalog, which
provided a full-color look at what Nancy Valentino, the curator,
called ``a capsule of an American life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a famous life, and the capsule was well preserved for 37
years in climate-controlled storage rooms. Monroe apparently never
threw anything away, so everything was on sale _ the glittery gowns
and the used furniture. Her dining-room table has the scratches of
a hard life in small apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a major saver,'' Ms. Valentino said. ``The way she
took care of her possessions really reflects her attitude toward
money. She came from a very poor childhood and never forgot that,
as opposed to people who make it big and throw everything out. We
were able to identify stuff from as far back as 1950. Most people
would get rid of it and buy new things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bidders did not seem to mind the wear and tear on things
Monroe had touched, sat in, played, wore or waved. Lot 7, the blue
jeans she wore while hanging from the side of a train in ``River of
No Return,'' sold for $37,000. A black-and-white photograph of Joe
DiMaggio went for $9,000. Her wedding ring from DiMaggio, a
platinum band with 34 diamonds (one is missing), sold for $700,000,
much more than Christie's estimate of $30,000 to $50,000. Her white
lacquered baby grand piano, which originally belonged to her
mother, Gladys, went for $600,000. (Prices do not include the
auctioneer's commission.)
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had expected her Bible _ with, as the sale catalog
put it, ``a few pencil markings in the text,'' just like her movie
scripts _ to sell for $2,000 to $4,000. It went for $33,000. Her
Union Prayerbook for Jewish Worship sold for $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had valued the sleeveless Jean Louis cocktail dress
that she wore in ``The Misfits'' at $20,000 to $30,000 _ triple the
estimate for the film's script, by Husband No. 3, Arthur Miller. On
page 20 of the script, where Monroe's character said: ``I didn't
want children. Not with him,'' she penciled in a notation, ``Like
with J.D.'' Christie's speculated that she was referring to Husband
No. 2, DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time, slides flashed on a screen at the front of the
room, showing off another batch of earrings, brooches or keepsakes.
There was her parchment nomination for a Golden Globe Award (for
``Some Like It Hot'' in 1959) sold for $30,000. This was followed
by the statuette she received when she won the award on March 8,
1960, which went for $125,000. Tomorrow, the compact she was
carrying that night will go on sale. Whoever buys it will also get
her acceptance speech typed on a card that fitted inside (``I'm
moved-thrilled'').

AFTER TWO DEATHS, A NATIONWIDE RECALL OF HOT DOGS PRODUCED AT NEW
YORK PLANT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Food safety inspectors are exploring whether two
recent deaths were caused by contaminated frankfurters that were
produced at a Bronx processing plant, and the products have been
recalled nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The hot dogs, marketed mainly under the Sabrett's and Western
Beef labels, may have been contaminated with listeria, a
potentially fatal food-borne bacteria, according to the Federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 2.1 million pounds
of the frankfurters made in the Bronx have been recalled by the
company that produces them, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no known cases of illness in New York, according to
state health officials. And Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesman, said:
``This is all evolving. I can't confirm whether any of the deaths
are linked or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a national advisory to health officials, the federal
agency said that it was investigating whether two deaths, and five
illnesses, were caused by listeria from hot dogs made at the plant.
The cases were reported in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia and Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strain in the food product, and the strain in the
patients, appears to be the same,'' the advisory said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bronx plant produces Sabrett's and Western Beef hot
dogs, some wholesalers elsewhere repackage the product under
different names.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, health officials said they had identified three
recent cases of listeria infection, including the death of an
83-year-old patient on Sept. 13, in which the disease strain
matched that in the tainted hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey-based company that produces the frankfurters,
Marathon Enterprises Inc., released a statement that said, in part,
``there is absolutely no definitive evidence that any reported
illnesses or deaths are related to our products.'' It also said
that the company took consumer concerns seriously and would
continue to cooperate with government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium carried by animals, can
contaminate animal products like meat and milk, and it affects
people with weakened immune systems. It kills some 250 Americans a
year out of the 1,100 who fall ill, according to data kept by the
CDC. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches and nausea, and the
disease can lead pregnant women to miscarry.
</P>
<P>
   Some 52,000 pounds of the Sabrett and Western Beef hot dogs were
first recalled on Oct. 13, after a man in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
complained of feeling sweaty and weak after eating them.
</P>
<P>
   In a market there, two packages of the skinless beef hot dogs
tested positive for the bacteria, and they carried the code of the
Bronx plant, 8854.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, company officials closed the Bronx plant. But
further tests by Marathon's own meat-safety inspectors revealed
listeria in more of the hot dogs, leading to an expanded recall on
Oct. 26, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Marathon spokeswoman said it was the first recall in the
history of the company, which sells more than 20 million pounds of
hot dogs a year.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled products, in 16-ounce and 5-pound packages, were
sold to wholesalers in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, Florida and Georgia. The hot dogs from the company's two
other plants _ in Jersey City, N.J., and in the Bronx neighborhood
of Hunts Point _ are safe to eat, she said. They bear the codes 850
and 7879.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The budget battle turned to tactical skirmishes
Wednesday, as Republicans struggled to write bills financing seven
federal agencies and foreign aid without tapping Social Security
funds, triggering vetoes or tearing apart their thin majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides ratcheted up the rhetoric as well, with Republicans
ridiculing the Democrats for fearing their proposed 1 percent
across-the-board budget cut and Democrats calling the Republicans'
accounting techniques a Stalinist ``Big Lie'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The battleground lay in four of 13 spending bills still in play.
The Republicans need to find ways to rewrite them or to change the
rules governing spending in ways that at least appear to avoid
using billions of dollars in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Treasury Department released final figures
for fiscal 1999 showing that Congress used $1 billion of the Social
Security surplus in last year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that for the second year in a row, the
government ran a large surplus in Social Security revenues _ $124
billion _ that went to pay down the national debt, which is now
$3.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have pledged to complete all the 13 bills
financing government agencies while spending no more than $594
billion _ the limit beyond which they would begin to drain surplus
Social Security funds. But their own calculations show them
spending about $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposed spending cut of about 1 percent would recoup
about $6 billion, bringing their budget into balance, with the help
of an unprecedented level of creative accounting in the spending
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Without that creativity, according to an estimate by the
independent Congressional Budget Office, the Republican bills spend
at least $609 billion, or $15 billion over the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said those
figures made a fiction of the Republicans' argument that their
across-the-board cut would protect Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the `Big Lie,''' Gephardt said. The 1 percent cut, he
argued, ``doesn't keep you from spending Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are still working on their plan, which as of
Wednesday afternoon lay in draft form as a budget cut of
nine-tenths of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to try to pass that plan on Thursday by attaching it
to the last of the spending bills to reach the House floor, a
measure financing the departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education. It was not certain Wednesday that 218
Republicans _ a majority vote in the House _ would support the
plan, congressional aides said. Senate Republicans, though not
wildly enthusiastic, say they will pass it nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   If President Clinton vetoes the cut, as he has vowed, the
Republicans will have to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   They must find ways to negotiate with the White House to defuse
problematic policies in the remaining bills. These include favors
for the mining and energy industries, restrictions on money for
diplomacy and roadblocks to paying the dues Washington owes the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The president says he will not sign the $85 billion labor,
health and education bill unless the Republicans include his
program to finance 100,000 new teachers in public schools. The
bill, in its final draft tonight, does not.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton vetoed the $37 billion bill financing the
Commerce, Justice and State departments because it does not include
money for 50,000 more police officers or U.N. dues.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 billion bill financing the Interior Department has been
approved by both houses of Congress and is ready to be sent to the
president. But he says he will not sign it unless the Senate
removes a series of riders attached to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton also vetoed the $12 billion foreign aid bill,
calling it a symptom of ``isolationalism'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will have to remain in session long past its scheduled
Oct. 29 adjournment to redraw these bills, which must become law in
some way, shape or form. The 2000 fiscal year began on Oct. 1, and
the month's second continuing resolution, keeping the government
running without a real budget, expires at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will have to pass and Clinton will have to sign a third
one this week as the struggle continues, with no clear end in
sight.

MANY AMERICANS UNDERESTIMATE ABILITY TO BUILD WEALTH

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Despite the almost decade-long economic
expansion in the United States and Wall Street specifically, many
Americans believe the best way to build wealth is to buy lottery
tickets, according to a survey to be released today in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when asked what a person's best chance was to obtain
$500,000 in a lifetime, 28 percent of respondents said to win a
lottery or sweepstakes, according to a public opinion survey
commissioned by the Consumer Federation of America and Primerica.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is stunning, coming at a time when Wall Street has
never been more popular. Individual investors are jumping into the
market, helping to propel it to new heights. Cable television
networks relay market information around the clock, buoyed by a
flood of ads for the thousands of mutual funds that have been
created in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to the survey of 1,010 Americans taken in July, a
large minority of those polled believe the best way for them to
accumulate wealth is to gamble on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans understood that their chances of winning a big
lottery jackpot were 10 million to 20 million to one, but that they
could accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars through regular
savings, more families would put $50 away rather than spending it
on gambling or unneeded consumption,'' said Joseph Plumeri,
chairman of Primerica, in a printed statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lotay Yang, vice president and branch manager of Fidelity's
investment center in Woodland Hills, said even $25 a week, if
invested at a conservative 8percent per year, would be worth
$103,000 in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that sometimes everyday expenses take
priority over savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your investments are not always financially based. Sometimes
the best investing is in your family,'' said Yang. ``When you have
the money that's when you start.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys resident Pamela Cupp agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger and raising a family, I couldn't put away
$5,'' said Cupp. ``Not in your 30s. But now that my daughter is an
adult, I have been investing in the stock market. Before that, I
didn't even think about the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related survey also to be released today, Capital Research
Associates economist Joseph M. Anderson concluded the average
American household has net financial assets of $1,000 and net
wealth of $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Using 1995 data collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the
most recent government data available, Anderson said the reason for
the low net financial assets was consumer debt, mainly from credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Average gross financial assets were about $2,700 before
subtracting unsecured debt, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the most disturbing trend in the survey was that
one-fifth of Americans with the lowest financial assets typically
were from middle-income households with earned income of about
$31,700 a year. The typical middle-class household had $4,700 more
in unsecured debt than in gross financial assets, the report said.

BROKERS' ADS TRY TO TURN STOCKS INTO NEW NATIONAL PASTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Corporate America thought that the mostly male
audience watching the World Series aspired to drive Chevy pickup
trucks, shave with Gillette's razors and drink Coors beer _ judging
by the amount of money that was spent on expensive ad time to
promote those brands.
</P>
<P>
   This year, General Motors still hopes World Series fans will buy
trucks and Anheuser-Busch expects that they will quaff lots of Bud.
But if ad spending in the series between the New York Yankees and
the Atlanta Braves is any indication, millions of baseball fans are
mainly angst-ridden about which of the Internet brokerage firms
they should use to trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Online investment firms, many of which did not exist two years
ago, have collectively bought more World Series ad time than any
other industry, displacing even GM, the marketing monolith of
sports, according to people who placed the ads. During nearly every
inning break and throughout the pre-game shows, FMR's Fidelity is
pitching its offerings against Etrade or Merrill Lynch, with Datek
and Ameritrade also vying for a slice of baseball fans' household
income.
</P>
<P>
   The spending binge is part of the investment world's attempt to
turn stock trading into a new national pastime, perhaps with room
for baseball, too. The number of Americans who own stock has soared
to just below half, according to a recent survey. The richest
investors also seem to have developed a passion for talking and
trading stocks and outsmarting the market _ turning investing
itself into a sport, or, say some critics, a wager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock trading for some people is a serious activity, and for
some it's legal gambling,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of
culture, journalism and sociology at New York University. ``These
brokerage firms are the house.''
</P>
<P>
   That house has gotten a little crowded. More and more investors
are trading stocks on their own, but they are spoiled for choices
about where to do so. About 130 Internet brokerage firms are
competing for a universe of online traders that now numbers about
10 million. Large brokerage firms, many of which have never tried
to sell their services during mass-market events like the World
Series or the Super Bowl before, are trying to make sure they are
not left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock investing is more a part of the American mainstream than
it's ever been,'' said Stephen Cone, head of consumer marketing at
Fidelity Investments and one of this year's biggest World Series
advertisers. ``It's water-cooler conversation. We want to be heard
along with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The online brokerage companies, and their offline rivals, are in
a vicious fight for market share that happens to have heated up
this fall. Many of the large investment companies have in recent
weeks announced that they will double or in some cases triple their
ad spending to get their message out. They are collectively
expected to devote $1.5 billion over the next year on marketing,
more than companies spend to promote Coke, Pepsi, Miller Lite and
Tylenol combined. None of the companies would say how much they are
spending on the World Series alone.

<P>
   Baseball and NBC, the network owned by General Electric that is
carrying the series, are the beneficiaries. Network executives have
had their hands full placing all the ads in time slots that are not
back to back. The idea of exclusivity _ sole sponsor of the
pre-game show, for example _ has gone the way of full stock trading
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the New York Stock Exchange sees sports and Wall Street as
natural allies. The exchange, which is preparing to become a public
company itself in the near future, has hired a bevy of high-price
sports talent, including Chicago Cubs home-run slugger Sammy Sosa,
, to promote the theme that the Big Board is ``at the center of the
sports universe.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that baseball, compared with golf, tennis and
even football, is everyman's sport. Its loyal fans are more
ethnically diverse, more male and less likely to have a fat
investment portfolio than those of other leading sports,
advertisers say. Moreover, the stock market is not as red hot as it
was early in the year, and online brokerage accounts are not
growing as fast.
</P>
<P>
   So why the rush? Etrade, one of the first Internet brokerage
firms, made a splash by buying expensive air time on the World
Series last year. Its account growth soared not long after. Etrade
has since increased its ad spending to $350 million for fiscal 2000
from $250 million the year before. The new level is roughly what
Burger King spends to promote it brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Charles Schwab, Ameritrade and some old-line brokerage
firms, including Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, are
trying to match Etrade's marketing blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is just flooding in as people want to build brand
awareness,'' said Len Short, head of marketing for Schwab, which
has bought some advertising slots from local stations during the
World Series but is not a national sponsor. ``Most of it, frankly,
is uneconomical. Prime time does not give you bang for the buck.
But with all the noise people are trying to create momentum.''

   Fans are a little overwhelmed. On a television hanging from the
ceiling at the Carriage House of Sports in Brooklyn, Penn and
Teller, the celebrity magicians who promote Fidelity's online
trading service, compete for attention with loud conversation and
the clack of balls on the bar's pool table during Game 2. Adam
Bertapelle, 25, is a devoted Yankees fan but no active trader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just blank it out,'' he said of the brokerage advertising.
``I don't know anyone who has enough loose money lying around to
bet on stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   At Park Avenue Country Club, a Manhattan sports bar where an
attendant stands guard in the marble restroom, the ads are closer
to their target. Scott Kephart, 36, who works for a computer
networking company, has an Etrade account and trades stocks every
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going after everyone with income. They're trying to
say anyone can do it, just try,'' he said, just after a World
Series commercial break featuring Merrill's pitch for its
overhauled brokerage service.
</P>
<P>
   Owning stock is becoming a normal thing for the majority of
Americans, said Gitlin. But the majority of people who hold stock,
often in mutual funds, do not trade very often. He said he thought
that the brokerage firms were capitalizing on broader stock
ownership to inculcate a culture of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``If owning stock is normal, why can't trading be normal?'' he
said. He added, however, that the firms appeared to be fighting for
a relatively small percentage of Americans who have enough money to
invest significant amounts in relatively high-risk trading
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the costly ads ever pay off in terms of new online
trading accounts is questionable, many in the industry acknowledge.
They consider World Series advertising to be brand promotion, not
carefully focused marketing. And, with the tumult in the financial
world resulting from the rise of the Internet, some of the
advertisers are talking as much to Wall Street, and even to their
own employees, as much as to potential customers. The subtext is
that with all the change going on in the industry, they are here to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill is an example. The largest traditional brokerage house,
Merrill is simultaneously promoting its own new online offering and
seeking to reassure customers, and its own brokers, that the old
way of doing business with the company is not about to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best place right now to put out a mass message,
and that's important to us,'' said Charles Mangano, senior director
for brand management at Merrill. ``We are reinforcing the message
with the press, our employees, the analysts who cover our company.
They all watch the World Series.''

 &HT;    Coke studying `two-way' vending
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wouldn't it be neat if a business could automatically
lower prices at any hour to drive more sales? Coca-Cola Co. is
pursuing ``intelligent vending technology'' that would allow
bottlers to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   For months, researchers at the Atlanta-based company have been
studying wireless technology that would allow bottlers to
``communicate'' with vending machines to lower prices during
periods of low sales and then return prices to normal levels during
high-traffic periods.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Ben Deutsch said such ``two-way'' communication would
allow the company to remotely change the electronic price display
on vending machines. The machines also would allow consumers to
``dial up'' a soft drink using cellular phone technology and charge
the cost to a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said the company has no immediate plans to field test
the two-way technology and added, ``We have no plans to put any
such machine into the marketplace.'' He said the research is in
``the infancy stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink vending machine business has become highly
competitive because it provides high margins for Coke and its main
rival, Pepsi. Pepsico spokesman Jeff Brown said his company isn't
testing similar wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all feeds into their strategy of micromarketing and
understanding the local consumer,'' said Morgan Stanley analyst
Andrew Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises and two other
bottlers are testing wireless technology that helps them keep track
of how quickly soft drink brands are selling in vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   If a vending machine runs low on one beverage, say Sprite, the
bottlers would know immediately and could dispatch a truck to
restock the machine, rather than wait for the machine to be
replenished during a regularly scheduled visit. Deutsch said this
``one-way'' communications technology will help a bottler determine
the right mix of products for specific locations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to CCE, Charlotte, N.C.-based Coca-Cola
Consolidated, the second-largest Coke bottler after CCE, and
Coca-Cola Amatil in Sydney, Australia, are testing the technology.

MORE DEBATE AND RULINGS SEEN FROM UPHOLDING OF BAN ON TYPE OF
ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis.) (sw) 
 By JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ Some called it ``chilling'' and
``contradictory.'' Others called it ``well-reasoned'' and
``remarkable.'' But no one affected by Tuesday's federal appeals
court decision upholding the criminalization of a rare late-term
abortion procedure that its opponents call ``partial birth'' was
predicting instant change in Wisconsin or Illinois, the states
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is continuing as always,'' said Judy Mann, head of
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which shut its clinics for a week
in 1998, shortly after Wisconsin's law was passed, because of
concerns that it was ambiguous and that doctors who performed any
type of abortions could be at risk for prosecution. The penalty,
the most severe in the nation, is life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, handed down by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, contrasted sharply with a similar case in the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the 8th Circuit, the court found that laws in Nebraska,
Arkansas and Iowa banning the late-term procedure were
unconstitutional because their language might be interpreted to
prohibit common and constitutionally protected methods of late-term
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The judges in the 7th Circuit did not find the Wisconsin and
Illinois laws banning one type of late-term abortion
unconstitutional. A federal judge in Illinois had ruled that
state's law was unconstitutional but a federal judge in Wisconsin
had upheld the law there after a trial. But the 7th Circuit said it
would instruct the federal district judges handling the
partial-birth abortion cases to issue ``precautionary'' injunctions
to ensure that other, constitutionally protected abortion
procedures are not banned. The 7th Circuit judges are expected to
issue their instructions to the district court judges within the
next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before then, said Roger Evans, director of public policy
litigation and law for the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America, ``we will take steps to preserve the status quo.'' Evans
represented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and four doctors in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The laws in Illinois and Wisconsin do not specify what
constitutes a ``partial-birth'' abortion. In their decision, the
7th Circuit judges said they were upholding criminalization of ``an
uncommon procedure'' in which a woman's cervix is dilated, usually
over several days; the fetus' feet are extracted, and the brain is
then partly evacuated and the fetus is delivered dead but otherwise
intact.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit said other common methods of late-term abortion
in which a fetus is dismembered inside a woman's uterus and removed
by forceps or suction, are constitutional and protected under
Supreme Court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit's reading of the law ``was what the state said
all along,'' said Susan Ullman, the assistant attorney general of
Wisconsin. ``The state wasn't trying to stop all abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Bertocchi, the solicitor general of Illinois, said he
expected that the federal court would issue an order to Illinois'
attorney general and 102 states attorneys ``to prosecute cases in
accordance with the court's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the decision noted that the 8th Circuit struck
down similar laws in Arkansas, Nebraska and Iowa because the
imprecision of their language might allow the prosecution of
doctors who performed procedures protected by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Connell, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties
Union in Chicago, which represented plaintiffs in Illinois, called
the 7th Circuit ruling ``radical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have a federal court enjoin a statute, tell a
state it can't enforce it, the court has to find that the statute,
either on its face or as applied, violates a federal constitutional
provision or federal law,'' she said. ``It's the most basic rule of
being a judge: before you can tell a state governmental official
they can't do something, the act they want to do has to be found
violative of federal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, of Planned Parenthood, said that the decision was
``fraught with contradictions,'' and that ``the court seems to have
set up a situation that no matter how the district judge writes the
injunction, any state prosecution will be met by a request from the
doctor for the federal court to intercede. It has set up a
situation where the federal court is dragged in every time.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, who wrote the Wisconsin law, said:
``In my personal view, this is groundbreaking. We have now set the
stage for a discussion on what is considered an abortion and
discuss it on the basis of the procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coleson, who represented 55 Wisconsin state legislators
and Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum in the case, called the appeals court
decision ``well-reasoned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It applies the normal rules of law to the abortion context,''
Coleson said. ``Often we have the abortion distortion complex. The
appeals court construed the topic as it was supposed to do, to save
it from constitutional attack, and gave deference to the trial
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Weiss, director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom
Project, which has litigated abortion cases across the country,
called the court's ruling ``heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these bans mean for women and doctors I represent
all over the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of abortion providers by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute in New York found that the abortion procedure banned in
Illinois and Wisconsin accounted for 0.03 to 0.05 percent of all
abortions in 1996, the latest year for which figures are available.
In all, this would amount to 650 abortions, most performed at 20 to
24 weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals judges wrote that no physicians in Illinois had said
they performed this procedure and only a few had done so in
Wisconsin. Ms. Mann said that she was troubled by the judges'
conclusion that this procedure was never medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the record in the district court was a classic case that
it's essential,'' Ms. Mann said. ``A woman was carrying a fetus
that was hydrocephalic. The woman wanted to let nature take its
course, but during the gestation, the head got so large she was in
jeopardy. There was no way to remove the fetus. Now the court has
ruled that if a doctor did this, he should go to prison for life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the ruling is very narrow,'' Ms. Mann continued,
``it puts judicial interest between the physician and the patient.
The judicial and legislative systems can't understand the
complexity of this. That's what the danger is to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weiss predicted: ``This split between the 7th and 8th
Circuits is going to force this issue before the Supreme Court
very, very quickly, in the next several months.''

 &HT;    Documentary displays classic Cosell
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, Oct. 31
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He was funny-looking and gawky. A face
for radio, that's for sure. He had a million-dollar image, but wore
a dime-store toupee. He never shied away from controversy. In fact,
he welcomed it. He championed such vilified black athletes as
Jackie Robinson, Tommie Smith and Muhammad Ali when only a handful
of white reporters would. He was loud, outspoken and brutally
condescending.
</P>
<P>
   But when you think of Howard Cosell, you think one thing: the
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, that voice. It was unmistakable. Droning. Commanding. Nasal.
Annoying. Yes, it was all those things. But actor Billy Crystal
sums it up best in ``Howard Cosell: Telling It Like It Is,'' HBO's
superb documentary of the legendary broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you describe Howard Cosell on the air to someone who
had never heard him before? It's like, think of a very smart man
scolding you with a bad sinus condition who had a great
vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have put it better.
</P>
<P>
   Cosell, who died in 1995 at age 77 of a heart condition, was a
fascinating case study in contrasts. In a 1978 TV Guide poll, he
was named both the most liked and the most disliked sportscaster in
America. He possessed Michael Jordan-like confidence and was never
afraid to, as he would often boast in his famous halting delivery,
``tell ... it ... like ... it ... is.'' But he was also an
extremely insecure man who read everything that was written about
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either hated Howard Cosell or loved him,'' Baltimore
Ravens owner Art Modell says on the documentary. ``Nobody was in
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. I loved Cosell ... most of the time. That doesn't
mean, however, I agreed with everything he said. I applauded him
because he was never afraid to take an unpopular stand. He spoke
out against such hot-button subjects as racism and the Vietnam War.
While Cosell was often a first-class jerk and an arrogant
son-of-a-you-know-what-I-mean, I remember he was the first
sportscaster ever to call Ali Muhammad Ali on the air while
everyone else insisted on calling him Cassius Clay. That counted
for a lot, as far as I was concerned.
</P>
<P>
   How many of today's cookie-cutter, bland-as-butterless toast
sportscasters are willing to go out on a limb and say something the
least bit controversial?
</P>
<P>
   The only one I can think of is Bob Costas.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's moving documentary offers a well-rounded portrait of a
man, who at the height of his fame, was one of the most famous
people in America. For instance, Cosell despised bigotry and
prejudice because as a Jewish kid growing up in a poor section of
New York's Brooklyn borough, he was discriminated against and often
found himself running away from Irish-Catholic boys who wanted to
beat him up.
</P>
<P>
   But as he got older, that man with the funny nose, cheap toupee
and distinctive voice, never ran away from anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard Cosell: Telling It Like It Is''

GORE SPARS WITH BRADLEY ON HEALTH CARE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ The first side-by-side matchup of the Democratic
presidential candidates erupted Wednesday night over the cost of
former Senator Bill Bradley's health-care plan, which Vice
President Al Gore charged would bust the budget and ``shred the
social safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has climbed in the polls partly by offering a
broader health-care plan than Gore, briefly and indignantly
addressed Gore's attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We each have our own experts,'' Bradley said during the
nationally televised forum, broadcast from the campus of Dartmouth
College. ``I dispute the cost figure that Al has used.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few open disagreements _ and even fewer
moments of discord _ on an evening when both candidates, through
their answers to voter questions, mostly underscored how similar
they are in temperament, ideology and outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has said his health program will cost $650 billion over
10 years, while Gore quoted a study that said it would cost $1.4
trillion. While Bradley has proposed providing insurance to 95
percent of Americans, Gore has proposed a program that covers all
children, which has led Bradley to say that the vice president's
proposal is too cautious during a time of prosperity and budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The two also drew dividing lines on a few other issues, with
Gore clearly the more determined to draw contrasts with Bradley,
whose campaign _ only months ago a blip in the polls _ now
threatens to surge past the vice president's in this first-primary
state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for example, said he disagreed with Bradley on whether to
provide tax dollars to help pay for private education. ``I think
vouchers was a mistake,'' Gore said, noting that he and Bradley
have disagreed for 18 years on the issue. Bradley has supported
some pilot programs for trying out the concept of vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the candidates largely agreed in the substance of
their responses to other issues raised by questioners _ citizens
screened by the forum sponsors, Dartmouth and CNN _ such as mental
health and campaign-finance reform. But the encounter provided an
outline of the campaign to come in the three months before New
Hampshire holds its primary, as the two men portrayed themselves as
having different paths to reach similar goals.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Gore's strategy was clear: he wanted to distance
himself from President Clinton and attack Bradley for making
budget-busting proposals.
</P>
<P>
   When a questioner vaguely asked about scandals in the
Clinton-Gore administration, the vice president interpreted it as a
reference to President Clinton's sexual relationship with former
intern Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward
President Clinton,'' Gore said. ``I felt it myself. I also feel
that the American people want to move on, focus on the future and
not the past. He is my friend. I took an oath under the
Constitution to serve through thick and thin.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer seemed significant because Gore has tended recently
to try to dismiss such questions, saying that the country has
``Clinton fatigue fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Gore implicitly criticized the work of his own
administration on Rwanda, where hundreds of thousands of people
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we we were tardy, frankly, in Rwanda,'' Gore said,
without explaining his own role in the decision on when the U.S.
would intervene in the deadly ethnic struggle in that African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, meanwhile, dealt with criticism that his retirement
from the Senate in 1996 amounted to quitting at a crucial time for
Democrats. ``The things I wanted to do I couldn't do in the
Senate,'' Bradley said, noting that after leaving Washington he
lectured at Stanford and Notre Dame and met people ``where they
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate produced no obvious gaffes, and both candidates
appeared comfortable on stage, straying from their stools to
respond to questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in what seemed like a carefully planned attack, repeatedly
sought to hammer Bradley on the cost of his proposed health
program. At one point, Gore warned that Bradley's program would
leave no money for Medicare or education initiatives, urging people
to be cautious about ``proposals that may sound great but for which
there is no money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley defended his proposal and said he was guilty only of
thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to do this, you ought to deal with the big
problems and you ought to have big solutions to big problems,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Bradley seemed determined not to engage in the
fireworks, passing up an opportunity to criticize the way the vice
president raised money in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were obviously some irregularities that have
been addressed,'' Bradley said. ``I'm not going to get into
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a statistical tie in a variety of New Hampshire polls,
Gore and Bradley used the forum both to introduce themselves to
voters and to distinguish themselves from each other. For many
voters, the forum _ or at least sound bites from the event that
were broadcast on the news _ are likely to provide a first
impression of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates squared off in the intimate confines of Dartmouth
College's Moore Theater, where students often gather to watch
popular films. The debate was broadcast locally on WMUR-TV and
nationally on CNN, which reaches 76 million households. But with
competition from Game Four of the World Series and with the primary
still three months away, the viewership was expected to be
relatively small, especially outside New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the forum was viewed as vital by both campaigns because
it was the first widely covered event of the 2000 election
campaign, attracting more than 300 members of the press, who in
turn report and interpret the event for a wider audience of
millions. Moreover, the strength or weaknesses exhibited in the
first-primary state often have a ripple effect in the rest of the
campaign. Already, Bradley's strong showing in the New Hampshire
polls has boosted his national standing.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore and Bradley and two moderators took their positions
beside stools on the stage, they were greeted by an audience
arrayed around them, with several dozen people seated
bleacher-style behind them and the rest of the audience in front.
The audience was randomly selected through a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to take control even before the debate began. The
candidates appeared on stage 15 minutes before air time and the
vice president immediately asked if anyone had a question. The two
men then launched into a warm-up question-and-answer session.
Shortly before the program went on the air, Bradley walked over to
Gore, shook the vice president's hand, and said, ``Let's have a
good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, dressed in a dark suit, blue shirt and red tie, spoke
carefully, drawing out his responses with practiced care. Gore,
dressed in a beige suit, blue shirt and striped tie, sought to
appear relaxed, taking the time to tell a favorite joke. At the
end, Gore seemed reluctant to leave, offering to answer questions
from any member of the audience after the program went off the air.

 &HT;    GORE AND BRADLEY PRODUCE NO FIREWORKS IN TOWN HALL MEETING

<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley shared most opinions as well as the stage at a town meeting
with New Hampshire voters Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic presidential contenders, taking turns
responding to questions from a studio audience of about 500 at
Dartmouth College, sparred a bit over the cost of a plan proposed
by Bradley to expand health care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But their first joint appearance before a New Hampshire audience
produced little in the way of fireworks as they alternately pledged
greater efforts to improve education, expand health benefits,
reform campaign finance and protect the civil rights of homosexuals
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The town meeting format discouraged the kind of give-and-take
between candidates that are part of presidential debates. And for
the most part, both candidates followed the format: responding in
90 seconds to questions posed from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Bradley both took time from their answers to other
questions to conduct a mini-debate over Bradley's proposal to
expand health care benefits to all uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that Bradley's plan could cost as much as $1.3
trillion, an amount the vice president contended could wipe out the
federal government's budget surplus and ultimately jeopardize
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dispute the cost figure that Al has used,'' Bradley
countered before answering a question about the Senate's recent
rejection of a nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a neck-and-neck battle with Bradley in New Hampshire,
took the offensive even before the broadcast of the town meeting
began. Before CNN went on the air, Gore invited the studio audience
to start firing questions at both of them. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   As the town meeting concluded, Gore also surprised moderators
Bernard Shaw of CNN and Karen Brown of Manchester's WMUR-TV with an
offer to remain after the broadcast to answer questions ``as long
as you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate ventured into unchartered waters in response
to any of the more than two dozen questions asked by the audience.
And seldom did they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Both were also on their best behavior, avoiding strong enough
criticism to warrant an interruption by the moderators. At one
point, in fact, Gore complimented Bradley's eloquence in advocating
rewriting civil rights laws to include sexual orientation, although
the vice president noted his own opposition to such an approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, often laconic and professorial, was at his eloquent
best when he spoke of why he left the Senate in 1996. He also took
a gentle jab at Gore, who has spent most of his life as a
politician.
</P>
<P>
   He said that by leaving the Senate in 1996 _ a decision Gore has
characterized as quitting in the face of the Newt-Gingrich-led
takeover of Congres _ he had been able to ``encounter people where
they live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates walked about the stage while responding to
questions. Gore, however, joked more and often responded to
questioners with jokes and with a request to tell him more about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions were issue-oriented, with health care,
education and cynicism about the current political system
dominating the concerns of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the town meeting had barely begun when Gore was forced to
respond to questions about the improper behavior of President
Clinton with onetime White House intern Monica Lewinsky _ a topic
the vice president has tried to avoid throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he shared the public's disappointment and anger during
the Lewinsky controversy and sought to provide ``as much continuity
and civility'' as possible. But of Clinton, he said, ``He's my
friend.''

EGG AUCTION ON INTERNET IS DRAWING CLOSE SCRUTINY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Days after a new Web site auctioning models' services
as egg donors made a wide-ranging publicity splash, some are
questioning whether the auction is for real, or just a ploy to
attract Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Shirky, a professor of new media at Hunter College, wrote
Tuesday in an online publication, The Silicon Alley Daily, that he
had paid to join the site so that he could investigate it, called
Ron's Angels, and had sent e-mail inquiries about bidding, but
received no reply.
</P>
<P>
   Shirky and others questioned whether Ron Harris, the
photographer who founded the site, actually intended to market the
site not as an egg auction but as an erotic venue much like others
he has run.
</P>
<P>
   The site charges $24.95 a month for the opportunity to bid on
donor eggs and to get more information on the models. By last night
the site also featured an advertisement for an online pharmacy
offering drugs for impotence, baldness and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman acknowledged Wednesday that Harris had run a number
of erotic sites on the Web, but said he had been closing them and
was serious about auctioning off eggs. The fledgling site's staff
has been so swamped by media interest that it has had no time to
answer inquiries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times published an article on Saturday about the
site and the reactions of infertility specialists. On Monday, an
article in USA Today included interviews with two prospective egg
donors and a woman who said she had bid $42,000 for one model's
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   This week The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and online
publications have published articles citing skepticism about the
site's authenticity and Harris' motives.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the number of models shown as potential donors on
the Ron's Angels site had dropped to three, from eight last week.
Harris' spokesman, who spoke on the condition that he not be named,
said that in view of the publicity and debate about the site, five
models had asked to be removed, at least temporarily. But he said
the site planned to add donors within days.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said he could not immediately make the three
remaining models available for interviews, and attempts Wednesday
to reach the two models quoted in the USA Today article were
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The site has drawn outraged criticism from infertility groups
and specialists, who condemned it for turning human eggs into a
commodity that would go to the highest bidder. Infertility clinics
routinely offer egg donor profiles, sometimes on line, but they
generally pay no more than $5,000 to the donors, and the money is
meant to compensate them for their discomfort and time, rather than
for the genetic material itself.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' other Web ventures have sometimes attracted scrutiny.
The Better Business Bureau in Los Angeles, where Harris is based,
said it had received two complaints from subscribers displeased
with the content and service provided by Eros Entertainment Inc.,
one of Harris' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the local office of the Federal Trade
Commission said it was undertaking no suits against Harris or his
companies. The Internet, however, carried ample records of
complaints against Harris for ``spamming'' _ bombarding news groups
on the Internet with advertisements for his soft-porn sites. Many
of the sites attributed to him and listed as ``rogue'' sites by
spam fighters are defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Internet, on a site called 4porn.net, is an
interview with Harris from 1996 that quotes him discussing his
sites, calling himself an artist rather than a pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get your genes into the next generation, you win,'' he
said then. ``The only reason you are here is to breed, to transmit
your DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Shirky harshly criticized reports on the site that took
it at ``face value,'' he also said he could believe that Harris was
sincere in his ideology and in the Web site's mission. ``I don't
think this is a hoax,'' he said, ``I think it's a public relations
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris does hope that the site will generate interest in a book
he has been writing on his views about genetics for the last 20
years, his spokesman said, but ``this is not a publicity thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the spokesman said, accusations that the site is a
hoax can be disproved only if bidders agree to go public about the
deal after the current bidding period ends Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, stay tuned,'' the spokesman said.

BANGLADESH'S WORLD TRADE DIPLOMAT PURSUES GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ While his driver is weaving through traffic to get him
to the office, Iftekhar Chowdhury's day begins, as nearly all do,
trying to ensure that the economically struggling Bangladesh
partakes in the fruits of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving one recent morning at the downtown building here that
houses his country's plainly furnished office suite, Chowdhury
confronts the mail that has accumulated overnight. Some are faxes
from Bangladesh, half a world away. Others are notices of meetings
and letters from international agencies, most bearing U.N.
abbreviations or acronyms.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old career diplomat, officially his country's
representative to U.N. agencies in Geneva, reels off these
overnight communications in order of priority: the World Trade
Organization, the U.N. Commission on Trade and Development, the
World Intellectual Property Organization, the International Labor
Organization _ and the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic notions about the life of a diplomat notwithstanding _
especially in expensive, affluent cities like Geneva _ Chowdhury's
grinding daily schedule is probably much closer to the truth. To
him, Geneva is a working garden of international resources and
contacts that he must constantly cultivate. His calendar is crammed
with meetings, conferences, lunches, receptions and dinners that
make for 16-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technical assistance we're after, not the physical
here,'' said Chowdhury, a compact, dapper man in a gray suit,
``because so many agencies here are involved in economics and
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the stern photographic gaze of the founding father of
Bangladesh, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, Chowdhury gives assignments to
his four assistants in Bengali alternating with English. Then they
fan out to agencies across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning his driver, Chowdhury hops into his black Mercedes for
the short drive to the World Trade Organization. He does not seem
to notice the sun reflecting on Lake Leman here, engrossed as he is
in examining the agenda for the meeting of the General Council, the
decision-making body of the 135-member trade forum.
</P>
<P>
   Chowdhury has decided to support a rapid-entry process for
Bhutan to join the trade group. ``It's a fellow South Asian
country'' and one of the less-developed nations, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides representing Bangladesh, Chowdhury acts as coordinator
for 48 of the poorest countries, only 14 of which can afford to
post envoys in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting has one other item of personal importance to
Chowdhury. The General Council is discussing nominations for deputy
director general posts, a sensitive matter after the protracted
struggle to choose the group's leader, now Mike Moore of New
Zealand. Mindful of their recent public squabbling, delegates are
stepping gingerly around the next questions _ the number and
homelands of Moore's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Chowdhury, who has advanced degrees in international relations
from Australian National University in Canberra, has thrown his hat
into the ring. ``This is a chance for Bangladesh to have a top
international position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade representatives say that since Moore's successor in
three years will be Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand, there is no
need for Asian representation at the deputy level. But others are
pushing for three deputies from the least-developed nations, which
they believe are significantly underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at the oval, glass-and-wood conference center
recesses after half an hour, and Chowdhury finds his driver and
zooms up the hill to the Palais des Nations to meet with Mokammel
Haque, chairman of Bangladesh's investment board. They both head
for the office of a United Nations trade and development agency
deputy, Carlos Fortin, to review what the agency is doing to help
Bangladesh, including developing a handbook to attract foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging such investment is a priority for Chowdhury, whose
predominantly agricultural country on the Bay of Bengal is
occasionally ravaged by floods and cyclones. A largely Muslim
nation with a population of nearly 125 million, Bangladesh has been
trying to shift to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges are extraordinary. Perhaps a third of the
labor force is unemployed, and poor people can earn less in a year
than it costs a visiting envoy to stay for a night in one of this
international city's luxury hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as Chowdhury sees it, the cost to Bangladesh of stationing
a diplomatic mission in Geneva is worth it. ``Ten years ago,'' he
said, ``we were exporting less than $1 million, and now it's $3
billion in clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   International aid to his country and its membership in the WTO
have helped strengthen its position as the world's largest exporter
of jute. Bangladesh also seeks business investment for oil and
natural gas exploration, the construction of gas pipelines and the
development of its computer software industry.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, Chowdhury is running late so he skips his first
diplomatic function _ one of nine receptions or lunches as well as
four dinners during the week, at three of which he is the host.
</P>
<P>
   Energetic and friendly, Chowdhury says he does not mind the
frenetic pace. ``I'm trying to raise Bangladesh's profile here,''
he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Zipping around Geneva's noontime traffic, his driver drops him
off for lunch with an official from the World Economic Forum. Their
topic is Bangladesh's participation in an investment seminar in New
Delhi. Then it is back to the World Trade Organization's stately
lakeside headquarters, where its General Council resumes discussion
of the choice of deputies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a desire among delegates to make a decision before they
leave next month for Seattle, where they will start the next round
of global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three hours later, he is back in his office fielding
phone calls, looking at more accumulated mail and preparing for the
next day's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30, he heads into an evening of three receptions, the first
given by U.S. officials attending a U.N. refugee agency's executive
board meeting. Chowdhury wants to put in an appearance to make sure
that his country's problems from a flood of refugees from Myanmar
stays on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is off to a reception given by the Swedish envoy, and
then one for Nigeria's commerce minister. At 8:30, he joins his
wife, Nicole, for a dinner with a potential investor in Bangladesh,
and wraps up the day at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heavy work, but very stimulating,'' he said.
``Intellectually, it's very demanding and challenging because you
must switch from one area to another, but it's rewarding because
you can see the tangible benefits to your country.''

EEOC TO EXTEND ANTI-BIAS RIGHTS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS IN WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to sharpen lede graf)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has announced that
it will extend broad anti-discrimination rights to illegal
immigrants for the first time, a policy that some critics said
could be hard to enforce and others contended would encourage
illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission announced this week
that it would for the first time extend broad anti-discrimination
rights to workers who are illegal immigrants, a policy that some
lawyers said might be hard to enforce because immigrants might fear
deportation if they assert these rights.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC said Tuesday that illegal immigrants who are dismissed
or discriminated against because of their race, sex, age or
religion should enjoy the same remedies as legal workers _ back
pay, punitive damages and even reinstatement, but reinstatement
coming only if they have first obtained legal work papers.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy faces several enforcement problems, among them
that illegal aliens might be too scared to file discrimination
complaints with the EEOC and are likely to have difficulty
obtaining official work documents.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC said it issued the new policy because it wanted to
ensure that employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens were not
free to discriminate against them without facing any penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the Clinton administration's immigration policies
attacked the decision, insisting that extending remedies like
reinstatement and back pay to illegal immigrants would only
encourage more such immigrants to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole policy is creating an atmosphere hostile to
removing illegal immigrants from the labor force,'' said Daniel
Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group pushing for stricter
limits on immigration. ``The EEOC is putting itself in the position
of a mother superior seeking to gather and protect the undocumented
flock.''
</P>
<P>
   EEOC Chairwoman Ida Castro asserted that without the policy
announced Tuesday, unscrupulous employers would feel encouraged to
hire illegal aliens with an eye to exploiting them. She said the
policy would discourage such discrimination and exploitation by
guaranteeing illegal aliens the same anti-discrimination
protections as U.S. citizens and resident aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro said, ``If you let employers just breach civil rights
requirements for a group of workers such as undocumented workers,
then you're indirectly supporting the hiring of this group and the
violation of our laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics suggested that the Clinton administration pushed
the EEOC to embrace this new policy as a way to win support for
Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign among three
important Democratic constituencies: labor unions, minorities and
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, which endorsed Gore two weeks ago, has pushed hard
for the EEOC to adopt this policy, arguing that failure to enforce
discrimination laws for illegal aliens encouraged employers to hire
them and undercut workplace conditions for all workers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and EEOC officials said politics had nothing to
do with the new EEOC policy.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO general counsel John Hiatt said the labor federation has
long pushed for this policy partly because of concerns that failing
to crack down on discrimination against illegal workers can create
an atmosphere that allows discrimination of documented workers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a very welcome set of guidelines,'' Hiatt said. ``The
exploitation of undocumented workers lowers wages, benefits and
conditions for documented workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new policy continues a trend in which the federal government
has extended more and more protections to illegal immigrants. They
are covered by minimum-wage and occupational-safety laws. And The
National Labor Relations Board has ruled that employers who
knowingly hire illegal aliens are prohibited from dismissing them
if they support unionization.
</P>
<P>
   Attracted in part by contingency fees and attorneys fees, some
lawyers have moved aggressively to file suits charging that
employers have violated minimum wage laws for undocumented workers.
Some business organizations voiced fears that lawyers might seek to
do the same in filing discrimination claims on behalf of illegal
aliens.
</P>
<P>
   One fear that some business executives expressed is that if they
hire illegal aliens without knowing of their undocumented status
and later dismiss those workers upon learning of that status, the
angered workers might file discrimination suits, charging that they
were fired because of their race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said they adopted the new policy after
encountering what they said were horrific examples of
discrimination against illegal immigrants.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These officials described one illegal immigrant who was
dismissed after refusing to provide sexual favors to her boss. EEOC
officials also described a group of Vietnamese workers who were
illegally segregated from other workers on a fishing vessel. These
officials also described instances in which managers retaliated
against illegal aliens by dismissing them after they sought to
report racial discrimination or sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unauthorized workers are especially vulnerable to abuse and
exploitation,'' Ms. Castro said. ``It is imperative for employers
to fully understand that discrimination against this class of
employees will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid a clash with the nation's immigration laws, the
EEOC said it would push for reinstatement for illegal aliens who
had been discriminated against only when those aliens have first
obtained papers authorizing them to work in the United States. But
the EEOC said it would recommend back pay whether or not the
immigrants had working papers.
</P>
<P>
   EEOC officials said the new policy would help not just illegal
aliens, but also their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If employers were not held responsible for discriminating
against unauthorized workers, it would create an incentive for
unscrupulous employers to employ and exploit these workers,'' the
commission said. ``It would also harm authorized workers who might
be denied these jobs or be subjected to a workplace which tolerated
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigration has been a controversial issue in recent
decades, as many Americans insist that illegal aliens are an
unwanted public charge, while others say they are hard workers who
contribute to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration
Forum, a Washington-based group that promotes immigrants' rights,
praised the EEOC, saying, ``This new policy says that if you're
working, we're not gong to be complicit in giving employers an open
door to using your illegal status to hit workers over the head with
discriminations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharry acknowledged that many illegal aliens might be too
timid to file discrimination charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sharry said the new policy was bound to stir controversy because
it pits two fundamental concerns against each other: the desire to
limit illegal immigrations and the desire to combat discrimination
on the basis of race, sex, age or religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mismatch between the debate and the reality,'' he
said. ``Lots of workers who some people say are criminals because
they entered illegally are actually hard-working, tax-paying
immigrants who are working hard to make a better lives for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, in one of the strongest backlashes against illegal
immigration, Californians passed a proposition that barred state
money for education, health care or other services for illegal
aliens. A U.S. District Court in Los Angeles has partially enjoined
enforcement of the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   John Findley, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, one of
the initiative's main sponsors, criticized the EEOC's new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it should be a nonstarter because an illegal alien by
definition is in the country unlawfully,'' he said. `That
individual has no right to the job in question. To force an
employer to rehire an individual with back pay and subject the
employers to sanctions seems to me ridiculous.''

IN ITS BIGGEST CAMPAIGN, FUJI PLAYS DOWN TECHNOLOGY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They're the photos that people really wish their
colleagues would keep to themselves. The baby sleeping. The
teen-ager on the phone. The dog's face in close-up. They document
the everyday moments of interest to no one but the closest of kin
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But to Joan Rutherford, marketing vice president for Fuji Photo
Film USA, they are the ``bookmarks of life, the everyday rituals
people are least likely to take pictures of but are most likely to
want to remember.'' And they are the backbone of a national
campaign _ Fuji's biggest ever, Ms. Rutherford said _ which began
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not about taking the camera out of the closet
on birthdays and holidays,'' said Howard Sherman, president of
Angotti, Thomas, Hedge in New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group
of Companies, which is the Fuji agency. ``It's about capturing
sentiments.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite an exclusive idea. Since the spring, marketing
executives at the Eastman Kodak Co., Fuji's archrival, have been
talking to industry and investor groups, saying they realize they
cannot live by graduations and bar mitzvahs alone, and that their
new strategy was to stress the everyday moments, too. The company's
ads have used a photograph-your-basic-life approach far longer than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kodak showed ``The Lobster Dinner,'' a funny spot
about photographing a child chasing an escaped lobster across the
kitchen floor. Now, it is putting on ``Take One and Pass It On,''
in which a bunch of teen-agers pass around a single-use camera to
photograph whatever strikes their fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled that Fuji is joining us in trying to build the
industry,'' said David N. Hardie, vice president for marketing in
Kodak's consumer imaging business _ who insists he speaks with not
one bit of sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fuji's campaign differs from Kodak's in many ways. For
one thing, each of the Kodak spots, which at 30 seconds are twice
the length of Fuji's, is promoting the virtues of a particular kind
of Kodak film. The scampering lobster and child needed high-speed
(translation: high priced and high margin) Max film to capture,
while the pass-it-on spot would only work with a cheap disposable
camera that would not be a catastrophe to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, Kodak advertised concepts and Fuji advertised
products, but lately, they've reversed roles,'' said Ulysses
Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman &AMP; Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji's campaign is uncharacteristically vague about product.
Sure, it features the Fuji logo, and Fuji film. But the five
15-second spots, along with five print ads that started running in
news magazines last week, make no attempt to trade customers up or
down on product quality or price. They simply feature a photograph
with a two-sentence tag-line _ ``Angels do exist'' for the sleeping
baby, for example, followed by ``They also wake up screaming'' _
and a quick fade out to ``Get the picture with Fuji film'' as a
voice-over says, ``Capture every day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fuji, which until now has concentrated on promoting its
products and technology, this is a turnabout that Ms. Rutherford
insists represents the culmination of years of focus groups and
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows that people are interested in the relevancy
of the photograph, and that they see the product and technology as
just a silent partner in the picture-taking experience'' Ms.
Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fuji and Kodak are less interested in grabbing each other's
customers than they are in accelerating the growth of what is
already a robust market for amateur photography. The numbers are
often in dispute, but most experts concur that the United States
consumer film industry is growing at a double-digit clip. Fuji's
share of that market has been steadily rising, and through 1997
most of that growth came out of Kodak's hide.
</P>
<P>
   But photography analysts say that Fuji is now grabbing its share
away from private-label films, not from Kodak. Kodak's share of
consumer film sales has been holding steady at nearly 70 percent
for a couple of years now, and even crept up a bit in the last
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fuji's main objective were to steal share from Kodak, it
would make the image quality of its film the hallmark of its
campaign, just as Kodak has done,'' said Steve Hoffenberg, an
imaging industry analyst at Lyra Research, a market research firm
in Newton, Mass. ``But Fuji's and Kodak's products are pretty
comparable by now, so Fuji is trying to pound its brand identity
deeper into people's awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, neither company will divulge its advertising budget.
But most analysts say that for the last three years, Kodak has been
spending about $100 million annually on promotions and ads.
Analysts say that Fuji's budget is closer to $20 million, a record
for that company. By sticking to 15-second spots, Fuji could afford
to buy time on expensive shows like `` E.R.'', ``Friends'' and
``Frasier'' and to take space in news weeklies like Time and
People.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Fuji's largest branding campaign initiative ever, and
we're going to run it aggressively for the near future,'' Sherman
said. ``We're 100 percent confident it will make a difference in
the marketplace.''

DESPITE STRONGER YEN, SONY MANAGES SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The stronger yen delivered a punch to Sony Corp. but the
blow was less severe than it might have been, thanks to strong
sales of personal computers and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in corporate tax rates in Japan helped Sony post a
profit of 46.5 billion yen ($445 million) in the quarter that ended
Sept. 30, up 3.1 percent from 45.1 billion yen ($432 million) in
the same period last year. But operating profits slid 37 percent to
70.2 billion yen, and sales fell 6.8 percent to 1.6 trillion yen
($15.3 billion), largely due to the yen's appreciation, the company
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very vulnerable to exchange rates,'' Masayoshi Morimoto,
corporate senior executive vice president, said in an interview.
``The only thing we can do is cut back costs, not just in the areas
of the labor and overhead of the company, but also by shifting
production.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had assumed the yen would trade at an average of 115
to the dollar in this fiscal year, but in the second quarter, the
yen averaged 112.7 to the dollar, rising 23.3 percent against the
dollar and 30.7 percent against the euro. Like most other companies
here, not to mention the government and the central bank, Sony was
caught by surprise by the yen's rapid appreciation and had not
hedged itself against such a dramatic move.
</P>
<P>
   Had the yen remained within the company's original projections,
sales in the second quarter would have increased by 9 percent and
operating income would have been up by 25 percent compared with the
period a year earlier, Sony said. The company said it had hedged to
protect itself for 90 percent of its foreign exchange requirements
in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you discount the impact of the yen, in every market _ the
U.S., Europe and Japan _ we are growing by more than double digit
increases'' on a percentage basis, Morimoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's sales in Japan climbed 15 percent in the second quarter,
while sales in the United States were up 10 percent, and sales in
Europe rose 13 percent. Morimoto said sales of the company's Vaio
laptops and digital cameras like the Mavica and a new video camera
that uses 8 mm film were especially good.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Play Station, the game console that has driven Sony's
earnings for the last few years, slid in the second quarter and
will probably continue to decline until the introduction next March
of Play Station 2, an entertainment center that will combine
electronic gaming with access to the Internet, DVD and a host of
other capabilities.

UCLA'S AWFUL SEASON FOUR YEARS IN MAKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last spring, long before the handicapped-parking
scandal or the 55-7 loss to Oregon State, UCLA's athletic
department selected ``Do You Believe?'' as its marketing theme for
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Right idea, wrong execution.
</P>
<P>
   The season has challenged belief, for sure, but not as UCLA
intended. Spring optimism became summer embarrassment and fall
frustration. From the disabled-parking suspensions to the injuries
and inexperience and poor play, it's been a disappointing season
for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as November approaches, the two-time defending Pac-10
champs are in last place, they have lost four of their last five,
and they must defeat Arizona, Washington and USC to become
bowl-eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe . . . this mess?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're a struggling football team,'' Bruins coach
Bob Toledo said. ``We have three games remaining. The important
thing is to focus on Arizona (Saturday), then we have a bye week to
regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   Is one week enough time to solve problems 4{ years in the
making?
</P>
<P>
   Lonely at the top
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's greatest problems are its small senior class, lack of
leadership and reliance on underclassmen. All three can be traced
to February '95, when former coach Terry Donahue signed his final
recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   It produced talent at the top (Cade McNown, Kris Farris) but
little depth. Three players left school. Three had career-ending
injuries. Three were forced to play as freshmen and have exhausted
their eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 17 players signed _ players who should be fifth-year
seniors _ six remain.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue resigned 10 months later. By the time Toledo was hired
in January, '96, he had just three weeks to recruit. His
hastily-compiled class has produced no elite players. Of the 18
signees, only 11 remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins should have 20-22 seniors. Instead, because of
injuries and attrition, they have 12 _ the second-smallest senior
class in the league. Of the 12, only six start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be a leader when you're not playing,'' Toledo
said. ``And then when you play, you have to lead by example. I
think the players are really concerned about doing their own thing
right now, as opposed to leading.''
</P>
<P>
   If substandard recruiting damaged the offense, it devastated the
defense. UCLA signed 14 defensive recruits in 1995 and '96. Several
retired because of injury (Mike Wiley, Ramogi Huma, Anselmo
Zamano). Two are hurt this season (Jason Bell, Travor Turner). Two
left the team (Damian Allen, Langston Woodberry). Two switched to
offense (Micah and Josh Webb). A few play sparingly (Eric
Whitfield, Billy Pieper and Jason Zdenek).
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, only one of the 14 is a regular this season:
defensive tackle/captain Pete Holland. The recruiting years that
should have produced the bulk of a veteran defense instead produced
one starter.
</P>
<P>
   Primary Problems
</P>
<P>
   Injuries, attrition and recruiting mistakes hit the secondary
and offensive line hardest.
</P>
<P>
   There are three first-time starters on the line. One of the
veterans, left guard Oscar Cabrera, was suspended for his
involvement in the parking scandal and hasn't played as expected;
the other, right tackle Brian Polak, practices sparingly because of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins wouldn't be in this position if six players hadn't
left school, gotten hurt or changed positions in the past year.
Jeff Wright and Scott Wiegand quit; Steve Morgan moved to defense;
Dave Wilford failed out; Kris Farris turned pro last spring; and
Josh Webb is out for the year with a bad shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Had Farris returned, redshirt freshman Blake Worley would be a
reserve and true freshman Bryce Bohlander would be redshirting.
Instead, Worley's starting before he's ready, and Bohlander's
playing a year too soon.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary is equally chaotic, with four freshmen among the
top eight players. The explanation is simple: The Bruins signed
eight defensive backs from 1995-97, and (begin ital)none(end ital)
is a full-time player in the secondary. (Note: Cornerback Ryan
Roques was signed as a tailback/receiver in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Ali Abdul Azziz and Ryan Nece moved to
linebacker; Whitfield and Zdenek play sparingly; Allen quit; Bell's
hurt; Marques Anderson's suspended and Jason Stephens was benched
early in the season for poor play.
</P>
<P>
   Not one, not two, but three lost recruiting years in the
secondary. Impossible to overcome. &QL; 
QB, or not QB
</P>
<P>
   McNown won 30 games for UCLA in four years, but he's
inadvertently lost a few for them this season. His durability (no
games missed because of injury) prevented the Bruins from
developing a successor.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only problem. Toledo and offensive
coordinator Al Borges spent two seasons preparing Drew Bennett to
replace McNown. After two starts, Bennett lost his job to redshirt
freshman Cory Paus. Three weeks later, Bennett moved to receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Bruins misjudged the situation, Toledo said: ``I
don't think so.'' But he agreed the month-long quarterback
competition between Bennett and Paus slowed Paus' development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he would be a little bit better,'' Toledo said. ``How
much better, I really don't know. That's hard to tell.'' &QL; 
Shooting blanks
</P>
<P>
   Last year, tailback DeShaun Foster and receivers Danny Farmer
and Brian Poli-Dixon combined for 31 of UCLA's 62 touchdowns. This
year, the playmakers have scored eight.
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon's out for the season with a broken wrist. Foster has
three carries in October because of a sprained ankle. Farmer missed
two games with a sprained ankle and played sparingly at Oregon
State because of a strained groin. In addition, big-play receiver
Freddie Mitchell is a step slow because of an aching knee.
</P>
<P>
   With a young line and rookie quarterback, every possession's an
adventure. Subtract your three biggest weapons, and production
plummets: UCLA's seven points against Cal and Oregon State is its
lowest two-game total in 35 years. &QL; 
Parking problems
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the disabled-parking scandal didn't end with 10
players missing two games and an 11th, Anderson, missing the
season. Because six were seniors, the suspensions were another
strike against upperclass leadership. It's hard to demand respect
when your pleading no contest to a horrific lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only two of the 12 seniors (Farmer and Holland)
have the moral authority to lead in the locker room and on the
field. And asking two to lead 103 is a bit much.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's another explanation for UCLA's predicament _
more powerful than subpar recruiting, injuries, suspensions,
inexperience and poor leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmic justice.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit the disabled, after all, and bad karma is sure to
follow. Perhaps the season was doomed before it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That idea has passed through my mind, too,'' offensive tackle
Brian Polak said. ``It's just bad luck. You can't prove it, and you
can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can definitely believe it.

HEWLETT PACKARD'S SHARES SLIDE AMID LOWER PROFIT FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares in Hewlett-Packard Co. fell more than 12
percent Wednesday after analysts suggested an earnings short-fall
in the fourth quarter, which ends this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard warned Oct. 1 that sales growth might slow but
said it still expected to meet earnings projections. Marlene
Somsak, a company spokeswoman, said Hewlett-Packard had not issued
any formal guidance since then but had continued to express concern
to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares fell $9.625, or 12.6 percent, to close at
$67 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 41 percent
from a record $118.4375 in July, gaining just 3 percent so far in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, cut his
fourth-quarter estimate by five cents to 73 cents. He said he now
expected sales growth of 6 percent, to $10.8 billion. He had
earlier estimated 10 percent growth, to $11.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now think Unix servers, which we thought would grow
modestly, will be down,'' Milunovich said, adding that enterprise
storage products and personal computer sales may also suffer.
``Although the company didn't point to it in a big way, I think Y2K
may be having some impact, and PC sales may have slowed in
anticipation of Microsoft Windows 2000 release.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. said Tuesday that Windows 2000, the successor to
Windows NT, would be delayed until Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Mona Eriba, an analyst with Gruntal &AMP; Co., lowered her fourth
quarter estimate to 70 cents a share from 77 cents, excluding the
results of Agilent, Hewlett-Packard's test and measurement
equipment business, which is being spun off into a separate
company. Dan Niles of Robertson Stephens reduced his estimate to 73
cents from 82 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In its Oct. 1 warning, Hewlett-Packard said its fourth quarter
revenue growth would fall at the low end of estimates because of
slow sales of its Unix servers and the disruption of its parts
supply pipeline following the Taiwan earthquake. Carly Fiorina, who
joined Hewlett-Packard as president and chief executive in July,
laid much of the blame on the company's North American sales force.
She said poor performers would be dismissed and a new compensation
plan would be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Sales growth in Unix systems remains constrained but most other
parts of the business are healthy, Ms. Somsak said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard will report its fourth quarter financial results
on Nov. 17; its quiet period begins Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   One continuing issue for Hewlett-Packard has been the weakness
in sales of its Unix servers and workstations, particularly when
compared with Sun Microsystems Inc., its arch-rival, which had a
record quarter. In a conference call with securities analysts
earlier this month, Sun president Ed Zander said Ms. Fiorina should
not blame Hewlett-Packard's sales force for poor Unix sales, but
should instead blame the Sun sales force for luring away customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Hewlett-Packard has been losing share in the Unix market to
Sun for some time. Although Hewlett-Packard now has a competitive
product line, analysts said the company still lacks the focus Sun
brings to the market. Sun's message is that Unix is the most robust
operating system and that its version of Unix, Solaris, is the most
advanced. Hewlett-Packard, in contrast, sells both Unix servers and
servers that run Microsoft's Windows NT, thus diluting its efforts,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard customers may also be delaying computer
purchases while they wait for the Year 2000 problem to be resolved.
The Y2K issue prompted IBM to warn last week of lower earnings in
its fourth and first quarters.

 &HT;    DH duty done well by novice
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees entered the three games at Yankee Stadium
with a big advantage at designated hitter, but the Braves came
through first.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez, making the second appearance of his career as a
designated hitter Tuesday, drove in two runs with a double to left
field off Andy Pettitte to give the Braves a 4-1 lead in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez stranded runners at second and third in the first
inning when he grounded out to Derek Jeter, but he answered in his
next at-bat, sending the first pitch from Pettitte into the
left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to be tough doing it for the first time,''
Hernandez said before the game. ``I know we've had trouble scoring
runs, so I'm going to try to be patient at the plate and get on
base any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez entered the game hitting .143 in the postseason and
was benched after Game 4 of the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have a little bit more experience going tonight in
Keith Lockhart, who will face right-hander Roger Clemens. Lockhart
was the DH in four of the Braves' nine interleague games in
American League parks this season, going 6-for-17 (.353) with a
double, four RBIs and five runs scored. Coming into this season,
Lockhart had hit .255 (12-for-47) as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   NO TEAM MEETING
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox didn't feel the need to make any special
speeches to the Braves despite their 2-0 deficit entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just some pats on the back and stuff like that,'' Cox said.
``We had (a team meeting) before we started this thing. They're
professionals. Nothing we can do about the past, but we have to be
positive about each game. We can't try to win four tonight. We have
to play one at a whack.''
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Perez will have arthroscopic surgery to repair
torn cartilage in his left knee on Nov. 4. He's been playing on a
sore right knee as well, so he will have an MRI on both knees and
his sore left shoulder the day before surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Lopez said Tuesday he has completed the 2 1/2-month
physical therapy on his right knee after surgery for a torn
anterior cruciate ligament, and his range of motion is nearly the
same now as his left knee. Now it's just a matter of working out
and increasing his strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time and letting it heal on its own,''
Lopez said. ``I've still got a long way to go before spring
training, but it's coming along real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez won't start swinging a bat until next month. For now he's
focused on losing weight. He's up to 230 pounds and would like to
get down to 215 for spring training, which would be lighter than
his usual playing weight because he wants to put as little pressure
on his knees as possible.
</P>
<P>
   UNAFRAID OF CLEMENS
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Don Baylor said the Braves should be thinking the
pressure is on Yankees starter Clemens tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some things to prove to the fans,'' Baylor said. ``Why
not see if we can rattle him a little bit?''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was a teammate of Clemens in Boston when he set a
major-league record with 20 strikeouts against the Mariners on
April 29, 1986. Baylor said Clemens' velocity is down from the
mid-90s to the lower 90s and his control is off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the same type of pitcher,'' Baylor said. ``His
control is all over.''

GORE DOES THE LITTLE ATTACKING IN JOINT CAMPAIGN ENCOUNTER WITH
BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H._ Vice President Al Gore, in his first televised
encounter with former Sen. Bill Bradley Wednesday night, pointedly
but gently pressed his rival to defend his costly proposals that he
warned would ``shred the social safety net.'' But on a panoply of
issues, the two candidates for the Democratic presidential
nomination agreed more than they disagreed as they appealed to
liberal primary voters for stepped up financing on mental health,
special education and environmental measures and for more stringent
laws protecting homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore occasionally disparaged Bradley's stands on health
care, school vouchers and foreign affairs, Bradley refused to be
ruffled or prodded into responding during an hourlong Town
Hall-like forum at Dartmouth College. Instead, Bradley spoke
broadly about his own proposals and _ in an subtle suggestion that
Gore does not offer big ideas _ said the presidency is about ``big
solutions to big problems'' and ``about dreaming and trying to
fulfill those dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moments when Gore tried to put Bradley on the
defensive, the event was rather amicable. The two rivals, who for
years served together in the Senate, chatted amicably as they sat
side by side on stools and referred to each other as ``Bill'' and
``Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore, confronted by polls in this state showing that
Bradley has a slight edge, sought to undermine his challenger by
criticizing his proposals as excessively costly. The vice president
presented himself, by contrast, as more fiscally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Before even 10 minutes had passed, Gore condemned Bradley's
health care proposal, asserting that it would cost ``more than the
entire surplus over the next 10 years.'' He said: ``You're going to
shred the social safety net _ so the cost is way excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, Bradley calmly refuted Gore's criticism.
``I want to make one clarification,'' he said, adding, ``I dispute
the cost the cost figure that Al has used.'' And he made no
apologies, saying of his health care plan, ``It's a big problem,
and it needs a big solution to that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore did not stop. Referring to Bradley, he said, ``If the
entire surplus is spent, there's no new money for education.'' He
also questioned Bradley on foreign policy saying, ``I think we were
right to go into East Timor _ Bill disagreed with that.'' And he
took a jab at Bradley for supporting school vouchers on a limited
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put on the defensive himself in the first question from
the audience. He found himself forced to defend President Clinton
after the scandals of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward
President Clinton and I've felt it myself,'' he said. ``I also feel
that the American people want to move on and turn the page and
focus on the future and not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Gore's critiques, Bradley pressed his own stands on
issues such as gay rights. He drew perhaps the biggest round of
applause of the evening when he called for changing the 1964 civil
rights act to include homosexuals and for allowing gays to openly
serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it's important that we can talk about gay
Americans and realize they are our neighbors, our bosses,'' he
said. ``They are no different in many ways than all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, reflecting a looser style on the campaign trail in recent
weeks, was particularly aggressive Wednesday night. He repeatedly
sought to connect with questioners by asking them about their
families. He also jumped off his stool often and strolled toward
the questioners in the audience behind and in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an informality not customary for the vice president,
Gore acted very much like the insurgent. He asked the audience to
begin questioning him even before the event began _ and he made a
point before the end to announce that would stick around to chat
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was far less aggressive, but he appeared comfortable on
stage. In some ways, his serious, calmer demeanor was more fitting
of an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The event Wednesday night, billed as a ``town meeting,'' was not
a traditional debate because the candidates did not have an
opportunity to directly question one another. Instead, Gore and
Bradley were quizzed by voters selected in a lottery by the Nelson
A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   But it was arguably the most critical hour thus far in the
Democratic competition because it was the highest profile event
featuring Gore and Bradley on the same stage _ and in the state
that will hold the first primary, on Feb. 1. The event, televised
live nationally by CNN and in New Hampshire by WMUR, drew hundreds
of reporters _ the most of any Democratic event of the campaign
season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At several points, Gore sought to show that Bradley was
proposing programs that would spend more money than is available in
the federal surplus. At one point, a woman asked Bradley if he
would work to ensure that the federal government pays its full
share for educating disabled students, as required under law.
Bradley said he would, then added that he would also seek to
finance a scholarship program that would place 60,000 new teachers
into disadvantage areas each year.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was then asked what he would do to end violence in
schools, he did not answer the question right away, but instead
returned to Bradley's previous remarks. ``If the entire surplus is
spent, then there is no money left over for new initiative on
education,'' Gore said. ``The numbers have to add up.''
</P>
<P>
   On his next question, about the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, Bradley responded to Gore's attack, saying that his
proposals would not eat up the entire surplus. ``We each have our
own experts,'' Bradley said. ``I dispute the cost figure that Al
has used.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he, like Bradley, did not support legalizing gay
marriages, but would endorse extending the same legal rights to gay
and lesbian partners that are now held by married couples. But he
said he opposed Bradley's idea of expanding the Civil Rights Act of
1964, adding that he thought most gay rights and civil rights
leaders agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   On education, one questioner, a teacher, asked how to change the
school system, saying there was a crisis in the schools in part
because the nation spent money on ``smart bombs'' not on ``smart
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that the most important ingredient in improving the
schools was a spirit and a ``willingness to try things that might
break through.'' But apart from doubling the funding for Head
Start, he was not specific, saying he wanted to create the kind of
spirit that Presidential Franklin D. Roosevelt did in overcoming
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Asked a similar question, Gore again sought to cast himself as
more fiscally responsible, saying, ``Some problems will require
more money, but it's about standards, accountability and reforms.''
He went on to say that he had been endorsed by the national
teachers unions, but still favored ``tough future testing for new
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at Bradley, Gore added that one experiment he opposed
was using vouchers, which Bradley has supported.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Gore, the forum got off to an unusual start. Twenty
minutes before the event was scheduled to begin, the two candidates
came onto the stage, adjusting their mikes and getting comfortable
in their wooden stools while the moderators were still backstage.
Suddenly, Gore, playing the master of ceremonies, walked to center
stage and said to the audience, ``Why don't you all ask us some
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A person in the crowd asked about how the two candidates would
overcome the fiercely partisan relationship between the White House
and Congress. In a lengthy answer that went well beyond the 90
seconds that would be allowed during the actual forum, Gore
recalled how Thomas Jefferson had run what he called a
``terrifically partisan'' campaign in 1800, but then had cordial
relations with Congress after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Following his answer, Gore turned to Bradley, who looked a
little surprised, and said, ``Bill?'' Bradley followed with a
discussion of how a healthy dose of civility would reduce
partisanship in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Though the scene was not being televised live on CNN, it was
broadcast to the press room where reporters were able to record it.

GERALD TRAUTMAN, EX-CHIEF AND AVID BUILDER OF GREYHOUND, DIES AT
87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald H. Trautman, a retired chairman, president and chief
executive of the Greyhound Corp., died Monday at a hospital in
Phoenix, where he lived. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Trautman, a lawyer, took over the struggling bus
company and built it largely through acquisitions in the 1970s,
when conglomerates were popular. By the time he retired in 1982,
Greyhound was one of the 50 largest corporations in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Trautman, Greyhound bought Armour/Dial, a meat processor
and soap maker twice its size, and made other acquisitions, large
and small, in fields as diverse as car rentals and financial
services. At one point, he directed 150 companies with 57,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Greyhound is now part of the Viad Corp., which also owns a share
of the Arizona Diamondbacks professional baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hough Trautman was born on Aug. 27, 1912, in Petoskey,
Mich. He graduated from Stanford University and earned a law degree
at Harvard Law School. He practiced law in San Francisco, and
during World War II, he served in the Navy's Adjutant General
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer in San Francisco, Trautman represented Greyhound,
among other companies. He later became the vice president and
general counsel of Greyhound and negotiated numerous acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Trautman phased out his law practice to become
president of Greyhound and later its chairman and chief executive.
He also moved the corporate headquarters to Phoenix from Chicago in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Trautman retired from Greyhound in 1982, but continued to serve
on its board, as well as on the boards of 20th Century Fox, Lehman
Brothers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Salk Institute.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Barbara; six sons, Gerald H.
Trautman Jr. of Newport Beach, Calif., William E. Trautman of San
Francisco, Tucker K. Trautman of Denver, Timothy Trautman of Los
Angeles, and Christopher and Thomas Trautman of Phoenix, and eight
grandchildren.

SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW USE OF ELECTRIC CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ala., Ga., Neb., Ohio, S.C., Va., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prompted by several flawed executions in Florida's electric
chair, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review for the first
time whether electrocution violates the Constitution. By taking the
case, legal scholars said Wednesday, the court will inevitably
refresh its definition of cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The electric chair was introduced in 1890 in New York as a more
humane method of execution but has been abandoned by most states as
less humane than lethal injection. Several bloody malfunctions of
the Florida electric chair have drawn public attention, but have
not moved the state's legislature to adopt other methods of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision to review a case challenging the
constitutionality of Florida's electric chair, announced on Tuesday
night, stays the executions of two murderers who were scheduled to
die this week in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could temporarily bar executions in Florida and
three other states _ Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska _ where
electrocution is the only method of execution. And the ultimate
decision could bar electrocution in three other states _ Ohio,
South Carolina and Virginia_ that allow it if the condemned person
chooses it.
</P>
<P>
   Florida legislative leaders said Wednesday that they would
consider calling a special session of the legislature to add an
option for lethal injection so that executions could continue.
Florida ranks third in the nation in the number of executions that
have taken place in recent decades, behind Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican, called the court's
decision disappointing because families of victims would have to
wait for justice to be served. He said he was exploring all options
to keep the death penalty alive in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody photographs of Allen Lee Davis, who was executed in
Florida in July, have been posted on the Internet and will be part
of the evidence reviewed by the Supreme Court. Davis, who killed a
pregnant woman and her two young daughters in 1982, had a nosebleed
just before he was electrocuted. Blood seeped through his shirt and
the buckle holes of the chest strap.
</P>
<P>
   In two earlier executions in Florida, in 1990 and 1997, flames
shot out from the masks of the inmates and the smell of burned
flesh filled the witness room. Similar malfunctions have occurred
in other states, not only with electrocutions but also with lethal
injections.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, opponents of the death penalty said they were
surprised that the Supreme Court agreed to take the case. The
method of execution has been a tangential part of the legal and
legislative battles over the death penalty, which have focused in
the past decade on procedures for appeals and the minimum age at
which capital punishment can be applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of Alabama embraced lethal injection, this
wouldn't be a fairer place,'' said Bryan A. Stevenson, director of
the Equal Justice Initiative, which represents inmates on Alabama's
death row. ``But when the legislature says, `We want to see people
burn, we want to see people suffer,' it becomes more of a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta the Georgia attorney general, Thurbert Baker, a
Democrat, said the state would continue to execute inmates in its
electric chair while the Supreme Court considers the case. ``It is
still the law of the land here in this state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, which already is reviewing the fairness of its
death penalty, Gov. Mike Johanns, a Republican who supports the
death penalty, said he would not instruct the state's attorney
general to change its procedures in death penalty cases. But
Nebraska has not executed anyone in the last two years, and is
already reviewing the fairness of its death penalty in a study
ordered by the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, contained
in the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, has been described by
the Supreme Court as ``an evolving standard of decency.''
Throughout most of the nation's history, hanging was the popular
method of execution in most states.
</P>
<P>
   In 1890, as public hangings were increasingly considered
barbaric, New York State used the electric chair to execute William
Kemmler, who had hacked his lover to death.
</P>
<P>
   Kemmler's case went to the Supreme Court, but the court did not
decide whether electrocution was cruel and unusual. Instead, it
found pre-emptively that the Eighth Amendment did not apply to the
states. It was not until 1962 that the court reversed course,
making the Eighth Amendment the last of the Bill of Rights to apply
to the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has never reviewed evidence whether any
method of execution violates the Eighth Amendment,'' said Deborah
W. Denno, a professor of law at Fordham University who has written
extensively on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Electrocution was ultimately adopted by 26 states, but none
after 1949. Lethal injection was first used in Texas in 1982. It
has now been chosen by 34 of the 38 states that have death penalty
laws, either as the only method or as a choice given to the
condemned.
</P>
<P>
   If the court sets a new standard of what ``cruel and unusual''
means, it could set terms for other attacks on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it cruel the way the death penalty arbitrarily strikes in
one city and not another, that those with good lawyers are spared
and those with bad lawyers aren't?'' said Richard C. Dieter,
executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a
Washington nonprofit group that opposes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis could be overly hopeful for opponents of the death
penalty, said Professor Denno of Fordham, who testified as an
expert in the Florida cases at the state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court spent a lot of time developing standards of cruel
and unusual punishment, relatively generous standards, particularly
in the area of prison conditions,'' Professor Denno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the court has never seen pictures of an inmate sitting on
a chair with blood on his face,'' she continued. ``The state of
Florida always says, `It's a fluke, an unforeseeable accident.' The
court might say: `It's no longer a fluke. It's a pattern.'''

LEONARD E. BOYLE, WHO MODERNIZED VATICAN LIBRARY, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Leonard E. Boyle, the former keeper of manuscripts and
chief librarian of the Vatican Library, who was dismissed from his
post in 1997, died on Monday in Rome. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle died of cancer, said Ambrogio Piazzoni, vice prefect of
the Vatican Library.
</P>
<P>
   The library is one of the world's greatest storehouses of
ancient books and manuscripts. Whether because of carelessness,
shadowy ecclesiastical politics or plain bad luck, Boyle, a highly
respected Oxford-trained paleographer, or student of manuscripts,
became involved in several imbroglios toward the end of his 13-year
tenure as keeper that tarnished an otherwise sterling reputation
and led to his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials refuse to discuss the circumstances
surrounding Boyle's departure. Piazzoni would only say: ``Everyone
has to leave some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others outside the Vatican were more forthcoming. ``What goes on
inside the Vatican is anybody's guess, but Boyle's opening of
access to materials in the library must have played a role in his
departure,'' said James H. Marrow, an emeritus professor of art
history at Princeton University who has worked at the Vatican
Library. ``He had a great impact on the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and supporters praise Boyle for having computerized the
library's ancient catalogs, wired the main reading room for
laptops, hired women for the first time and liberalized the strict
dress code. Others suggest that the liberalization measures and
Boyle's trustfulness were the seeds of his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995 Anthony Melnikas, a professor of art at Ohio State
University, was found to have stolen from the Vatican Library two
leaves from a medieval manuscript once owned by Petrarch, the
14th-century Italian poet. Melnikas was sentenced to 14 months in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle was stunned by the theft by a man he considered a friend;
he was criticized as an unwitting accomplice for having granted
Melnikas many special privileges in the library, including allowing
him the free run of the institution in August, when it is closed to
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a year after the Melnikas affair, the Vatican was
obliged to pay $8.8 million plus $1.3 million in attorneys' fees to
settle a lawsuit stemming from Boyle's sale to a California
entrepreneur of exclusive world rights to reproduce the images in
the Library.
</P>
<P>
   His object, he insisted, had been to raise money to pay for a
modernization program, but the Holy See accused him of acting
without authority _ a charge he contested. Boyle's offer to take
early retirement in order to discourage gossip was not accepted; he
was dismissed three weeks before the 13th anniversary of his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Eugene Boyle was born on Nov. 13, 1923, in Ballintra,
County Donegal, Ireland. He was educated in Gaelic and entered the
Dominican order at Cork in 1943. He then went to Oxford University,
where he discovered his passion for medieval manuscripts. He was
ordained a priest in 1949 and soon became a widely published and
prize-winning scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to Toronto, he taught at the Pontifical Institute of
Mediaeval Studies, and in 1961 also taught at the neighboring
Center for Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto. He was
employed by the Vatican Library in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A playfully witty man, Boyle disparaged suggestions that he
might be positioning himself to become a cardinal. ``I'm not
interested in some second-rate job,'' he said. ``The papacy or
nothing!''

<P>
   Robert Edward Blum, a retired business executive and civic
leader who was an early problem solver for Lincoln Center, died
Friday at his home in Salisbury, Conn. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, Blum graduated from Yale University in
1921, and the following year joined Abraham &AMP; Straus, the Brooklyn
department store founded by his grandfather, Abraham Abraham. He
retired in 1964 as a vice president and secretary, also serving as
a director and vice president of Federated Department Stores from
1944 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   After ending his full-time business career, he continued as a
director on several corporate boards and worked with community
agencies, especially in the environmental field. He also maintained
his interest in New York City's many cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Blum had an early role in the development of Lincoln Center for
the Performing Arts, serving as treasurer from 1956 to 1963. He had
been a director emeritus since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected honorary trustee of the American Museum of
Natural History in 1970, crowning his nearly 50 years of support
for the institution. He became a trustee of the Brooklyn Museum of
Art and remained a member of its advisory board and honorary
trustee until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He also had ties for many years with the Brooklyn Botanic
Garden, Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the
Brooklyn Children's Museum, the New York Zoological Society and the
College of the Atlantic in Mount Desert, Maine He was a past
president of the Art Commission of the City of New York, and a

Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He held offices at the New York Community Trust, the New York
State Board of Social Welfare and the National Institute of Social
Services.

   Blum is survived by a son, John R. H. Blum, and a daughter,
Alice E. B. Yoakum, both of Lakeville, Conn.; nine grandchildren,
and 19 great-grandchildren. His wife, Ethel Halsey Blum, died in
1991 after 63 years of marriage.

PALMER'S INJURY ONLY PART OF USC'S PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What do USC's always lofty goals and Carson
Palmer's collarbone have in common? They were both shattered in
Eugene, Ore., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's clavicle will eventually heal, but it is too soon to
tell if the Trojans will ever recover enough to reach the nearly
impossible standards set in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   USC's players had complete confidence they could reach the Rose
Bowl heading into the third game against Oregon, but Palmer
suffered his injury at the end of the first half and the season
quickly nosedived.
</P>
<P>
   Or so goes the conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   However, USC's breakdown in 1999 is not simple enough to place
solely on the tender shoulder of Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a given that Palmer might be the best quarterback in school
history, could be a top-five NFL draft pick and the team would be
5-2 if he were healthy. But Palmer should not be an alibi for the
unseemly things that have taken place during the Trojans'
disappointing 3-4 start.
</P>
<P>
   If you listened to the hype, the Trojans had enough talent
without Palmer to overcome his absence. And how did they take
21-point leads over Notre Dame and Stanford without their
superstar?
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett is right when he says great coaches
always have great quarterbacks. Bill Walsh had Joe Montana. Chuck
Noll had Terry Bradshaw. Tom Landry had Roger Staubach.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not talking about greatness here. Just wondering how
you slip to 3-4 with a team full of speed and experience? And why
have so many people have forgotten that the Palmer-led Trojans
barely beat San Diego State 24-21?
</P>
<P>
   No, USC's problems are far more pervasive than the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   To summarize:
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line has been a disaster for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The tailbacks have been uninspiring.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams have been atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been good but not dominating.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching has not risen to a level that would lift the
Trojans out of their funk.
</P>
<P>
   That explains a sub-.500 record as much as Palmer's injury.
</P>
<P>
   Before we leave the quarterback position, though, a quick word
about starter Mike Van Raaphorst. He's a competent player. Nothing
more. Nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   As Hackett said after last weekend's loss to Stanford, Van
Raaphorst put the Trojans in a position to win. He won't lead USC
to victory. He won't be the reason the Trojans lost. He'll just be
there.
</P>
<P>
   Those who blame Van Raaphorst should ask themselves why senior
John Fox has not been given an opportunity. Well, it would take a
big man to start a guy who was basically forced to move to tight
end a year ago because he wasn't considered good enough to hang
with Van Raaphorst, Palmer or Jason Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't expect Fox to start anytime soon. &QL; 
The offensive line
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback is really not the key to winning college football,
however. Offensive lines are what win games. Remember the '70s? And
this offensive line has been a total disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   All five starters returned from last season, so there was a
reasonable expectation it would experience some form of growth.
Instead, the line completely stagnated and at times looked worse in
losses to Oregon and Arizona. The line committed nine penalties
against the Ducks and half of those were false starts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been signs the past two games that the line has
gotten over its penchant for penalties and is actually blocking
somebody, but it might be too late to make a difference this
season. &QL; 
The tailbacks
</P>
<P>
   Here's the only stat you need to know. Chad Morton's longest run
from scrimmage this season is 19 yards. His longest run last season
was 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just the offensive line's fault. Whether Morton's
lost a step or not is debatable. Some have speculated he bulked up
too much in the offseason to avoid injuries. Whatever, the fact is
USC does not have a breakaway threat.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Sultan McCullough has sprinter's speed, but the coaches
appear reluctant to use him. &QL; 
Special teams
</P>
<P>
   It seems like an unrealistic assignment to have assistant coach
Shawn Slocum worry about coaching the linebackers and the special
teams simultaneously. USC's special-teams play hasn't made anyone
think it's a job that can be split with a defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum brought in kicker David Newbury from Texas and he's made
only 8 of 14 field goals, including three misses in the
triple-overtime loss to Oregon. Punter Mike MacGillivray has been
inconsistent (39.9 yards per punt), and Hackett has toyed with the
idea of using David Bell in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Trojans have blocked just one field goal
this season. Last year, USC blocked four punts and four field goals
and two extra points.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams were the cornerstone of USC's success last season.
Today, they are far more likely to influence a game negatively. &QL; 
The defense
</P>
<P>
   If you blow a 21-point lead, someone's giving up the points. But
it might be fair to remember that before the season, Hackett said
the offense would be ahead of the defense, in a reversal of last
year's roles.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has probably been right about where it should be.
But it has once again been under intense pressure because of the
offense's repeated ineptness.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the defense gained a bloated reputation, based on
holding Hawaii to seven points. There was also way too much
giddiness over the emergence of linebacker Markus Steele. He's a
wonderful player, but people foolishly forgot that this defense
missed Chris Claiborne. It's a point that must be made over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   As Hackett said after losing to Notre Dame, ``The defense was
good, not great.'' &QL; 
Coaching
</P>
<P>
   Hackett went a long way toward growing into his role this week
by taking responsibility for USC's woes. It's clear his plan to
challenge the seniors last week backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have,'' Steele said. ``It's not just the seniors and
upperclassmen. We have freshmen and sophomores playing, too. We
don't want to put it on the seniors. We want to put it on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett might be better served by loosening up a little. The
players seem to roll their eyes when he gets tough or goes
negative. They respond better to positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett seemed to learn this lesson, too, by trying to stay
upbeat after the Stanford loss without assessing blame.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he has not spent enough time on strategy and was
caught off-guard by Arizona's defensive scheme. He vowed to work on
that in the offseason. That's a sign he is willing to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in building and developing something for the long
term,'' Hackett said. ``I relish in that part. The thing that I
have had to learn is that I had been gone from the strategy of
college football for a while. The frustration has been that I feel
like I've been a little behind in terms of the strategy in our
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   With only five games left, it's time to catch up.

 &HT;    Gore, Bradley offer specific answers in conflict-free debate
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ With barely a hint of confrontation or even
serious disagreement, Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore
offered voters a first impression of themselves as just thoughtful
guys during an hourlong nationally televised forum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions from the audience at Dartmouth College, they
dealt with topics ranging from gay marriages to health care, from
school safety to East Timor. Questions were specific and for the
most part, so were the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attempted to be the more engaging, asking each questioner
about their family or job, while Bradley appeared less rehearsed
and more thoughtful _ at one point when asked about leadership, he
used Woodrow Wilson and Mikhail Gorbachev as examples.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the opening question about the questionable
personal conduct of President Clinton, the vice president said he
was as disappointed as anyone. Calling Clinton, ``my friend,'' Gore
said he had a responsibility to show leadership during the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A woman asked Bradley about the military's don't ask, don't tell
policy toward gays, forcing them to keep their sexual orientation a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support gays being able to serve openly in the military. If
gays can serve openly in the White House, in Congress, in the
courts, in the Treasury Department ... why can't they serve in the
military?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would support a legal designation for domestic
partnerships of gay couples. Gore said he supports such a
designation but would oppose calling it a marriage because it is
not the same as marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was asked to explain why he left the Senate in 1996, a
point often noted by Gore. Bradley explained that he wanted to get
``outside of Washington'' and ``have a dialogue'' with the voters.
That experience, he said, proved to him that he is ready to become
president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bradley's plan to spend up to $65 billion on
health care programs. He said Bradley's plan is far more expensive
than Bradley has admitted. Bradley insisted that his economic
advisers have given a realistic cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a nip at Gore, Bradley said his vision is that, ``If
you're going to do this, you ought to deal with the big problems
and you ought to have big solutions to big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's forum also marked the start of a new campaign for
Gore. When he entered the race earlier this year, Gore strategists
saw Bradley as little more than an annoyance on the way to the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley has become a formidable foe tying Gore in polls
in Iowa and New Hampshire, with one new poll, done by Quinnipac
College in New Hampshire, showing Bradley leading 47 percent to 39
percent. Gore hoped to use the forum to convince voters here and
supporters around the country that he understands the mistakes his
campaign has made and is ready to aggressively fight for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters were seeing Bradley for the first time and Gore's
strategists are hoping that the impression Bradley made was that he
is less presidential than Gore. Gore tried to take command early
when, while the two men sat on stage waiting for the show to start,
he encouraged the audience to ask questions off the air. Then, when
the forum ended, the last words were from Gore inviting the
audience to stay and ask more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Republicans gather for their forum here with the
notable absence of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. He will appear on
local television to explain to New Hampshire voters that he skipped
the event because he wants to be with his wife when she receives an
award from Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals accuse Bush of snubbing New Hampshire voters. ``He's
thumbing his nose'' at them, said Dan Schnur, spokesman for Arizona
Sen. John McCain, who has been gaining on Bush in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took advantage of the Democratic forum to air
commercials before and after the event poking fun at both
candidates, with one actor ending the ad with this line, ``who
spends more? That's the only debate between Bradley and Gore.''

EDITORIAL: THE DOW GROWS MORE YOUTHFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dow'' will shed a remarkable number of pounds and years by
next Monday. That is when the Dow Jones industrial average _ the
yardstick by which the public most often tracks changes in stock
prices _ changes composition. Four companies will be added to the
index of stock prices of 30 major businesses; four will be removed.
Gone will be Union Carbide and Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber,
manufacturers of tangible goods, which have been part of the Dow
for more than 60 years. Entering will be the high-tech superstars
Microsoft and Intel, makers of software and computer innards.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes in the Dow made by the editors of The Wall
Street Journal over the past few years have followed the same
pattern: Substitute young stars in the technology, finance and
other service sectors for the heavy-manufacturing stars of
yesteryear. In the past eight years alone, 11 of the 30 positions
in the Dow average have been changed. Texaco and Bethlehem Steel
were dropped. Hewlett-Packard and Walt Disney were added.
Typically, the new companies were lighter and younger.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the changes, the Dow is hardly representative of the
U.S. economy, new or old. It excludes utility and transportation
companies because they are tracked by other averages published by
Dow Jones &AMP; Co. Also, the Dow includes stock prices of only
so-called blue chip companies _ major, successful companies that
are expected to remain industry leaders. The goal is to have an
``average'' that represents the leading companies, not some amalgam
of all companies.

   Despite the skewed selection process, movements in the Dow track
overall stock prices surprisingly well over extended lengths of
time. Over the three-, five- and seven-year periods before July 1,
the Dow rose 94 percent, 203 percent and 231 percent respectively.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a broader average that
includes many more technology and financial stocks, rose by
comparable amounts _ 104 percent, 209 percent and 236 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 and other broader-based indexes are used by most
financial analysts to judge the performance of stocks in general
and of specific mutual funds or stock pickers. But when announcing
financial news, the 103-year-old Dow remains the first and often
the only yardstick. It may not be the most representative
yardstick, but it is changing to keep pace with the economy.

   Former Sen. George J. Mitchell began the last days of his
eight-week- old effort to salvage the sinking peace accord, with
frosty relations between rival parties thawing but no breakthrough
reported. ``No one should underestimate just how important are the

   A Belfast journalist, Ed Moloney, won a legal battle when
Northern Ireland's lord chief justice, Sir Robert Carswell, threw
out a court decision ordering him to give the police notes of a
1990 interview with a former Protestant paramilitary man charged in
the 1980 murder of a Catholic human rights lawyer. The killing
attracted international attention because of charges that the Royal

GORE TAKES FIGHT TO BRADLEY DURING FIRST JOINT APPEARANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 A News Analysis   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore took the fight to former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley during their first side-by-side tryout before American
voters Wednesday night, by doggedly challenging his rival's
financing for an ambitious health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   During the nationally televised ``town meeting'' in which New
Hampshire voters divided 24 questions between the two rivals for
the Democratic presidential nomination, Gore and Bradley agreed on
far more than they disagreed about.
</P>
<P>
   Both endorsed greater civil rights for homosexuals and lesbians,
although Gore opposed legalizing marriages between partners of the
same sex. Both endorsed campaign finance reform. Both endorsed
steps to target specific health care problems, with Bradley vowing
steps to help provide care for Alzheimers' patients and Gore
promising to work ``toward parity'' to treat mental illness on a
par with physical illness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate attacked the other during the hour-long
encounter, though they looked for opportunities to criticize the
other's policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Gore zeroed in on questions about how Bradley would finance his
health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we are going to finance the plans?'' Gore asked in the
opening minutes of the two candidates' first side-by-side
appearance. ``The numbers have to add up. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has proposed a plan, costing about $65 billion a year,
to provide health insurance to almost all Americans, including the
45 million people without insurance this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big problem,'' Bradley said. ``And it needs a big
solution to that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bradley's proposal would consume the entire projected
$1.2 trillion federal budget surplus over the next ten years,
robbing the federal government of the chance to ``save Medicare,''
the federally subsidized senior citizens' health insurance program
that benefits almost 40 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's criticisms, leveled at Bradley's plan on at least three
occasions during their joint appearance at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, N.H., finally got a rise out of Bradley, who left the
Senate in 1996 after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I just want to make one clarification,'' Bradley said
in response to an unrelated question. ``On the cost of the health
care plan, we each have our own experts. I dispute the cost figure
that Al has used.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley ducked at least one opportunity to take a
shot at the Clinton-Gore administration, when he was asked to
comment ``on the behavior of the '96 Clinton-Gore campaign as it
relates to fund-raising?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley replied: ``I think there were obviously some
irregularities that have been addressed. I'm not going to get into
the details at this stage of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's repeated appeals for the chance to serve as president
contrasted sharply with Bradley's laid back, deliberate manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you, give me a chance to roll up my sleeves and go
to work on this,'' Gore said at one point, referring to mental
health care coverage. ``This is one that I will fix for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore went out of his way to engage the questioners, asking about
their families, telling a joke, making humorous asides. At one
point he told the vice president of a local labor union, ``That's
an important position, incidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the debate, Gore seemed eager to tell a
questioner that he understood ``the disappointment and anger that
you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself,'' adding:
``I also feel that the American people want to move on and turn the
page and focus on the future and not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore mentioned his service in Vietnam; he cited his endorsement
by the AFL-CIO, the National Education Association and the American
Federation of Teachers. Gore also cited his opposition to the
school voucher program once supported by Bradley; he outlined far
greater readiness to intervene in foreign ethnic wars that did
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was less imploring. He stated his policy positions in a
straight forward way as he moved easily around the stage, with the
ease of a former NBA basketball star.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lack of vigorous disagreements Wednesday night was
anticipated, based on the fact that the two Democrats agreed on
most issues most of the time during the eight years they shared
together in the Senate, before Gore was chosen by Bill Clinton to
join the Democratic ticket in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, liberal organizations such as Americans for
Democratic Action and the AFL-CIO's political action arm found that
Gore and Bradley voted to support their organizations' priorities a
majority of the time.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative organizations found that Gore and Bradley
failed to support their organizations' priorities most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce found that Gore supported its position
on an average of 33 percent of the votes it selected over the four
years ending in 1990. Bradley voted for the organization's business
priorities on 27 percent of the selected votes used to rate
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The independent National Journal, which conducts annual ratings
of lawmakers' voting records, found that Gore voted the liberal
position on economic issues 92 percent of the time compared to
Bradley who voted that way 84 percent of the time. Gore adopted the
liberal position on social issues 81 percent of the time compared
to Bradley who took that position 74 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy issues, the National Journal study in 1990
found that Gore voted for the liberal position on 64 percent of the
selected votes. Gore voted the conservative position on 35 percent
of the selected votes. Bradley voted the liberal position on 75
percent of the votes; he voted the conservative position on 20
percent of the votes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed by an Oregon law allowing
physician-assisted suicide, the House of Representatives passed a
bill Wednesday that would make it a federal crime for doctors to
prescribe drugs to help terminally ill patients end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 271-156. Seventy-one Democrats joined 200
Republicans in supporting the legislation. Twenty Republicans, 135
Democrats and one independent voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill, introduced in the Senate by the assistant
Republican leader, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, has 31 co-sponsors, but
has not reached the floor. &UR;  &LR; Supporters say they are confident
because most Republicans and some Democrats are likely to back the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Like many state laws that ban assisted suicide, the House bill
makes a sharp distinction between the use of prescription drugs to
control pain and the use of such medications to hasten death.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says that the use of controlled substances to alleviate
pain or discomfort is a ``legitimate medical purpose,'' even ``if
the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.'' But
under the bill, a doctor who prescribes drugs ``for the purpose of
causing death'' would be subject to criminal penalties _ 20 years
in prison for prescribing the drugs most commonly used to aid a
suicide, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Oregon law, which was enacted in October 1997
following a statewide referendum, doctors may, in some
circumstances, prescribe drugs to enable terminally ill patients to
end their lives. In June 1998, Attorney General Janet Reno said the
federal government would not take action against Oregon doctors who
assist in a suicide and fully comply with the procedures of the
state's law, the Death With Dignity Act.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed Wednesday by the House would, in effect,
overrule Reno. It says that in deciding whether to issue or revoke
a doctor's license to prescribe potentially dangerous drugs, known
as controlled substances, the attorney general shall not recognize
any state law permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department told Congress last week that it opposed
physician-assisted suicide but disliked provisions of the House
bill that would ``interfere with state policy-making in a
particularly heavy-handed way.'' The White House shares that view,
although it did not issue an official statement of administration
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House bill said that Congress had authority to
legislate on this issue because it can regulate the use of
potentially dangerous drugs. The bill would amend a 1970 federal
law, the Controlled Substances Act, which sets uniform national
standards for the control of morphine and other narcotics. The use
of hallucinogens, stimulants and depressants is regulated under the
same law.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Oregon expressed outrage at the legislation,
saying it was the height of hypocrisy for conservative Republicans
_ usually staunch advocates of states' rights _ to overturn a law
twice approved in referendums by the voters of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon law was first approved in 1994, 51 percent to 49
percent, but was promptly put on hold amid great legal dispute,
with the Roman Catholic Church leading the opposition. In 1997, the
state's voters backed the law again, this time by 60 percent to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats and some Republicans said the bill would put
federal drug agents in hospital rooms to judge the intent of
doctors prescribing pain-relief medicines in the final days of
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said
they were trying to protect the sanctity of life by forbidding
doctors to prescribe drugs for the purpose of hastening death.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the bill promoted the uniform application of federal
drug laws. ``Oregon,'' he said, ``decided to change the
time-honored professional purpose of medicine and give doctors the
option to serve no longer as healing forces, but as social
engineers, messengers of death. Doctors are authorized by the
Oregon law to put down the stethoscope and pick up the poison pill
and assist in the execution of their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said Congress was arrogantly
setting standards for the practice of medicine. ``We, the great
board of medicine in the sky, will decide what goes on between
doctors and patients'' in the last days of life, said McDermott, a
psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., said: ``This is a day of shame for the
U.S. Congress. In addition to overturning Oregon's law, this bill
authorizes the Drug Enforcement Administration to second-guess
physicians all across America, and its effect on pain management
will be devastating. Few, if any, members of Congress even read the
Oregon law they voted to overturn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill said that technically it would not
overturn the Oregon law. But, they said, it would severely hamper
patients' ability to invoke the state law, because doctors could
not legally prescribe lethal doses of controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, a Republican who voted
against the House bill, said, ``DEA agents will have to decide
whether the doctor's purpose was to alleviate pain, even at the
risk of death, or to hasten death.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a physician who supported the House
measure, insisted, ``This bill does nothing to disturb the proper
doctor-patient relationship in Oregon.'' A doctor who would take a
patient's life ``no longer has an ethical right to care for that
patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the first year of its assisted-suicide law,
Oregon said that 15 people ended their lives with lethal
medications in 1998. Thirteen had cancer, one had a chronic lung
condition and one had congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association supported the House bill and
supports Nickles' bill too.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yank D. Coble, secretary-treasurer of the association, said
the bills would provide ``a new and important statutory protection
for physicians prescribing controlled substances for pain,
particularly for patients at the end of life.'' The AMA has long
opposed assisted suicide, on the ground that it is ``antithetical
to the role of physician as healer.''
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the House bill, as stated in the
legislation, is ``to promote pain management and palliative care
without permitting assisted suicide and euthanasia.'' Palliative
care alleviates pain and distress, but is not meant to hasten death
or cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill provides federal money to train doctors and other
health care professionals in methods of alleviating pain. The
government would also encourage research on how to care for the
terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of abortion strongly supported the House bill. Burke
J. Balch, director of medical ethics at the National Right to Life
Committee, said his group opposed abortion and assisted suicide
because of ``our concern for the vulnerable and powerless _ in one
case, unborn children; in the other case, people with disabilities,
older people, poor people, people at the margins of society, who
are at risk of being coerced into euthanasia.''

TENNESSEE REPORT SAYS RULES WEREN'T VIOLATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Tennessee president J. Wade Gilley said Wednesday
that the school's general counsel's office had not found any ``kind
of systemic, unwarranted or tutorial help'' in the school's
athletic department and said that none of its student athletes
violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley said he had received an oral report from associate
general counsel Ron Leadbetter, who conducted the monthlong review
into allegations reported by ESPN.com on Sept. 26 that some
Tennessee football players, including at least one member of the
1998 national title team, were suspected of turning in plagiarized
papers or papers co-written by tutors. He said the report clearing
the program will be forwarded to the Southeastern Conference and to
the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing verifiable to precipitate further action,''
Gilley said in a telephone interview. ``We have no evidence that
the student athletes or tutors acted improperly. There's no
pattern. We are confident we have a very sound system with seasoned
people of integrity in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said he would deliver the three-page report to Gilley
Thursday, and it would be made public perhaps as early as Friday.
He would not comment on the specifics of the report, but said in a
telephone interview that the review was ``very thorough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The university does not find itself in difficulty,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said he spoke with every person cited in the ESPN.com
report, which alleged that at least four tutors may have done
schoolwork for as many as five players _ dating back to 1995 _ and
that high-level administrators in the athletic department were made
aware of instructors' and staffers' suspicions but did not pass
them on to the school's compliance officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke with everyone who had useful information, some people
multiple times,'' Leadbetter said, declining to say how many. ``We
talked to anyone who remotely might have had firsthand knowledge of
the allegations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When released, the report is certain to create more debate on
the Knoxville campus where concerned faculty members have recently
undertaken several initiatives to gain greater control of the
academic pursuits of athletes. ``It's been an embarrassment to the
university,'' Lorayne Lester, dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences, said last week about the allegations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tennessee's faculty senate recently voted to study how often
grade changes were made for athletes. And a subcommittee on
academic integrity will also examine the tutoring program, as well
as the special-needs program for learning disabled athletes. Many
faculty members have also suggested that someone other than the
general counsel's office should have conducted the review.
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said, however, that though the focus of the report
was on determining whether NCAA violations occurred that he was
bound to report any other violations that broke university rules.
He indicated he discovered none. ``The report is very positive,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley pointed out that as the author of a 1986 book titled,
``Administration of University Athletics: Internal Control and
Excellence,'' he too was intent on a serious, wide-ranging inquiry.
``It cost the university tens of thousands of dollars,'' he said.
``People can make anonymous charges all the time, and you have to
take them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be up to the NCAA enforcement division to decide
whether Tennessee violated any bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   The organization does not comment on potential or current
investigations at specific institutions. A spokeswoman, Jane
Jankowski, said it is routine for the NCAA to get reports from
member institutions _ many of them acknowledging violations _ but
that the NCAA still acts independently.  &QL;

HEAT DOESN'T SCARE EUROPEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thanks to the Europeans' surprising enthusiasm and
a wagering-rules change, Breeders' Cup handicappers might have more
horses than ever to choose from this year.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred twenty-eight horses have been ``pre-entered'' for
the Breeders' Cup Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park _ including 22
Europe-based horses, who will be asked to brave the Florida
humidity, blamed for foreigners' failure to win a race when the
event was held in that state in 1989 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With six of the eight races overflowing their 14-horse limits,
among them the new fillies-and-mares turf race, this shapes up as
one of the most hotly contested of the 16 Breeders' Cups. The
pre-entry lists will be whittled down and starting fields will be
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans include Daylami, a contender for the Breeders' Cup
Turf. Breeders' Cup president D.G. Van Clief Jr. attributed the
Europeans' eagerness to try again at Gulfstream to well-advertised
improvements in the air conditioning in the track's quarantine barn
and a policy change permitting turf workouts in the cool early
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   The turf course, flooded by Hurricane Irene, was scheduled to
reopen this morning to allow Breeders' Cup horses already on the
scene to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It adds up to a very deep _ frankly deeper than we expected _
European contingent,'' Van Clief said Wednesday. ``We've had what
we feel is a tremendously strong response to the Breeders' Cup
championship this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the response reflects the popular assessment that most
Breeders' Cup races are wide open following a spate of injuries to
top horses in the spring and summer and a rash of upsets in the
autumn prep races.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very contentious races where people think that
with the right trip on the right day, they can win it,'' said D.
Wayne Lukas, trainer of a record 13 Breeders' Cup winners.
</P>
<P>
   Longshot bettors won't have to worry about coupled entries
reducing their choices and odds. Gulfstream officials are waiving
the rule requiring horses with common ownership to race as a joint
wagering interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas pre-entered seven horses _ Cat Thief (Classic), A Lady
From Dixie (in the Distaff), Surfside and Cash Run (Juvenile
Fillies), Natalie Too (Filly and Mare Turf), and High Yield and
Millencolin (Juvenile).
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert dominates the contenders lists with General
Challenge and River Keen (Classic), Silverbulletday (Distaff),
Chilukki (Juvenile Fillies), Tuzla (Mile), Forestry (Sprint) and
Forest Camp and Captain Steve (Juvenile).
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Anita:!off! With the Breeders' Cup Classic drawing
California-breds General Challenge and Budroyale, Saturday's
California Cup Classic is left with seven horses and no star.
Baffert-trained Del Mar Gray and jockey Alex Solis are 8-5
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Fields for the 10-race Cal Cup card, a $1.275 million showcase
for state-bred horses, were announced Wednesday.

OWENS CORNING GOES TO COURT OVER A FAKE INTERNET MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This much is known: A lawsuit was filed this week in
federal district court in Manhattan. But no one knows who was sued.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual case was brought by Owens Corning, the building
products company best known for its pink fiberglass insulation. In
the lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, Owens Corning says it was libeled by
an unknown person purporting to be the company's chairman, who
posted a message on an Internet bulletin board maintained by Yahoo
and devoted to discussion about the company.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed against ``John Doe,'' claims the fake message
hurt the company's reputation with stock analysts and traders on
Wall Street, as well as the company's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The message is written in the name of the company's chairman and
chief executive, Glen H. Hiner, who appears to respond to earlier
criticism from shareholders. In one place, the message quotes him
as making critical remarks about shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In another, it quotes him as saying, ``So what if I have padded
the board with my cronies.'' It also quotes Hiner as saying that
Owens Corning, which has defended thousands of lawsuits from people
over exposure to asbestos products that the company once made, has
``the fix in with 88 percent of the plaintiffs' attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, which was posted at 4:54 p.m. on Sept. 26, drew
angry responses from shareholders, the suit said, who apparently
believed it was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one of a number of John Doe suits that have been
brought by companies that contend that their reputations were
damaged in anonymous Internet messages, said Floyd Abrams, the
lawyer who specializes in First Amendment issues.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, who said he was not familiar with the Owens Corning suit
and was speaking only generally, said some companies appeared to be
using the civil legal process to silence their critics,
particularly employees who might be posting the anonymous messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been happening a lot in the last eight or nine months,''
Abrams said. ``It's often been the case that the only purpose of a
number of these lawsuits has been to find out the identify of the
critical employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers for Owens Corning, William I. Sussman and Nelson A.
Boxer, declined to elaborate on the lawsuit, except to say that it
was not filed to stifle dissent but rather, as Boxer put it,
because ``someone anonymously went on the Internet, on the bulletin
board, purporting to be the CEO and making derogatory statements
about the company's stockholders and how the company's being run.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the company ``never has had any strategy about trying to
stifle any kind of discussions and public statements on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Yahoo, like other companies that run such
bulletin boards, was immune from suit.
</P>
<P>
   An official with Yahoo, Mike Riley, a senior producer, said he
could not comment on the specific case but that generally, Yahoo,
under its strict privacy policy, ``will not release any identifying
information about our users without their consent, unless we're
legally compelled to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Such compulsion, he said, ``usually comes in the form of a
subpoena.''

EL AL SPLITS ORDER BETWEEN BOEING, AIRBUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Airbus Industrie appeared last night to have won what
industry analysts called a major victory over The Boeing Co. when
Israel's national airline announced that it would buy widebody
planes from both airplane manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   El Al has an all-Boeing fleet and the fierce competition for the
latest order had been closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic
to see if Airbus could break Boeing's monopoly in Israel, despite
intense U.S. political pressure on the Jewish state, which receives
about $3 billion annually in U.S. foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   After a late-night meeting of its board, state-owned El Al said
through a spokesman that it had decided to buy three Boeing 777s
and also planned to buy three or four Airbus A330s.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus order still needs final approval, an El Al spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means another Boeing market has fallen to the advancing
Airbus hordes,'' said Richard Aboulafia, senior aerospace analyst
with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leaves one traditional Boeing market _ Japan. That's it.
When Japan falls, protect the Fatherland, it's invasion of the home
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragan MacKenzie said the El Al order
further shows the considerable strides that Airbus has made with
loyal Boeing customers. British Airways last year bought Airbus
planes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime Airbus can get its foot in the door of a customer that
does not have Airbus planes, it opens up great potential for Airbus
down the road, even if the order is only for one or two planes,''
Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman said the board decided to split
the order because the 300-seat 777 is more suitable for long
flights, while the 250-seat Airbus A330 can be used on shorter
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boeing and Airbus made considerable concessions to El Al as
they maneuvered to win the competition, which has unfolded over
several months. El Al's decision was originally set for early
spring but has been postponed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to steeply discounting their planes, Boeing and
Airbus agreed to give Israeli companies business worth 50 percent
of the value of the orders. These are known as ``offset''
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The two airplane makers made revised 11th-hour offers Monday,
just hours before the board was scheduled to meet. Airbus, which
had previously said it would provide provide offsets worth 35
percent, raised it to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The board postponed the Monday meeting so it could take more
time to study the revised offers.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also announced over the weekend that it would team with
Israel Aircraft Industries to convert 757 passenger planes to
freighters. That deal, worth about $120 million to the Israeli
company, was not linked to the El Al order.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how much of a discount Airbus and Boeing offered
El Al on their respective planes.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus senior vice president John Leahy, who has been the
European planemaker's chief salesman in Tel Aviv for the El Al
order, expressed satisfaction with the deal:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely happy with the deal. But we are a lot happier
with the new partnership that was formed today with El Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Alan Mulally, also issued
a statement, saying, ``We are extremely pleased that El Al has made
a decision in favor of the Boeing 777.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally had made a second trip to Israel in recent days to pitch
Boeing's offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Al has conducted a very rigorous competition evaluating all
aspects of the commercial products to make sure that they made the
best business decision, Mulally said in the statement. ``We look
forward to the first Boeing 777 delivery to El Al in February
2001.''
</P>
<P>
   Klieman said the $400 million order for the three Boeing 777s is
a done deal, but the order for the Airbus planes still needs final
approval by company management. That could take a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The overall order is larger than the three or four planes El Al
had been expected to buy this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to evaluate our cash flow as well as the economics of
the destinations these planes (the A330s) would serve,'' Klieman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The first Airbus planes will be delivered in 2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus order is worth between $250 million and $400 million,
depending on how many planes El Al buys and the maintanance
agreements, an Airbus spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Klieman said the 777s would replace Boeing 747-200s while the
A330s would replace Boeing 767s.
</P>
<P>
   El Al has 13 747s in its fleet and six 767s. Some of those 747s
are the -400 model, which is the biggest and newest jumbo jet that
Boeing makes. El Al also flys Boeing 737s and 757s.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus lost an El Al deal in 1997 after Boeing reportedly
undercut it at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, the Airbus executive, was quoted by Bloomberg News this
week as saying the European consortium was prepared to take a loss
to break the Boeing monopoly with El Al.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Airbus becomes a single corporate entity, profitability
will matter much more,'' said Aboulafia, the industry analyst.
``Right now, it's grab market share while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit told analysts
that Boeing has had to walk from some recent competitions with
Airbus rather than make unprofitable deals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have applauded Boeing's commitment to the bottom line,
but they also are worried about the trend that has seen Airbus win
order after order from airlines that were loyal Boeing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is far ahead of Boeing this year in orders for new
planes. Airbus has so far captured about 70 percent of the 1999
firm orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing faces something of a dilemma,'' said Jacobs of Ragan
MacKenzie. ``It does not want to sell airplanes at huge discounts,
but from another perspective it cannot allow Airbus to continue to
penetrate what has been sole Boeing customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, Airbus cannot continue to sell its planes at
grossly reduced prices ... But if airlines are choosing Airbus
planes because they view them as the better product, then Boeing
has some other fundamental problems that it will need to address.''

 &HT;    Tenacity not new for Gray
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jim Gray has compiled an impressive body of work as a
TV sports reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta resident's resume includes stints with ESPN and CBS
and two with NBC. Gray's experience since graduating from the
University of Colorado in 1981 includes many major sporting events:
Olympics, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, heavyweight boxing title fights,
the Masters and the men's NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But after an interview Sunday with Pete Rose, Gray is facing the
toughest challenge of his career.
</P>
<P>
   For showing tenacity in pursuing the Mike Tyson-Evander
Holyfield ear-biting story in 1997, Gray won a Special Individual
Achievement Emmy Award.
</P>
<P>
   For showing tenacity in trying to force Rose to admit to
gambling on a night when baseball celebrated its greatest players,
Gray has won the scorn of many viewers nationwide. In a career that
has been mostly highs, Gray has hit a low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Situations like this do not have real long life spans. Things
tend to calm down,'' said Mike Pearl, Turner Sports executive
producer who was Gray's coordinating producer when the two were at
CBS. ``After the Series is over, things will smooth over, and
everybody will move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, 40, is married. He first moved to Atlanta before the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Denver, where he played tennis in high school. He
first showed interest in broadcasting while attending Colorado
University. His first TV job was as an intern at Denver's KUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't set on a broadcasting career,'' he told the
Rocky Mountain News several years ago. ``But the opportunity and
support were there, so I took advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first jobs Gray held after leaving Colorado with a
degree in journalism was in Philadelphia while Rose was with the
Phillies. Gray worked for PRISM, a regional cable network, in
1981-83 as an evening sports anchor and host of pregame shows on
the 76ers and Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   He left PRISM in 1983 and spent a year working as an associate
producer on an Olympics film before joining ESPN as its West Coast
Bureau Chief in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Gray reported on ESPN's coverage of such events as the America's
Cup, the NBA and the Super Bowl, but his breakthrough came on Oct.
30, 1987, when he was the first to reveal that Rams Hall of Famer
Eric Dickerson had been traded to the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   That scoop by Gray caught the eye of NBC, which hired him in
1988 to be a reporter on its pregame pro football show, ``NFL
Live,'' and for the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   His first departure from NBC was not amicable. ``I got a call at
4:45 a.m. on an April morning in 1989 from (the) executive
producer,'' he told the Rocky Mountain News. ``His message: I was
being replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement was O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Gray was hired by CBS to work on its pregame pro
football show, ``The NFL Today.'' It was during Gray's four-year
run with CBS that the big-time assignments began to come in
bunches.
</P>
<P>
   When CBS lost the NFL, he returned to NBC in 1994 and was
assigned to virtually every major event the network had, the
highlight being his exemplary work on the night of the Olympic Park
bombing at the Atlanta Games in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He also gained some notice at the 1995 NBA All-Star Game, when
he interviewed Charles Barkley about Barkley's comment about
``hating white people.'' Barkley claimed his comments were taken
out of context and playfully gave Gray a kiss during the interview.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Gray also has worked for Showtime on
its boxing coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's a fine reporter, and, as evidenced, he's a fearless
reporter,'' Showtime president Jay Larkin said. ``If you don't take
risks, the level of achievement is mediocrity. Sometimes, it
backfires. But I think it's a compliment, not a detriment, that
he's willing to take risks.''

 &HT;    Gray boycott ends
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers and Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees apparently decided to back off their
boycott of NBC's Jim Gray, because manager Joe Torre and second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch granted him interviews Wednesday for the
pregame show.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had said it would not change Gray's role after Game 3 hero
Chad Curtis refused to talk with him, and the network stood by that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the Yankees and everything will be fine,'' NBC
vice president Ed Markey said. ``Jim will be in the dugout and talk
to them on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott had forced NBC to move Craig Sager from the Braves
to the Yankees on Tuesday in order to get interviews for its
postgame show on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't enjoy doing it,'' Sager said. ``It felt
uncomfortable, but you have to do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's game, Gray sat in the New York dugout
beside Fox Sports anchor Keith Olbermann. Noticing several
reporters moving toward him, Gray smiled evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to hear here, guys,'' Gray said. Asked if that
should be interpreted as ``no comment,'' Gray smiled again and
said, ``I'm just having a conversation with Keith.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann appeared to try to help Gray deal with the growing
contingent of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm changing jobs again,'' joked Olbermann, who has moved from
ESPN to MSNBC to Fox in the past two years. He then added, ``I'm
not trying to steal Jim's thunder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead,'' Gray interjected swiftly. ``This is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, about 15 reporters were pressing in on Gray, who
politely listened to a few questions. He offered virtually the same
response to all: ``I'm just getting ready for Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would address the controversy again, he smiled a bit
more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already addressed everything I'm going to address on the
air,'' he said.

GORE DOES THE LITTLE ATTACKING IN JOINT CAMPAIGN ENCOUNTER WITH
BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Bradley's position on East Timor in 7th graf; ADDS 3 grafs at
end with Gore staying to answer questions.) (rk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore, in his first televised
encounter with former Sen. Bill Bradley Wednesday night, pointedly
but gently pressed his rival to defend his costly proposals that he
warned would ``shred the social safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a panoply of issues, the two candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination agreed more than they disagreed
as they appealed to liberal primary voters for stepped up financing
on mental health, special education and environmental measures and
for more stringent laws protecting homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore occasionally disparaged Bradley's stands on health
care, school vouchers and foreign affairs, Bradley refused to be
ruffled or prodded into responding during an hourlong Town
Hall-like forum at Dartmouth College. Instead, Bradley spoke
broadly about his own proposals and _ in an subtle suggestion that
Gore does not offer big ideas _ said the presidency is about ``big
solutions to big problems'' and ``about dreaming and trying to
fulfill those dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moments when Gore tried to put Bradley on the
defensive, the event was rather amicable. The two rivals, who for
years served together in the Senate, chatted amicably as they sat
side by side on stools and referred to each other as ``Bill'' and
``Al.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore, confronted by polls in this state showing that
Bradley has a slight edge, sought to undermine his challenger by
criticizing his proposals as excessively costly. The vice president
presented himself, by contrast, as more fiscally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Before even 10 minutes had passed, Gore condemned Bradley's
health care proposal, asserting that it would cost ``more than the
entire surplus over the next 10 years.'' He said: ``You're going to
shred the social safety net _ so the cost is way excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, Bradley calmly refuted Gore's criticism.
``I want to make one clarification,'' he said, adding, ``I dispute
the cost the cost figure that Al has used.'' And he made no
apologies, saying of his health care plan, ``It's a big problem,
and it needs a big solution to that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore did not stop. Referring to Bradley, he said, ``If the
entire surplus is spent, there's no new money for education.'' He
took a jab at Bradley for supporting school vouchers on a limited
basis. He also questioned Bradley on foreign policy saying, ``I
think we were right to go into East Timor _ Bill disagreed with
that.'' Bradley later said he had agreed with the administration's
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was put on the defensive himself in the first question from
the audience. He found himself forced to defend President Clinton
after the scandals of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward
President Clinton and I've felt it myself,'' he said. ``I also feel
that the American people want to move on and turn the page and
focus on the future and not the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Gore's critiques, Bradley pressed his own stands on
issues such as gay rights. He drew perhaps the biggest round of
applause of the evening when he called for changing the 1964 civil
rights act to include homosexuals and for allowing gays to openly
serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it's important that we can talk about gay
Americans and realize they are our neighbors, our bosses,'' he
said. ``They are no different in many ways than all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, reflecting a looser style on the campaign trail in recent
weeks, was particularly aggressive Wednesday night. He repeatedly
sought to connect with questioners by asking them about their
families. He also jumped off his stool often and strolled toward
the questioners in the audience behind and in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking an informality not customary for the vice president,
Gore acted very much like the insurgent. He asked the audience to
begin questioning him even before the event began _ and he made a
point before the end to announce that would stick around to chat
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was far less aggressive, but he appeared comfortable on
stage. In some ways, his serious, calmer demeanor was more fitting
of an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The event Wednesday night, billed as a ``town meeting,'' was not
a traditional debate because the candidates did not have an
opportunity to directly question one another. Instead, Gore and
Bradley were quizzed by voters selected in a lottery by the Nelson
A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   But it was arguably the most critical hour thus far in the
Democratic competition because it was the highest profile event
featuring Gore and Bradley on the same stage _ and in the state
that will hold the first primary, on Feb. 1. The event, televised
live nationally by CNN and in New Hampshire by WMUR, drew hundreds
of reporters _ the most of any Democratic event of the campaign
season.

</P>
<P>
   At several points, Gore sought to show that Bradley was
proposing programs that would spend more money than is available in
the federal surplus. At one point, a woman asked Bradley if he
would work to ensure that the federal government pays its full
share for educating disabled students, as required under law.
Bradley said he would, then added that he would also seek to
finance a scholarship program that would place 60,000 new teachers
into disadvantage areas each year.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore was then asked what he would do to end violence in
schools, he did not answer the question right away, but instead
returned to Bradley's previous remarks. ``If the entire surplus is
spent, then there is no money left over for new initiative on
education,'' Gore said. ``The numbers have to add up.''
</P>
<P>
   On his next question, about the proliferation of nuclear
weapons, Bradley responded to Gore's attack, saying that his
proposals would not eat up the entire surplus. ``We each have our
own experts,'' Bradley said. ``I dispute the cost figure that Al
has used.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he, like Bradley, did not support legalizing gay
marriages, but would endorse extending the same legal rights to gay
and lesbian partners that are now held by married couples. But he
said he opposed Bradley's idea of expanding the Civil Rights Act of
1964, adding that he thought most gay rights and civil rights
leaders agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   On education, one questioner, a teacher, asked how to change the
school system, saying there was a crisis in the schools in part
because the nation spent money on ``smart bombs'' not on ``smart
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that the most important ingredient in improving the
schools was a spirit and a ``willingness to try things that might
break through.'' But apart from doubling the funding for Head
Start, he was not specific, saying he wanted to create the kind of
spirit that Presidential Franklin D. Roosevelt did in overcoming
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Asked a similar question, Gore again sought to cast himself as
more fiscally responsible, saying, ``Some problems will require
more money, but it's about standards, accountability and reforms.''
He went on to say that he had been endorsed by the national
teachers unions, but still favored ``tough future testing for new
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jab at Bradley, Gore added that one experiment he opposed
was using vouchers, which Bradley has supported.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Gore, the forum got off to an unusual start. Twenty
minutes before the event was scheduled to begin, the two candidates
came onto the stage, adjusting their mikes and getting comfortable
in their wooden stools while the moderators were still backstage.
Suddenly, Gore, playing the master of ceremonies, walked to center
stage and said to the audience, ``Why don't you all ask us some
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   A person in the crowd asked about how the two candidates would
overcome the fiercely partisan relationship between the White House
and Congress. In a lengthy answer that went well beyond the 90
seconds that would be allowed during the actual forum, Gore
recalled how Thomas Jefferson had run what he called a
``terrifically partisan'' campaign in 1800, but then had cordial
relations with Congress after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Following his answer, Gore turned to Bradley, who looked a
little surprised, and said, ``Bill?'' Bradley followed with a
discussion of how a healthy dose of civility would reduce
partisanship in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the televised session, Bradley left the stage but
Gore stayed in the hall to answer more questions. With sweat
streaming down his face, he was surrounded by scores of people and
answered their questions briskly.
</P>
<P>
   To a man who asked about trade relations with countries accused
of humanitarian abuses, ``We've got to work for a ban on child
labor around the world,'' Gore said. To a biologist who asked about
the teaching of creationism, Gore said: ``I am strongly opposed to
the teaching of creationism in the schools. It is against the
Constitution.'' He said it could be taught in religion classes, but
not in science classes. ``No state should be allowed to do it, no
school district should be allowed to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   After 90 minutes, Gore finally stopped talking and left the
stage.

NEWS ANALYSIS: THE SURPRISE POSSIBILITY OF A DIGNIFIED DEMOCRATIC
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DEMS-DEBATE) 
(js) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday
night discussed important, complicated issues in their first joint
event and invited voters to judge them not for campaign jabs but by
their earnest concerns about problems from health care to
homosexuals' rights to campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a secret meeting, scheduled against the fourth
game of the World Series, and so the ratings for the town meeting,
broadcast by WMUR in Manchester, N.H., and nationally by CNN, will
probably be minuscule. The scheduling seemed odd since the
electorate constantly complains to reporters and pollsters that
neither candidates nor news organizations pay attention to issues.
</P>
<P>
   But since Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley
have committed themselves to a series of these meetings, a
dignified campaign for their party's nomination on Wednesday night
became, if not a certainty, then surely a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's format did not invite detailed discussion, and of
the many issues covered, health care was the subject on which they
came closest to engaging each other directly. In discussing their
health care proposals, Gore said Bradley's was too expensive.
Bradley said that it was not as expensive as Gore thought, but that
``it's a big problem and it needs a big solution.''
</P>
<P>
   For the subject to be examined seriously, Gore's suggestion that
future debates focus on particular topics seemed apt.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates played to a larger perspective than their
questioners, New Hampshire citizens chosen by lot with questions
approved by the broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a fairly narrow question on energy conservation and
gave a broader answer, saying: ``We, in our country, have a lot of
work to do. Global warming is a real problem. Air pollution is a
real problem. Water pollution is a real problem. We've got to clean
up the toxic waste sites. And you know, a president of the United
States who is committed to cleaning up the environment and fighting
for all of the families that now suffer with asthma or other health
problems because of the dirty environment _ a president can make a
huge difference.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bradley declined an invitation to criticize the Clinton-Gore
administration over its campaign fund-raising, saying merely that
there had been ``irregularities.'' Instead, he said that in order
to change the system, the public had to be aroused and so did civic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a president that is going to make campaign finance
reform one of the top three or four or five issues,'' he said,
``because he recognizes how it is connected to our ability to
insure more Americans, to our ability to reduce child poverty. From
my perspective there is no issue that is as linked to other issues
as campaign finance reform. That's why it is an imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked about civil rights for homosexuals, each answered
the specific question and went on to talk about human dignity.
Bradley said homosexuals should be allowed to serve in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Then he said: ``It's important that we can talk about gay
Americans and realize that they are our neighbors, they're our
bosses. They're no different in many ways than all of us. And we
have to get to a time in America where we can see beneath skin
color, eye shape, or sexual orientation, to the individual because
that is when we are going to be able to achieve the dignity that I
think America stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he opposed same-sex marriages, adding: ``I think that
the story of our country is in part an unfolding of the American
dream with a deeper meaning in each generation. It's a mystery how
Thomas Jefferson could write the words of our Declaration and own
slaves. It's a mystery how the founders in Philadelphia could write
our Constitution and not allow women to vote. But we have taken the
inner meaning and power of our founding documents and the spirit of
America and breathed new life into them in each new generation. And
the time has come for gays and lesbians to be recognized within the
circle of human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Most joint appearances get interesting when sparks fly.
Wednesday the most intriguing moments came at the end, when each
man was asked to define presidential leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Each answered in terms of past presidents. Gore cited Abraham
Lincoln, who could ``assert values and elevate those values so that
people buy into them and base their decisions on those values.'' He
said Franklin D. Roosevelt was the ``finest example of articulating
a vision _ of how we could get through the Depression and win World
War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bradley cited Jimmy Carter for ``absolute integrity'' and
Woodrow Wilson for an ``ability to see the future before it's
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And in what may have been the most thoughtful comment of the
evening, the former senator cited the last president of the Soviet
Union. He said Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``saw that the world must
change and had the courage to make that change.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The sun will rise and shine. Birds will chirp. Squirrels will steal
munchies from unsuspecting fans. And at 8:39 this morning, the
first shot of the 1999 Tour Championship will be fired.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officially, it will start like every other golf tournament
starts. But from that moment on, it will be unlike any event before
it or, hopefully, in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a celebration of Payne Stewart's life and the first tiny
steps of ensuring his memory is there for generations of future
golfers to admire and respect.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a lot more than mere golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not playing golf, I don't know how else we are able
to honor Payne's life,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said
Wednesday. ``If we're not playing, what forum can we use to remind
people about Payne and what he was all about?''
</P>
<P>
   The golfing community will come together on the beautiful
dew-draped grounds at Champions Golf Club today with Stewart first
and foremost in everybody's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Three days have passed since the Learjet in which he was
traveling crashed. There remains an uncomfortable, awkward feeling
throughout the ranks of players, fans and officials at the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But golf will go on. Or, at least, the tournament will.
</P>
<P>
   Today will start what will become a long list of tributes to
Stewart. A brief memorial service on the first tee will be held at
7:45 a.m. Tom Lehman will eulogize Stewart and deliver a prayer. A
lone bagpiper will stroll down the first fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people question whether we should be playing this
tournament,'' said Davis Love III. ``I questioned should we play
golf this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best thing the tour can do is to show its support for
Payne and his family. And we're going to show our support a lot
better being out here playing than we would have if we were all off
with our own families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got ideas of how this tournament should go. But
the main thing is being together. If we're together, we can do the
right things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne's memory is going to live on through golf. We have to
keep playing. We can shed a lot of light on Payne's life this week
that we couldn't if we didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's easy. The ceremony this morning figures to be a
teary-eyed affair. And a swell of emotions normally is not the best
way to prepare for a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   But the players agree the short commemorative service will be
appropriate. Then, after 27 holes are played today, most of the
players at the tournament will board a fleet of chartered aircraft
bound for Orlando, Fla., for a memorial service Friday morning at
the church where Stewart was a member, along with his wife, Tracey,
and their two children.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the players will return to Houston and the
tournament will resume with 27 holes Saturday and an 18-hole finale
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coping continues to be the main aspiration of all involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels different being here,'' Love said. ``At first, I
really didn't think we should play. And it doesn't feel right when
you're grinding out there on the range. It doesn't feel right when
you're laughing about something in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This event is going to have some weird things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   One clear story line is that the players are committed to
playing the event. But Love also wondered just how players will
respond after the trip to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is, once we get to Orlando and see Tracey and the
kids, am I going to want to come back and play golf?'' Love said.
``I don't know. I think that some of the guys may feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very, very difficult to go. I would
be surprised if everybody did go. Going and spending some time with
the family in November and December might be even more important.
Hopefully, we can draw some inspiration from it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Love, who finished third at the Tour Championship the last
time it was at Champions in 1997, believes by being together today,
the players are doing the most therapeutic thing they can do while
also honoring their friend and competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us to come out and run into guys and hug guys
that need to be hugged and cry with the guys who want to cry,''
Love said. ``Go ahead and get your grieving process started. I
think that's an important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, the defending champion, echoed Love's thoughts that
the atmosphere at Champions is anything but that of a normal PGA
Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly has been a different feel around here this
week,'' said Sutton, 41, a year younger than Stewart. ``I think the
one thing that this challenges us to think about is how short life
really is. I almost feel like I lost a family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year or so, I guess you might say we took some
pride in the fact that we were coming back at the age that we are
at. We were being competitive, and he'd say to me, `Let's win one
for the old guys.' Although Payne and I don't want to admit we are
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton admitted that concentrating on golf won't be the main
issue this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those situations in life where you are asked to
prioritize,'' he said. ``And I think the priority here is not this
golf tournament but what has happened to us as a tour with the loss
of Payne, the loss of a friend and what Tracey and the kids are
going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll all be putting our best foot forward, and there
will be a winner on Sunday night. But there is a greater priority.
So I'm not really worried about how I focus or don't focus this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   This tournament will not be about individuals trying to compete
and be the best this week. It will be about playing for Payne.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a friend gets taken in a tragedy like Payne has been, you
are reminded of how short life really is,'' Sutton said. ``So all
the people you haven't told you love lately, you'd better tell
them. And you'd better live your days like you mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   And for 29 PGA Tour pros, today marks the start of building an
emotional monument to one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payne Stewart's memory will live on as a golfer and as a
father,'' Love said. ``And, now, as a legend that was taken too
early.''

EDITORIAL: A CORRIDOR TO MIDEAST PEACE  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, October
28:
</P>
<P>
   The opening this week of the first ``safe passage'' corridor
between the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip and the other main areas
of Palestinian administration, on the West Bank, may have lacked
the political drama of earlier steps on the road to Middle East
peace. But it was a crucial advance.
</P>
<P>
   Building a lasting peace will require finding ways to meet the
economic needs of the Palestinians without compromising Israeli
security. The corridor, which will allow Palestinians living in
crowded and impoverished Gaza to cross Israel to seek new
opportunities in the more prosperous West Bank, shows how this can
be done. Its long-delayed opening raises hopes that a final peace
agreement can be worked out as early as next year, the goal set by
Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been much movement on other bargaining issues
between Israel and the Palestinians since both sides embraced that
one-year target in early September. Street clashes have erupted in
Bethlehem, and security officers from both sides confronted each
other in Jerusalem Tuesday over arrangements for protecting
Britain's foreign secretary when he met with Palestinian leaders.
But uneven progress is to be expected as Barak and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, wrestle with the sensitive remaining issues.
Six months after Barak's election, he has not flagged in his desire
for a speedy completion of the talks. Next week Barak, Arafat and
President Clinton will meet in Norway, and new understandings could
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the safe-passage agreement, Palestinians need only a
magnetic travel permit, which is good for a year and looks like a
driver's license, to make unlimited trips between Gaza and the West
Bank. Most will make the 27-mile journey by bus, but private cars
are permitted as well. No stops inside Israel are permitted, all
baggage is X-rayed and the permits are scanned by Israeli and
Palestinian security officers at either end of the corridor to spot
potential terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   First promised four years ago and then revived in the September
peace agreement, the system missed its scheduled starting date but
finally went into operation on Monday. For the million Palestinians
who until now had been virtually trapped in Gaza's jobless economy,
it is the most tangible benefit so far delivered by the Oslo peace.

STEWART'S PLANE CRASH EVOKES PAINFUL MEMORIES FOR DAVIS LOVE III  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Davis Love III lost his father in a plane crash 11
years ago. When Payne Stewart was killed in a plane crash Monday,
it was a shock to everyone in the golf world, but for Love it
stirred painful memories. It was the sudden loss of another person
who had been dear to him, a Ryder Cup teammate, someone he
respected and admired.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Tour Championship begins Thursday at Champions Golf
Club here, forgive Love if his mind drifts elsewhere, to thoughts
of his father, to thoughts of Stewart. It was a struggle for Love
just to enter the tournament. Until Justin Leonard and Ben Crenshaw
telephoned on Tuesday and persuaded Love to come, he was still
grieving at his home in Georgia, convinced that he wouldn't play
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Love arrived at the course Wednesday morning, still shaken, but
drawing strength from his peers. On Monday, he believed the
tournament should have been canceled. By Wednesday, he had a
different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at home thinking, `It doesn't seem right to play
golf,''' he said. ``People were questioning if we should play. But
after being here today, it is good to hug the guys that want to be
hugged, and cry with the guys that want to cry. It is part of the
process, and it is good for us to be together. We can shed light on
Payne by playing that we couldn't if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Love was 24 in 1988 when his father, Davis Love Jr., was killed
in the crash of a small plane near the Jacksonville, Fla., airport.
Love's father was one of the country's most respected golf
instructors, and to this day people approach Love and reminisce
about his father, telling Love how proud his father would have been
to see him having become one of the world's top players.
</P>
<P>
   The most memorable moment of Love's career occurred at the 1997
PG.A Championship, when a rainbow appeared over the 18th green at
Winged Foot Country Club as Love prepared to sink the winning putt.
It was like a signal from heaven, but Love was unable to share the
moment with his father face to face. Now, Love is concerned about
how Stewart's two children, 13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old
Aaron, will react to life without their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can help Aaron and Chelsea understand eventually
that the memories of their father will be fun,'' Love said. ``He
will live on in golf, but he will live on as a great father.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament schedule has been altered to allow players to
attend Stewart's memorial service Friday morning in Orlando, Fla.
The 29-man field in Houston will play 27 holes both Thursday and
Saturday, and 18 holes on Sunday. Chartered planes to Orlando have
been provided for players, their wives and their caddies on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a brief memorial service Thursday morning on
the first tee here before the tournament begins. Tom Lehman will
lead a prayer, and a single bagpipe player will walk down the first
fairway and play ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many players from Houston would attend
Friday's service in Orlando, but most of them, including Love, plan
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Players practiced at the course Wednesday and tried to focus on
golf amid many reminders of Stewart, with flags at the course
flying at half-mast and flowers hanging in front of the parking
space that had been reserved for him. Players were uncertain how to
act, or what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This challenges us to think about how short life really is,''
said Hal Sutton, the tournament's defending champion. ``Although
Payne wasn't a family member of mine, I almost feel like I lost a
family member. Payne and I have been competing against each other
for 22 years. Because our names were so close together, we were
always lockered beside one another. When we were parking in
alphabetical order, we were parking beside one another. Every time
I look at his locker this week, it causes distress in my insides.''
</P>
<P>
   Love feels the same way, but he hopes to summon enough strength
to finish the tournament, which has a $5 million purse, with
$900,000 going to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since my dad passed away, I have had a tough time going
to funerals,'' Love said. ``Once I get to Orlando, am I going to
want to come back here? I don't know. Hopefully, we will all get
that inspiration to come back and be ready to play.''

EDITORIAL: ABORTION RIGHTS IN PERIL  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   This week's federal appeals court decision upholding statutory
bans on so-called partial birth abortion in Illinois and Wisconsin
is a serious assault on the reproductive freedom guaranteed women
under Roe vs. Wade. The sharply divided 5-4 opinion by the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals conflicts with the decision only last
month by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking down
similar bans in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa. Thus the stage seems
to be set for a Supreme Court showdown on the roiling partial birth
issue. Surely the nation's top court cannot stand aloof when an
anti-abortion statute similar to one found unconstitutionally vague
and burdensome in Iowa is narrowly upheld weeks later in
neighboring Wisconsin, posing a threat to doctors of life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Although billed as narrow prohibitions of a rare late-term
abortion procedure, the proliferating partial birth laws all
contain language that could be read to forbid the abortion
procedures most commonly used before fetal viability, the period in
which the Supreme Court has held that abortions are protected by
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   To navigate around this problem, the 7th Circuit majority
resorted to gimmickry. First it declared that the laws were not
unconstitutionally vague. Then, in a contradictory move, it issued
``precautionary'' injunctions to forbid enforcement of the statutes
outside what the majority defined as their core prohibition until
state courts have a chance to clarify the statutes through criminal
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in dismissing arguments that the bans place an undue
burden on women's right to choose abortion, the majority brushed
aside reputable medical testimony about the need for a health
exception. They also ignored the real-world impact of the statutes
in deterring physicians from performing abortion procedures that
the majority concede are constitutionally protected. In an
impassioned dissent, the circuit's chief judge, Richard Posner, a
Reagan appointee, wrote, ``What physician would be fool enough or
hero enough to risk a criminal prosecution in order to explore the
precise meaning'' of the broadly worded ban?
</P>
<P>
   The profoundly flawed 7th Circuit decision has at least
crystallized the idea that this fight is about far more than a
single late-term abortion procedure. It is about the continuing
vitality of the Supreme Court's wise decision in Roe to keep
politicians from interfering with what should remain women's
private medical decisions.

PLAYERS AT TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP GRIEVE FOR STEWART, HIS FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIP-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The roar of jet engines was an eerie sound from the
bright autumn sky above Champions Golf Club Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The ghostly rumble of airplanes flying to and from Houston's
George Bush Intercontinental Airport triggered mass introspection
during the aftermath of Payne Stewart's untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time U.S. Open champion and five others died Monday
after an accident during a scheduled flight from Orlando, Fla., to
Dallas. The Learjet ran out of fuel after a four-hour flight and
slammed nose-first into a field near Mina, S.D. All on board might
have been dead or unconscious prior to the crash due to a loss of
pressure, government investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about how many times we've all flown on private
airplanes and how many times we've gotten into that private
airplane and didn't know anything about that airplane or anything
about the pilots in that airplane,'' said Hal Sutton, a PGA Tour
member and Stewart's teammate on last month's U.S. Ryder
Cup-winning team. ``I think about how many times I've put my family
into a situation like that, and it's just tragic that Payne had to
be an example for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA considered canceling this week's Tour Championship for
the top 30 players on its money list, commissioner Tim Finchem
said. Davis Love III admitted his reluctance to attend until a
conversation with Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting at home thinking, `It doesn't seem right to play
golf. It doesn't seem right to do anything other than try to do
something for the Stewarts,' '' Love said. ``I really think some
people were questioning should we play. I questioned should we play
golf this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Others shared Love's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think about playing a tournament,'' John Huston
said. ``It doesn't seem worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Leonard convinced Love that fellowship with one another
would be the beginning of healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for us to come out and run into guys and hug the
guys that want to get hugged and cry with the guys that want to
cry,'' Love said. ``Go ahead and get your grieving process started.
I think that's the important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``... It's good for us to get out here in our atmosphere where
we're more comfortable doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, 29 men will attempt to navigate 72 holes _ 27 Thursday and
Saturday and 18 on Sunday _ despite heavy hearts for their fallen
friend and his surviving family. There will be no play Friday here
or at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in Madison, Miss., out of
respect for Stewart's memorial service, scheduled for 11 a.m. EDT
in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Players will wear ribbons in memory of Stewart this week, and
Stewart's family will receive the $80,000 check that the 30th-place
finisher would have earned, Finchem said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a brief memorial service scheduled for 7:45 a.m.
Thursday on the No. 1 tee at Champions Golf Club. Tom Lehman,
another of Stewart's Ryder Cup teammates, will lead the prayer. A
lone bagpiper will walk down the fairway to conclude the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Finchem expects ``in the range of 100 players'' to attend the
service in Orlando, but no one could answer whether all 29 players
scheduled to play at the Tour Championship will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people _ and I'm one of them _ who don't do
well in situations like that and try to avoid them,'' Love said.
``Ever since my dad passed away, I've had a tough time going to
funerals or services. I think guys are going to have to decide
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my biggest issue is once I get to Orlando and see
(Stewart's wife) Tracey and those kids, am I going to want to come
back here? I don't know. I think that some of the guys may feel
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   No number of birdies or eagles will alleviate the heartache
experienced this week, and that pain will make it difficult for all
to focus and grind through this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about that all day long, and I think the
only answer that I have to that question is that this is one of
those situations in life where you're asked to prioritize,'' Sutton
said. ``I think the priority here is not this golf tournament, but
what has happened to us as a tour with the loss of Payne, the loss
of a friend and what Tracey and the kids are going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll all be putting our best foot forward, and there
will be a winner on Sunday night, but there is a greater priority.
So, I'm not really worried about how I focus or don't focus this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Stewart and their two children, 13-year-old Chelsea and
10-year-old Aaron, remain the focus of those prayers and thoughts.
Finchem met with Tracey on Tuesday in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will just say, as you might suspect, that she is very
strong,'' Finchem said. ``She is so positive in her love for him
that in some ways that seems to be giving her strength to deal with
it all from my perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Love understands this tragedy better than most. Love's
father, Davis Love Jr., died along with club professionals Jimmy
Hodges and John Popa in a November 1988 plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very hard,'' Love said. ``I can't say how Tracey
Stewart feels or Aaron or Chelsea. Everybody handles things
differently, but I think our whole family and anybody that has lost
a loved one or relative or friend in any type of accident knows a
little bit how they're feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton suggested one way that Stewart's friends could remember
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kidded Payne all my life about his knickers, but just as
a tribute to him,'' Sutton said, ``I think it would be kind of neat
if we all wore knickers on Sunday. I don't know if that's possible
or not, but it would be kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's space in the parking lot remains empty, yet
well-wishers have left flowers there in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of mine at home said, `How are you going to get on an
airplane on Friday? Doesn't that scare you?''' Love said. ``I've
been dealing with that for over 10 years. Sure, you think about it
every time you get on an airplane, but I like Tiger Woods' line.
Something about you can't ride a bike 50 miles to work just because
you were in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of our lives, and things happen. I basically just
told my kids, `Hey, we put a lot of faith in machines, and they
break sometimes.' And you know, you can't live your life scared.
And you know, when your time to go is there, sometimes it's not
what we choose. But in the end, somehow it turns out best. Right
now, it's hard for us to see that.'' nn

HELMS ORDERS 10 WOMEN FROM HOUSE OUT OF A SENATE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2nd graf to add that Helms believes the U.N. accord would be
unenforceable.) 
(ATTN: N.C., Calif.)  (rk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Jesse Helms, the hard-nosed chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, ordered Capitol police officers
Wednesday to remove 10 female House members from a Senate hearing
after he said they were disrupting the meeting by trying to present
him with a letter supporting an international treaty against the
discrimination against women.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, R-N.C., has blocked a Senate vote on the 1979 U.N.
accord, which he says would be unenforceable, and has declined to
meet personally with treaty supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The minor uproar began when Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California led
the group of women, all House Democrats who were accompanied by
some aides, from a Capitol Hill news conference to Helms' Senate
office and then to a nearby hearing room, where he was leading a
meeting on the Clinton administration's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   The group entered quietly, seeking to give Helms a placard-size
letter signed by 100 members of Congress in support of the
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
Against Women. The pact has been ratified by 165 countries, but not
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Taken aback, Helms gaveled the hearing to a halt and scolded Ms.
Woolsey _ ``Please be a lady'' _ before ordering uniformed officers
to ``Escort them out!''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the women expressed shock at the treatment from
Helms, who is notoriously tough but also assumes a courtly air with
women who appear before his panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he was asking us to be ladies, he could have been more
gentlemanly in treating us like colleagues in Congress,'' said Rep.
Nancy Pelosi of California.
</P>
<P>
   The tempest marked the latest episode in a rocky week for Helms.
Last week, he made clear that he opposed the nomination of Carol
Moseley-Braun to be ambassador to New Zealand. Democrats seized on
the comments about Ms. Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected
to the Senate, to accuse Helms and others of racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, decried the
chairman's actions, saying, ``If they were kicked out of a hearing
of the Congress, that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms, Marc Thiessen, disagreed, saying, ``They
came into a Senate hearing and disrupted it, holding placards and
yelling across the room at the chairman, and so they were removed
like any other protester would be.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the hearing showed Helms halting the testimony
from Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hearing on China and we have guests who are not
interested in that,'' said Helms, who seemed unsure who the House
members were. ``They want to demonstrate on another issue. I hope
the security people will escort them out in the corridor and let
them wait there.''
</P>
<P>
   From the back of the room, Ms. Woolsey asked the chairman to
accept their letter, but he cut her off with a bang of his gavel.
</P>
<P>
   She tried again, but Helms gaveled her silence. ``I would not be
discourteous to you where you work,'' he said. ``Now you please be
a lady. Escort them out! Escort them out!''
</P>
<P>
   After the women filed out, Helms turned to Cox and chortled,
``Heh, heh, some of your colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Not missing a beat, Cox responded: ``I thank you, senator. It's
much easier to get order in this hearing than it normally is on the
floor of the House of Representatives.''

FORMER TOP EDITOR AT ST. MARTIN'S TAKES JOB WITH TALK MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert B. Wallace, the former editor in chief of St.
Martin's Press who resigned abruptly two days ago, has a new job.
After a breakfast-time wooing Wednesday morning by Tina Brown, the
editor in chief of Talk Magazine, Wallace, a veteran of both ABC
News and Rolling Stone magazine, decided to join Talk as editorial
director.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's resignation came five days after St. Martin's recalled
a biography of George W. Bush, ``Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and
the Making of an American President'' from bookstores across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing house said that it no longer trusted the author,
J.H. Hatfield, because it learned that he had a criminal record,
which included a conviction 11 years ago for a botched
murder-for-hire scheme targeting Hatfield's then-boss.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives at St. Martin's, which is owned by
Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, said that Wallace had
approached John Sargent, the company's chief executive, over the
weekend and said he would resign if Sargent did not ask for the
resignation of Thomas L. Dunne, the editor in chief of the separate
St. Martin's imprint that published the Hatfield book.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said that Wallace had chafed at the fact that he did
not oversee Dunne's fief of nine editorial employees.
</P>
<P>
   In resigning, Wallace said he did not want to be associated with
the Dunne imprint and had been kept out of the loop on the book.
St. Martin's denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said Wednesday he did not want to discuss St. Martin's.
</P>
<P>
   Talk magazine, after the burst of publicity generated by its
first issue and an interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton, has faded
as a topic for the talk-show circuit. Two staff editors, including
the managing editor and the features editor, have left in recent
weeks, citing Ms. Brown's penchant for editing stories until the
last available minute. The magazine is a joint venture of the
Hearst Corp. and Miramax, a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   A Talk spokeswoman, Hilary Bass, said that the appointment of an
editorial director would not affect the editorial structure of the
magazine, or the responsibilities of the executive editor, David
Kuhn. She said that Kuhn's responsibilities were focused on Talk
Media, a development company of which he is a vice president, and
that Wallace would serve as editorial director for the magazine
alone, a position that addresses the long-term editorial vision of
the magazine and that has been handled thus far by Ms. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace said he was comfortable with the vagaries of a
start-up magazine; as an editor at Rolling Stone, he worked on the
start-ups of Family Life and Men's Journal. However different the
environment at Family Life magazine may be from Ms. Brown's Talk,
Wallace said, ``I understand that growing pains are a part of the
business.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With deep-pocketed bidders competing to outspend one
another, the carefully preserved baubles and treasures of Marilyn
Monroe went up for auction Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Christie's auction house in Manhattan applauded as
spirited bidding carried the prices of Monroe's belongings into the
stratosphere, well beyond what the auction house had estimated. The
winning bids totaled $5,030,000.
</P>
<P>
   The final item in the sale, the dress she wore at Madison Square
Garden when she sang ``Happy Birthday'' to President Kennedy on May
19, 1962, went for $1.15 million, plus commission.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Adlai E. Stevenson described that show-stopper by
remembering that Monroe was ``dressed in what she calls `skin and
beads.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the beads,'' Stevenson added.
</P>
<P>
   Auctions have become a popular way to dispose of belongings that
celebrities' heirs no longer want. In the last couple of years,
fans have paid handsomely for the not-necessarily handsome discards
of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Leonard Bernstein and Academy
Award-winning actresses _ everything from dog-eared sheet music to
furniture to old LPs to grand pianos to necklaces to evening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   The latest indication of how much people will pay for
celebrities' possessions began when Lord Hindlip _ the chairman of
Christie's International and the auctioneer who gaveled away 79
dresses belonging to Diana, princess of Wales, in 1997 _ faced the
standing-room-only crowd Wednesday night in the sale at Rockefeller
Center. Among those in the audience were the actress Stephanie
Seymour, Tony Curtis and Massimo Ferragamo, the chairman of the
Ferragamo shoe company, who wanted to buy back a pair of red
stiletto heels that the company made in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good form of reinvestment,'' said Ferragamo, who said
he wanted the shoes for the company's museum in Florence. ``The
estimate on those shoes was 1,000 times more than what the original
price was. Plus, Marilyn Monroe is an icon for all the reasons I
don't need to go into.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ferragamos got the shoes with a winning bid of $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the bidding began, Ferragamo settled into a stiff chair in
the 1,000-seat sale room _ a room filled through a lottery among
would-be bidders whose first purchase was the dictionary-thick
catalog, which cost $85 ($95 by mail). Christie's installed 100
telephone lines to handle prospective buyers who were not in the
room for the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were there clutched copies of the catalog, which
provided a full-color look at what Nancy Valentino, the curator,
called ``a capsule of an American life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a famous life, and the capsule was well preserved for 37
years in climate-controlled storage rooms. Monroe apparently never
threw anything away, so everything was on sale _ the glittery gowns
and the used furniture. Her dining-room table has the scratches of
a hard life in small apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a major saver,'' Ms. Valentino said. ``The way she
took care of her possessions really reflects her attitude toward
money. She came from a very poor childhood and never forgot that,
as opposed to people who make it big and throw everything out. We
were able to identify stuff from as far back as 1950. Most people
would get rid of it and buy new things.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bidders did not seem to mind the wear and tear on things
Monroe had touched, sat in, played, wore or waved. Lot 7, the blue
jeans she wore while hanging from the side of a train in ``River of
No Return,'' sold for $37,000. A black-and-white photograph of Joe
DiMaggio went for $9,000. Her wedding ring from DiMaggio, a
platinum band with 34 diamonds (one is missing), sold for $700,000,
much more than Christie's estimate of $30,000 to $50,000. Her white
lacquered baby grand piano, which originally belonged to her
mother, Gladys, went for $600,000. (Prices do not include the
auctioneer's commission.)
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had expected her Bible _ with, as the sale catalog
put it, ``a few pencil markings in the text,'' just like her movie
scripts _ to sell for $2,000 to $4,000. It went for $33,000. Her
Union Prayerbook for Jewish Worship sold for $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had valued the sleeveless Jean Louis cocktail dress
that she wore in ``The Misfits'' at $20,000 to $30,000 _ triple the
estimate for the film's script, by Husband No. 3, Arthur Miller. On
page 20 of the script, where Monroe's character said: ``I didn't
want children. Not with him,'' she penciled in a notation, ``Like
with J.D.'' Christie's speculated that she was referring to Husband
No. 2, DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time, slides flashed on a screen at the front of the
room, showing off another batch of earrings, brooches or keepsakes.
There was her parchment nomination for a Golden Globe Award (for
``Some Like It Hot'' in 1959) sold for $30,000. This was followed
by the statuette she received when she won the award on March 8,

carrying that night will go on sale. Whoever buys it will also get

EDITORIAL: MISGUIDED SHELTER REFORM  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 28:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers remember vividly when homeless women with children
were sleeping in Grand Central Terminal and violent, mentally ill
people were a regular hazard on the streets. New York City has made
a great deal of progress by coaxing these people into shelters,
where they get help with drug addiction, mental problems and the
domestic calamities that caused their lives to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giuliani administration is preparing to require all
able-bodied homeless people to work for their shelter, an extension
of the policy of requiring all welfare recipients to work for their
aid. The new policy appears abrupt and unduly punitive to the most
down-and-out residents of the city as cold weather approaches. From
a civic standpoint, it seems self-defeating to drive people onto
the streets, recreating the conditions so rightly deplored just a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter system holds about 7,000 single men and women, many
of them with drug or mental problems or other disabilities, and
about 5,000 families that include about 9,000 children. Some
three-quarters of the shelter residents receive welfare _ which
means that most of them already have workfare jobs. Of those not on
welfare, many work but remain in shelters because they earn too
little money to pay rent.
</P>
<P>
   Under current state policy, welfare recipients lose their
benefits if they fail to meet workfare requirements. The program
now proposed by the Giuliani administration would compound the
penalty by denying the welfare recipient shelter as well. Once a
homeless mother was ejected, child welfare officials could even
remove the children and put them in foster care to keep them off
the streets. However, a state court ruling in 1997 enjoined the
city from seeking foster care for homeless children ``solely based
upon a lack of housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most New Yorkers support the idea of requiring welfare
recipients to work in exchange for benefits. But even supporters of
workfare are startled by a plan that might force homeless people
back onto the streets and allow the city to usurp the role of
parent. Experience has shown that homeless people can get back on
their feet with close guidance, social service help and work skills
that many of them so desperately lack. Any plan that cuts against
this approach is a bad idea.

ARRESTS BY NEW JERSEY TROOPERS SHOW ANOTHER DROP IN SEPTEMBER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arrests by the New Jersey State Police were down 42 percent in
September from the same period last year, and the head of the state
troopers' union said Wednesday that he attributed the decline to
low morale and troopers' fear of being accused of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, which are published monthly, show a continuing
trend of fewer arrests since February, when Col. Carl A. Williams,
superintendent of the State Police, was forced to resign by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman. Williams had said in a newspaper interview
at the time that certain racial and ethnic groups dominate segments
of the illegal drug trade. In the month after the resignation, the
number of arrests also fell 42 percent; they had been up slightly
the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers made 1,042 arrests last month, 754 fewer than the 1,796
made in September 1998, according to figures released Tuesday. The
number of traffic summonses issued was also down, by about 10
percent, to 32,567 last month from 36,074 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trooper Edward Lennon, president of the State Troopers Fraternal
Organization, said the decline _ the largest since March _
reflected troopers' poor morale and fears of being accused of
singling out minority drivers. It was on Sept. 7, Lennon said, that
Troopers John Hogan, 29, and James Kenna, 28, were indicted on
charges of attempted murder and assault in the April 1998 shooting
of three unarmed men, two of them black and one Hispanic, on the
New Jersey Turnpike. The incident led to widespread public
criticism as well as state and federal investigations of the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think troopers are less likely to take the step further that
is required to initiate a patrol-related arrest,'' Lennon said.
``When they stop a car for speeding, they're issued a summons for
speeding, and the driver's on his way.'' There are indicators, like
a driver's nervousness, that might ordinarily prompt troopers to
search a car, he said, but ``it could be that they are ignoring
those indicators.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Police, would not
comment on Lennon's assertions. Hagerty said the decline could be
linked to the reassignment of 40 troopers to flood relief duty last
month or to a continuing decline in the overall crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that in 1998 we recorded a 9 percent drop in
crime, and the FBI is telling us we're looking at a similar decline
in 1999,'' he said. ``With declining crime rates, you're going to
have fewer arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty said troopers were also busier aiding drivers last
month, with 15,127 reports of assistance, compared with 14,277 in
September 1998. The number of warnings issued fell slightly, to
15,418 from 15,684.
</P>
<P>
   The State Police began publishing the monthly figures in April
at the recommendation of Peter G. Verniero, then the state attorney
general, to increase accountability and public confidence in the
force. Hagerty said he could not say whether either goal had been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Police get letters, pro and con, on a daily basis,'' he
said. ``Are we seeing a difference in the tone and nature of the
letters? Not necessarily.''

GORE, BRADLEY SPAR POLITELY, BUT VP IS CRITICAL OF CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore moved quickly Wednesday
in the first nationally televised joint appearance of the
presidential campaign to distance himself from President Clinton's
White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore's first questioner from the audience only alluded
to the Lewinsky affair, without mentioning Clinton by name, the
vice president jumped in with a specific denunciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward
President Clinton _ and I felt it myself,'' said Gore, who seemed
to want to get the statement out as early and clearly as possible
to a purely political audience.
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently hoped to get past the problematic period and
its impact on his campaign. ``I also feel that the American people
want to move on and turn the page and focus on the future and not
the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's unexpectedly
strong challenger, sat nearby on a tall stool and did not comment
on the Monica Lewinsky scandal or Gore's response.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley only tepidly engaged when one of his questioners asked
him to comment on the financing of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were obviously some irregularities that have
been addressed,'' Bradley said, after acknowledging the opening he
had been given with a grinning sideways glance at Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the hourlong ``town meeting'' on the Dartmouth College
campus, was a polite, straightforward answer session by the
Democratic contenders to two dozen questions from audience members
who were picked by lottery. The inquiries had been screened by
sponsors CNN, which carried the event live, and WMUR-TV, the main
New Hampshire commercial station.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose uneven campaign had the most at stake, tried to work
in as many policy differences as possible with Bradley, but it was
far from the confrontational approach that has marked several of
the vice president's debates over the years. The sharpest exchanges
were gently couched disagreements over the cost of Bradley's more
comprehensive health-care proposal.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore relied heavily on his capacious memory to throw in
facts and figures, Bradley's emphasis was on a warm empathy to go
with the public policy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his hip three-button gray-green suit and blue shirt,
was hot, in contrast to the self-assured, laid-back cool of
Bradley, who wore a blue suit typical of the staid attire Gore has
forsaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall sense is that Gore tried a little too hard to
connect,'' said independent political analyst Stuart Rothenberg.
``It was pretty obvious what he was doing, it was so artificial.
Bradley's nonpolitician approach seemed more genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The session, in Dartmouth's Moore Theater, was the first major
face-off between the two Democratic contenders and comes about
three months before the first major test of the 2000 presidential
campaign, the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24. The New Hampshire primary
is eight days later on Feb 1.
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley steadily moved up on Gore in national polls, and
pulled ahead in New Hampshire surveys, the vice president began to
challenge his former Senate colleague to weekly debates. Earlier,
Gore not only had been disinterested in debates but also refused
even to mention Bradley by name.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley have agreed to at least six more debates before
the New Hampshire primary, some of which will allow a more direct
one-on-one approach that will test the candidates' mettle under
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential contenders, except Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the GOP front-runner, will make a similar joint appearance
Thursday night during a 90-minute national telecast (8-9 p.m. EDT,
on CNN).
</P>
<P>
   Bush's challengers were amazed to learn Wednesday that debate
sponsor WMUR-TV has agreed to give the governor a live solo
interview on the evening news before the GOP engagement, which he
refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also ducked a Republican debate in New Hampshire last
week, is skipping Thursday night's event because he said he wanted
to attend a Dallas dinner where his wife, Laura, will be honored by
her alma mater, Southern Methodist University. Bush aides said the
governor is to conduct the interview from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday in Iowa what he wanted voters to take from
his absence Thursday, Bush said: ``That I love my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor asked
for the interview because, ``he wanted to let the people of New
Hampshire know why he would not be in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic debate came as new polling showed Bradley's lead
in New Hampshire growing as national surveys continued to suggest
he may be more electable over a Republican than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates included a direct appeal to voters in
New Hampshire, historically the site of the first primary of the
quadrennial presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Once a question arose about the cost of Bradley's health-care
plan, each candidate used several pieces of other 90-second answers
to return to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said his plan, which guarantees health care to children
and opens a federal medical insurance system to the poor, would
cost $50 billion to $65 billion a year and would be financed by the
growing federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose health-care plan is smaller, moved quickly over a
question about juvenile diabetes to claim Bradley's proposal would
cost $1.2 trillion over 10 years and eat up all the projected
surplus _ leaving no funds to shore up the Medicare system as the
baby boom generation reaches retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost is way excessive,'' Gore said, draping his rejoinder
over two subsequent answers. ``Medicare cannot be an
afterthought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our own experts,'' Bradley later replied. ``I
dispute the cost figures Al used.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also some subtle differences in how the candidates
handled emotional issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley called for homosexuals to be allowed to serve openly in
the military. Even though the next question to Gore was also about
gay rights, he did not defend the Clinton administration's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy that keeps homosexuals closeted while in
military service _ nor did he repudiate it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley proposed amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include
sexual orientation as a protected category, but Gore pointed out
that civil rights groups favored a less dramatic approach to
provide legal protection for gays.
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically about recognition of gay marriage, Gore
pointed out that both he and Bradley were opposed to formal state
sanction of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore said he backed legal protection, such as
contractual rights, for same-sex couples, ``I favor protecting the
institution of marriage as it has been understood, between a man
and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' answers to most of the questions followed
long-scripted responses that are delivered almost daily as they
campaign across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In replying to a question on health maintenance organizations,
Gore turned to one of his favorite campaign trail jokes, about the
HMO administrator, who when he approached the Pearly Gates was told
by St. Peter that he could come in _ but stay only three days.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also chose to deal lightly with a seemingly serious
question about the biggest mistake of his political life by
replying that he had chosen his words poorly when he seemed to
claim he had invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley came closest to being challenged on personal motives by
a question asking why he left the Senate in 1996 _ when, as Gore
has suggested, he should have stayed and help fight the Republican
majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for me to move on,'' said Bradley, who detailed
his subsequent efforts as a professor, businessman and campaign
finance reform advocate. Bradley's campaign strategists are
convinced voters will not hold it against their candidate _ or
anyone's _ for leaving Washington.

FROM SILICON VALLEY TO SOMALIA: A HELPING HEART THAT SEES NO
BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDY KENNEDY    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can take your pick of heart-stopping stories to
introduce Joelle Tanguy. This one takes place in Somalia, with the
barrel of an AK-47 resting against her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tanguy, 40, is the executive director of the U.S. wing of
Doctors Without Borders _ or Medecins Sans Frontieres _ the
Paris-based humanitarian group that won the Nobel Peace Prize this
month.
</P>
<P>
   But before she took an office job, she was living what Doctors
Without Borders calls the ``blue bag life.'' She had walked away
from a great job in Silicon Valley in 1989, had canceled her lease
and signed on with the group as a logistics specialist. She had no
home, no salary and no possessions beyond what she absolutely
needed, jammed into one of the bright blue duffel bags that have
become the group's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, she was in Mogadishu, where she spent five months. And
as the city began to come apart, with battles mounting between
United Nations peacekeeping troops and Somali clan leaders, it fell
to Ms. Tanguy (pronounced Tahn-GHEE) to pull her people out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closing of the mission was very hard,'' she recalled the
other day in her spartan office on the edge of Manhattan's Garment
District. ``You had local people losing their jobs. And everybody
who lost their jobs there either had a Kalashnikov or an AK-47 or
had a brother who had one.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Labor negotiations in this country can be tough,
but labor negotiations in Somalia were quite interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, as she stared down the Somali worker on the
trigger end of the rifle, she does not remember being exceptionally
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain. It's very unexplainable in a
newspaper,'' she said. ``Probably I was a second, a split-second,
away from being dead. I don't know. But I was feeling very
comfortable there. I didn't believe he would do it. I guess I had
to believe that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people get angry is because they are afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tanguy is 5 feet tall and speaks softly, with a thick,
lilting French accent. You could almost call her bubbly. So it is
hard to imagine her facing down gunmen or standing her ground in a
room full of angry Somali warlords or building bridges over
refrigerator-sized potholes with planks she carried atop her car.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably also hard to imagine that she can tell these
stories without sounding just like all the battle junkies and
adrenaline addicts she has so often met and hated in the world's
war zones. But it takes coaxing to get her talking about herself,
mostly because she is worried that she will send the wrong message
about Doctors Without Borders.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she is worried that the Nobel Prize citation _ which
called the volunteers ``fearless and self-sacrificing'' _ will send
the same wrong message. And her true message is: no cowboys or
cowgirls need apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any martyrs or heroes,'' she said. ``When you
walk into a war zone, you have to do it with your brain cells in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tanguy, who grew up in a suburb of Versailles, the daughter
of an aeronautics technician, had no pedigree for this kind of
life. Her parents have never taken an overseas trip, and they
wonder to this day ``how come there was such a spontaneous
generation of a traveler in such a sedentary family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She once or twice saw me on television with the bombing in the
background, my mother did,'' Ms. Tanguy said. ``I was actually for
many years trying to prevent her from knowing where I was. I would
say I was in Kenya when I was in Somalia. I would say I was in
Croatia when I was in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   But ever since she was 25 and, as a successful Stanford
University business school graduate, took a ``sabbatical'' from her
job, her parents knew she was a lost cause. She left to travel
alone for a couple of months in India. A couple of months turned
into 18, and India turned into most of Asia. When she was asked how
her company felt about such an extended sabbatical, she laughed.
``Oh no, no. I quit. I knew that I would find a job when I came
back. It was such a natural thing to me at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   She loved traveling, but it started to make her feel complacent
the way that making computers and a lot of money did. She visited
Pakistan during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and watched
as the Russians tried to ``how do you say, get the fish by
destroying the fish tank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a tourist, and you would see people who are asking
 &UR; you &LR;  for medicine. They're interested in whether in your backpack
you wouldn't maybe have something to cure them. And you start to
realize, `I'm having a fantastic time, and I'm discovering the
world, but I'm a bit of a useless part of that world.'''
</P>
<P>
   After five years of almost continuous field work for the group,
from Armenia to Zaire to Bosnia, Ms. Tanguy, ``with lots and lots
of hesitation,'' decided that she needed to ``take a sabbatical
from her sabbaticals.'' She accepted the job in New York, where she
coordinates the farflung work of about 120 medical volunteers a
year. She found an apartment in the East Village and signed her
first lease in five years.
</P>
<P>
   She says cryptically that she is still trying to have a personal
life. But if you had called her any time over the last year and a
half, chances are you would not have found her home. She has been
to Kosovo three times, most recently this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't live without having my chance at a blue bag every once
in a while.''

U.S. CHARGES 8 INSPECTORS IN KICKBACK SCHEME AT BRONX PRODUCE
MARKET

 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eight federal food inspectors who monitored millions
of pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables sold each year at the Hunts
Point Terminal Market in the Bronx have been arrested in a bribery
and kickback scheme that allowed wholesalers to cheat their
suppliers, federal authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme, the inspectors would declare food at the
market to be of lower quality, allowing wholesalers to pay less to
suppliers of fruits and vegetables, the authorities said. While it
did not result in the sale of tainted or lower-quality produce to
the public, officials said, the scheme resulted in thousands of
phony inspections and a system that became so corrupt that some
growers told the authorities that they no longer wanted to sell
their produce in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit to the wholesalers was obvious,'' said Lewis D.
Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI in charge of the New York
office. ``They were routinely getting Grade A produce at Grade B
prices, and it's a safe bet they weren't passing the savings on to
the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors include 7 of the 14 currently assigned by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture to Hunts Point, the nation's largest
produce wholesale market. An eighth inspector, no longer assigned
to the market, was also charged, along with 13 employees of
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme, which was outlined in a 65-count racketeering and
bribery indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
took place over two decades, officials said, and was so endemic
that some of the inspectors took more than $100,000 a year in
illegal payoffs, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, said that an
undercover investigation for two and a half years, called Operation
Forbidden Fruit, found that inspectors had worked closely together,
collecting payoffs for each other and cooperating to identify
companies most likely to agree to payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors, who were each charged with racketeering and
other counts, were identified as David L. Ball, Paul I. Cutler,
Thomas C. Vincent and Michael Tsamis, all of New York City; Edmund
R. Esposito, of East Rockaway, N.Y.; Glenn A. Jones, of Glen Oaks,
N.Y.; Elias Malavet, of Carle Place, N.Y.; Michael Strusiak, of
Stafford, Va..
</P>
<P>
   The 13 employees were each charged with bribery of a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors charged in the case, who had salaries of roughly
$40,000 to $50,000, earned at least twice that amount in kickbacks,
Ms. White said. The payoffs, she said, were ``a matter of routine,
year after year, day after day.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rubin, co-president of the Hunts Point Produce Cooperative,
an association of wholesaler produce companies, said in a statement
that his group would cooperate with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shocked by today's accusation,'' he said. ``Hunts Point
Cooperative has zero tolerance for any infraction of the law by
anyone who works for or is associated with the market.''
</P>
<P>
   As the authorities described it Wednesday, the conspiracy
depended in large part on the fragile interplay between produce
wholesalers at Hunts Point and growers across the country, most in
Western agricultural states, who often shipped their fruits and
vegetables to New York over long distances in large tractor-trailer
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers at Hunts Point, who number more than 50, would
resell the fruit across the New York region, up and down the east
coast, and as far west as Chicago, a spokesman for the market said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor, Evan T. Barr, said that typically the
wholesalers entered into agreements with the suppliers specifying
the quality of the produce, such as ``U.S. Extra Fancy,'' as part
of a federal grading system. The inspections were voluntary and
were conducted only if requested by the wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Working through the night from a second-floor office in one of
the huge warehouse-like buildings that line the 113-acre property,
the inspectors would examine the fruit and vegetables for evidence
of bruises, discoloration, or other damage that might have occurred
during shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Although the inspectors were supposed to resolve disputes
between suppliers and wholesalers impartially, those charged
Wednesday instead are accused of taking payoffs from the
wholesalers of about $50 per lot inspected, in return ``for
agreeing to alter the results of produce inspections by
`downgrading''' the quality, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with such a report, the wholesalers had enormous leverage
to renegotiate the price downward with the supplier, who typically
accepted a lower price for the produce, rather than take it back.
</P>
<P>
   Even the slightest variance in the grade of the fruits and
vegetables could dramatically change the overall contract price,
sometimes by thousands of dollars, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real money from real people coast to coast,'' said
Roger C. Viadero, inspector general of the Agriculture Department.
``It impacts the small farmer and the producer, who are the true
victims here.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began after farmers complained to the
inspector general, Barr said, and it continued with assistance from
what he described as ``several honest inspectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the inspectors charged in the case were ``an organized
group.'' For example, he said that after completing an inspection
they would ``kick back a portion of the bribe proceeds to the night
supervisor, who was in charge of assigning them to a particular
location each morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspectors would coordinate with each other,'' Barr said, ``to
determine which locations were `paying' locations, and which ones
were not.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21 defendants were each expected to be released on bond
Wednesday, officials said. Their lawyers could not be immediately
identified for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the New York police began making arrests at the
market early Wednesday, at about 4 a.m., the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man, they were everywhere,'' one warehouse worker, Ismael
Cancela, recalled yesterday afternoon. ``I never saw anything like
it.''

EX-PLAYER ADVISES COWBOYS' IRVIN TO QUIT NOW
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Nobody around the Dallas Cowboys' Valley Ranch
headquarters would offer career advice to Michael Irvin on
Wednesday. But at the same time, nobody would seem to be surprised
if Michael Irvin retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision that a lot of players, at some point or
another, have to make ... as to whether or not going out and
playing is worth the risk,'' Troy Aikman said. ``Michael may very
well be faced with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, the third member of the so-called ``Triplets'' who
formed the cornerstone of the Cowboys' three Super Bowl
championship teams this decade, was asked about his concerns over
the Cowboys wide receiver coming back. Or even if Irvin will come
back after being diagnosed with cervical stenosis _ a narrow spinal
canal that could leave him paralyzed if he takes another hit like
the one that knocked him out of the game at Philadelphia on Oct 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good question,'' Smith said. ``Obviously, Michael
definitely needs to do what is best for him and his family. Mike
knows we all want him back. Now he has to figure out whether or not
he wants to go back out and risk (his long-term health), and
whether or not he feels he can play up to his capabilities without
hindering himself mentally, more so than physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Denver, Broncos linebackers coach Frank Bush, given
a diagnosis 13 years ago of the same genetically narrow spinal
canal as Irvin, had four words of advice for the Cowboys' all-time
leading receiver:
</P>
<P>
   ``Shut it down, Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, 33, is scheduled to undergo magnetic resonance imaging
for a second time Thursday. Cervical stenosis was first diagnosed
in Irvin when he had an MRI after the injury in Philadelphia. With
a narrow spinal canal, there is no cushion to keep the bone from
putting pressure on the spinal cord when jarred. The condition
increases the potential for a hit similar to the one he suffered
against Philadelphia _ or even one not as severe _ to cause
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who also suffered swelling in his cervical spine after
the hit, has said he will gather as much information as possible.
As to the question of whether to play again, Irvin ``should be able
to make an intelligent decision within the next couple of weeks,''
said his agent, Steve Endicott.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones described Irvin's cervical stenosis,
which is an unchanging condition, as ``more the issue'' than the
swelling at two places in Irvin's spinal column.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said, ``There's a possibility that there is not going
to be a definitive (medical) conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, no one in the medical field had even tried to
advise Irvin to retire. Irvin was not at Valley Ranch on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who speaks from experience, has been told by spine
specialists that, if trauma is experienced again, calcium build-up
inside the spinal canal of a cervical stenosis patient can make an
already-narrow space even narrower, causing numbness and possible
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told if you have had (numbness) once, the next time can
be even worse,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose promising pro career with the Houston Oilers
abruptly ended in 1986 as a 23-year-old linebacker who had made the
NFL all-rookie team in '85, received four medical opinions _ all
the same. He tried to find a neurosurgeon who would tell him that
it was OK to keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never played again, just as Green Bay cornerback Tim Lewis,
now secondary coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, never played again
after being given a diagnosis of cervical stenosis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was injured in a 1986 Bears-Packers game on ``Monday Night
Football'', one night after Bush was injured in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In all three cases _ Bush, Lewis and Irvin _ this genetically
narrowed spinal canal, a condition they all share, would not have
been detected if they hadn't received neck injuries that required
examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell (Irvin), `Shut it down, Michael.' That would be
the smart thing to do,'' Bush said. ``He's had a great (12-year)
career. You're not going to play this game forever, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has been examined by a spine specialist in Philadelphia
and in Dallas by Dr. Drew Dossett. He has been encouraged by the
Cowboys to get all the second opinions that he wants, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The MRI taken Thursday will be compared to the MRI taken Oct.
11, in Philadelphia, one day after Irvin was taken by ambulance to
a downtown trauma unit. Irvin lost feeling in his hands and his
legs for more than 15 minutes after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, now 36, enjoys what he calls ``a normal life'' without any
numbness or any weakness in any of his extremities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I haven't hit anybody, either,'' said Bush, who
remembers reading about Irvin's injury and thinking, `Oh no, I'll
bet he's got what I got.' It's going to be real shaky if he tries
to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Following doctor's advice, Bush gets a checkup on his cervical
spine every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that doctors are afraid of the calcium that can
build up right where the spinal cord and the spinal canal collide,
if you ever get jarred,'' Bush added. ``The calcium is the body's
way of healing, but this calcium can cause numbness. I was told if
you have had it once, it can only be worse the next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cervical stenosis is not life-threatening; it's
lifestyle-threatening if you continue to play. I know Michael Irvin
is considered an old football player, but he's still a young man.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens was traded to the Yankees on the first
day of spring training, and on the last day of the World Series he
became a Yankee. He and his teammates heard all year how the team
wasn't as good as the record-setting Yankees of 1998, but when it
came to achieving any team's ultimate goal _ winning the World
Series _ the Yankees, and Clemens, were every bit as good.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens shut out the Atlanta Braves into the eighth inning on
Wednesday night and the Yankees went on to win, 4-1, at Yankee
Stadium, clinching a four-game sweep and the Yankees' 25th
championship of the century, their third title in four years. The
Yankees' victory on Wednesday night was their 12th straight in the
World Series, tying a record.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, was named the most valuable
player of the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was on the mound in the ninth inning when Atlanta's Keith
Lockhart hit a high pop fly to left field. As soon as the ball went
into the air, the Yankees began moving out of their dugout and
catcher Jorge Posada raised both arms and started rushing toward
the mound. Rivera waited until the ball fell into the mitt of left
fielder Chad Curtis, then raised his arms, turned and fell into the
arms of Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, whose father had passed away earlier in the day,
ran in from right field, pausing to stop at second base and step on
the bag superstitiously before joining his teammates near the
mound. Many of the Yankees appeared to be near tears as they
hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens finished warming up in the bullpen, stepped among the
monuments and pressed his right palm against the bronze image of
Babe Ruth, then walked across the Yankee Stadium field, fans
roaring when they saw him. It was a blustery fall night, the
evening moon was red-orange; this is Clemens' favorite time of
year, and this was the day he had been waiting for, Yankees Manager
Joe Torre said before the game, ``for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Clemens scaled the mound to start the game, third
baseman Scott Brosius handed him the baseball and said something to
him; then Derek Jeter jogged in, with his perpetual half-grin,
added a few words of wisdom and slapped Clemens on the backside
with his glove. Clemens blew on his clenched right fist to warm his
hand, stood on the mound and stared in for the sign, peering
underneath his cap and over his black glove.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had been conquered by his own adrenaline repeatedly this
year, mostly in the early innings, when he would struggle to throw
strikes. Right away, the lead-off batter, Gerald Williams, fought
Clemens to a full count _ before Clemens fired a low fastball below
Williams' wild swing. Bret Boone grounded out to shortstop, and so
did Chipper Jones. Three up, three down.
</P>
<P>
   This was what the Yankees envisioned when they traded for
Clemens, a pitcher in command. During the regular season, Clemens
averaged 17.7 pitches an inning, but he would average less than 13
an inning in the first five innings on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   All season, Clemens had his catchers provide multiple signs for
him, even when there were no runners on base, and sometimes it
confused them. On Wednesday night, Clemens changed that, and Posada
gave him one sign at a time, rather than three. He kept his
fastball down in the strike zone, mixing in a particularly
hard-breaking split-fingered fastball and an occasional slider.
Great stuff.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz, the Atlanta pitcher, also had great stuff, but the
Yankees, as they do better than anybody else, gnawed at him, taking
pitches, spraying foul balls _ 18 in the first three innings _ and
driving up his pitch count quickly: Smoltz threw 75 pitches in the
first three innings, and reached three-ball counts on 10 of the
first 18 hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had runners at first and second and nobody out in
the second inning and could not score, as Posada, Ricky Ledee and
Brosius all took fastballs over the outside corner. But Chuck
Knoblauch reached first on an infield single to lead off the third,
and Jeter spanked a broken-bat single to right, Knoblauch sprinting
to third and pulling into the base standing. The Yankee Stadium
crowd of 56,752 boomed aloud, and in the Braves' dugout, Atlanta
Manager Bobby Cox could be seen shaking his head slightly; there
was no score, but it felt as if the conclusion was foregone.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill struck out, with Jeter stealing second, and the Braves
intentionally walked Bernie Williams. Bases loaded, one out. Tino
Martinez then turned on a fastball, pulling it hard toward first
base. Ryan Klesko, the Atlanta first baseman, waved his glove at
the ball, which bounded off his wrist and rolled into short right
field. Knoblauch scored and Jeter followed, taking the last steps
toward home plate with his right fist raised. Two batters later,
Posada stroked a single to right, and Williams rambled homeward
safely. The Yankees' lead was three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had found a groove by then, throwing comfortably,
freely. Clemens had been injured while pitching in Boston 12 days
ago, receiving treatment on his lower back after he was knocked out
at the outset of the third inning; teammates believe the reason he
would not disclose he was hurt is that he did not want to appear to
be making an excuse. Whatever ailed him apparently was no longer a
problem, for he blistered the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was keeping his fastball and split-fingered fastball
low, he was getting an unusual number of groundballs: 15 of the
first 21 outs were on grounders, four others were on strikeouts,
and with each subsequent out, the fans at Yankee Stadium began
smelling the championship. Their cheers were louder, and Clemens'
energy increased.
</P>
<P>
   When Brosius rushed in to field a bouncer and then throw to
second nicely for an out, Clemens had pumped a fist and pointed at
Brosius. Keith Lockhart led off the fifth inning and Clemens fell
behind Eddie Perez, three balls and no strikes; this was the one
moment all night when the Braves appeared to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez eventually chopped a grounder to Brosius, who threw to
Knoblauch, who avoided Lockhart's slide and threw perfectly to
first. Clemens screamed aloud _ ``Yeah, Bro!'' _ and stalked around
the mound, jabbing a finger first in the direction of Brosius, and
then Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fell while covering first base with two outs in the
eighth inning, when the runner Walt Weiss ran over his leg, and
Clemens came away limping. But as he tested the injury, Yankees'
fans cheered with each of his throws, louder and louder; they
wanted him to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens surrendered another hit, however, and once Torre emerged
from the dugout to relieve him, the cheers for Clemens began and
they peaked as Torre took the ball from him and sent him to the
dugout with a pat on his back. He had surrendered four hits and
just one run in his seven and two-thirds innings, walking two and
striking out four. Flashbulbs popped, everybody in Yankee Stadium
was standing and roaring and Clemens was moved to take off his cap,
wave both hands. Roger, Roger.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen took over, one run scoring before Rivera
relieved. The end was in sight now. All year, Clemens heard that he
was not as good as David Wells, maybe not good enough for the
Yankees. But he drove them over that finish line that seemed so
distant so often this summer.

OREGON CONSIDERS CHALLENGE IF ASSISTED-SUICIDE LAW IS OVERTURNED
</HEADLINE>
   (With DEATH-CONGRESS) 
(rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Elected officials in Oregon raised the possibility
Wednesday that they would mount a constitutional challenge to any
federal measure that tried to overturn state law allowing
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Their reaction followed passage in the House of a bill that
would prohibit doctors from prescribing drugs to help terminally
ill patients end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor views the bill as a roundabout way of undermining
Oregon's law,'' said Jon Coney, a spokesman for Gov. John
Kitzhaber, a Democrat. He said the governor would consider a legal
challenge, which could eventually send the issue to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Some state lawmakers indicated that they might be willing to
back that approach, but wanted to wait to see whether the Senate
and the president go along with the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Such a challenge would appear to be an uphill one. The
constitution generally provides that federal laws supersede those
passed by the states, said David Schuman, Oregon's deputy attorney
general. But he said officials were exploring other means to
involve the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a states'-rights issue,'' Schuman said,
``and the question would be: Is the regulation of the medical
profession something that Congress can do, or is that something
that's reserved for the states?''
</P>
<P>
   The State Senate's majority leader, Gene Derfler, a Republican,
also said Wednesday that he would support a legal challenge.
``Whether you like it or don't like it,'' he said of
physician-assisted suicide, ``the states should have the ability to
make those choices.''
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on any form of legal challenge by the state
would be up to Kitzhaber, a doctor who has done battle with the
federal government before, over the state's strategy, developed in
the early 1990s, to ration some forms of medical treatment to
provide care for more people.

COWBOYS PONDER HOW TO ADJUST IF IRVIN DOESN'T RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As ``Life Without Michael Irvin'' goes into its
third week, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman is left to
ponder along with everyone else:
</P>
<P>
   What if this isn't temporary?
</P>
<P>
   Can Aikman find the same comfort zone with Raghib ``Rocket''
Ismail as he enjoyed for more than 11 seasons, through three Super
Bowl championships and 14 playoff games with Irvin as his favorite
target?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocket and I have gotten more and more comfortable together,''
Aikman said. ``But Rocket and I probably won't play 11 years
together. And he's a different kind of receiver than Michael. You
tend to have more of that kind of (quarterback-receiver) rapport
with a possession-type guy like Michael, as opposed to a real
big-play threat like Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has a genetically narrow spinal canal, a condition known
as cervical stenosis, which was detected three weeks ago after he
underwentmagnetic resonance imaging in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith momentarily broke away from the serious nature of
what is being considered a career decision facing Irvin to speak
directly to his fallen teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These eight- and nine-man fronts ain't no joke,'' said Smith,
who has a 2.3-yard average over the past two games. ``You need to
come back. You need to just stand out there on the field. You used
to tell me, `Just stand up back there. Don't get off the field.'
Well, I need you to (draw) some double-coverage again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith lost his smile, adding, ``On a serious note, Michael has
to do what is best for him and his family. He can only do that by
listening to the advice of the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Those at Valley Ranch put Irvin's quality of life above
football. But there is a void with Irvin gone, and it's being
experienced now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing pains,'' Aikman called it. ``Clearly, we're better
when Michael is playing. We would like not to be inconsistent, but
when you have a lot of young players you're depending on ... it
lends itself to inconsistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Receivers Jason Tucker, Jeff Ogden and injured Wane McGarity
(who has a dislocated shoulder but should return next month) are
all first- or second-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever replace a Michael Irvin,'' coach Chan
Gailey said. ``You only hope that others step up and allow you to
diversify to make up for his absence.''

THOMAS NOW STARTING AT FULLBACK FOR COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Rarely does lightning strike twice in the same
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys fullback Robert Thomas would beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly two months after being hit with the news that the
Cowboys were going to move him from linebacker to fullback, Thomas
walked into the team's Valley Ranch headquarters Wednesday and was
overwhelmed again.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Tim Lester on Tuesday meant that Thomas, in his
second-year in the league and eighth week as a fullback, was going
to join the future Hall of Fame backfield of quarterback Troy
Aikman and running back Emmitt Smith as the starting fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all just hit me,'' Thomas said. ``I found out when I came
in. It's a surprise. They told me it's my job to lose now. They
said I earned it. I'm happy, but I know I've still got work to do.
I've still got to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said Thomas had progressed enough
since switching positions near the end of training camp for them to
make the move with Lester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been very good,'' said former starter and
resident fullback teacher Daryl Johnston, who is out for the season
with a neck injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very impressive what he's done in such little time at the
position. He has a lot of potential. I don't see him having any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   While the eight-year veteran Lester still understands the
nuances of fullback better than Thomas, Thomas has more explosion
as a blocker and comes at a cheaper salary. Lester was also a
liability on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is that the role of the fullback is not
the same as it was in the past. The Cowboys will use running back
Chris Warren as a fullback in the backfield with Smith a lot more.
They also will work more out of the one-back set with tight ends
Mike Lucky and David LaFleur taking the blocking assignments of the
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the fullback position remains important _ to the team and
Smith personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to spend time with Daryl Johnston and myself and
learn what made him good and what made us click,'' Smith said. ``If
he doesn't do that, he's selling himself short and he's selling me
short and he's selling the team short.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, is confident that the 6-foot-1, 255-pound Thomas
will measure up because he's a quick learner who has leaned heavily
on Johnston since the move in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be where I am now without Moose,'' Thomas said.
``He has been a blessing to me, getting me ready physically and
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   SMITH'S WORKLOAD
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith, who has already carried the ball more times in his
career than any other running back in NFL history outside of Walter
Payton, is on pace for more attempts this season than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 30, is averaging 25 rushes a game and would finish 1999
with 400 at the current pace. His previous high-tote mark was 377
in 1995. Only three running backs in NFL history have carried the
ball 400 times. Nobody has done that this late in a career.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it seemingly contradicts the
lessen-the-load-on-Smith mantra Chan Gailey came in with a year
ago, the Cowboys coach is not worried about Smith's carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said anything about limiting Emmitt's carries,''
Gailey said. ``I've always said we wanted to give Emmitt some rest.
We've been able to do that on passing downs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rest Smith gets with backup Chris Warren
serving as the third-down back, Gailey said Smith takes less licks
because he doesn't pass-block. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Safety George Teague, who missed last week's game against the
Redskins, will be out one to three weeks with a herniated disk.
Izell Reese will start in his place against the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cornerback Kevin Mathis (hamstring) and center Mark Stepnoski
(low back contusion) missed practice Wednesday. Stepnoski is
expected to practice today and be ready for the Colts game. Mathis
is questionable for the Colts game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Receiver Wane McGarity (separated right shoulder) said it will
likely be another couple of weeks before it's decided when he'll
get back on the field. What's certain is that he'll probably need
surgery in the off-season to fully repair the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys cut offensive lineman Ben Fricke and re-signed him
to the practice squad. They used the roster opening to sign rookie
free-agent safety Chris Akins off the Green Bay Packers' practice
squad. He will help out in the secondary and play special teams. nn

 TURNING YOUR COMPUTER INTO A TURNTABLE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
T urning your desktop PC into a full-blown music jukebox requires
an investment in time, money and at least a small degree of
computer know-how.
<P>
   Yet it's getting easier. For one thing, major computer-makers
are packaging some new home computers with all the software and
hardware you need.
</P>
<P>
   But even if your PC comes with all the components, you still
need to know how to run the jukebox software and where all the
cords and plugs go.
</P>
<P>
   Most computers bought within the past few years should have the
basic hardware _ an audio card, a decent set of speakers, a CD-ROM
drive and a lot of free space on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a Pentium III, 450-megahertz computer to play
MP3s,'' said Michael Robertson, CEO of MP3.com, a Web site that has
become the top Internet portal for digital music news and
information.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some additions that will help you build a deluxe
music machine right on your desktop:
</P>
<P>
   SOFTWARE
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are downloading songs off the Internet or simply
copying _ a process called ``ripping'' _ music tracks from CDs you
already own, you need digital music software.
</P>
<P>
   The type of program you want depends on your end purpose. Some
programs are better at copying and playing songs, while others are
better at organizing music and transferring tracks to a portable
player. You may need to use more than one program.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, jukebox software lets you copy songs from a
CD, using the computer's CD-ROM drive, into digital files stored on
your computer's hard drive. Music also can be downloaded from the
Internet, usually already in MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   All jukebox software supports the popular MP3 audio-compression
format, which can squeeze a WAV file used on CDs to about one-10th
of its size by taking out some parts of the audio spectrum not
heard by the human ear. So a four-minute, 50-megabyte song on a CD
will turn into a 4-megabyte MP3 file.
</P>
<P>
   Some jukebox software also supports Microsoft's competing
Windows Media audio compression technology and Liquid Audio Inc.'s
proprietary Liquid Tracks digital audio format.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Converting music can take about 50 to 60 percent of the time
it takes to play the song or CD. But once the songs are in the
computer, you can organize them by genre, such as jazz, rock or
classical. Or you can create a playlist of favorite songs by one
artist, say your favorite ``thin Elvis'' tunes, while skipping
tunes he recorded in his ``fat Elvis'' days.
</P>
<P>
   You also can create playlists of songs to fit your mood _ an
hour's worth of jazz for relaxing, two hours of rock for exercising
or six hours of various genres to play in the background during a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, whose site at www.mp3.com rates and reviews jukebox
software, said MusicMatch Jukebox and RealJukebox are the standouts
of nearly 20 programs available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's seems to be a two-horse race,'' said Robertson, whose
site rates and reviews digital music software.
</P>
<P>
   Both are available for download from those companies' respective
Web sites, www.musicmatch.com and www.realnetworks.com, in free
versions, which can encode songs in ``near CD-quality'' MP3 format,
or enhanced $29.95 versions that allow you to step up to sound
quality that matches that of CDs.
</P>
<P>
   MusicMatch has just begun reaching out to more mainstream
consumers by marketing a shrink-wrapped version at retailers like
CompUSA, Best Buy and Staples. The boxed version also includes a
cable, to connect the computer's sound card to standard RCA jacks
in a stereo amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   Digital music fans like Drew Lynn of Venice, Calif., say they
also use WinAmp, the Internet's most popular MP3-player shareware,
because it is a Windows-based program that organizes songs in the
same way Microsoft Word documents are dragged and dropped into
files.
</P>
<P>
   Other jukebox programs are better at specific tasks. RioPort
Inc.'s Rio Audio Manager, for example, was designed to download
music into the Diamond Rio PMP 500 portable MP3 player. The
company, which spun off this week from S3 Inc., is working to make
the Rio Audio Manager better at organizing music.
</P>
<P>
   And if you fancy yourself an amateur disc jockey, there's a
program called PCDJ PHAT made by a small Florida firm called
VisioSonic Ltd. PCDJ PHAT, which stands for ``Pretty Hot and
Tight,'' allows you to mix songs in the same way a real DJ spins
together songs by hand-spinning and scratching vinyl records on a
turntable.
</P>
<P>
   HARDWARE
</P>
<P>
   Here's where it could get expensive; although, at minimum,
playing back songs on your computer's speaker system is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   A set of new computer speakers and subwoofers costing between
$100 and $200 gives a fuller, richer sound, MP3.com's Robertson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But you also could plug your computer's sound card to your
stereo system with a standard set of RCA cords and a
mini-plug-to-RCA adapter.
</P>
<P>
   This may be easy if you have a computer and stereo system in the
same room. If not, and if you don't want to drill holes in walls, a
Seattle company called X10 Ltd. (www.x10.com) sells an $88 wireless
connector called MP3 Anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Using an FM radio frequency, the MP3 Anywhere beams the music
signal from your PC to your stereo amplifier, and it comes with a
remote control computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   If you find the audio quality not up to CD standards, Creative
Labs Inc. has introduced Sound Blaster Live MP3-Plus. The firm,
based in Milpitas, Calif., says the $99 sound board boosts and
enhances stereo signals from MP3-encoded files. It comes with RCA
output jacks and software that creates mood-setting psychedelic
shapes and colors that move and groove on the computer monitor in
time with the music.
</P>
<P>
   Also, SRS Labs Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif., has introduced WOW
Thing, a $29.95 translucent blue box that enhances high- and
low-audio signals from MP3 and other digital audio files.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get going, it's easy to start filling up your hard
drive with songs, which creates the need for buying a bigger drive.
A few companies have popped up to offer virtual space.
</P>
<P>
   Myplay Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., for example, offers 250
Mbytes of free storage space for MP3 fans, hosted on its server,
plus the ability to listen to music playlists from any
Internet-connected computer and to share music with friends.
</P>
<P>
   New devices eventually may come on the market to make it even
easier to listen to computer songs. Wade Meyercord, chief financial
officer of RioPort Inc., said his company is working with partners
to develop a way to connect stereo systems directly to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you will see in the not-too-distant future,''
maybe within the year, Meyercord said.

 &HT;    Final game of decade tells the story of the '90s
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Major-league baseball in the 1990s came to a fitting
end Wednesday night, with the rich getting richer and the poor
Braves showing the form that made them a team of heartbreak in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are World Series champions for the third
time in the past four years, while the Atlanta Braves are
disappointed again.
</P>
<P>
   For all the time and energy the Braves have spent making this
such a storied season _ not to mention the previous eight _ it took
them only four games against the Yankees to watch it all swept
away, the last in a 4-1 loss Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the Yankees claimed their 25th World Series title overall
_ the best for any sports franchise _ the Braves made their
quickest exit in any of their 18 postseason series this decade and
probably their most painful.
</P>
<P>
   It came with a sick symmetry for John Smoltz, who started Game 7
of the 1991 World Series loss to the Twins. The sting of that loss
seemed innocent enough at the time but would become the Braves'
trademark in the four World Series losses to follow, two now to the
Yankees. The 1995 championship over the Cleveland Indians is the
only consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz pitched well Wednesday night, as Braves starters
seemingly always do in October, and lost, as Braves teams so often
do in October, without much semblance of an offense behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to put up one last offensive fight, the Braves instead
made a hero out of Roger Clemens, the only Yankee pitcher who'd
been vincible this postseason after a season of shortcomings. But
making his first World Series start since he played for the Red Sox
in the 1986 World Series, Clemens dominated the Braves lineup,
allowing only two balls out of the infield through the first seven
innings, on hits bKlesko and Keith Lockhart, and left to a
Yankee Stadium ovation after giving up his first back-to-back hits
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs and two strikes against him, Bret Boone chopped a
single between the middle infielders to score the Braves' first run
and cut the lead to 3-1. But the Yankees called on closer Mariano
Rivera, who hadn't allowed a run since July, to retire Chipper
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones worked the count to 2-2, and just missed a double down the
first base line before grounding out to Luis Sojo to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Braves got any more comeback ideas, they got a raw
reminder of where they were and who they were playing when Jim
Leyritz homered off Terry Mulholland with two outs in the bottom of
the eighth. Leyritz, whose Game 4 three-run homer sparked the
Braves World Series collapse against the Yankees in 1996, rekindled
a Yankees fan celebration that's been going on for the better part
of five days.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz's was a fitting story to end the Braves season, as he
embodies so much of what the 1999 Braves were about _ bruised but
rarely beaten. But he and the Braves learned Wednesday night that
the best they could come up with despite their steady stream of
injuries and setbacks this season wasn't near enough against the
best in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the Yankees the three-quarters arm angle he adopted to
pitch with a sore elbow, and the will that registered 95 mph on the
radar gun, Smoltz took his turn at the Yankee lineup, which had
rallied to win in the late innings of Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't bother waiting in this one, using a three-run third
inning to put the heat on the Braves and erase an otherwise
dominating effort from Smoltz, who had a World Series career-high
11 strikeouts in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz had allowed a pair of baserunners with nobody out in the
second inning and escaped by striking out the last three hitters,
all looking.
</P>
<P>
   But he was victimized by some more poor Braves defense an inning
later, as the Yankees used what were scored a couple of infield
hits on grounders off the gloves of Walt Weiss and Ryan Klesko to
mount a three-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch reached on an infield hit to Weiss, and Derek
Jeter lined a single to right and stole second. Smoltz walked
Bernie Williams to load the bases with one out and bring up Tino
Martinez. He grounded a ball toward first, where Klesko had planted
his glove in the dirt and watched the ball hop up and off his arm
into shallow right field, allowing both Knoblauch and Jeter to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Then with two outs and a 3-2 count on Jorge Posada, Smoltz
surrendered a line drive to right for an RBI single and the 3-0
deficit.

 NEW HARDWARE, SOFTWARE TURNS PCS INTO JUKEBOXES  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
M ike Tatum says he's a big music fan, not a computer geek.
<P>
   Yet with a little work and some relatively inexpensive software
and hardware, Tatum has turned his computer into a central
component of his home stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum, business development director for an Internet startup in
San Francisco, uses ``music jukebox software'' to play and organize
MP3 music files stored on his computer hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And he bought an $88 wireless transmitter to beam the music from
the computer to his stereo amplifier so he can listen to the songs
on his big speakers instead of his lower-quality PC speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum, 28, exemplifies a fast-growing trend of music fans who
have found that computers have more musical talents than just the
ability to play back CD recordings. The desktop PC in Tatum's San
Francisco apartment has become an all-in-one appliance that can
play, record, store and organize music from a variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late at night when I was doing e-mail or doing work and wanted
to listen to music, I used to have to get up and load a CD, when
all I wanted to do was listen to the MP3s I already had on my
computer,'' Tatum said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tatum plays his MP3s &LR;   &LR; with the same ``full stereo effect''
he has listening to CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the idea of using a personal computer as a stereo
component was popular only among a small but growing Internet
fringe _ techno-savvy high school and college students who were
copying and sharing digital MP3-formatted songs through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in digital music has been shooting to the top of
the charts. ``MP3'' has surpassed ``sex'' as the most-searched term
on the Web. Software-makers have responded with ``music jukebox''
programs, while computer-makers have embraced musical features as a
way to sell computers.
</P>
<P>
   Music-jukebox software evolved from shareware programs that
recorded, played and organized audio files into MP3 or other
digital formats. Jukebox software has become faster and easier to
use and incorporates other features, like support for several
audio-compression formats, links to Internet music databases and
the ability to tune in live Internet radio programming.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hewlett-Packard said it will sell a new line of home
PCs that come with MusicMatch Jukebox software and some free
MP3-formatted songs from Internet site eMusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of being able to try out music and download it is
obviously catching the consumer's eye, and we're just trying to
make it as easy as possible,'' said Tom Anderson, HP home products
marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people will pay for a computer (just because it)
has music capability built in, but I think it will be a
tiebreaker,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. also has started tuning into the computer
music market with an advertising campaign highlighting new PCs with
preinstalled MusicMatch software and big 37-gigabite hard drives,
which if used only for music would be large enough to store about
10,000 MP3-formatted songs.
</P>
<P>
   One Dell print ad depicts a distraught youth with a messy pile
of CDs at his feet and the tag line: ``I want a PC that will make
my stereo fear for its life.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer-makers hope that music fans will be lured by the
way jukebox software can personalize their music.
</P>
<P>
   Like the colorful, coin-operated 45-rpm and 78-rpm jukeboxes of
old, software jukeboxes can store a large library of music in MP3
or other audio formats. The computer jukebox organizes digital
music files copied from CDs or downloaded from the Internet by
title, artist, genre or other personal preference.
</P>
<P>
   Songs can be played in any order on the computer, burned into a
CD-ROM or transferred into a portable handheld device.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Lynn, a vocalist with a Southern California band called 40
Watt Domain, has culled about 500 favorite tunes from his
collection of 1,000 CDs and converted them into MP3 files stored in
his laptop. Instead of lugging the CDs everywhere, he just brings
the laptop or downloads some favorite tunes into a handheld MP3
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``My computer is functioning as an additional stereo system
right now,'' Lynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is considering buying an inexpensive computer to act as a
music server. ``Someday, the stereo components are going to have a
connection to a network so you can download and have the stuff go
right into the stereo.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Lynn admits, ``there are a lot of steps you got to go
through, but once you get it dialed in, it doesn't seem like it
takes a lot of time at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth the hassle, he said, ``to be able to take music where
you want to go.''

 RISE IN CHIP PRICES NOT EXPECTED TO HIT PCS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Will rising memory prices push up the cost of new PCs during the
holiday shopping season?
<P>
   Probably not, most industry watchers say, but discount offers
might be a little less tempting, and users who demand gobs of extra
RAM will pay a lot more than they would have last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that prices for computer memory, after falling
precipitously last year and through the first half of this year,
bounced back this summer and then spiked still further in the wake
of last month's earthquake in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, they have begun to settle, and barring
some new natural or man-made disaster, that trend should continue
for the rest of the year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Dell Computer, the No.1 PC manufacturer in the
U.S. market, warned that higher RAM prices would cut into its
profits for the current quarter. The manufacturer, based in Round
Rock, Texas, also said it would reduce the amount of memory in some
of its standard PC configurations.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement triggered fears that other PC-makers would
either follow suit or raise their prices to compensate for the
higher cost of maintaining their current memory configurations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, no other major PC-maker has followed Dell's
example, and most observers don't expect them to. Not only have
prices begun to recede from their September highs, but the supply
of RAM chips is expected to increase during the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at
Insight 64, a technology research firm in Saratoga, the phenomenon
that drove prices down so far prior to this summer's run-up _ an
excess of memory-manufacturing capacity, even in the face of strong
PC sales _ remains.
</P>
<P>
   The problem over the summer, he said, occurred because RAM
prices dropped so far in the first half of the year that memory
manufacturers had little incentive to deliver the product. Some of
them slowed down their production lines or shifted them to other
types of semiconductors that carry higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   When PC sales during the summer turned out to exceed
expectations, there was little inventory available to meet the
demand. That caused prices to rise, and that, in turn, persuaded
memory manufacturers to step up production.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry can't increase memory output overnight: It
takes two to three months, Brookwood said, from a ``wafer start'' _
the first step in the production process _ until chips are ready to
ship to customers. So over the summer, even as memory-makers were
stepping up production, the shortage increased.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's earthquake in Taiwan compounded the problem, even
though less than 15 percent of world memory production occurs
there. The semiconductor fabrication plants where memory is made
suffered no structural damage from the temblor, but power was out
for a week, and even after it was restored some machines required
recalibration and repair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, chips made from the extra silicon wafers first
started in the summer are beginning to reach the U.S. market.
That's why prices have settled back in the past few weeks. Because
output is expected to continue increasing this fall, further price
drops are likely, even though PC sales remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   PC vendors, who typically sign three-month contracts with their
RAM suppliers, still may face price increases when renewing these
arrangements, and that creates a continuing temptation either to
reduce the amount of RAM they install as standard equipment or to
raise the prices they charge for their systems.
</P>
<P>
   The latter strategy, however, will be difficult because the PC
market remains intensely competitive, and depending on their
contracts, some manufacturers already are seeing their costs settle
down.
</P>
<P>
   Decreasing standard RAM configurations _ the strategy Dell
adopted _ seems easier, but if it's carried too far, users might
rebel because cutting memory below today's prevailing standard, 64
megabytes, could have a noticeably negative effect on system
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Computers store program code and data they're currently using in
RAM, from which it can be read quickly. When there's no room in
RAM, such data has to be read from the computer's hard drive _ a
much slower process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the news of Dell's plans to cut standard RAM amounts
elicited a strong response from a little-known organization called
the Council on Computing Power, which this week distributed a press
release warning consumers of the dire effects of reduced RAM,
especially in memory-intensive applications such as digital photo
editing.
</P>
<P>
   The council also noted that Windows 2000, a new Microsoft
operating system for business computers that's now expected to
reach users in February, will require a minimum of 64 megabytes,
and most beta testers have said it really requires 128 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Computing Power, though it describes itself as
``a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping consumers get the
most out of their PCs,'` turns out to be a trade organization of
RAM manufacturers _ not exactly an unbiased source on this issue.
But the group bolsters its position _ explained at
www.rammatters.com and www.computingpower.org _ with test data from
Ziff-Davis' Testing and Analysis Group, and most computer experts
agree that the point is well taken.

 LEIGH STEINBERG SELLS SPORTS AGENCY  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Steve Young was traded to Canada on Wednesday.
<P>
   OK, not exactly. But Young's high-profile sports agent, Leigh
Steinberg, did sell his privately held agency to a Canadian
financial management firm called Assante Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. However, a source
close to the deal said Steinberg Moorad &AMP; Dunn fetched about $120
million and that Steinberg walked away with ``over half'' of that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg now will serve as chief executive of Assante Sports
Management Group, the company's newly created subsidiary for
athletes. It will be based in both Berkeley, Calif., and Newport
Beach, Calif., and it will absorb all of Steinberg's 30 employees
and existing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Assante, which went public in Canada earlier this year,
describes itself as a ``wealth and life management firm.'' What
that means, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Martin Weinberg, is that Assante aims to handle all financial, tax,
insurance and business matters for its clients _ for life.
</P>
<P>
   Its show-biz clients include actors Tom Cruise and Michael J.
Fox and talk-show host David Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Assante, which recently acquired two Los Angeles talent
agencies, wants to manage not just clients' money, but also their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to branch out into sports, Weinberg said Assante
looked at more than a dozen agencies before settling on Steinberg
Moorad &AMP; Dunn. He described the acquisition as ``the perfect
marriage'' of sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg agreed, saying he expects all sorts of new marketing
opportunities to emerge from the deal. ``This will allow our
athletes access to new avenues and careers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such opportunities may be coming none too soon for Young, who
has suffered no fewer than four concussions in the past three years
and may sit out the remainder of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg enjoys considerable stature among sports agents. Among
other claims to fame, he said the film ``Jerry Maguire'' was
``loosely based'' on his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Other Steinberg clients include Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman, New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe and Arizona
Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Assante has more than 2,500 employees in 150 offices across
North America. It administers $17 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the largest nonbank financial advisory firm in Canada,''
Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Assante reported quarterly revenue of $50 million, up
45 percent from a year earlier. But the company said recent
acquisitions had caused it to post a quarterly loss of $748,000,
compared with profit of $3.2 million a year before.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Steinberg said Assante will now seek as many as a dozen other
sports agencies for additional acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have the largest collection of sports talent in the
world,'' he declared.
