<HEADLINE> Report: Lott Doubts Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott says he's not  
sure he can trust President Clinton and expressed doubt the 
president wants to reconcile with congressional Republicans, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing news reports that Clinton vowed to punish House  
prosecutors by working against them in the upcoming elections, Lott 
said, ``That doesn't sound like reconciliation. That sounds like 
revenge and politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., who voted to remove Clinton from office, made his  
remarks to a small group of reporters shortly after Clinton was 
acquitted of perjury and obstruction charges by the Senate on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks were reported Saturday in The New York Times. Lott's  
spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the senator was not available 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, Lott had stinging criticism of Clinton  
and said he no longer was sure he could trust the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's a guy who had all these things in his background and he  
did it again, in the neighborhood of the Oval Office,'' Lott said, 
referring past allegations of infidelity and Clinton's sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he predicted further misconduct, Lott was quoted  
as saying, ``It's not a prediction. It's a fear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, he said, ``I fear that this sordid saga is not  
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp remarks raised questions about whether Republicans and  
Democrats can overcome the partisan bitterness produced by the 
impeachment, and whether Lott will be able to work with Clinton on 
a variety of issues over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he has not had much contact with the president,  
anyway. ``We legislate, he executes,'' Lott was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	As for cooperating with Democrats in Congress, Lott said: ``The  
Democrats' intent for the next two years will be basically to try 
to delay, draw out and stop all legislation, and then say, `See, 
Congress is not doing its job.'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he pities Senate Democrats. ``I'd hate to have to defend  
the conduct of this president before my constituents if I was a 
Democrat,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> General Motors May Buy BMW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- General Motors will make an offer to buy  
Bavarian car company BMW in the next few days, a German newspaper 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about BMW's future have been swirling since its chairman,  
Bernd Pischetsrieder, resigned last Friday amid criticism of his 
handling of BMW's British subsidiary, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW spokesman Joerg Dinner denied the report Saturday in Die  
Welt newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW wants to stay independent,'' Dinner said, adding the main  
shareholder Quandt family remained ``unbroken'' in its support of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors spokesman Dan Jankowski said, ``We wouldn't have  
any comment on the rumor of the takeover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors was one of the few companies that could afford  
BMW's price tag of $7 billion to $9 billion, Die Welt noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes one day after Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported  
Volkswagen wanted its subsidiary Audi and BMW to take a 24.9 
percent stake in each other. VW would take over the ailing Rover 
plant in Britain as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW denied that report, too, though earlier acknowledged VW has  
long been interested in acquiring at least a stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since buying it  
in 1994. Analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of about $590 
million for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Frisk Me Now Wins Gulfstream Sprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Frisk Me Now rebounded from two poor  
outings in distance races to hold off Young At Heart by a neck to 
win the $134,000 Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup Sprint Championship 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frisk Me Now, ridden by Eddie King Jr., ran the seven furlongs  
in 1:22 4-5 to return $26.20, $11.40 and $6.40. Young At Heart paid 
$8.40 and $5.60, while Good and Tough returned $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
	A 5-year-old son of Mister Frisky, Frisk Me Now stood fourth at  
the quarter pole before making a charge on the outside. He overtook 
Good and Tough inside the sixteenth pole and held off the late 
charge of Young At Heart on the far outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Good and Tough outran Thrillin Discovery for third. Cowboy Cop,  
the 6-5 favorite, faded to last in the six-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Carol Dender and trained by her husband, Bobby Durso,  
Frisk Me Now won for the 10th time in 31 starts and finished in the 
money for the 21st time. In his previous two races, he finished 
seventh in the Broward Handicap and ninth in the Donn Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Jorge Chavez fell just short of Gulfstream's one-day  
record for winning rides when he finished first on six of 10 
mounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Peruvian rider won on his first four mounts,  
captured his fifth in on Clarion Blast in the eighth race and 
capped the day by winning the 11th with Spirited Child. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez fell one shy of the Gulfstream record of seven winners in  
one day, set by Jerry Bailey in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Torture Turns Courts Into Tribunals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- His body remembers. Pain rakes his legs.  
It kicks at his skull. And every day it gnaws the soft flesh 
between his thighs where more than six years ago, he says, his 
tormentor pounded with fist, club and booted foot, telling Kemal 
Mehinovic: ``You won't be needing this anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic landed in Utah the summer of 1995, a man in need of a  
country. Besides his wife and teen-age son and daughter, he brought 
only a plastic bag containing his refugee papers and two 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Once co-owner of a family bakery, restaurant and cafe in a small  
city in Bosnia, he says, he lost it all in the Bosnian Serb 
takeover of 1992. According to documents he filed in federal court, 
he was arrested with other Muslims, sent to a concentration camp, 
separated from his family for more than two years, abused and 
starved. 
</P>
<P>
	The past came galloping back in January 1998. A Bosnian friend  
living in Georgia phoned around midnight. ``I have some news for 
you,'' the caller said. ``That guy who was beating you all the 
time. He's here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For several nights Mehinovic couldn't sleep. ``I couldn't  
believe it at first. ... How can somebody like that come to the 
United States?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic, a chain smoker with tired brown eyes and thick  
working man's fingers, speaks little English. Now, three years 
after arriving in America, he's taking action the American way: 
He's suing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic v. Vuckovic, filed last August in U.S. District Court  
in Atlanta, seeks unspecified damages for torture, genocide, 
assault and false arrest. The defendant is a Serbian-born Bosnian 
named Nikola Vuckovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuckovic has denied the claims in court documents and through  
his lawyer. ``Doesn't even know the guy,'' his attorney, Larry 
Pankey, said. Besides, Pankey said, he'll argue that Georgia's 
two-year statute of limitations on personal injury cases 
invalidates the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuckovic again denied the allegations in an interview published  
Saturday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic's lawsuit, since joined by three more plaintiffs and  
not yet set for trial, is among the latest in a small but growing 
body of cases in which people claiming to be victims of torture in 
other countries seek redress in American courts. 
</P>
<P>
	They are giving new life to the Alien Tort Claims Act, enacted  
by the first Congress in 1789. The law allows foreign residents to 
sue in U.S. courts those who break ``the law of nations or a treaty 
of the United States'' -- pirates, for instance. Two hundred years 
later, the same law is turning some U.S. courtrooms into human 
rights tribunals of a sort. 
</P>
<P>
	In court documents, Vuckovic acknowledges he was a soldier but  
denies the allegations of wrongdoing. ``Everybody who was 
able-bodied in that country was a soldier,'' Vuckovic's lawyer 
pointed out. ``So what? Did he have a choice in the matter? No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Were it not for the lawsuit, Nikola Vuckovic might be left alone  
digging his own toehold in Clarkston, Ga., a suburban enclave of 
new immigrants 12 miles outside Atlanta. A Christian, he has a 
Muslim wife and three children. They came to this country in 
October 1997, refugees like Mehinovic. He works at an air 
compressor plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Now much of his income pays a lawyer who charges $150 to $200 an  
hour. Trouble may loom on another front. His attorney said the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service in Atlanta has questioned 
him about the allegations against his client. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his accuser, Vuckovic is 42, short and stocky. In January  
he seemed eager to give an interview but yielded to his lawyer's 
order not to. Anything his client says could be used against him in 
court, Pankey said then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so sorry, lady,'' Vuckovic said, sitting in the family  
apartment. ``Maybe next time,'' he added with an engaging smile. 
</P>
<P>
	A Christmas wreath hung on the door. Shoes, left outside in  
keeping with Muslim custom, cluttered the landing. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined once again Saturday to speak with The Associated  
Press. But he told the Journal-Constitution he didn't know any of 
the four men suing him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the newspaper interview, Vuckovic said he spent only two days  
at the police station, the place Mehinovic's lawsuit claims the 
abuse occurred over a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	The first day Vuckovic said he received his uniform. On the  
second, he told the paper, he was sent to City Hall to work as a 
mechanic repairing city and army officials' cars. Vuckovic said he 
was not allowed to work as a soldier in the police station because 
his wife was a Muslim. Later he was sent to the front, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, more than 20 lawsuits citing the Alien Tort Claims  
Act have been filed in this country. The potential scope broadened 
with the 1991 Torture Victim Protection Act, which entitles U.S. 
citizens to bring these lawsuits as well, and spells out that 
torture and summary execution are personal injuries for which 
people can seek damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiff need not live in this country, though most do. And  
the defendant need only set foot on American soil long enough to be 
served a complaint. In some cases, the victim is dead and the 
lawsuit is filed by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	While juries and courts have awarded plaintiffs millions of  
dollars, little has been collected. Most of those sued have left 
this country, and it's too expensive to trace their assets abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	A sampler of cases that invoked the Alien Tort Claims Act:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Lawsuits pursued ex-dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family  
after they fled the Philippines for Hawaii in 1986. Marcos died 
three years later, but a federal jury in 1994 held his estate 
liable for $1.96 billion in damages for nearly 10,000 victims of 
torture, summary executions and disappearances during his regime. 
The disbursement of the money remains in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former Haitian dictator, was living  
in the country club development of Miami Lakes, Fla., when he was 
sued in 1991 by six Haitians who accused him of torture and other 
maltreatment. The plaintiffs won a $41 million default judgment in 
1994; Avril had returned to Haiti and refused to come back to Miami 
for a court-ordered deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Guatemala's former defense minister, Hector Gramajo, was sued  
by an American nun and eight Guatemalan Indians who accused him of 
murder, torture and forced exile. One summons was delivered to him 
the day of his 1991 graduation from Harvard's John F. Kennedy 
School of Government. Gramajo returned to Guatemala and was running 
for president in 1995 when a U.S. federal judge ruled him liable by 
default for $47.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramajo said at the time he had no money to fight the lawsuit  
and denied involvement or knowledge of the crimes attributed to 
him. ``I am a general out of the ordinary who fought for 
democracy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other defendants have included a former Indonesian general and,  
in a case still pending, former Bosnian-Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic. Also pending are various lawsuits naming multinational 
corporations as defendants. One is accused of misusing workers in a 
Burma pipeline project, another of profiting from slave labor in 
Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The Alien Tort Claims Act was invoked again last month in a  
federal lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on behalf of more than 50,000 
workers recruited from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and 
Thailand. The defendants are more than two dozen corporations -- 
including a slew of popular U.S. clothing retailers -- accused of 
abusive garment factory practices on the Pacific island of Saipan, 
a tiny U.S. commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Spain's current effort to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet,  
charging the former Chilean dictator ordered murder, kidnapping and 
torture during his 1973-90 rule, the lawsuits reflect a movement 
since World War II that aims to hold wrongdoers to account for 
human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got all of these treaties and conventions and  
speeches,'' said Peter Weiss, a corporate lawyer in New York. ``The 
top guys, the real criminals, always seem to get away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss unearthed the Alien Tort Claims Act during the Vietnam  
War, seeking a way to sue U.S. military officials on behalf of 
victims of the 1968 My Lai massacre. The lawsuit was never filed, 
but a decade later he found a way to use the old law. 
</P>
<P>
	The American system of justice is unique, said Weiss, who takes  
cases pro bono for the Center for Constitutional Rights. ``There's 
no other country where the Filartiga principle applies quite the 
way it does here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Filartiga principle takes its name from a Paraguayan family  
that sought the center's help in 1979 following the torture and 
death of 17-year-old Joelito Filartiga. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, his sister, Dolly, and father, Joel, won a $10.4  
million judgment against Americo Pena Irala, a former Paraguayan 
police official. 
</P>
<P>
	The family says Joelito was targeted in 1976 because his father  
actively opposed then-dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years after that death, Pena Irala was in New York and  
about to be deported for overstaying his tourist visa. Before he 
left, the Filartigas sued him in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, 
N.Y., invoking the Alien Tort Claims Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Pena Irala paid not a penny, but Ms. Filartiga, 43, feels hers  
is more than a paper victory. ``We made a big step, for it won't be 
that easy for people that torture.'' As for her brother, ``He 
didn't die in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God bless America,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. immigration laws and screening processes don't always spot  
people with trouble in their past. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ethiopian immigrant named Kelbessa Negewo was a bellhop at an  
Atlanta hotel in 1989 when he was recognized by a waitress working 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	That encounter led in 1993 to a U.S. district judge's order that  
Negewo pay $1.5 million to the waitress and two other women who 
testified that he tortured them during Ethiopia's ``Red Terror'' 
campaign of 1977-78. 
</P>
<P>
	The women said they were stripped, hung upside down from a pole  
and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Negewo represented himself at the trial because the court said  
there were no ``exceptional'' grounds to appoint a lawyer for him. 
He denied the charges and claimed he didn't know the women, while 
accusing them of belonging to a violent political group. Negewo 
came to this country under political asylum and pointed out that he 
himself had been imprisoned after falling out with the regime. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeals court upheld the judgment against him. The U.S.  
Supreme Court declined to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, he received U.S. citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
	The women, represented by a law firm that took their case pro  
bono, got his wages and bank account garnisheed. He promptly filed 
for bankruptcy and got the money back. The two sides are now 
embroiled in court over whether Negewo can use bankruptcy to avoid 
paying the damage award. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, back in Ethiopia, Negewo is on trial in  
absentia with others accused of murder and torture that took place 
20 years ago. Now in his late 40s, Negewo still lives in Atlanta, 
works at a hotel and lives with his wife in a two-bedroom 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	An interview arranged by Negewo's lawyer fell through when  
Negewo said he had to leave for work. John Matteson, a critic of 
the Alien Tort Claims Act who became Negewo's lawyer after the 
trial, said: ``They've got a lot of unsubstantiated allegations 
from pitiful people with pitiful stories. But my client didn't have 
anything to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The INS has begun reviewing Negewo's case for possible  
denaturalization, an official in Atlanta said. 
</P>
<P>
	But while civil lawsuits need only show allegations are more  
than likely true, revoking citizenship or permanent residency 
requires clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence, said John 
Miles, associate general counsel for INS in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	This rarely happens; only about 20 naturalizations are revoked  
each year, Miles said. Another 5,000 individuals lose their 
permanent residency and are deported. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemal Mehinovic's lawsuit says his troubles began in May 1992  
when he was roused from a nap by Bosnian-Serb militiamen, beaten 
and taken to the police station in his hometown of Bosanski Samac. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, the documents say, a familiar face appeared among the  
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikola Vuckovic was a friend, Mehinovic said in an interview.  
Vuckovic's brother-in-law had worked in Mehinovic's bakery. When 
the brother-in-law fell ill with cancer, Mehinovic helped out and 
later collected money for the funeral. Vuckovic often came to 
Mehinovic's place for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	But over his six months in custody at the police station,  
Mehinovic's lawsuit says, Vuckovic ``repeatedly tortured and beat'' 
him. It says Vuckovic struck him ``with metal pipes, baseball bats, 
chair legs, wooden batons, his fists and heavy boots, and at one 
point forced his legs apart and beat his genitals, stating `You 
won't be needing this anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	His lawsuit against Vuckovic is the first for the San  
Francisco-based Center for Justice &AMP; Accountability, a nonprofit 
law firm started by Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic's lawyer, Shawn Roberts, said he has witnesses: the  
three men who joined his lawsuit, and several who can testify to 
Mehinovic's further accusations in the lawsuit that Vuckovic had a 
role in persecuting Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic's lawsuit says he was moved to a concentration camp  
and later tried and convicted in a Bosnian-Serb military court on 
vague charges of killing Bosnian-Serb children. Though sentenced to 
die, he was let go in a prisoner exchange, the lawsuit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, a place he had never heard of, was picked by the refugee  
aid agency because the climate was like his home region. He found 
work managing rental apartments and houses. With help from his 
boss, he says, he now owns his modest blue frame home and rental 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehinovic said he doesn't expect to see any money if he wins his  
lawsuit. Whatever the outcome, he said, he is happy that his story 
is on record.

<HEADLINE> Shaq's Status Remains Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal,  
the NBA's leading scorer, sat out Saturday's practice because of a 
strained right groin muscle, but might be able to play Sunday 
against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure, I'll wait until tomorrow and see how I feel,''  
O'Neal said after working out at Los Angeles Southwest College 
under the supervision of his stomach-muscle specialist, Alex 
McKechnie, who arrived in Los Angeles from Vancouver on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, who also shot a few baskets on the side, suffered his  
latest injury Wednesday night in a 103-98 victory at Denver, and 
sat out an 86-75 loss at Minnesota the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a game-time decision whether he plays (against  
Indiana) or not,'' Lakers spokesman John Black said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, averaging 30.5 points and 12.3 rebounds while playing in  
four of his team's five games, missed 21 games last season because 
of an injury to his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
	If O'Neal can't play, Elden Campbell will start in his place  
against the Pacers in a battle of teams considered among the NBA's 
best. Both have 3-2 records.

<HEADLINE> States Back Regional Primary Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State election officials have approved a new  
calendar for presidential primaries beginning in 2004 that would 
give different blocs of states an earlier say in the nominating 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's secretaries of state face a formidable task in  
getting approval of 48 states and both major political parties. 
Many states have pushed their primaries earlier for 2000 so they 
will have a bigger say in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan approved Friday, Iowa and New Hampshire would  
retain their leading positions in the presidential selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the country would be divided into four regions:  
East, South, Midwest and West. Many of the states in the regional 
groupings already have started to hold primaries on the same dates. 
</P>
<P>
	Primaries in each state of a given region would be held on or  
soon after the first Tuesday of March, April, May and June of 
presidential election years. Not all states in a region would have 
to hold their contest on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	After the voting, the region that goes first would go last the  
next election cycle, and the second region would move up. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the current system has become almost unworkable  
and has jammed too many primaries into the opening few weeks in 
late February and early March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we sit here today, the presidential primary selection  
process will probably be all but completed about 13 months from 
now,'' said William F. Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth of 
Massachusetts. ``This will come at a time when most people in this 
country have not thought about the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galvin said the quick primary schedule hurts lesser-known  
candidates, forces candidates to declare their intentions too early 
and hurts voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was adopted by the National Association of Secretaries  
of State with a handful of dissenting votes.

<HEADLINE> Deborah Harry Would Choose Sex Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Deborah Harry says if she were starting out  
today, she'd forgo music for something a little more provocative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that probably now I would go into the sex industry,''  
Harry says in the March edition of Esquire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always interested in the clandestine. That's what  
attracted me to the music world. And I don't know where you can 
find that so much these days,'' says the 53-year-old entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she doesn't know exactly what aspect of the sex  
business would interest her. Before her break in music, she worked 
as a Playboy Bunny waitress. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry, who had hits as the lead singer of Blondie with songs  
including ``Heart of Glass'' and ``Call Me,'' is currently on tour 
in a Blondie reunion after a 16-year hiatus.

<HEADLINE> Americans Moving Past Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POWDER SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Americans were still talking about  
President Clinton's impeachment Saturday -- some relieved and others 
irritated at the result, but nearly everyone eager to move on to 
another topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people got tired of it weeks ago,'' said Ada  
Askea, finishing her breakfast of grits and coffee in a Huddle 
House restaurant at daybreak after she and her husband finished 
their deliveries of the Marietta Daily Journal in this suburban 
city 25 miles west of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	From the youth baseball park here to a subway tavern to  
Manhattan, to a coastal diner in Oregon, and among people 
exercising around Pasadena's Rose Bowl, there was an 
often-expressed reaction that as historic as Friday's Senate vote 
may have been, for many people it was an anti-climactic end to a 
soap opera they had begun tuning out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just been catching the highlights. I didn't think he was  
ever in any jeopardy of being convicted,'' said Chan Whitlow, who 
was helping organize Saturday's tryouts for the spring season of 
the Powder Springs Youth Baseball league. ``I think he made a bad 
decision; we all make bad decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nancy Ferrell, feeding cereal to 22-month-old daughter  
Morgan while watching 7-year-old son Brad field ground balls on 
blustery cold morning, shook her head at ``the whole escapade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even stand to look at him (Clinton). That smirk of his  
just turns me off,'' she said. ``I don't know how he ever got into 
office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Fowler, a baseball coach, complained that senators  
``followed the polls too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He should have been convicted,'' agreed Bryan Foster, another  
coach bundled up to sit through a day of tryouts. ``Slick Willie's 
going to slide through again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This city is represented by Republican Rep. Bob Barr, an early,  
outspoken advocate of Clinton's impeachment. However, even though 
Don and Ada Askea were against Clinton's removal, they felt Barr 
was only trying to do his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will hurt him here politically,'' Don Askea  
said of the congressman, who spoke Saturday at a GOP fund-raising 
luncheon near his Smyrna hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rep. James Rogan's district in Pasadena, Calif., it seemed  
everyone had an opinion amid the morning sunlight streaming over 
the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bringing up of all this is good for the overall moral  
thinking of people,'' said Daniel Dunkelberger, a Republican 
retiree in Rogan's Pasadena-area district. ``It's kind of a payback 
time for the loose morality'' of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Gillette, a 49-year-old Pasadena engineer, was pleased with  
the acquittal and disgusted by lawmakers whose attempts to impeach 
Clinton were ``self-serving.'' Pausing from his morning walk, he 
said they were motivated by ``selfishness and greed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his congressman -- who served as one of the House  
managers of Clinton's prosecution -- doesn't represent his point of 
view in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I've always had in my mind is have you ever known  
anyone to tell the truth about sex?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a midtown Manhattan tavern located in the subway and called  
Siberia, people analyzed the verdict as they sipped their drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people have shown, once again, that they only  
care about what the president does in front of closed doors, not 
behind them,'' said Jim McKeon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obvious from the beginning that they would never throw  
this guy out of office,'' added Brian Duff. ``Come on. It was 
nothing more than a circus from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	W.F. Bryant, 80, sat Saturday morning in a diner in the Oregon  
town of North Bend. A lifelong Democrat, he offered opinions as 
strong as the cup of coffee he nursed in hands gnarled from working 
at the local sawmill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't surprised he got off,'' he said, the banner headline  
of his newspaper reading: ``ACQUITTED.'' ``He just had enough guts 
to fight it out. He's smarter than they are. And his wife's smarter 
than he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant added that he believes Clinton has done a good job as  
president, ``as good a president as we've had up there in a long 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the Huddle House restaurant, the Askeas said they  
believe Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky 
was a private matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it concerned us,'' Mrs. Askea said. ``That's  
between him and Hillary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't do anything any different than Kennedy,'' her  
husband added, prompting mechanic Lloyd Miller to offer from the 
next booth: ``Or Nixon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Askea said, smiling. ``Nixon was doing it to the  
country.'' 
</P>
<P>

Foster in North Bend, Ore., and Michelle DeArmond in Pasadena.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Rule on Pilots' Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Swarms of anxious holiday travelers were left  
stranded when American Airlines again scrubbed more than a thousand 
flights after its pilots defied a court order and continued their 
mass sickout. 
</P>
<P>
	About one in four American pilots called in sick Friday at the  
nation's second-largest airline, which in turn canceled several 
hundred more flights planned for the long Presidents Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``A federal judge ordered them back to work,'' said Edwin Amaya  
after learning his flight from Boston to Miami had been canceled. 
``Why aren't they here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall -- the author of that order --  
asked the same question of the Allied Pilots Association during a 
contempt hearing in Dallas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	American had asked Kendall to impose a ``coercive fine'' against  
the union for failing to comply with the order he issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union leaders have thumbed their noses at management and  
the public,'' argued company lawyer Dee Kelly. ``The airline has 
suffered enough and it is time that the pilots suffer along with 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall adjourned the hearing late in the afternoon and  
suggested union officials spend ``a productive evening'' on the 
telephone telling pilots to get back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to do anything right now,'' he said. ``I'm going  
to recess so as not to shoot from the hip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ruling was expected today.  
</P>
<P>
	American canceled 1,102 flights Friday -- nearly half of its  
daily total -- a day after it canceled 1,170. The carrier also 
scrapped 845 flights for today and 209 for Sunday, with additional 
cancellations possible. The airline estimated Friday that 450,000 
passengers have been affected since the job action began Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently in response to the judge's comments, union President  
Rich LaVoy changed his hot line message late Friday to exhort 
pilots to return to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make a personal plea to all of our pilots: The  
association's leadership needs your help in complying with Judge 
Joe Kendall's order. We need to get this airline back up and 
running at full capacity, and we need to do so quickly,'' LaVoy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please clear the sick list immediately and resume your normal  
schedule. Again, APA (the pilots union) is absolutely serious about 
doing all we can to comply with the judge's order, and APA's entire 
leadership is asking for your help in doing so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were signs pilots may be taking heed. According to an  
updated message today on American's hot line, about 2,100 of the 
airline's 9,400 pilots were on the sick list today, down from 2,443 
Friday. Although they are barred by federal law from striking over 
the issue, federal regulations require pilots to call in sick if 
they are experiencing emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Damain Fecell was one of thousands of passengers stranded Friday  
at Miami International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole catastrophe has cost the company a client and cost  
me an extra paycheck,'' he said. ``American Airlines, in these type 
of situations, should have a backup plan because it is not our 
fault that they are at a dispute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute centers on how quickly American should integrate the  
pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into its own roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots in both groups stand to make more money once they all  
fall under American's existing contract. Many American pilots would 
advance up the seniority chart, while Reno pilots would get pay 
raises compared to their old carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	But AMR Corp., the airline's parent company, says the process of  
integrating the companies and pilots will take a year to 18 months. 
That, according to the pilots, is too long. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and the pilots union both said American could return  
to normal operations in three days if the mass sick calls end. 
However, no negotiations over the dispute were held Friday and none 
were set for today. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Kendall asked LaVoy how strongly pilots were  
urged to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our honest intent was to immediately get a message out,''  
LaVoy said. ``Our pilots are intelligent people; I think they 
understand that a judge is a powerful man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The return-to-work order was issued to the union -- not to  
individual pilots -- and the union argued it shouldn't be found in 
contempt if it dutifully communicated the contents of the order to 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Kendall asked union leaders about the  
organization's net worth, a sign he may have been considering the 
``coercive'' fine requested by American. 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy sought to assure Kendall that the union would do  
everything possible to get its members back on the job: ``if I have 
to drive around with a loudspeaker on top of my car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't rocket science,'' the judge said. ``Go back to  
work.''

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Murder Case Ends in Mistrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A mistrial was declared Saturday in the  
quadruple murder trial of a man who says he has multiple 
personalities, after a jury said it was unable to decide whether 
Thomas ``Zoo Man'' Huskey was insane. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member panel, brought 200 miles from Nashville because of  
intense local publicity, told Judge Richard Baumgartner they were 
deadlocked 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was on the (mental) responsibility part,'' one juror  
said. ``Not the guilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense claimed Huskey, a former zoo elephant trainer, was  
possessed of multiple personalities he can't control or remember, 
including an evil alter ego named ``Kyle'' who confessed to the 
1992 killings of four women. 
</P>
<P>
	Huskey, 38, is nicknamed ``zoo man'' for taking prostitutes to  
the Knoxville Zoo for abusive sex. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury's non-decision brought relief to Huskey's family and  
frustration to victims' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather have this than have my father put to death,''  
said Isaac Huskey, one of the defendant's two teen-age sons. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Lerner of Dearborn, Mich., the sister of victim Susan  
Stone, said she thought the evidence was overwhelming against 
Huskey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely disappointed,'' she said. ``It has been seven  
long years and we would like some closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution will push for a new trial. He already had been  
sentenced to 66 years in prison for raping four women.

<HEADLINE> World Relieved by Clinton Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- People around the world were relieved that the  
impeachment trial of President Clinton was finally over and 
expressed hope that Washington would now move on to more important 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time the Americans ended such a silly debate,''  
48-year-old South Korean housewife Choi Yang-ok said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In many nations, Clinton's acquittal Friday on charges of  
perjury and obstruction of justice in the Senate was the top news 
story. And the responses tended to be congratulatory -- with some 
showing amazement over how long the sex scandal lasted. 
</P>
<P>
	South African President Nelson Mandela sent a message of  
congratulations to both the Senate and the White House and said he 
hoped that the U.S. government could now focus on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Ehud Barak, the head of the opposition Labor Party,  
also congratulated Clinton. In a letter, Barak said he was 
satisfied with the decision because it would now let Clinton get 
back to aiding Middle East peace, Israel radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing similar sentiments, Australian Deputy Prime Minister and  
Trade Minister Tim Fischer said they hoped that the United States 
could now focus on trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
	But editorials in British newspapers suggested that while  
Clinton may have escaped impeachment, his reputation around the 
world is severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``His luck has been amazing, but it has cost his authority  
dear,'' said an editorial in The Daily Telegraph, a conservative 
broadsheet. ``In his future dealings with the Middle East or China 
or North Korea, it will be difficult not to regard him as the 
lamest of ducks. That is a loss not only to Americans, but also to 
their friends around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times, another London-based broadsheet newspaper, reported  
on its front page, ``Clinton: the great escape.'' But it also ran 
an editorial urging Clinton to ``salvage his reputation'' and 
restore dignity to his office. British tabloids largely ignored the 
story, relegating it to inside pages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mexico, where Clinton is scheduled to meet President Ernesto  
Zedillo on Sunday and Monday, political analyst Sergio Sarmiento 
said Mexicans generally saw the whole impeachment as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incomprehensible for the majority of Mexicans,'' he said,  
``that an intimate relationship ... would be converted into a 
political persecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An editorial in the English-language Hong Kong Standard  
suggested the world may not have seen the end of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the twists and turns this saga has taken, at times  
looking more like a soap opera ... it is still too early to write 
finis,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dubai, the acquittal was big news. But an editorial in The  
Khaleej Times, an English-language daily, declared the vote an 
anticlimax. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thailand, where politicians openly have mistresses, many saw  
Clinton's affair as a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to what he has accomplished for the country, the  
scandal was nothing,'' said Tik Chang in Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> NY Verdict May Fuel Anti-Gun Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Brooklyn jury's unprecedented verdict finding  
gun makers liable for shootings could give a boost to other cities 
around the nation that are suing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities ``are going to have it a whole lot easier now,''  
said David Yassky, a Brooklyn Law School professor who closely 
followed the trial. ``They have a very solid precedent that what 
the gun industry does is negligent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago, New Orleans, Bridgeport, Conn., and Miami-Dade County  
are suing the industry to recoup the costs of fighting gun 
violence. Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore are among those 
considering the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said the Brooklyn verdict  
demonstrated that ``people are demanding that the gun industry be 
held accountable.'' And Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas hailed 
it as ``a major, major, major victory that will have major 
ramifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others argued that Thursday's verdict proved an awkward  
outcome to an awkward case, making its impact uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Kopel of the Independence Institute, a conservative think  
tank in Golden, Colo., said the jury had been asked to fix a social 
problem by blaming gun makers for illegal use of legal products -- 
despite little or no evidence that those manufacturers' brands were 
involved in any of the shootings at issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This a compromise verdict that makes no sense at all,'' said  
Kopel, who is also an adjunct law professor at New York University 
Law School. ``The jury didn't know the first thing about what was 
going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came after a monthlong trial in federal court.  
Despite sending Judge Jack Weinstein numerous notes saying they 
were deadlocked, the 11 jurors finally found 15 of 25 defendants 
negligent in how they sell handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury also said only nine companies were liable in the  
shootings. Of those, only three companies -- American Arms, Beretta 
USA and Taurus International Manufacturing -- were ordered to pay a 
total of $500,000 to one of the seven plaintiffs. The plaintiffs 
had been seeking $500,000 to $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
	In a post-verdict meeting between jurors and attorneys, the  
jurors reportedly said they rejected the plaintiffs' central claim 
that gun makers negligently oversupply states that have lax gun 
laws, knowing the excess feeds a black market in strict gun law 
states like New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they focused on whether the defendants had provisions  
in their contracts with distributors that sought to keep guns out 
of criminals' hands, such as banning the sale of their products at 
gun shows. Those that didn't were found negligent. 
</P>
<P>
	The ambiguous outcome didn't prevent trial attorneys on both  
sides from claiming victory. And the defense team said it is 
confident the portion of the verdict that went against gun makers 
will be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case still has caused concern among manufacturers who fear  
it will embolden the suing cities. Richard Feldman, head of the 
Atlanta-based American Shooting Sports Council, said he received 
several calls from industry insiders Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them don't panic,'' Feldman said. ``Juries make  
mistakes. That's what appeals courts are for. But I do worry about 
public perception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman predicted the verdict will intensify the efforts of  
pro-gun groups that are lobbying state legislatures to pass laws 
prohibiting liability suits like the one filed in Brooklyn.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wins Piracy Case in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A Beijing court has ordered two Chinese firms to  
pay $100,000 in compensation to Microsoft for using its software 
without authorization, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the relatively small damages ordered by the Beijing No.  
1 Intermediate Court, the ruling may set a precedent for other 
software piracy cases in China, where most computers operate on 
pirated software. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing Haisida Science and Technology Development Co. and  
Min'an Investment Consulting Co. were found guilty of copyright 
infringement, Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies failed to meet a deadline to file an appeal, it  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials were not available for comment late Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the case was Microsoft's first piracy case in China,  
the software giant has teamed up with Chinese authorities in trying 
to catch computer retailers using pirated software in their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States went to the brink of a trade war  
before reaching agreements in 1995 and 1996 to stamp out piracy. 
The U.S. government has since lauded China's efforts to close down 
factories producing pirated software, films, compact discs and 
computer discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Software Alliance, a group that combats piracy,  
estimates that unlicensed software costs makers $1.5 billion in 
China each year.

<HEADLINE> Slalom Is Game of Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Welcome to the sadistic world of slalom.  
</P>
<P>
	After watching the women's World Alpine Ski Championships on  
Saturday, I realized again how brutal is the life of a slalom 
racer. Look no further than two of the favorites, Zali Steggall, 
the gold medalist, and Kristina Koznick, the American medal hope 
who lasted only 15 seconds before exiting the course. 
</P>
<P>
	The downhill, with its thrills and spills, may be more  
life-threatening, but slalom is the toughest race to finish. Most 
downhillers complete their runs; half the slalom racers don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Slalom's quick, icy turns wipe out racers in a hurry. Now that I  
am retired, I look at a slalom course with 55 gates as having 55 
chances to make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Slalom is a crap shoot. The one with the most confidence will  
win. And a little luck never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does that confidence come from? For slalom specialists  
like Koznick and Steggall, who have been waiting for a month since 
their last race, that is the defining question. 
</P>
<P>
	For the two weeks these championships have been going on and  
while other women have had the chance to compete, slalom racers 
have waited and watched. Multi-event skiers have had the chance to 
build momentum. Pernilla Wiberg, after a strong showing in the 
combined, added to that momentum in the giant slalom with one of 
her best results this decade (fourth) and rolled to a silver medal 
in the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	You could see the snowball getting bigger all week. Enter  
Andrine Flemmen, silver medalist in Thursday's GS, and boom, she 
clocks her best result ever (fourth) in slalom on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The task of trying to stop these racers from continuing their  
streaks falls on the slalom specialists. Where other racers are 
already in the groove and have nothing to lose in the last event, 
for the slalom specialists those are the only two runs they get. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a specialist, you've got to have nerves,'' American  
women's coach Georg Capaul says. ``Some people can deal with it, 
some people can't. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to put it on the line. When you have other chances  
all week long, it's easier to do. When you've had a busy week, 
failing doesn't even enter your mind, but when you just ski that 
one event, you think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all her weeks of waiting, Koznick had only 15 seconds of  
action to show for it. A fluke catch of her outside edge and she 
was out. Where can she go to find refuge after a day like that? She 
has no other events to turn to, nothing to take her mind off of one 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be in the top in just one event. It's way too much  
pressure,'' Koznick says. ``By 2002, I will try to ski the 
combined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without another event to think about, it becomes a mental game.  
Koznick will be hard-pressed not to dwell on the mistake that ended 
her medal hopes. With only slalom to compete in, Koznick is looking 
at 11 races a season. That's not many chances to work magic. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what was so impressive about Steggall's performance. A  
specialist herself, she is able to handle the pressure so well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of a Catch-22 when you've only got one event.''  
Steggall said. ``You only have two runs and that's it, but at the 
same time, it allows me to come really well prepared. The morning 
of the race I can say there's nothing I could have done to prepare 
better for this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steggall seems to delight in slalom's game of torture. She skis  
so confidently that one can't help but feel her mind was made for 
it. For Koznick and the rest of the mortals out there, here's an 
idea from an ex-slalom racer: Live a healthier life, do some other 
events and give yourself a break. 
</P>
<P>
	I hope, for everyone's sanity, that Capaul was right when he  
said, ``I think the time of the specialists may be nearing an 
end.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Matches 50-Meter Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maurice Greene, who has quietly emerged as  
the fastest sprinter in the world, shot out of the blocks and 
sailed down the boards to a world indoor record-equalling 50-meter 
time Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, who already owned the indoor mark for 60 meters, matched  
the 50 standard of 5.56 seconds set by Canada's Donovan Bailey on 
Feb. 9, 1996 in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Greene got a great jump and seemed to have a  
half-step on the field just out of the blocks of the featured 
50-meter dash at the Los Angeles Indoor Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene steadily widened his lead for the victory, and his  
training partner, Jon Drummond, finished second in 5.63. Former 
Kentucky NCAA champion Tim Harden was third in 5.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100 meters, Greene won the  
event at the 1997 World Championships and has a career best of 9.86 
seconds. He set the world indoor 60-meter mark of 6.39 last year in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene is determined to hang onto the top world ranking through  
the 2000 Olympics, and he has run extremely well so far in the 1999 
indoor season. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend before he logged his record-tying time at the Los  
Angeles Sports Arena, he ran the fastest 60 meters ever in the 
United States, a 6.45 clocking in Boston on Sunday. Two days 
earlier, he won with a 6.51 in the Millrose Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greene won his race as expected in the LA Invitational,  
Mark Crear, ranked No. 1 internationally in the high hurdles last 
year, finished second in the 50-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Wisconsin Badgers' wide receiver Reggie Torian, a rising  
star in the hurdles, was clocked in 6.43, just .02 seconds in front 
of Crear. Former Texas A&AMP;M standout Larry Wade was third in 6.51. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' top female hurdler in 1998, Melissa Morrison,  
set a meet record in the 50 hurdles at 6.81. Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
held the old record with a 6.82 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Anjanette Kirkland finished second to Morrison in 6.87, and  
Tiffany Lott was third in 6.89. 
</P>
<P>
	In a two-runner final, 1996 Olympian Inger Miller edged Chryste  
Gaines, formerly of Stanford, by .01 seconds in the 50 meters, 
winning in 6.15.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A Brazilian judge has ruled that a  
real estate magnate must compensate six people who lost their 
apartments in a building collapse nearly a year ago that killed 
eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Celia Maria Vidal on Friday ordered developer Sergio Naya  
to pay $316,000 to former residents of the 22-story Palace II 
apartments in Rio's fashionable Barra da Tijuca neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Naya had been accused of using poor-quality materials, including  
concrete laced with seashells. 
</P>
<P>
	The collapse sparked a debate in Brazil about unsafe building  
practices, abuse of power and immunity for politicians. At the 
time, Naya was a federal congressman. Since then, he has been 
expelled from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Eduardo Lutz, attorney for the Association of the  
Palace Victims, Naya eventually will have to pay as much as $165 
million to satisfy the claims of the building's 130 families. 
</P>

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP)-- Police arrested a man who confessed  
to killing a Brazilian congresswoman last December, local media 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police detained Mendonca Medeiros da Silva in the town of  
Conceicao do Araguaia in the Amazon basin state of Para, 1,900 
miles north of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceci Cunha, a two-term congresswoman, her husband and two other  
relatives, were shot dead by gunmen in Maceio, the capital of the 
northeastern state of Alagoas. 
</P>
<P>
	According to CBN radio, da Silva confessed to shooting Cunha,  
and led police to the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the killers may have a connection to Talvane  
Albuquerque, an alternate congressman who by law took Cunha's 
legislative seat after her death. Two of his closest aides have 
been charged with the killings and jailed.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's largest state-run university has  
cautiously proposed its first tuition hike since 1948 -- a plan that 
would raise the current annual tuition of 3 cents to $136. 
</P>
<P>
	Student representatives at the National Autonomous University of  
Mexico immediately protested the proposal Friday, despite the fact 
that the plan would allows students to pay the old rate simply by 
signing a declaration saying they can't afford the higher charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at the cash-strapped university, which has about  
250,000 students at its Mexico City campus, staged rowdy protests 
and shut down the university for a month in 1986 when similar 
tuition increases were proposed. Those proposals were later 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper Reforma estimated Saturday that, even with the  
tuition increase, fees at the college would be much lower than the 
cost of attending one of the city's more prestigious private 
universities, where tuition runs at about $7,200 per year. 
</P>

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Police arrested several young suspects in a  
botched kidnapping, local media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests were made Friday after the group's captive,  
Alejandro Lopez Soto, untied himself, broke open a window in the 
Mexico City house where he had been held since Jan. 29, and leapt 
to the street from a second-story window. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappers apparently were not guarding him. They had  
demanded $500,000 for his release. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez Soto, the son of a local car-wash owner, was quoted by the  
newspaper La Jornada as saying that he was ``sure they were going 
to kill me'' after receiving the ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Four men and a woman -- ages 16, 17, 23, 23 and 24 -- were  
arrested on the scene. A 16-year-old girl and a 41-year-old man 
were arrested later.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Beat Hunter in Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Detroit made it 5-0 for baseball owners in  
salary arbitration this year, beating outfielder Brian Hunter on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was awarded the Tigers' figure of $1.75 million by  
arbitrator Jerome Ross, who heard the case Friday, rather than his 
$2.75 million request. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter made $562,500 in 1998, hitting .254 with four homers, 36  
RBIs and 42 stolen bases in 54 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners have won all four of the decisions issued thus far. Nine  
players remain in arbitration, with their hearing scheduled for 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal infielder Shane Andrews, Boston outfielder Midre  
Cummings, Kansas City outfielder Johnny Damon and Los Angeles 
infielder Mark Grudzielanek also lost their cases.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Fed Chief Predicts Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  
St. Louis said Friday that indicators signal continued economic 
growth for the next six to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	William Poole, speaking before the Academy of Economics and  
Finance in Little Rock, said a 2.5 percent growth rate is forecast 
for the rest of the year, with interest rates remaining low. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may depart from that,'' Poole said. ``But it will depart  
from that for reasons that are unforeseeable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poole also said he doubted the Year 2000 computer bug will cause  
turmoil among U.S. banks. He noted an earlier decision of the Fed, 
however, to set aside $50 billion in case banks experience a surge 
in demand for currency before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm guessing that it's going to be a major nonevent,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Republicans Focus on 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, fresh from voting for the  
Republicans' failed effort to convict President Clinton on 
impeachment articles, told a gathering of party moderates Saturday 
that the GOP must move on to important issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Republicans have a great deal of work to do to remind  
voters that we are not simply the anti-Clinton party,'' said the 
Arizona Republican, who is considering a presidential run in 2000. 
``I believe the American people understand very well what we stood 
against. We now need to remind them what we stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was the keynote speaker Saturday night at the Republican  
Leadership Council's winter meeting. The group is an organization 
of moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a war hero, said the impeachment proceedings were  
difficult but brought senators closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged that while ``I have done things in my  
private life that I am not proud of ... I have at all times and to 
the best of my ability kept ... every oath I have ever sworn to 
this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he had words of caution for Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	``I do not hold the president to the same standard that I hold  
military officers to; I hold him to a higher standard,'' McCain 
said in explaining his vote to convict Clinton on the two charges 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain added he hoped newspaper reports that the president was  
now ``on a vendetta with an enemy's list to get people in the 
upcoming election'' were wrong. He said if it were true, it was 
going to make it very hard to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	Others echoed the theme, and called for the party to forget  
about Clinton and start concentrating on the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The impeachment process has made one thing clear: We have a  
lot of work to do to rebuild the Republican Party before the year 
2000,'' New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said earlier 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's vote to acquit Clinton on charges of lying under  
oath and obstructing justice to cover up his affair with Monica 
Lewinsky marked the GOP's latest defeat in a series of Clinton 
probes. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds vote was needed to remove the president from  
office, but neither article garnered a majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman warned against letting Democrats shape future debate,  
saying Republicans ``cannot let others define who we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The next step for the Democrats is to come after us as the  
party that went after the president,'' she said. ``We can't let 
that be the lasting image of our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut Gov. John Rowland called for Republicans to reach  
out to other groups of Americans. He said the GOP has been too 
``intolerant'' of certain groups and has ``alienated'' others from 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a 25-year history of isolating everyone,'' Rowland  
said. ``There is a population out there called the baby boomers who 
we have totally alienated. When all people see is that we are 
against certain policies, why would they want to join us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman agreed, saying Republicans need more visibility from  
within the ranks so the public hears more than the party's most 
conservative voices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry Falwell is not the spokesman for the Republican Party,''  
Whitman said. ``We have to get away from these one or two spokesmen 
who say something and cause people to think that's us. That is not 
the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain minimized questions of lingering public outrage at  
Republicans for pushing through the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will pass very quickly if we are able to move on to  
more important issues. I think the American people will forget 
about it because they want to forget about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the impeachment has strengthened our party and not  
weakened it.''

<HEADLINE> Romney Not Worried About Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The new head of Salt Lake City's scandal-plagued Olympic  
committee isn't worried about critics. 
</P>
<P>
	On his first full day on the job, Mitt Romney asked anti-Olympic  
crusader Stephen Pace for a replica of his ``Slalom and Gomorrah'' 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``My experience is the loyal opposition is both loyal and  
valuable,'' said Romney, the Boston venture capitalist chosen 
Thursday to head the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, the son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney and a  
descendant of Utah's Mormon pioneers, said he is willing to listen 
to suggestions from Olympic critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like a political system that has two parties,'' said Romney,  
a Republican who lost a challenge to Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy 
in 1994. ``This enterprise doesn't really have two parties, so 
having people from the community weighing in on issues is 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a fourth board member resigned from the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Badami, whose company owns the resort where the giant  
slalom and snowboarding events will be held at the 2002 Salt Lake 
Games, told Gov. Mike Leavitt that he was ``prepared to withdraw 
his service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Badami is the fourth SLOC trustee to resign in two days.  
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt's recent request that any trustee with a conflict of  
interest resign within 60 days prompted three of them, including 
Badami, to resign. Each has had business dealings with SLOC, which 
were OK under the old ethics policy requiring only disclosure of 
conflicts and withdrawal during votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The other trustee to resign, Verl Topham, had no conflict but  
resigned because he was on the bid committee board that, according 
to the ethics panel, didn't give proper oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, an independent ethics panel said former  
executives of the bid committee unethically spent more than $1 
million in cash, shopping sprees, vacations, medical care, bogus 
jobs and scholarships for International Olympic Committee members 
who voted on whether Salt Lake could host the 2002 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the highest-ranking Olympic official implicated in  
the Salt Lake bribery case urged the IOC to dismiss the 
``scandalous allegations'' against him and his son. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Un-yong, the powerful South Korean executive board member,  
said the allegations were a ``personal affront'' to his 
``untarnished reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is deeply saddened by this situation and we hope it  
will be resolved swiftly,'' Kim said in a letter to IOC president 
Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim defended himself in a three-page letter that was also sent  
to members of the IOC panel investigating ethical misconduct during 
Salt Lake's winning bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel said bid committee records show it paid $45,000  
toward the salary of Kim's son to work at Keystone Communications, 
a satellite communications company based in Salt Lake. Keystone's 
former chief executive David Simmons said the bid committee paid 
all of the costs of John Kim's employment -- $75,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has been considered a leading candidate to succeed  
Samaranch, whose term expires in 2001. One of Kim's main rivals is 
Dick Pound, the IOC vice president who is leading the internal 
inquiry into the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other members of the panel also are seen as presidential  
hopefuls -- Pal Schmitt of Hungary, Thomas Bach of Germany and 
Jacques Rogge of Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Nine IOC members might have broken IOC rules during visits to  
Nagano during the Japanese city's bid for the 1998 Winter Games, 
Japanese Olympic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rogge, who heads the IOC's oversight panel for the 2000  
Olympics, said preparations for the games were being disturbed by 
continuing questions about whether Sydney won the bid fairly.

<HEADLINE> Chocolatier Offers Life-Like Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Theresa Mueller makes Valentine's hearts  
lined with blood vessels, aorta attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The $8.95 chocolate heart -- life-sized and shaped like a human  
heart -- is the latest in a series of novelty items that she's sold 
at her shop for 20 years. She said inspiration for the heart came 
last year when she saw the deluge of traditional Valentine's Day 
decorations. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the Cupids and these love-shaped things -- I thought, 'This  
is nonsense,''' Ms. Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mueller runs Chocolate by Mueller in downtown Philadelphia.  
She consulted a medical textbook for pictures to use as a guide to 
have the molds custom-made. 
</P>
<P>
	She still sells chocolates in the traditional stylized heart  
shape and ones shaped like Cupid, but she said the anatomically 
correct hearts have exceeded her expectations by far. 
</P>
<P>
	They're even beating out the top selling body-part novelty for  
last year's Valentine's Day -- 12 chocolate noses along with a note 
saying, ``I thought you said you wanted a dozen noses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Mueller said the hearts are ahead this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it last weekend and I thought it was a clever idea,''  
said Drew Johnson, a saloonkeeper from Wallingford, Pa. ``I also 
have noses -- a dozen noses -- for my mother, and the heart is for my 
wife. ... She has a good sense of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she sometimes gets unusual requests, like the one from  
a woman Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just called and she said, 'Do you have gall bladders?',''  
Ms. Mueller said. The answer: ``I will.''

<HEADLINE> Casey Takes Tumble, Roll and Skid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Casey Atwood's car hit the wall nose  
first. Then it went airborne, flipped end-over-end and skidded on 
its hood for about 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it rolled four times, sheet metal spewing all over  
the track, before the crumpled frame finally came to rest upright 
on the infield grass near the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what did your 18-year-old do this weekend?  
</P>
<P>
	One of the Busch Series' youngest drivers had the most dramatic  
of six wrecks that turned Saturday's Napa Auto Parts 300 into a 
struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, from Nashville, Tenn., crashed with just one lap  
remaining in the season-opener. Randy LaJoie clinched the victory 
under a yellow flag -- how appropriate -- and finally, the Busch 
drivers picked up the remains of their cars and got the heck out of 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most definitely the worst accident I've ever been  
involved in and hopefully it will always be the worst,'' said 
Atwood, who wasn't seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just took a little bump off turn 4 and got turned sideways.  
Then, things got out of control. I look at the way that car looks 
and it's hard to believe I'm OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, one of many young, inexperienced drivers in NASCAR's  
second-tier series, hit the wall after he was tapped on his rear 
bumper by Andy Hillenburg, who finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty wild ride,'' Atwood said. ``I always wondered  
what that felt like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the accident, he was running a solid race. The second-year  
Busch Series driver was competing for second place, trying to 
position himself for a late run at LaJoie as the cars headed into 
the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up finishing 17th, joining 18 other drivers in the  
43-car field who couldn't finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like bunch of kids at the go-kart track trying to get  
their go-karts to go the fastest,'' said fifth-place finisher Bobby 
Hillin. ``You fight for position and do everything but push each 
other off. That's what you're going to get here every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even at practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven drivers started in backup cars due to a series of  
accidents at (un)happy hour Friday, where everyone is supposed to 
be on his best behavior while crews make their final adjustments 
before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of weekend that left another 18-year-old -- Adam  
Petty -- feeling like an old man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God there aren't anymore superspeedway races for a  
while,'' said Petty, grandson of seven-time Daytona 500 winner 
Richard Petty. ``If I had to run these every weekend, I don't know 
if I'd be a race car driver. Some of the moves I saw out there, I'd 
never make, even when I'm playing on the computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Petty walked out to the garage area, he was stopped by a  
couple of autograph seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them held the most fitting souvenir from this wild  
weekend of Busch racing: the crushed grille plucked from the garage 
of driver Larry Pearson's wrecked car.

<HEADLINE> NFLPA May Suspend Agent's License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- An NFL Players Association committee has  
recommended suspending the license of a sports agent accused of 
supplying Michigan safety Marcus Ray with food, access to a stadium 
skybox and help with paying for hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati-based agent James Gould's license to represent  
players would be suspended for two years and he would be fined 
$15,000 under the recommendations offered by the NFLPA's 
disciplinary committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur McAsee, the association's staff counsel, told The Ann  
Arbor News in a story Saturday that Gould has appealed both the 
suspension and the fine. His appeal will be heard by an arbitrator 
who specializes in issues involving players and agents, McAsee 
said. The matter is expected to be resolved within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gould, who represents 23 NFL players, said Friday that he has  
hired two attorneys to pursue the appeal. He said he did not 
violate any NFL or NCAA rules by meeting with Ray. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel this is the most egregious thing I've witnessed in all  
my years in this business, as does everyone else who advises me or 
whom I represent,'' Gould told The News. ``The union took the 
position that I did it. I have not had the right of due process, 
but I'm the guy who's losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the union hasn't taken into consideration is my spotless  
record from day one. I have never had a complaint lodged against 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gould said he estimates the recommendation would cost him  
between $500,000 and $1 million in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, a fifth-year senior on the 1998 Wolverines team, was  
suspended Sept. 17 after school officials learned from the NCAA 
that Ray may have made improper contact with Gould, and had 
received extra benefits not allowed by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Gragg, the university's director of compliance,  
investigated and filed a report with the NCAA. Based on the 
findings of the report, the NCAA suspended Ray for six games. Ray 
also agreed to pay $477.26 in restitution for the benefits deemed 
improper. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said Thursday that he was pleased  
with the committee's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the (committee's) action certainly sends a message to  
players and agents alike, which I think is positive for the game,'' 
Carr said. ``Hopefully, the message will help some other kid and 
restrain some other agent. It's good, but it doesn't help Marcus 
Ray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA's recommendation was handed down by a three-player  
committee comprised of the Miami Dolphins' Trace Armstrong, the 
NFLPA president, the Oakland Raiders' Richard Harvey and the 
Minnesota Vikings' Robert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Michigan report, Ray and his mother, Pamela  
Simons, received tickets last July to the 1998 Jazz Festival at 
Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, as well as tickets to a skybox area. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the concert and skybox tickets were provided by  
Ohio-based Star Bank, which loaned Ray, a Columbus, Ohio, native, 
the money to pay for his disability insurance. Ray and his mother 
spent time with Gould in the skybox the night of the concert.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden May Have Left Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, the Saudi  
millionaire accused by the United States of plotting bomb attacks 
on two U.S. embassies in Africa, has left Afghanistan, Afghan 
sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden's whereabouts were not known, said the sources, who  
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The report of his departure comes just days after the Taliban  
religious army, which rules most of Afghanistan, took away bin 
Laden's satellite telephone and banned him from speaking to the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taliban spokesman in the militia's southern stronghold of  
Kandahar said today bin Laden ``has disappeared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't ask him to leave and we don't know where he is. ...  
That's all I am saying,'' Mohammed Tayyab said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban have called bin Laden their honored guest, a friend  
who helped the Afghan resistance fight invading Soviet soldiers in 
the 1980s. He came to Afghanistan from Sudan more than five years 
ago while the Taliban's opposition ruled the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban's ambassador in Islamabad, Saeed-ur-Rehman Haqqani,  
said he had not been told of bin Laden's departure, ``but if it has 
happened, it will be a good thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has offered asylum to bin Laden,  
who openly supports Iraq against the Western powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite repeated demands from Washington, the Taliban refused to  
hand over bin Laden after the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies 
in Kenya and Tanzania, demanding proof of his involvement in 
terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in recent weeks, both the United States and Britain  
have renewed their pressure on the Taliban to expel bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed that the new restrictions on bin Laden were linked  
to recent meetings between the Taliban and U.S. and British 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Taliban officials met U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for  
South Asian Affairs Rick Inderfurth last week in Islamabad and 
later met with British officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan, a strong ally of the Taliban and one of only three  
countries to recognize the movement's control over Afghanistan, 
also has been asked by the United States to use its influence to 
have bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been asked, but we can't force the Taliban to do  
anything they don't want to do,'' Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taliban did promise that bin Laden would not use Afghanistan  
as a staging arena for terrorist activities.

<HEADLINE> NASCAR Daytona 500 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gentlemen, zip your windbreakers.  
</P>
<P>
	A cold front dipped into central Florida early Saturday morning,  
dropping temperatures into the mid-50s with wind gusts of up to 25 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the conditions drivers are expected to encounter when  
they take the track Sunday for the Daytona 500. It will offer a 
stark contrast from early in the week, when practice and qualifying 
were held in 80-degree temperatures and sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's going to be cooler, and we hope it's not going to  
rain,'' said defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon. ``It's not 
going to make a big difference. At some tracks it will, but here 
it's not going to do much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Generally, cold weather is supposed to make the cars go faster.  
</P>
<P>
	And downplaying the attention he pays to weather conditions is  
nothing but show for Gordon. His crew chief, Ray Evernham, is among 
the most detail-oriented in racing. That's one reason his team has 
won three of the last four Winston Cup titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon conceded there would be changes to his car due to  
weather, but they would be subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same for everybody,'' he said. ``I don't see the cool  
temperatures doing a lot other than just helping the drivers not 
sweat so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PACKER BACKER: Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre is  
getting into the NASCAR business, teaming with Dale Jarrett in 
ownership of a Busch Series team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett's Winston Cup teammate, Kenny Irwin, will drive in 11  
races and Jarrett will take the wheel for three more. Jarrett-Favre 
Motorsports' first entry will be March 27 at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until about two years ago, I didn't really know much about  
the sport,'' Favre said. ``It is a business opportunity for me, but 
I'm not going to retire from football anytime soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett drove his own car in 12 Busch races last year, finishing  
in the top 10 four times. He convinced last year's Winston Cup 
Rookie of the Year to drive for him this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something interesting to do,'' Irwin said. ``It's going  
to be on my schedule a lot and, like Dale said, the more time, the 
better it's going to be. And hopefully, now I can get tickets to 
some Packers game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NO PRESSURE, KID: Could there be any more pressure on a young  
racer than having a seven-time Daytona 500 winner watching his 
every move? 
</P>
<P>
	Sure. If the guy is your grandfather. And your spotter is his  
former crew chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-year-old Adam Petty had some major help for Saturday's  
Busch Series NAPA Auto Parts 300, with Richard Petty and Dale Inman 
looking on. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Petty finished in sixth place in his first big-time race at  
Daytona, the place his grandfather -- The King -- dominated in the 
1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just as proud as a grandfather could be,'' Richard Petty  
said. ``The situation was, you'd watch him and hold your breath. He 
did a heck of a good job. He just watched what was going on and 
didn't try anything crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strategy spoken from a master.  
</P>
<P>
	Adam Petty said surviving the crash-filled race was a  
significant accomplishment, one helped along by Inman, who started 
spotting for him at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said those guys were getting crazy,'' Petty said. ``With  
about 20 laps to go (Chuck Bown's) car got into me. It wasn't 
anybody's fault, but it was a really scary moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BIG MONEY: The purse for Saturday's race was a record  
$1,288,997. Race winner Randy LaJoie earned $90,950 for his victory 
on NASCAR's second-tier series, but didn't feel like a minor 
leaguer afterwards. ``What's wrong with the Busch Series,'' he 
quipped after hearing what he had won. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Casey Atwood's multiple-roll accident at the end of  
the race severed land lines used to finalize scoring for the Busch 
Series race. NASCAR officials had to revert to their old system and 
results were delayed by about 30 minutes. ... Going back to 
Friday's Goody's Dash series race, there have been nine accidents 
involving 39 cars and bringing out 13 yellow or red flags. That's 
not including the incidents that wrecked seven cars during Friday's 
Busch Series practice ... Four drivers entered in the Daytona 500 
wrecked in the Busch Series race. They were Michael Waltrip, Johnny 
Benson, Mark Martin and Terry Labonte. All but Labonte were gone 
from the race before it was one-third over.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Auction Draws Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Potential bidders expressed qualms  
about buying O.J. Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the 
collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find the whole thing a little bit sad, to take away the  
Heisman Trophy,'' said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles, who came to 
view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on 
Friday. ``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college  
football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned. The catalog 
noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as 
``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque. 
</P>
<P>
	Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the  
Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said  
Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the 
Butterfield and Butterfield auction house. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home  
at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. They 
won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the 
murders in criminal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred  
Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he 
would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to  
help satisfy the $33.5 million civil court judgment against him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown  
pockets,'' Beardsley said. ``I believe he's not responsible for 
this crime, and I think there are a lot of people who believe 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery  
were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson 
during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No. 
32 football jerseys; oriental carpets; paintings and Tiffany-style 
lamps. 
</P>
<P>
	The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned  
by Simpson's first wife, Marguerite.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya To Face Major Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The jury is still out on whether Oscar De La  
Hoya is the best welterweight fighter since Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Thomas Hearns were in their prime. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt, however, that he's the richest.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will add another $9 million or so to his already  
substantial bank account tonight when he steps into the ring to 
defend his WBC welterweight title against unbeaten Ike Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	It's billed as the first true test of De La Hoya's career -- one  
that has seen the 1992 Olympic gold medalist already earn some $105 
million in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the beginning of a dual role for De La Hoya as a  
partner in the fight promotion -- taking some of the risk out of 
promoter Bob Arum's pocket with the chance to make a few extra 
million dollars if the fight sells well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar thinks his fights sell more tickets than they do,'' Arum  
said. ``I hope my partner's right, but he'll be putting his money 
up to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While De La Hoya has gotten rich in winning four weight division  
titles in his 29 pro fights, he has also been criticized for 
carefully picking opponents who were a bit over the hill or were 
having to move up or down in weight to fight him. 
</P>
<P>
	That figures to change with Quartey, who is 34-0-1 and made  
seven defenses of the WBA 147-pound title before it was taken from 
him for chasing big money fights instead of making a mandatory 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a tough fight, a good competitive fight,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``I need to fight the tough guys to bring out the best in 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's found one in Quartey (34-0-1), although the native of Ghana  
hasn't fought in 16 months and is coming off a draw in which he was 
knocked down in the 11th round of his last title fight with Jose 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey has 29 knockouts and is a solid puncher with both hands,  
although his straight-ahead style may be made for the boxer in De 
La Hoya. He weighed 146 1/2 pounds Friday to 147 for the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to figure out what I want to do,'' De La Hoya said.  
``Do I want to impress my fans and the whole boxing world to see 
who is the last guy standing or do I box him and take him to 
school? I have to figure that out maybe in the first or second 
round of the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has fought -- and beaten -- the likes of Julio Cesar  
Chavez, Pernell Whitaker and Hector ``Macho'' Camacho, but even he 
views the 29-year-old Quartey as his first opponent with a 
legitimate chance of upsetting De La Hoya's carefully laid career 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers aren't so certain, making De La Hoya a 3 1/2-1 favorite  
in the fight, which will be televised by pay-per-view beginning 
about 11:30 p.m. EST from the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first real test in my boxing career,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``He is a former world champion. He is unbeaten. I 
took this fight because I know that style wise Ike Quartey -- heavy 
hitter, dangerous puncher -- will bring out the best in me. I'm up 
for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quartey, it's not only the chance to finally earn some big  
money -- he'll get about $3 million -- but the chance to vault his 
name into boxing's top tier of fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey was supposed to fight Pernell Whitaker last April in a  
bout that fell through when Whitaker tested positive for cocaine. 
Then promotional problems derailed a possible fight with IBF 
welterweight champion Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the biggest opportunity of my life,'' Quartey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, he won't have to look far for his next  
opponent. Former three-time champion Frankie Randall and Oba Carr 
are fighting a 10-round elimination fight on the undercard for the 
right to challenge De La Hoya on May 22 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is rooting for Randall, a 37-year-old former WBA  
super lightweight champion. Carr is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr wouldn't motivate me as much as Randall would,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``Frankie is still hungry. He has a name. He'd help 
me fill up an arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken just like a promoter.

knocked down in the 11th round of his last title fight with Jose 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey has 29 knockouts and is a solid puncher with both hands,  
although his straight-ahead style may be made for the boxer in De 
La Hoya. He weighed 146 1/2 pounds Friday to 147 for the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to figure out what I want to do,'' De La Hoya said.  
``Do I want to impress my fans and the whole boxing world to see 
who is the last guy standing or do I box him and take him to 
school? I have to figure that out maybe in the first or second 
round of the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has fought -- and beaten -- the likes of Julio Cesar  
Chavez, Pernell Whitaker and Hector ``Macho'' Camacho, but even he 
views the 29-year-old Quartey as his first opponent with a 
legitimate chance of upsetting De La Hoya's carefully laid career 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers aren't so certain, making De La Hoya a 3 1/2-1 favorite  
in the fight, which will be televised by pay-per-view beginning 
about 11:30 p.m. EST from the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first real test in my boxing career,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``He is a former world champion. He is unbeaten. I 
took this fight because I know that style wise Ike Quartey -- heavy 
hitter, dangerous puncher -- will bring out the best in me. I'm up 
for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quartey, it's not only the chance to finally earn some big  
money -- he'll get about $3 million -- but the chance to vault his 
name into boxing's top tier of fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey was supposed to fight Pernell Whitaker last April in a  
bout that fell through when Whitaker tested positive for cocaine. 
Then promotional problems derailed a possible fight with IBF 
welterweight champion Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the biggest opportunity of my life,'' Quartey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, he won't have to look far for his next  
opponent. Former three-time champion Frankie Randall and Oba Carr 
are fighting a 10-round elimination fight on the undercard for the 
right to challenge De La Hoya on May 22 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is rooting for Randall, a 37-year-old former WBA  
super lightweight champion. Carr is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr wouldn't motivate me as much as Randall would,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``Frankie is still hungry. He has a name. He'd help 
me fill up an arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken just like a promoter.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Energy Exec To Head Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is planning to nominate  
Charles Curtis, a former acting head of the Energy Department, to 
the long-vacant post of secretary of the Air Force, a White House 
official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's first choice, Daryl Jones, failed to win  
approval of the Senate Armed Services Committee in July because of 
questions about his record as a reserve fighter pilot. He was 
accused of being grounded because of mishaps and then lying about 
it -- allegations he denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis, 58, is undergoing a final background check before  
Clinton sends his nomination to the Senate, a White House official 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington lawyer is a former classmate of Defense Secretary  
William Cohen from Boston University School of Law. He also served 
in the Army Reserve from 1965 to 1971 and is a current member of 
the Department of Defense's Policy Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining the law firm of Hogan and Hartson in the fall of  
1997, Curtis was the No. 2 official at the Energy Department and 
served as acting secretary after Hazel O'Leary left and before 
Federico Pena won the job at the beginning of Clinton's second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis had been in the running to become Energy secretary, a job  
now held by Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Energy Department, Curtis was chief operating office and  
was responsible for the agency's science, technology and national 
security programs. He was on the Nuclear Weapons Council and 
chaired a department board that oversees the National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Carter administration, he was chairman of the Federal  
Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary is the Air Force's top civilian job, which has  
been vacant since Sheila Widnall resigned in October 1997 to return 
to teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves GTE Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consortium led by GTE Corp. has won federal  
permission to buy a controlling stake in Puerto Rico's main 
telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's action Friday permits  
the consortium to finalize the roughly $2 billion deal with the 
state-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE, in Irving, Texas, said it expects the sale to close in  
March. After that, the state will continue to have some ownership 
in Puerto Rico Telephone, a GTE spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC concluded that the transaction, announced last year,  
would benefit Puerto Rico's residents by the consortium's 
commitments to, among other things, maintain residential phone 
rates and provide discounted Internet access to educational 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents also would benefit by GTE's telecommunications  
experience and its financial clout, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction ``is unlikely to produce competitive harms in  
Puerto Rican telecommunications markets,'' the FCC concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, about 6,400 workers went on strike to protest Gov.  
Pedro Rossello's decision to sell the controlling stake to the 
consortium. The proposed sale touched off weeks of picketing, 
sporadic clashes with police and sabotage that at its peak left 
many people without long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Rico Telephone Co. also provides local, phone service  
and Internet access to business and residential customers. It has 
1.3 million phone lines, more than 155,000 cellular customers and 
more than 237,000 paging customers. GTE provides local and 
long-distance phone services, wireless services and Internet 
access.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Some Disabled Fees OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- States may charge disabled people for such  
services as handicapped license plates and parking placards, a 
federal appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Friday that a  
regulation regarding fees contained in the Americans with 
Disabilities Act is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal courts have ruled that states can't charge for the  
license plates and placards. Friday's decision applies only within 
the jurisdiction of the 4th Circuit -- Virginia, Maryland, North 
Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest ruling stems from a case in North Carolina. Five  
disabled residents sued the state, saying the Department of Motor 
Vehicles broke the law by charging $5 for handicapped parking 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
	The residents argued that the ADA prohibits states from charging  
for programs that give the disabled equal access, but the 4th 
Circuit struck down the regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling does not affect the rest of the ADA, a broad federal  
law designed to protect disabled people from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said department  
lawyers were reviewing the decision and had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Pilot Union in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge held American  
Airlines' pilots union and two union leaders in contempt Saturday, 
threatening to fine them millions of dollars for not doing enough 
to get pilots back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the radical element that seems to be in control  
of the Allied Pilots Association seems determined to fly American 
Airlines into the side of a mountain, taking themselves, the 
company, their co-workers and their customers with them,'' U.S. 
District Judge Joe Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline because of the large number of 
pilots calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall had ordered the pilots on Wednesday to quit their job  
action, which stems from a dispute with management. But 1,700 of 
the airline's 9,400 pilots remained on the sick list Saturday 
afternoon at the Fort Worth-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
	That number was down from about 2,443 on Friday and airline  
officials seemed optimistic operations soon would return to normal. 
Allied Pilots Association President Rich LaVoy said he implored the 
pilots to return to work following Kendall's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We obviously don't agree with the judge's order,'' he said.  
``We are going to continue to comply with the judge's order and ask 
that the pilot's get back in the cockpit to get the system up and 
operating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he did not believe the union leadership was sincere  
in its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can make someone go fly an airplane, particularly if  
someone is dishonest and willing to lie and say they are sick when 
they really aren't,'' Kendall said. ``But what a federal judge can 
do -- and what I will do -- is make people pay for what they break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he would decide Wednesday how much to fine the  
union, LaVoy and union Vice President Brian Mayhew. He said the 
fine and related damages would be ``eight figures'' and ordered 
that the union set aside $10 million, or about a quarter of its net 
worth, in a bond to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ordered LaVoy to set aside $10,000 and Mayhew $5,000.  
LaVoy and Mayhew, both pilots, earned more than $200,000 last year, 
mainly doing work for the union. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials said that 5,600 flights have been canceled  
since the work action began, costing American between $67 million 
and $90 million, Chiames said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for AMR Corp., parent company of American Airlines,  
which had asked Kendall to declare the union in contempt, said 
officials had mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gratified with the judge's order but clearly  
disappointed it has come to this,'' said spokesman Chris Chiames. 
``A majority of our pilots are doing their jobs and we hope the 
rest come back real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American canceled 1,102 flights Friday -- nearly half of its  
daily total -- a day after it canceled 1,170. The carrier also 
scrapped 845 flights for Saturday and 209 for Sunday, with 
additional cancellations possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members have been calling in sick and refusing to accept  
overtime since Feb. 6 in a dispute over American's handling of pay 
raises to pilots of recently purchased Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots and those formerly with Reno Air stand to make  
more money once they all fall under American's existing contract. 
Many American pilots would advance up the seniority chart, while 
Reno pilots would get pay raises compared to their old carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR says the process of integrating the companies and pilots  
will take a year to 18 months. The pilots claim that is too long 
and accuse the company of dragging its feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge described the situation as a minor labor dispute that  
the union has transformed into a shakedown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it may indeed be more economical for American to  
cave in and pay, in the long run, if you pay extortion today, you 
typically have to pay it tomorrow,'' he said. ``When the pitch is 
'pay us what we want or we will cost you more,' it is the type of 
negotiation one usually sees when doing business with one of the 
five families in New York.''

<HEADLINE> View in Delta Center Is Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If the Salt Lake City Olympic organizers  
think the bribery scandal gave them an image problem, get ready for 
the wrath of the fans who saw Michelle Kwan disappear right before 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who paid hundreds of dollars for tickets to this week's  
U.S. Figure Skating Championships only got to see part of the show. 
Seating started about 15 feet above the floor, giving almost all of 
the fans obstructed views of at least part of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans were on hand to miss the action.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've sat in a couple of different areas and there doesn't seem  
to be a good area where it's not blocked,'' Connie Phelps of 
suburban Salt Lake said. ``I think people would not want to pay 
knowing they wouldn't be able to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee hasn't made a final decision on where  
to hold figure skating during the Olympics, but initial plans are 
to put it in the Delta Center. And on paper, that idea looks pretty 
smart. Capacity for nationals was 10,800, though seating probably 
can be increased by a few thousand to accommodate the figure 
skating fans in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a relatively new arena, so it's easy to maneuver in and has  
amenities like a coffee bar and room for souvenir hawkers. It's in 
the heart of downtown, close to hotels, highways and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Delta Center was built solely for basketball. Unlike  
other, multipurpose arenas, it doesn't have permanent seats at ice 
level. There are temporary seats, but they don't fit when an 
international-size ice rink -- 60 meters by 30 meters -- is put down. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rink this week is set way down and the seats up high.  
That means spectators can't see into the corners or along the 
sideboards on the side where they're sitting. Huge movie screens 
were hung at either end of the rink, but that meant fans were 
flipping back and forth between the ice and the screens -- fine for 
a ping-pong match, but a little annoying for programs that last 
less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little distracting to watch the skater, then watch  
the screen,'' said Shawna Brennan, who came with her mother from 
Marshfield, Mass., to watch nationals. ``It took away from the 
performance having to watch the screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with prices at nationals ranging from $15 to $75 for  
individual tickets and $125 to $375 for packages, that's a lot of 
money to pay to watch part of the event on television. Prices will 
be even higher for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would come if they make revisions,'' Phelps said.  
``If they don't, I don't think I would come. I'd just as soon watch 
it on television, even though I live here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans weren't the only ones dismayed with the setup. Banners had  
to be put up at the ends of the rink so skaters wouldn't get 
disoriented during their programs. A few skaters said they felt 
like they were in ``a pit,'' while others said it was strange not 
to be able to make eye contact with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unusual ... a little strange,'' Kwan said.  
``Probably the fans see the top of your head instead of your 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the venue assignments are being re-evaluated, said Frank  
Zang, spokesman for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. There's a 
possibility figure skating could be moved to the E Center, a 
smaller facility built for hockey and skating that's about 20 
minutes outside downtown. The men's hockey tournament is scheduled 
for the E Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the floor at the Delta Center is another possibility,  
but not a likely one, said Claire Ferguson, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association's representative to the International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it may be a contentious issue,'' Ferguson said. ``I've  
been looking at the seating, trying different seats in different 
areas all around the arena and it's obvious there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this arena also has so much space and that is good for the  
skaters. There is lots of room for television and space to put the 
TV cameras and for the skaters to walk and warm-up, and they have 
big locker rooms and lounges, which makes them more comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But changing the seating or moving figure skating to the E  
Center will have no effect on the abysmal attendance at nationals. 
Going into the marquee events Saturday -- the men's and ladies' free 
skate -- only 21,660 had showed up. The largest turnout was 4,628 
for the pairs free skate Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3,804 showed up to watch Kwan's short program Thursday  
night. And attendance for the men's short program was the worst so 
far, 1,776. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like our city's real supportive,'' Phelps  
said. ``I thought it would be jammed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Mickelson, executive director of the LOC, doesn't know why  
attendance has been so bad, but she said timing is definitely a 
problem. The year after an Olympics is traditionally watered down 
as medalists move on to other things. This year is no different. 
Kwan and Kyoko Ina are the only champions to return, though Ina, a 
two-time U.S. gold medalist with Jason Dungjen, is skating with a 
new partner, John Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	But no-shows haven't plagued other post-Olympic nationals. An  
average of more than 9,000 fans attended each session at the 1995 
nationals in Providence, R.I. That compares with an average of 
3,094 per session here. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless some changes are made, things won't look much better in  
2002.

	Clinton Heading to Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials admit that Mexico still  
has a ``tremendous problem'' with drug trafficking but are praising 
its eradication efforts in advance of President Clinton's two-day 
trip there that begins tomorrow. Mexico's war against drug 
traffickers, highlighted by a new $400 million, land-sea-and-air 
battle plan, tops the agenda for Clinton's meetings with Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo. In addition to drugs, their agenda 
includes trade, migration and the environment.

	Americans Looking Past Impeachment  
</P>
<P>
	POWDER SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Americans were still talking about  
President Clinton's impeachment today -- some relieved and others 
irritated at the result, but nearly everyone eager to move on to 
another topic. ``I think most people got tired of it weeks ago,'' 
said Ada Askea said in Atlanta. From the youth baseball park here 
to a subway tavern to Manhattan, to a coastal diner in Oregon, and 
among people exercising around Pasadena's Rose Bowl, there was an 
often-expressed reaction that as historic as yesterday's Senate 
vote may have been, for many people it was an anti-climactic end to 
a soap opera they had begun tuning out.

	Pilots' Union Held in Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- American Airlines' pilots union and two  
top union members have been threatened with millions of dollars in 
fines for not doing enough to get pilots to end their sickout. U.S. 
District Judge Joe Kendall today held the Allied Pilots Association 
and its president and vice president in contempt of court. Kendall 
had ordered the pilots on Wednesday to quit their job action, which 
stems from a dispute with management over the integration of Reno 
Air pilots onto the American roster. But 1,700 of the airline's 
9,400 pilots remained on the sick list. The work action cost the 
airline between $67 million and $90 million so far, according to 
American officials.

	Clinton Commits US Troops to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 4,000 American troops will go to  
Kosovo as part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force if 
warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians reach a political settlement, 
President Clinton said today. Clinton said that without a U.S. 
commitment, the warfare could bleed beyond Kosovo's borders -- into 
Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and even re-ignite conflict in 
Bosnia. The president's commitment of U.S. personnel was timed to 
strengthen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's hand as she flew 
to France to nudge stalled talks between the Serb government and 
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.

	Iraq Says U.S. Attack Killed Three  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. planes attacked sites in the southern  
``no fly'' zone today, killing at least three civilians and 
injuring several others, Iraqi media reported. One group of planes 
``attacked a civilian installation,'' killing three civilians and 
wounding ``a number of others,'' the statement said. It also said 
jets attacked a residential area in southern Iraq, injuring several 
people. Today was the third straight day Iraq has claimed civilian 
casualties in the ``no-fly'' zones. The reports could not be 
independently verified.

	French Jet, Glider Almost Collide  
</P>
<P>
	MONTPELLIER, France (AP) -- A glider and an Air France jet  
carrying 175 passengers to a city in southern France nearly 
collided, police and air traffic authorities said today. The Airbus 
A320 from Paris was beginning its descent to Montpellier's airport 
Friday afternoon when the plane lurched violently to the left, 
passengers said. The pilot soon after told startled passengers that 
he had swerved to avoid a head-on collision with a glider, which 
had grazed the plane's left wing. Both the plane and the glider 
landed safely.

21 points and seven assists for the Trojans (12-10, 4-9 Pacific-10

rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Aniston Denies Brad Pitt Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jennifer Aniston says recent reports of her  
pending marriage to actor Brad Pitt are greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``No! No! And that's what's so amusing -- all these detailed  
stories claiming, `Two sources said' or `I have sources,' yet 
nothing ever comes from the horse's mouth. I just watch and 
laugh,'' Aniston says in the March 4 edition of Rolling Stone 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Friends'' star also refuted allegations by critics who say  
the couple are trying to attract publicity by denying the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. It's not that at all,'' she says. ``My responsibility to  
the public is my work -- not what goes on in my private life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Aniston was tight-lipped about her private moments with  
Pitt, she told the magazine: ``I'll just tell you that this is the 
happiest time of my life -- that I'm happier than I've ever been. 
I'm not saying why. It's for a lot of reasons: work, love, family, 
just life.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquitted but Tarnished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is campaigning for better  
relations with Congress and the nation after his acquittal by the 
Senate. The drive to oust him from office failed but seems destined 
to taint him as the second president in history to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all Americans here in Washington and throughout our  
land, will rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation 
and building our future together,'' Clinton said in a brief, 
low-key statement he read Friday after the Senate, with Democrats 
solidly in his camp, acquitted him on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and  
renewal for America,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, battered by this latest defeat in a series of  
Clinton administration probes, were happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move on. He won. He always wins,'' said Sen. Bob Smith,  
R-N.H., who twice voted to convict the president and remove him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats who were furious at Clinton's misleading statements  
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky said they would take his word 
on future policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to. We've got life-and-death issues facing us'' here  
and abroad, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., told reporters before the 
long-expected vote to acquit. Still, he said, ``The relationship is 
unquestionably damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort at renewal came in the hours following Chief Justice  
William Rehnquist's somber announcement that Clinton was ``hereby 
acquitted of the charges'' passed by the House in December. The 
votes fell far short of the two-thirds margin required for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10  
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats in voting not guilty. The 
second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with five 
Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments after the trial ended, Republicans blocked an effort led  
by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to censure Clinton for 
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' behavior. Lawmakers said 
they did not expect the issue to resurface when lawmakers return to 
the Capitol after a 10-day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Other matters remain unresolved, however, such as whether  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will indict Clinton, and whether 
the widely criticized statute that authorized his nearly five-year 
investigation will be renewed when it expires in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also has not decided whether to release the  
full-length videotaped depositions of Monica Lewinsky, presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. Also 
uncertain is whether Senate leaders will refer questions about 
Blumenthal's truthfulness under oath to the Justice Department or 
let Starr handle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 45 minutes of the vote, the impeachment trial -- the first  
of president since Andrew Johnson's in 1868 -- was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's acquittal brought an anticlimactic end to a saga that  
paralyzed Washington for a year and disgusted many Americans 
outside the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Long expected to fail, the votes' predictability contrasted  
sharply with the days of suspense that began with the news 13 
months ago that Starr was investigating whether Clinton had lied 
under oath about an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House 
intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's finger-wagging denial, Ms. Lewinsky's stained dress,  
the sight of Starr's motorcade delivering his report to Congress 
were history, preserved forever on paper and videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Public opinion polls, too, were historic, for their consistency  
and for their role in saving Clinton's presidency. From the time 
the nation awoke one January 1998 morning to the news of Starr's 
probe, through the verdict on Friday, the polls showed that 
Americans overwhelmingly wanted Clinton to remain in office even if 
the charges were proven true. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans drove the point home as the Republican-led  
congressional probe continued last fall. New dramas unfolded when 
the GOP lost House seats in a campaign that was widely viewed as a 
referendum of sorts on the president's fate. House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich took responsibility and resigned. His would-be successor, 
Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., followed suit after reporters learned 
that he, too, had had extramarital affairs. The House approved the 
two articles of impeachment the same day, just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial opened in the Senate on Jan. 7, with the unforgettable  
sight of Rehnquist mounting the dais, senators vowing to do 
impartial justice and walking to the front of the chamber to sign a 
book attesting to their oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The two legal teams clashed for days on end, but the real  
struggle played out in closed-door party caucuses. There, 
Democratic support for Clinton hardened. Republicans, sensing 
political damage, fractured, most importantly on whether to call 
witnesses and how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict in, senators praised one another for working  
together and thanked Rehnquist, who had presided with firm control 
over the time and an impish sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work as a court of impeachment is now done,'' the chief  
justice said, and he walked from the chamber for the final time.

<HEADLINE> Carr Earns Welterweight Title Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oba Carr won a lot more than a fight Saturday  
night against Frankie Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have also won the biggest chance of his boxing career.  
</P>
<P>
	With a promised shot at Oscar De La Hoya to the winner, there  
was a lot more at stake than the $100,000 each fighter earned on 
the featured undercard fight before De La Hoya defended his WBC 
welterweight title against Ike Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr was the one who took advantage, dominating the fight  
against the 37-year-old former two-time junior welterweight 
champion from the second round on to win a unanimous 10-round 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fought a smart fight. I didn't come here for a knockout,''  
Carr said. ``He tried to hold on, tried to survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no knockdowns in the fight, but Carr was clearly the  
faster and stronger fighter. He wore Randall down with body shots 
in the middle rounds and scored well with counter punches as 
Randall moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges Duane Ford and Jerry Roth had Carr winning 97-92, while  
Duane Ford scored it 99-90. The Associated Press had Carr winning 
99-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall, the first fighter to beat Julio Cesar Chavez, had a  
point taken from him in the seventh round for pushing Carr on a 
break, then hitting him with a right hand that sent Carr staggering 
across the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight. It was a bad decision,'' Randall  
said. ``This is what always happens to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randall, 146, who held the WBA 140-pound title twice in his  
career, fell to 55-6-1. Carr, 148, improved to 48-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In another title fight, Erik Morales of Tijuana, Mexico, took a  
round to figure out Angel Chacon, then knocked him out with a 
spectacular flurry a round later to retain his WBC super 
batamweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales knocked Chacon through the ropes with a three-punch  
flurry and referee Richard Steele moved in to immediately stop the 
fight with Chacon laying on his back on the ring apron. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales, 121 1/2, scored his 26th knockout in defending his title  
for the fifth time. His record improved to 32-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make a statement,'' said Morales, who will defend  
his title May 8 against Wayne McCullough. ``It's a big fight 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chacon, 122, of Puerto Rico, was tentative from the opening bell  
but wasn't in serious trouble until Morales chased him across the 
ring early in the second round to land a flurry. 
</P>
<P>
	A few seconds later, Morales backed Chacon into the ropes and  
landed a big right followed by a left to the head. A right missed, 
but Morales connected with another left as Chacon (24-3) fell to 
the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of novelty fights, female boxer Mia St. John of  
Canoga, Park, Calif., won a unanimous four-round decision over 
Amanda Skelton of Fort Smith, Ark., while Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch 
knocked out Canada's Patrick Graham in the third round of a 
scheduled four-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Esch, who at 316 pounds outweighed Graham by 85 pounds, ran over  
to George Foreman at ringside after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the grilling machine, George,'' he said. ``The grilling  
machine done this.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Says It's Time To Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Republican leader says impeachment  
is over, and it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	Trent Lott says most senators agreed President Clinton lied  
under oath and tried to obstruct justice, but he'll stay in office 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he says, lawmakers must get on with the people's business.  
</P>
<P>
	The majority leader says Republicans support using most of the  
surplus for Social Security, but they also want an across-the-board 
tax cut. He says Americans will get one if they demand it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott says the GOP also wants an education reform plan to give  
state and local officials more control over how they spend their 
dollars. He says President Clinton has resisted giving up that 
control.

<HEADLINE>  De La Hoya To Face Major Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The jury is still out on whether Oscar De La  
Hoya is the best welterweight fighter since Sugar Ray Leonard and 
Thomas Hearns were in their prime. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no doubt, however, that he's the richest.  
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will add another $9 million or so to his already  
substantial bank account tonight when he steps into the ring to 
defend his WBC welterweight title against unbeaten Ike Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	It's billed as the first true test of De La Hoya's career -- one  
that has seen the 1992 Olympic gold medalist already earn some $105 
million in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the beginning of a dual role for De La Hoya as a  
partner in the fight promotion -- taking some of the risk out of 
promoter Bob Arum's pocket with the chance to make a few extra 
million dollars if the fight sells well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oscar thinks his fights sell more tickets than they do,'' Arum  
said. ``I hope my partner's right, but he'll be putting his money 
up to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While De La Hoya has gotten rich in winning four weight division  
titles in his 29 pro fights, he has also been criticized for 
carefully picking opponents who were a bit over the hill or were 
having to move up or down in weight to fight him. 
</P>
<P>
	That figures to change with Quartey, who is 34-0-1 and made  
seven defenses of the WBA 147-pound title before it was taken from 
him for chasing big money fights instead of making a mandatory 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want a tough fight, a good competitive fight,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``I need to fight the tough guys to bring out the best in 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's found one in Quartey (34-0-1), although the native of Ghana  
hasn't fought in 16 months and is coming off a draw in which he was 
knocked down in the 11th round of his last title fight with Jose 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey has 29 knockouts and is a solid puncher with both hands,  
although his straight-ahead style may be made for the boxer in De 
La Hoya. He weighed 146 1/2 pounds Friday to 147 for the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to figure out what I want to do,'' De La Hoya said.  
``Do I want to impress my fans and the whole boxing world to see 
who is the last guy standing or do I box him and take him to 
school? I have to figure that out maybe in the first or second 
round of the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya has fought -- and beaten -- the likes of Julio Cesar  
Chavez, Pernell Whitaker and Hector ``Macho'' Camacho, but even he 
views the 29-year-old Quartey as his first opponent with a 
legitimate chance of upsetting De La Hoya's carefully laid career 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Oddsmakers aren't so certain, making De La Hoya a 3 1/2-1 favorite  
in the fight, which will be televised by pay-per-view beginning 
about 11:30 p.m. EST from the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the first real test in my boxing career,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``He is a former world champion. He is unbeaten. I 
took this fight because I know that style wise Ike Quartey -- heavy 
hitter, dangerous puncher -- will bring out the best in me. I'm up 
for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quartey, it's not only the chance to finally earn some big  
money -- he'll get about $3 million -- but the chance to vault his 
name into boxing's top tier of fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey was supposed to fight Pernell Whitaker last April in a  
bout that fell through when Whitaker tested positive for cocaine. 
Then promotional problems derailed a possible fight with IBF 
welterweight champion Felix Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the biggest opportunity of my life,'' Quartey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Should De La Hoya win, he won't have to look far for his next  
opponent. Former three-time champion Frankie Randall and Oba Carr 
are fighting a 10-round elimination fight on the undercard for the 
right to challenge De La Hoya on May 22 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is rooting for Randall, a 37-year-old former WBA  
super lightweight champion. Carr is 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oba Carr wouldn't motivate me as much as Randall would,'' De  
La Hoya said. ``Frankie is still hungry. He has a name. He'd help 
me fill up an arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spoken just like a promoter.

<HEADLINE> Error Leads to Gulfstream Mistiming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Several Gulfstream Park races last month  
will have to be retimed after the company responsible for the 
timing system on Saturday acknowledged problems with its system. 
</P>
<P>
	Teleview Racing Patrol attributed the false times to operator  
error. 
</P>
<P>
	``After almost three weeks of diligent research ... we have  
found and rectified the problem that resulted in some of 
Gulfstream's race times being erroneously posted,'' Teleview 
president Ron Sellitto said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The races in question will be retimed electronically from track  
videotapes. Times then will be corrected in each horse's past 
performance charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Teleview nor Gulfstream officials would say how many  
races will need to be retimed. The problem is believed to be 
limited to the first three weeks of the Gulfstream meet, which 
opened in early January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teleview regrets the entire episode and apologizes for it,''  
Sellitto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent clockers at the track have said official times have  
been off by as much as 1 2-5 seconds -- the equivalent of seven 
lengths.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Out 3-4 Wks. With Hurt Knee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley will be sidelined 3-4 weeks after  
deciding Saturday to undergo surgery to fix a painful muscle tear 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	After an MRI diagnosed the problem on Tuesday, team officials  
said he would play through the pain while treating the injury with 
rehabilitation and medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The pain has continued to worsen, however, and Rockets spokesman  
Tim Frank said Barkley couldn't even fully bend the knee on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that I've got to miss any games, because my  
goal was to play all the games this year,'' said Barkley, who was 
hampered by injuries all last season. ``The problem is, my other 
leg is getting sore from overcompensating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Walter Lowe will perform the surgery as early as Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Barkley's injury is particularly disappointing to the Rockets  
because he had entered the lockout-shortened season in peak 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest blow to Houston's star-studded roster.  
</P>
<P>
	Starting point guard Matt Maloney is battling a slightly  
separated right shoulder, fellow guard Rodrick Rhodes is out seven 
more weeks recovering from a torn tendon in his chest and backup 
center Antoine Carr is out 3-5 more weeks after knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley had led the Rockets after recovering fully from  
off-season double hernia and elbow surgery. During Houston's 4-1 
start, Barkley averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 17 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Soldier Sentenced in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A former U.S. Army soldier who plotted to  
deliver sensitive defense documents to Hungarian and Czech agents 
while stationed in West Germany has been handed a 25-year prison 
term . 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said the espionage involved one of the most  
serious breaches of U.S. and NATO security during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Therese Warren, 32, of Warner Robins, Ga., was sentenced  
Friday. She pleaded guilty in November to conspiring to commit 
espionage while stationed with the U.S. Army 8th Infantry Division 
headquarters in Bad Kreuznach, West Germany, from 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped prepare classified documents that concerned the  
Allied defense of Central Europe in case of an attack by former 
Warsaw Pact countries, plans for the use of nuclear weapons and 
documents related to chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
	``The compromise of this classified material was devastating to  
our national security and with this information the enemy probably 
could have defeated a conventional counterattack,'' said retired 
Gen. Clayton Otis, a former commander in chief of the Army in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren was the fifth person convicted of taking part in the  
scheme. One man was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to 
forfeit $1.7 million. Another man got 36 years in prison, and two 
others 18 years.

<HEADLINE> Marines Could Get to Kosovo Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acting as the vanguard of a U.S. peacekeeping  
force for Kosovo, Marines could enter the Serbian province within 
10 days of a peace agreement, a senior U.S. defense official said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials provided details of military planning for a  
peacekeeping operation after President Clinton announced Saturday 
in his weekly radio address that the United States would contribute 
about 4,000 troops if warring parties reach a solid agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	It remained in doubt whether peace will be negotiated between  
the Serbs and ethnic Albanian activists demanding more freedom for 
the province. Negotiations in France were stalled as the Serb 
delegation refused to discuss a U.S.-sponsored peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
	If peace comes, however, current plans specify that Marines of  
the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit would be the first U.S. forces 
to enter Kosovo, the senior defense official said, speaking on 
condition he not be identified. About 2,200 of the unit's Marines 
are embarked aboard the USS Nassau and other Navy ships in the 
Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the Marine unit, trained as a mobile,  
versatile force, would clear the way for slower-deploying Army 
soldiers, who would eventually replace the Marines and do the main 
peacekeeping work. It was not clear whether the Army troops would 
come from bases in Europe or the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how quickly the Marines could get there if a peace deal  
were signed and Clinton gave a final OK for U.S. military 
involvement, the official said: ``We're talking days, not weeks. 
Probably less than 10 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The approximately 4,000 U.S. troops would represent about 14  
percent of a projected total NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000, the 
official said. Most of the troops would be provided by Britain, 
France, Germany and other European nations, with the overall force 
commanded by a British general who heads NATO's Allied Rapid 
Reaction Force. The NATO chain of command would run through the 
alliance's command for southern Europe, headed by U.S. Navy Adm. 
John Ellis, and ultimately to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, 
who is U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army force would be organized as a ``brigade combat team''  
comprising two mechanized infantry battalions and an aviation 
battalion, the defense official said. The U.S. Air Force would not 
be involved directly, although U.S. warplanes and Navy ships would 
remain in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. defense official said the peacekeepers' mission would  
be to monitor and enforce the military aspects of a peace 
agreement. He stressed they would enter Kosovo only at the consent 
of the parties to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The force would be strong enough to protect itself from  
various elements that may reject the settlement,'' the official 
said, reflecting the likelihood that fringe groups may try to 
undermine peace. U.S. officials voiced similar worries when U.S. 
peacekeepers entered Bosnia after the 1995 Dayton peace accord, 
although no serious military challenge to the peacekeepers 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	A top priority for implementing a Kosovo peace, the official  
said, would be to ensure withdrawal of Serbia's security forces. 
The peacekeepers would ``remove them from the scene'' in a way that 
is ``acceptable to both sides,'' he said. In parallel, the 
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army would be disarmed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If military elements of a Kosovo peace accord are accepted as  
currently drafted, half the 13,000 to 14,000 Serbian border guards 
now in Kosovo would be withdrawn within 90 days, the official said. 
After another 90 days, all but 1,500 border guards, plus 1,000 
support personnel, would be gone. Full withdrawal would be 
completed within a year of the signing, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, most of the Serb police force of 10,000 to 12,000  
now in Kosovo would be withdrawn within 120 days of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO troops would not perform police functions. A police  
force of indigenous Kosovo Albanians would be created to ensure 
public security, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign Wally Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Wally Williams signed a five-year contract  
Saturday with the New Orleans Saints, a team looking to shore up 
its offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will be paid $18.5 million, including a $7 million  
signing bonus, according to WWL-TV in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, at 6-foot-2 and 315 pounds, is a six-year NFL veteran  
who originally signed with the Cleveland Browns in 1993 as a 
college free agent out of Florida A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Williams started the first seven games at left  
guard, moving to center for the next six. Saints coach Mike Ditka 
said he liked Williams' versatility, but hopes to use him in 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a proven outstanding player in the league,'' Ditka said.  
``He can play in more than one position, but we don't want that. We 
want to solidify the left side of the line. We think we're going to 
have a good line. We really think we're going to have a great young 
line and that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he's glad to be given the chance to work in one  
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been bounced around from left guard, right guard and  
center throughout my career. All I wanted was the opportunity to 
come in and solidify a position and perfect it. I've played hard 
every position I've been in but given an opportunity to come here 
and perfect one position I think I can take my skills to the next 
level.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Holds Pilot Union in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge on Saturday held  
American Airlines' pilots union and two top board members in 
contempt and promised sizable fines against them, saying the union 
did not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after a 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline because of the large number of 
pilots calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered the pilots  
Wednesday to quit their job action stemming from a dispute with 
management, about one in five remained on the sick list Saturday at 
the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline. The airline canceled hundreds 
of flights planned for the long Presidents Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he would decide Feb. 17 how much to fine the Allied  
Pilots Association, union President Rich LaVoy and union Vice 
President Brian Mayhew. The judge chided them for what he suggested 
was a short-sighted approach to relations with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the radical element that seems to be in control  
of the Allied Pilots Association seems determined to fly American 
Airlines into the side of a mountain, taking themselves, the 
company, their co-workers and their customers with them,'' Kendall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge indicated the fine and related damages would be  
``eight figures'' and ordered that the union set aside $10 million, 
or about a quarter of its net worth, in a bond to pay it. He 
ordered LaVoy to set aside $10,000 and Mayhew $5,000. LaVoy and 
Mayhew, both pilots, earned more than $200,000 last year, mainly 
doing work for the union. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for AMR Corp., parent company of American Airlines,  
which had asked Kendall to declare the union in contempt, said 
officials had mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gratified with the judge's order but clearly  
disappointed it has come to this,'' said spokesman Chris Chiames. 
``A majority of our pilots are doing their jobs and we hope the 
rest come back real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy said he was not surprised. He plans to review his options  
with his lawyers before deciding whether to appeal. ``We obviously 
don't agree with the judge's order,'' he said, adding that the 
union would ``continue to comply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union members have been calling in sick and refusing to accept  
overtime since Feb. 6 in a dispute concerning how quickly American 
should integrate the pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into 
its own roster. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials said that 5,600 flights have been canceled  
since the work action began, costing American between $67 million 
and $90 million, Chiames said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Los Angeles International Airport, lines at the American  
Airlines terminal were shorter than they had been the past several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an inconvenience,'' said Gordon Gibson, a Los Angeles  
building contractor heading to a vacation in Rio de Janeiro. ``I 
was on the phone for hours this morning trying to find out whether 
my flight was still on, and now I'm spending hours at the airport 
trying to get the ticket for my canceled flight validated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he did not believe the union leadership sincerely  
tried to get members to go back to work after he ordered them to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can make someone go fly an airplane, particularly if  
someone is dishonest and willing to lie and say they are sick when 
they really aren't,'' Kendall added. ``But what a federal judge can 
do -- and what I will do -- is make people pay for what they break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he would not hold in contempt the seven other  
officers of the pilots union who showed up for Friday's daylong 
hearing on American's request. He said he would deal later with the 
12 union officials who did not appear. 
</P>
<P>
	American canceled 1,102 flights Friday -- nearly half of its  
daily total -- a day after it canceled 1,170. The carrier also 
scrapped 845 flights for Saturday and 209 for Sunday, with 
additional cancellations possible. 
</P>
<P>
	American pilots and those formerly with Reno Air stand to make  
more money once they all fall under American's existing contract. 
Many American pilots would advance up the seniority chart, while 
Reno pilots would get pay raises compared to their old carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR says the process of integrating the companies and pilots  
will take a year to 18 months. That, according to the pilots, is 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
	No negotiations were scheduled for Saturday between the union  
and the airline. American issued a statement calling for more 
talks: ``We are prepared to get back to the negotiating table this 
weekend and we believe we can promptly resolve the matters that led 
to the disruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment on whether either side would ask  
for binding arbitration or whether a federal mediator would oversee 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiames said the airline is trying to beef up its phone lines to  
help passengers who want to reschedule. Many passengers who have 
flooded American with calls have been disconnected or gotten busy 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on it,'' Chiames said. ``I don't blame them for  
being frustrated.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Center Not Up to Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If the Salt Lake City Olympic organizers  
think the bribery scandal gave them an image problem, get ready for 
the wrath of the fans who saw Michelle Kwan disappear right before 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who paid hundreds of dollars for tickets to this week's  
U.S. Figure Skating Championships only got to see part of the show. 
Seating started about 15 feet above the floor, giving almost all of 
the fans obstructed views of at least part of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans were on hand to miss the action.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've sat in a couple of different areas and there doesn't seem  
to be a good area where it's not blocked,'' Connie Phelps of 
suburban Salt Lake said. ``I think people would not want to pay 
knowing they wouldn't be able to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee hasn't made a final decision on where  
to hold figure skating during the Olympics, but initial plans are 
to put it in the Delta Center. And on paper, that idea looks pretty 
smart. Capacity for nationals was 10,800, though seating probably 
can be increased by a few thousand to accommodate the figure 
skating fans in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a relatively new arena, so it's easy to maneuver in and has  
amenities like a coffee bar and room for souvenir hawkers. It's in 
the heart of downtown, close to hotels, highways and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Delta Center was built solely for basketball. Unlike  
other, multipurpose arenas, it doesn't have permanent seats at ice 
level. There are temporary seats, but they don't fit when an 
international-size ice rink -- 60 meters by 30 meters -- is put down. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rink this week is set way down and the seats up high.  
That means spectators can't see into the corners or along the 
sideboards on the side where they're sitting. Huge movie screens 
were hung at either end of the rink, but that meant fans were 
flipping back and forth between the ice and the screens -- fine for 
a ping-pong match, but a little annoying for programs that last 
less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little distracting to watch the skater, then watch  
the screen,'' said Shawna Brennan, who came with her mother from 
Marshfield, Mass., to watch nationals. ``It took away from the 
performance having to watch the screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with prices at nationals ranging from $15 to $75 for  
individual tickets and $125 to $375 for packages, that's a lot of 
money to pay to watch part of the event on television. Prices will 
be even higher for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would come if they make revisions,'' Phelps said.  
``If they don't, I don't think I would come. I'd just as soon watch 
it on television, even though I live here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans weren't the only ones dismayed with the setup. Banners had  
to be put up at the ends of the rink so skaters wouldn't get 
disoriented during their programs. A few skaters said they felt 
like they were in ``a pit,'' while others said it was strange not 
to be able to make eye contact with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unusual ... a little strange,'' Kwan said.  
``Probably the fans see the top of your head instead of your 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the venue assignments are being re-evaluated, said Frank  
Zang, spokesman for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. There's a 
possibility figure skating could be moved to the E Center, a 
smaller facility built for hockey and skating that's about 20 
minutes outside downtown. The men's hockey tournament is scheduled 
for the E Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the floor at the Delta Center is another possibility,  
but not a likely one, said Claire Ferguson, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association's representative to the International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it may be a contentious issue,'' Ferguson said. ``I've  
been looking at the seating, trying different seats in different 
areas all around the arena and it's obvious there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this arena also has so much space and that is good for the  
skaters. There is lots of room for television and space to put the 
TV cameras and for the skaters to walk and warm-up, and they have 
big locker rooms and lounges, which makes them more comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But changing the seating or moving figure skating to the E  
Center will have no effect on the abysmal attendance at nationals. 
A total of 32,456 spectators showed up for the week's events, with 
the largest crowd -- 6,571 -- for the women's free skate Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 4,225 showed up for the men's free skate Saturday, and  
3,804 were on hand for Kwan's short program Thursday night. 
Attendance for the men's short program was the worst so far, 1,776. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like our city's real supportive,'' Phelps  
said. ``I thought it would be jammed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Mickelson, executive director of the LOC, doesn't know why  
attendance has been so bad, but she said timing is definitely a 
problem. The year after an Olympics is traditionally watered down 
as medalists move on to other things. This year is no different. 
Kwan and Kyoko Ina are the only champions to return, though Ina, a 
two-time U.S. gold medalist with Jason Dungjen, is skating with a 
new partner, John Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	But no-shows haven't plagued other post-Olympic nationals. An  
average of more than 9,000 fans attended each session at the 1995 
nationals in Providence, R.I. That compares with an average of 
3,606 per session here. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless some changes are made, things won't look much better in  
2002.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Wins Piracy Case in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A Beijing court has ordered two Chinese firms to  
pay $100,000 in compensation to Microsoft for using its software 
without authorization, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the relatively small damages ordered by the Beijing No.  
1 Intermediate Court, the ruling may set a precedent for other 
software piracy cases in China, where most computers operate on 
pirated software. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing Haisida Science and Technology Development Co. and  
Min'an Investment Consulting Co. were found guilty of copyright 
infringement, Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies failed to meet a deadline to file an appeal, it  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials were not available for comment late Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the case was Microsoft's first piracy case in China,  
the software giant has teamed up with Chinese authorities in trying 
to catch computer retailers using pirated software in their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	China and the United States went to the brink of a trade war  
before reaching agreements in 1995 and 1996 to stamp out piracy. 
The U.S. government has since lauded China's efforts to close down 
factories producing pirated software, films, compact discs and 
computer discs. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Software Alliance, a group that combats piracy,  
estimates that unlicensed software costs makers $1.5 billion in 
China each year.

<HEADLINE> Third Time No Charm for Koznick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- After Sestriere, after Nagano, Kristina  
Koznick figured bad luck was behind her. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, the top American medal hope in the World Alpine Ski  
Championships, dulled the enthusiasm of an early-morning crowd 
when, as the first starter, she lasted about 10 gates before skiing 
out of the women's slalom Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened so fast, when I hit the ground, I said, `No, no,  
this is not happening to me,' '' said Koznick, of Burnsville, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I loved starting first. When we were watching the men  
yesterday, I was telling everybody, `Going first is the best. The 
snow's perfect.' It was just not my day. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I fell, I just wanted to go back.''  
</P>
<P>
	The fall continued a litany of failure in big events for  
Koznick. She lasted only a few gates before skiing out in the 1997 
Worlds at Sestriere, Italy. A year later, she skied what she 
thought was a safe first run in the Olympics at Nagano, Japan, and 
was so far back she had no chance at a medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sestriere was totally different. I didn't know what it was  
like to win,'' said Koznick, who has since won two World Cup 
slaloms. ``Now I'm in a totally different spot than I was in 
Sestriere. I'm almost a totally different person. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy for me to go back to Japan and say, `OK, this is  
what I'm taking away from it.' But Japan was different. Japan was 
me being naive and I didn't know what I was doing. Now I know what 
I'm doing. It's not a matter of even learning anything. I think 
it's just a matter of luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to stop wracking up this big-event thing. I need to  
have good things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koznick, who got her second victory at Semmering, Austria, in  
December, was considered to have a good chance in Saturday's 
slalom, and she agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I woke up this morning, I thought I'd have a medal around  
my neck,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night at the draw, everybody was like, `All right, it's  
time for a medal.' I wanted it, too, and I'd like to think I'm 
strong enough to handle that kind of pressure. I don't think that's 
what it was. I felt fine in the start and I was excited this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I fell, I was at a loss. This is such an opportunity, to  
be in my home country and be skiing as well as I am and have a 
(sunny) day like this and snow like this. Everything is perfect. 
It's tough to think that in a way I blew it. I guess it's just bad 
luck. I caught an edge; I didn't do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it is easier to ski on the road. But to come down and  
have a crowd like this is what you dream. I've got to figure out a 
way to make it work.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Win U.S. Skating Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michelle Kwan probably could have won her  
third national title wearing snowshoes. 
</P>
<P>
	To her credit, the two-time world champion was unaffected by the  
lack of competition at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Her 
superb free skate, marred only by a late fall on a triple lutz she 
didn't need, was plenty good Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those performances where I just let it go,''  
said Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Saturday, after two years of barely missing a national  
title, Michael Weiss was nearly flawless in the men's event. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who has won the U.S. title in 1996, '98 and this year,  
made her other six triple jumps, including a triple toe loop-triple 
toe loop combination, look effortless. Her spins were precise and 
she ignored her fall to finish strongly with a series of spins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what happened. I thought I had it,'' she said of  
the fall. ``I was straight in the air. I guess I just didn't check 
out, but I knew to get right back up and keep on going. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning, my goal was to do the triple-triple,  
because I haven't done it in a year or maybe more,'' added Kwan, 
18, of Torrance, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was gorgeous,'' added coach Frank Carroll.  
</P>
<P>
	Her routine to ``Ariane,'' earned 10 5.9s and the rest 5.8s. The  
performance was, by far, the highlight of a night on which many 
skaters couldn't even land one triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Two 13-year-olds finished in the top four. Naomi Nari Nam, who  
was fourth at the U.S. juniors a year ago, jumped and spun her way 
to second place. Sarah Hughes, second in this year's junior worlds, 
was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Angela Nikodinov surged from fifth overall to third with a  
strong free skate, worth two-thirds of the total score. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, many of the women could barely stand up.  
</P>
<P>
	Nari Nam is too young to go to next month's world championships,  
but Hughes can take her place because of an International Skating 
Union rule allowing a medalist at junior worlds to compete at 
senior worlds, regardless of age. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss fell early on his quadruple toe loop, but it didn't matter  
after he hit eight triple jumps, four in combination. He responded 
to the pressure of coming to nationals a heavy favorite following 
runner-up finishes to Todd Eldredge the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked real hard for this,'' Weiss said. ``I felt like this  
was my national championships and I didn't want anyone to take it 
away from me. 
</P>
<P>
	``People look at you a little differently when you have that  
title. A lot of times people skate with a little bit more 
enthusiasm and a little more confidence, so it's good to have that 
title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, 22, of Fairfax, Va., leads a young squad to worlds. Only  
Weiss, seventh at the Nagano Olympics last February and sixth at 
the 1998 worlds, has much senior international experience. And he 
hadn't won a major competition since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise member of the three-man world team is Trifun  
Zivanovic, who surged from seventh in '98 to second this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unexpected,'' he said. ``I was aiming for top  
three, but I knew I was capable of anything coming here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old from Los Angeles drew a standing ovation for his  
routine to ``West Side Story.'' He nailed seven triple jumps in the 
best performance of his career, capping a solid season in which he 
has not finished worse than second in four events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said when I got off the ice, I didn't care what place I got,  
it felt so good to skate that way,'' added Zivanovic, who saluted 
the crowd, throwing kisses and pumping his arms. When he reached 
the kiss-and-cry area, coach Gary Visconti placed a hat on 
Zivanovic's head and he wildly waved it in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Uplifting, one of the greatest feelings in my life,''  
Zivanovic said. ``It's a dream come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel, 18, the only American to land a quad in  
competition, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Portraying the warriors from ``Mulan,'' Weiss completed the four  
rotations on his opening quad toe loop, but couldn't hold the 
landing and hit the ice. Weiss came up determined, hitting a triple 
axel-triple toe, followed by a triple flip-triple toe. 
</P>
<P>
	He knocked off one element after another to complete his climb  
from 1994 world junior champion to king of U.S. skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredibly prestigious title to hold and being close  
to it the last couple of years, it feels great to be the champion 
of the United States,'' Weiss said. ``Now I can go out and 
celebrate and have a pizza.''

<HEADLINE> $4M Paid in Malpractice Amputation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Claudia Archer had a benign tumor on her neck.  
She had surgery to remove it, and ended up losing both her legs. 
</P>
<P>
	A domino effect of mistakes and medical consequences at military  
hospitals also left the Army specialist's wife breathing and eating 
through tubes, she claimed in a malpractice lawsuit. The government 
settled the suit in federal court Friday for $4 million, but did 
not admit fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government does not pay $4 million if there was no  
fault,'' said Gilbert Spencer, one of Mrs. Archer's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where Mrs.  
Archer's legs were amputated below the knee in 1996, did not 
immediately respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Archer, 52, first had a benign growth removed from the left  
side of her neck at an Army hospital at Fort Campbell, Ky., where 
her husband was stationed. Doctors there failed to remove all the 
tumor and it regrew, causing a variety of problems that eventually 
sent her to Walter Reed in Washington for specialty treatment, her 
suit claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at the Washington hospital, the Army's premier medical  
center, got the tumor. But operating room errors, infection, and 
other problems ensued, she claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	She checked out four months later unable to walk, breathe or eat  
normally, Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the settlement as the best way to end a difficult  
process for Mrs. Archer and her husband, Raymond, who is still in 
the Army and stationed at Fort Eustis in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a countersuit, the government claimed the couple did not  
follow doctors' instructions and brought on many medical problems 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The government ``strongly contests plaintiffs' assertion that  
there was any breach of the applicable standard of care,'' federal 
prosecutors representing the Army doctors and hospitals wrote in 
court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement signed by U.S. District Court Judge Royce  
Lamberth ends both lawsuits without a trial.

<HEADLINE> Lott Outlines Post-Trial Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top legislative priorities for Republicans in  
the post-impeachment trial Senate include a national missile 
defense system and better military pay, Majority Leader Trent Lott 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Republicans' weekly radio address, Lott predicted the  
Senate would pass a ``long overdue'' pay raise for the armed 
services within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the attention given to the trial, you might have  
missed what else has been happening here,'' said Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our most crucial initiatives deals with a missile  
defense system for the nation,'' Lott said. ``The bad news is we do 
not have one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans are determined to build a missile defense  
despite Democratic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said Congress will address the Year 2000 computer glitch  
and consider recommendations due soon from a commission studying 
how to revamp Medicare. Later this month, lawmakers plan to take up 
a GOP bill giving parents a greater say in local schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted Friday to acquit President Clinton on charges  
of perjury and obstruction of justice after a 21-day trial and 20 
hours of closed-door deliberations.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Deny Rodman Signing Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, known for his dyed hair and  
cross-dressing as well as his ferocious defense and rebounding, has 
decided to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Los Angeles Times 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's agent, Steve Chasman of International Creative  
Management, has been negotiating with the team for the past two 
weeks. Talks became sidetracked for a week while they discussed a 
possible movie deal with Fox, which holds an option to buy into the 
Lakers as a 10 percent partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's seven-time rebounding champ and the league's  
most flamboyant player, has agreed to play for the veterans' 
minimum of $1 million -- pro-rated to $600,000 for this lockout 
shortened season, sources told the Times in a story published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	He will also earn $3 million from an endorsement contract with  
Converse, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers denied the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have not signed him,'' John Black, the team's director of  
public relations, said today. ``We have nothing to report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward, the NBA's top rebounder in each of the  
last seven seasons, was laying low at his Newport Beach home before 
finally agreeing to meet with Lakers officials on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls left for Lakers spokesman John Black and Rodman's  
representatives at ICM were not returned late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement and the team's subsequent  
break-up, however, he was cut loose by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman expressed interest in playing for Orlando and Miami as  
well as Los Angeles, but he was irked by Heat coach Pat Riley's 
public insistence that he follow team rules. Magic coach Chuck 
Daly, Rodman's first pro coach at Detroit, tried to cut a deal, but 
was overruled by owner Rich DeVos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers soon became his only option.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's signing would be a boost for the Lakers, which failed  
to sign a marquee power forward to help O'Neal shoulder the 
rebounding burden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any team can use his physical ability,'' first-year Lakers  
guard Derek Harper said before the season began. ``The problem with 
Dennis is how he's going to conduct himself off the basketball 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three seasons ago he was suspended by the NBA for head-butting  
referee Ted Bernhardt. A season later he was suspended by the 
Chicago Bulls for cursing on a live postgame show and by the league 
for kicking a photographer in the crotch during a game. 
</P>
<P>
	He is regularly late for everything, from team photo sessions to  
practices. During last year's Bulls-Jazz finals series, he skipped 
practice to wrestle with Hollywood Hulk Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's arrival would cap a bizarre past two months in which  
Rodman announced he was retiring, then changed his mind and said he 
wanted to return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He also recently married longtime girlfriend Carmen Electra,  
although days later there were reports of an annulment filing. But 
in another wacky twist, the ``Hyperion Bay'' actress later denied 
the marriage was off. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the greatest rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player won seven straight rebounding titles.

<HEADLINE> Blues Acquire Rangers' Defensenmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues, plagued by injuries to  
their defense, have acquired Jeff Finley and Geoff Smith from the 
New York Rangers in return for future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley, 31, played Saturday night in St. Louis against the  
Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 29, will join the Worcester Ice Cats of the AHL, a Blues  
spokesman said Saturday. He played four games with the Rangers this 
season and had no points and two penalty minutes. He was 1-4-5 with 
10 penalty minutes in nine games with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the 
AHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley was 2-10-12 with 22 penalty minutes in 41 games with  
Hartford this season. Over his 12-year career, he is 7-42-49 with 
251 penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues defensemen Chris Pronger, Marc Bergevin and Rudy Poeshek  
are out with injuries. Pronger, who is leading the league with an 
average of 30.43 minutes played per game, suffered a bruised ankle 
after getting hit by a shot from San Jose's Jeff Norton on 
Thursday. Pronger is listed day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergevin has missed 14 games and is listed day-to-day with a  
stomach strain. Poeshek has missed seven games and is out 
indefinitely with a sprained ankle.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Still Wait at Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Stranded because of the sickout by American  
Airlines pilots, a desperate Victor Parente waited Saturday to 
catch a flight to Puerto Rico to visit his sick mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may not even make it on time,'' said the New York  
accountant, whose flight leaving Miami was delayed. ``I've been 
waiting for four hours now for them to book me on another flight, 
on another airline, anything. I can't afford to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parente was hardly alone.  
</P>
<P>
	The sickout has affected the travel plans of more than a  
half-million people. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than a week, members of the airline's pilots union have  
been calling in sick and refusing to accept overtime in a dispute 
over how quickly American should integrate pilots from recently 
purchased Reno Air into its own roster. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Saturday held the Allied Pilots Association  
and two of its board members in contempt for ignoring a 
back-to-work court order issued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Lima and wife Esther waited at Miami International  
Airport for a flight they had rebooked to San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
hoping not to miss the cruise ship they were scheduled to board 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what else we can do,'' said Lima, whose original  
Friday afternoon flight was canceled. ``I have a feeling this one 
will be canceled too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Limas flew from Los Angeles to spend a two-week vacation in  
Miami before a 7-day cruise on a Carnival Cruise Lines ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had it not been for the cruise, I wouldn't mind too much. We  
were on vacation anyway,'' Ms. Lima said. ``But what hurts is the 
$3,000 we spent on that cruise, and the cruise line is not 
responsible because we didn't book it through them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many frustrated travelers, a relaxed Felix Luble waited  
to reschedule a flight to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only going back home to visit family, so it's not really a  
big deal for me,'' Luble said. ``I can wait forever, and that's 
what I foresee.''

	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- An elevator plunged three stories at  
a hotel, sending at least three Daytona 500 fans to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people were in the elevator Friday night at the Holiday Inn  
Sunspree when it fell to the ground floor. Four people were taken 
to the hospital with head, neck or back injuries; one of them was 
not immediately identified.

	The cause of the accident was being investigated, said fire  
department spokesman Gene Stone. Hotel manager Allen Warren did not 
immediately return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That thing had been screwed up for three days and we reported  
it,'' said James Britt, a race fan from Houston who was in the 
elevator when it fell but wasn't injured. 
</P>
<P>
	A lighting fixture fell on the head of his friend Greg Miller,  
causing a deep gash in his temple.

<HEADLINE> Lawrence Phillips Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips, the former  
Nebraska and NFL running back whose troubles with the law have 
plagued his football career, was sentenced to six months probation 
stemming from a nightclub confrontation with a woman in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips had pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge  
for twice striking and threatening Michelle Black at a Plantation 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Brossard County Judge Leonard Fernier also ordered Phillips on  
Friday to pay $1,352 restitution in medical bills for Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the plea deal, Phillips does not have to report  
to a probation officer, but he can be jailed if he is arrested. He 
must pay $192 in court costs and stay away from Black. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman told police Phillips approached her and asked her to  
dance. When she declined, he allegedly said, ``Do you know who I 
am? You don't know me?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Black, 26, told police Phillips threatened to break her jaw,  
then punched her in the face. The blow chipped her front tooth and 
cut her lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson cut Phillips from the team three  
weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 23, has had several brushes with the law, most notably  
when he attended the University of Nebraska. He was arrested and 
charged with domestic violence for beating his ex-girlfriend and 
sentenced to probation. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams chose Phillips as the sixth overall pick of  
the 1996 draft, but he was arrested three times and spent 23 days 
in jail during 19 months with the team.

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek now  
have a national title to add to their world crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein and Pekarek easily won the junior ice dancing title  
Saturday with a mature and passionate free dance, earning marks 
ranging from 5.4 to 5.9. Emilie Nussear and Brandon Forsyth of 
Simsbury, Conn., who were second, had marks ranging from 5.1 to 
5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Lynn Beckerdite, of San Jose, Calif., and Matt Healy, of  
Greenville, S.C., were third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just trying to be more mature, express deeper  
emotions,'' Pekarek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein, 15, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Pekarek, 17, of  
Southfield, Mich., have had a breakthrough season after finishing 
second at junior nationals last year. They won the Junior World 
Championships in November -- the second straight American couple to 
claim the crown -- and swept the compulsory dances, the original 
dance and the free dance at nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	After their free skate, a fan tossed a small plastic album on  
the ice filled with photos of their performance at last year's 
nationals. One of the photos showed their marks -- 5.2s to 5.4s. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple said they've been inspired by five-time U.S.  
champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, who also train at 
the Detroit Skating Club. Punsalan and Swallow even took 
Silverstein and Pekarek out to dinner after they won junior worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	And who knows, there might be more celebratory dinners in the  
future. The duo hasn't decided if they'll move up to seniors next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have broader horizons now,'' Pekarek said. ``We're looking  
more toward the future now in skating. It's not just a junior 
thing. The junior worlds is a stepping stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *A FLIPPANT SENDOFF:* Dan Hollander knew he wasn't going to take  
home a medal from his last nationals, so he figured he may as well 
give the audience a show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander, who was third at nationals in 1997 and 1998, did a  
back flip with about 20 seconds left in his free skate Saturday 
afternoon. The move is illegal, but the audience loved it, letting 
out a huge roar when he landed it. When he finished his program, he 
got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my spin at the end and I could hear people  
screaming,'' Hollander said. ``I thought, `Geez, maybe I should 
have done this years ago.' It was a cool moment. It was as nice as 
'96 nationals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander, who was third at nationals in 1996 and 1997, hasn't  
been able to train as he wanted because he's been fighting a groin 
pull for the last year. He was 14th after the short program, and he 
was feeling so awful physically that he called the U.S. Figure 
Skating Association on Saturday morning and told them he was 
withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
	After a quick shower and a ride to the arena, he'd changed his  
mind and asked to be let back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I decided `No, no, this would be a really good last  
time to enjoy it and be with the audience.' Things were going OK 
and I was having a good time at the very end, so I thought, `Let's 
give this audience a really good show. At the end I thought, what 
the hell, why not?' 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking out at the audience and seeing them smile, it was by  
far worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander finished 11th.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WITHDRAWALS:* Danny Clausen, Jeff Merica and Morgan Rowe all  
withdrew before the free skates Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe, who was 13th after the women's short program withdrew  
because of an intestinal infection. Clausen, in eighth after the 
short program, pulled out because he was ill. Merica, who was 
second-to-last, didn't give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe, of Harwich, Mass., was second at the Eastern Sectionals.  
She finished 12th at nationals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clausen, 22, and Merica, 24, both won their qualifying  
competitions. Clausen, of Anchorage, Alaska, won the Upper Great 
Lakes Regionals and the Midwestern Sectionals to earn his first 
trip to senior nationals. Merica, of Annapolis, Md., was first at 
the South Atlantic Regionals and the Eastern Sectionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Merica finished 14th at last year's nationals, his first as a  
senior. He was second at the 1996 junior nationals.

bonus frequent flyer miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle and Steve Hartsell, who won their first pairs title  
Friday, and Trifun Zivanovic and Timothy Goebel, the silver and 
bronze men's medalists, were selected for the inaugural Four 
Continents Championships later this month in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose, who were third in pairs, and  
Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, who were fifth, also will go to 
Four Continents. Scott and Dulebohn were chosen over third-place 
finishers Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler, who were ineligible because 
Tiffany Stiegler is too young. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Savoie, who finished fourth, will be the other men's  
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	National champion Michael Weiss and Kyoko Ina and John  
Zimmerman, who were second in pairs, weren't selected because 
they're competing in the Grand Prix Final the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's team has Angela Nikodinov, Sarah Hughes and Erin  
Pearl, who were third through fifth at nationals. Champion Michelle 
Kwan will spend the time prearing for the world championships, and 
runner-up Naomi Nari Nam is too young for ISU senior competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Continents, which will be held Feb. 21-28 in Halifax,  
Nova Scotia, is designed as a balance to the European 
Championships. Skaters from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania 
can compete.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Told No Valentine's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Muslims in Singapore have been advised by their  
religious leaders not to celebrate Valentine's Day because of its 
non-Islamic origins, a newspaper has reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Murat Mohammed Aris, manager of the office of Singapore's mufti,  
the Asian city-state's highest-ranking Muslim clergy, was quoted in 
The Straits Times today as saying the holiday is off-limits to 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are asked to respect other religions, we should not  
imitate them,'' he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had Muslims calling us to ask if they can celebrate  
Valentine's Day, as well as feedback from a few parents saying that 
their children are celebrating it,'' Murat told The Straits Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He warned that young Muslim couples who go out for Valentine's  
Day may get caught up in the romantic mood and risk overstepping 
the bounds of Islamic morality. That could be especially true for 
unmarried couples, who are required under Islam to have a third 
party with them. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore  
advising against participation in the holiday on Sunday was 
published Friday in the Malay-language newspaper Berita Herian. 
</P>
<P>
	Malays, who are mostly Muslim, comprise 14 percent of the  
population in Chinese-majority Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Valentine was a third-century Christian priest and martyr in  
Rome who was put to death because he performed marriage ceremonies 
for Roman soldiers, who were supposed to remain single.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Go to Mexico Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials admit that Mexico still  
has a ``tremendous problem'' with drug trafficking but are praising 
its eradication efforts in advance of President Clinton's two-day 
trip there that begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's war against drug traffickers, highlighted by a new $400  
million, land-sea-and-air battle plan, tops the agenda for 
Clinton's meetings with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting will be the Yucatan Peninsula, a tourist haven where  
the two presidents and their wives will have a Valentine's evening 
dinner before Clinton and Zedillo get down to business on Monday. 
They have met seven times previously. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drugs, their agenda includes trade, migration and  
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meetings will take place against a background of a  
congressionally mandated review of Mexico's cooperation with U.S. 
counternarcotics efforts in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico could face stiff economic sanctions if it receives a  
failing grade, but all signs point to a U.S. decision to 
``certify'' Mexico as fully cooperative -- as it has been all 12 
years the process has been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking nothing for granted about Clinton's decision, however,  
Mexico declared ``total war'' against the drug chieftains Feb. 4 
through a program that specifies early detection of drug flights 
and sea shipments and a stepped-up counternarcotics role for the 
Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year plan contemplates purchases of aircraft, ships,  
radar, X-ray equipment and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Friday  
that drug control is an important part of the U.S. agenda. In the 
two years since Clinton and Zedillo established a set of common 
objectives, he said, ``We have seen Mexico extradite fugitives, 
eradicate thousands of acres of opium, criminalize money-laundering 
and institute a new screening process for law-enforcement 
officials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, obviously this is a tremendous problem for Mexico, but  
one that they are tackling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, with the certification decision just weeks away, the  
two countries announced a plan outlining joint projects against 
drug consumption, money laundering, gunrunning and narcotics 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	The review process targets about 30 countries deemed to be  
sources for drugs or through which drugs transit. Only a handful 
were decertified a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While seemingly assured a clean bill of health from Clinton,  
there were no such assurances that Mexico's expected certification 
won't be overturned by Congress, where skepticism runs deep about 
the Zedillo government's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting from an internal White House memo, The Washington Post  
reported last week that congressional opponents of certification 
want more than good-faith efforts -- ``They want results, including 
extraditions of Mexican nationals, more prosecutions of corrupt 
officials and more than paper agreements about cooperative 
law-enforcement arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a two-thirds vote, the Congress could overturn a Clinton  
certification, which officials fear could trigger a nationalist 
backlash in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The certification process is widely disliked in Mexico. ``It  
does more harm than good,'' says Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a 
Mexican academic on leave this year at the Brookings Institution. 
He said the process fuels nationalistic feelings that impair cross 
border relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Leiken, an expert on Mexico at Brookings, says Mexicans  
are baffled by the process because they believe the drug problem 
exists only because of the demand for narcotics in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiken questions whether it is realistic to assume that Mexico  
will be able to deal with narcotics traffickers, given its 
inability to cope with a steadily worsening problem of street 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin acknowledged this past  
week that the drug problem may be more than Mexico can handle 
because of the vast resources of the drug runners. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted the certification process does not take into  
account results. ``There is a difference between cooperation and 
success,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's trip to Mexico and other Central American countries,  
originally scheduled for last week, was postponed after the Senate 
set a goal of finishing the president's impeachment trial by 
Friday, when he still would have been out of the country. The 
Senate acquitted Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexico leg was rescheduled for Sunday and Monday. He will  
visit Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is a major transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments  
from South America. It is also a major producer of marijuana and a 
significant producer of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of Mexican officials visiting Washington admitted  
Wednesday that seizures of illicit narcotics have been down over 
the past year. They raised the possibility that Colombian 
narcotraffickers may be relying more on routes other than Mexico 
for their drug shipments because of increased law enforcement in 
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Scandal Has Been Test for Utah Gov. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Cautious, conservative and  
image-conscious, Republican Gov. Mike Leavitt has survived six 
years in office without a major scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the sting of Olympics corruption, which has tarnished  
reputations around the globe, has left the boy wonder of Utah 
politics relatively unscathed. ``He has been very Teflon,'' says 
former House Speaker Mel Brown. ``Nothing sticks to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not so fast: Leavitt had a close brush with Olympics tar  
last week when he abruptly dumped a sweeping telecom deregulation 
plan over allegations that US West had dangled a $5 million Olympic 
contribution for favorable treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt admits he is ``in a crisis mode'' that shows no sign of  
ending two months after the Olympics scandal broke. He figures the 
stain of corruption will linger far longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been the most demanding experience I've had in six  
years,'' Leavitt told The Associated Press. ``Everybody has them. 
You never know where they are going to come from or when they are 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, whose temper has flared at times under the pressure, is  
more than just a bystander to Olympic bribery allegations. He 
served on the secretive Salt Lake bid committee that, on the city's 
fifth try in 1995, won the right to host the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt heatedly insists he was a figurehead who attended no  
meetings. But critics say he bears at least some responsibility for 
more than $1 million in gifts, cash and favors showered on voting 
members of the International Olympic Committee and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican state Rep. Dave Ure says rumors were circulating  
three years ago of IOC ``shopping sprees'' and ``scholarships.'' 
But he acknowledges that he didn't ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt and other committee members say they were duped by bid  
executives Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, who bore the brunt of the 
blame in a voluminous report from an ethics panel working for the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Leavitt attacked the scandal in his usual manner,  
methodically. But as it blew higher, he moved faster. He made heads 
roll at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. He engineered 
organizational reforms. He recruited ``white knight'' Mitt Romney -- 
millionaire venture capitalist and one-time Senate candidate in 
Massachusetts -- as the new CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mormon and father of five, Leavitt had never run for office  
when he jumped into the 1992 race for governor and came out on top 
in a wide-open, three-way race. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 41, an insurance executive from Cedar City, the son of a  
state senator, a political insider who had worked campaigns for 
Sen. Orrin Hatch and others, banking IOUs, running a political 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a second term in a landslide and is expected to pursue a  
third next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, who turned 48 on Thursday, is in line for chairman of  
the National Governors Association and is widely seen as having 
national ambitions.

<HEADLINE> Oprah Relaxes, Avoids Quitting Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey basked in the sunshine and  
served up sexy topics for her talk show, a much-ballyhooed topic 
itself amid reports that she is planning to leave it. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfrey, who was in the Bahamas taping shows Friday, remained  
coy about the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In London last week, Winfrey was quoted by The Sunday Times as  
saying she was fed up with escalating sleaze on daytime TV talk 
shows, especially by rival host Jerry Springer, and that she 
planned to quit her show when her contract ends in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	She seemed taken aback when locals asked her about her plans and  
her criticism of Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been overblown,'' replied the queen of daytime talk. ``He  
does his show, I do mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just stay the way you are, girl!'' and ``We love you, Oprah!''  
the audience shouted in response. 
</P>
<P>
	The island shows, to begin airing Monday, will give U.S. viewers  
a splash of Bahamas culture, as well as topics including ``Sexiest 
Island Man Contest'' and ``Victoria's Secret Swim Fashions.''

<HEADLINE> Kerr Adapts to Life After Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Steve Kerr returns to Chicago Sunday, the  
first of the ex-Bulls to come back to the arena that was home to 
the greatest professional sports dynasty of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Is he looking forward to it?  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, but only because he'll be able to see his wife and kids.  
</P>
<P>
	Is he enjoying his new life with the San Antonio Spurs? It  
doesn't seem that way. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Kerr is a worker bee for a team that has no buzz, a  
far cry from his past three years when he was a part of a truly 
special team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't miss the circus, but I miss my buddies from that  
team,'' Kerr said Friday night. ``We had a great bunch of guys, we 
were together five years and we had a lot of fun together, so I 
miss that. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I miss going into an arena and sensing the crowd's  
anticipation when we ran out on the floor. With us, it was always a 
special night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs' game against the Bulls will mark the final stop of a  
four-game, six-night road trip that has included two losses and one 
victory Defeats at the hands of Minnesota and Cleveland were 
followed by a 98-94 victory over Philadelphia Friday night when 
Kerr shot 1-for-4 from the field and scored six points. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, the NBA's career leader in 3-point field goal percentage,  
has struggled during the Spurs' first six games, shooting 3-for-13 
from long range. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is we don't have practice anymore, so it's been  
hard to get a feel for the team, the league and how everything is 
stacking up,'' Kerr said. ``It's a crazy season, and I probably 
won't have a real feel for it until it's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, one of several ex-Bulls strewn around the league, has not  
been in contact with any of his former teammates who remain in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The process of getting to know his new teammates has been slow,  
and Kerr -- despite having a new five-year, $11 million contract -- 
does not carry the look of a man who is having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm dead tired, exhausted,'' he said. ``I haven't seen my  
family for three weeks, I'm living in a hotel in San Antonio. So 
I'm not happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it has nothing to do with the team. Once I'm settled into  
a house and get my family down there and get some serious sleep, 
I'll be all right. I'll be happy. It's just been a rough few 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr continues to maintain that the breakup of the Bulls was a  
good thing. He had a front-row seat for the closed-door bickering, 
jealousy and distrust that existed between Bulls management and the 
team, and he viewed the dismantling as more of a fait accompli than 
a two-day disassembling of a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the best way to go out: Win the title and move on, the  
perfect way to end it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wouldn't it have been better to keep the nucleus intact, albeit  
without Michael Jordan, and try to build around that, as some have 
said? 
</P>
<P>
	``If they kept us all around, we would have been a good team,  
but a championship team? No,'' Kerr said. ``We wouldn't have won a 
championship without Michael.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what about the apparent flaws in general manager Jerry  
Krause's rebuilding plan? The Bulls will have about $20 million in 
salary cap room, but many of next summer's possible free agents 
already have re-signed with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr owes a debt of gratitude to Krause for engineering the  
sign-and-trade deal that provided him with such a lucrative 
contract, so he's quicker than most to defend the GM. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cap room he has gives him flexibility for other reasons  
than free agents,'' Kerr said. ``You can make trades and fit guys 
in (under the cap), plus the Bulls might have the No. 1 pick in the 
draft. I know the main guys have signed, and that's something they 
weren't planning on, but they'll have other options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Kerr's options on the court, they mostly revolve around  
waiting on the perimeter to see if David Robinson or Tim Duncan 
will pass out of a double team. That leaves him standing around 
than he was used to in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to get used to what we do,'' coach Gregg Popovich said.  
``He's a smart player and he'll pick it up quickly. In Chicago, 
there was so much movement, and the rest of us in the NBA have so 
little movement. So it's a lot of change and it'll take time for 
him to come around. But he's a big part of our plans if we're going 
to get where we want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a place where Kerr already has been -- on a championship  
team where every night was prime time. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans in Chicago will be reminded of those days when Kerr,  
who hit the title-clinching shot in Game 6 of the 1997 NBA Finals, 
steps back on the United Center floor Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it was coming to an end, so it's not a shock,'' Kerr  
said. ``It's going to be weird. It's going to be strange playing in 
that building and wearing a different uniform.''

<HEADLINE> Crabbers Hit by Oregon Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Though the decision to burn a grounded  
cargo ship kept thousands of gallons of oil off ocean beaches, 
oyster growers are angry that even the little oil flowing toward 
sheltered tidal flats threatens $10 million worth of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is prime oyster growing ground,'' said Lilli Clausen, who  
with her husband, Max, has been growing oysters in Coos Bay since 
1980 and ships them around the world. ``Whoever made the oil spill 
response didn't consider oysters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tarballs and a light sheen of oil from the grounded cargo ship  
have flowed about five miles into Coos Bay, prompting the state's 
agriculture department on Friday to shut down harvests at the four 
oyster farms there. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will test to see if the shellfish have been  
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion is that with the light amount of oil coming, in  
they will survive,'' said John Johnson, shellfish biologist with 
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Recreational shellfishing has also been banned in the area and  
crab fishermen have been unable to pull pots in an area around the 
grounded ship closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't want to take any risk of oiled shellfish getting  
out to the public,'' said Deb Cannon of the Oregon Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill came just as oyster farmers were preparing to set out  
new oysters for the next generation. Clausen lets her oysters grow 
three years before harvesting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot Japanese-owned cargo ship New Carissa ran aground  
on the beach a mile north of the entrance to Coos Bay on Feb. 4 and 
last Monday began leaking oil from its fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with the threat of the ship breaking up in stormy weather  
and spilling nearly 400,000 gallons of tarlike bunker fuel oil on 
southern Oregon beaches, authorities came up with a bold plan to 
crack open the ship's fuel tanks with explosives and set the fuel 
on fire with napalm. 
</P>
<P>
	With a fiery explosion Thursday night, the fuel was ignited and  
during the blaze the ship broke apart, spilling more oil. 
Authorities have estimated at least two-thirds of the fuel has 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship fire, which was briefly reignited Saturday after  
burning out overnight, was out again Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 10 percent of the fuel is believed to have leaked out  
since cracks developed in the fuel tanks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 25 dead birds have been recovered, 11 of them oiled.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It'll be a real treat for David Arquette to  
walk around in platform shoes as a transvestite. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a guy, you don't get to walk around in fishnets and panties  
very often,'' says the ``Scream'' star, speaking of his upcoming 
gig in a Los Angeles stage production of ``The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cross-dressing is a mild adventure compared to a theme in his  
upcoming movie ``Ravenous'' -- cannibalism.

grubbing. It gets a little creepy,'' Arquette says in the March 
issue of Cosmopolitan. 
</P>

	In real life, the actor has comfortably slipped into the role of  
a man in love -- by getting down on his knee on a Florida beach and 
proposing to actress Courtney Cox.

<HEADLINE> Ken Starr's Investigation Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeachment is over, but Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr is not finished. There are presidential friends to be 
tried, a leaks case to resolve and a momentous decision: whether to 
indict President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	And when all that is done, Starr will have to tie together in a  
single report an investigation that has covered everything from 
Vincent Foster's suicide and the Whitewater land deal to the FBI 
files matter and, of course, the Monica Lewinsky saga. 
</P>
<P>
	It remains a mystery just when the prosecutor will end an  
investigation that Americans long since have tired of. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is Starr running an investigation that will continue into  
perpetuity or is there a strategy here for an end-game?'' former 
Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen asked. ``If it's in perpetuity, 
that's an unacceptable scenario given eroding public confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are complications for Starr.  
</P>
<P>
	He not only is investigating, but also being investigated. A  
federal judge is trying to determine if his office violated grand 
jury secrecy laws, and the Justice Department informed him last 
month it intends to investigate his handling of the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could turn into a Dunkirk situation with no ships on the  
horizon to rescue the troops in Starr's office,'' said Gillen, who 
helped close out Lawrence Walsh's six-year Iran-Contra criminal 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Starr's deputies have begun to think about work  
elsewhere. Still, his office has vowed to press ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest decision for Starr is whether to indict Clinton for  
perjury in the Paula Jones case and before Starr's grand jury and 
for obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky case. The Senate on 
Friday refused to convict Clinton on charges of perjury and 
obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal sources say the prosecutor concluded some time ago he  
could indict a sitting president. With impeachment at an end, the 
question now is whether Starr will seek a grand jury indictment 
before Clinton leaves office, wait until his term ends or drop the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	He got some unsolicited advice Friday from the man who led the  
prosecution of Clinton's case before the Senate and lost. ``I think 
for the good of the country, probably forget it,'' said House 
Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	First up, however, is the obstruction case against the Clintons'  
former Whitewater business partner, Susan McDougal, who goes on 
trial March 8 in Little Rock, Ark., for refusing to cooperate with 
Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor have wanted to know from Mrs. McDougal whether  
the president had a connection to a fraudulent $300,000 loan that 
she never repaid. Clinton has testified he knew nothing about the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr also has two prosecutions pending against long-time  
presidential buddy Webster Hubbell, who has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, Hubbell is accused of concealing his and Hillary  
Rodham Clinton's roles in a fraudulent 1980s Arkansas land 
development owned by Mrs. McDougal's late ex-husband, James 
McDougal. Mrs. Clinton, who worked at an Arkansas law firm with 
Hubbell, says she doesn't recall what work she did on the 
development. Hubbell's father-in-law, retired Little Rock 
businessman Seth Ward, got $300,000 from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell also faces tax evasion charges on hundreds of thousands  
of dollars in income, some of it arranged by friends of the 
president in 1994 when Hubbell was under investigation by Starr's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge originally dismissed those charges on grounds that Starr  
exceeded his authority, but a federal appeals court reinstated the 
case recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacking the records to make a case against the Clintons  
concerning their Arkansas business dealing, Starr has tried for 
years to gain information from Hubbell and Mrs. McDougal, but they 
seem more unlikely than ever to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal served 18 months in prison rather than answer  
Starr's questions last time around. And Hubbell insists he has 
already supplied Starr with all the information on the Clintons 
that he possesses -- and does not believe the Clintons did anything 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Lewinsky front, the independent counsel is still delving  
into whether Clinton committed perjury when he denied making an 
unwanted sexual advance toward former White House volunteer 
Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office will put a former Willey friend, Julie Hiatt  
Steele, on trial March 30 in Alexandria, Va., on charges of 
obstruction and lying. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is also trying to wrap up work on two other areas:  
</P>
<P>
	--The probe of whether presidential aides lied about Mrs.  
Clinton's role in the 1993 firings of the White House travel 
office. The first lady has denied under oath that she ordered the 
purge, but a memo that surfaced in the White House in 1996 says she 
was behind the dismissals. 
</P>
<P>
	--The investigation into whether anyone lied in the White House's  
gathering of hundreds of FBI background files on appointees from 
prior administrations. The prosecutor says he has no evidence the 
files were used for an improper purpose, but that there are 
unspecified ``outstanding issues'' regarding one person he refuses 
to identify.

<HEADLINE> Another Big Result for Forsyth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Chalk up another big result for Canada's  
Allison Forsyth. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1968, when Nancy Greene won a silver medal, has a  
Canadian woman had a better result in an Olympic or World 
Championship slalom than Forsyth's 10th place on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, the World Cup's first women's overall champion, retired  
in 1968, 10 years before Forsyth was born. Yet her fame is such 
that youngsters recall her feats decades later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really admire her, of course. She did some amazing things in  
ski racing,'' Forsyth said. ``I'm really in shock right now. A top 
10 is unheard of. ... I feel really lucky to follow in her 
footsteps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsyth wasn't expected to have much impact on the World Alpine  
Ski Championships, since she's a rookie in World Cup skiing. A 16th 
in the giant slalom on Thursday was a pleasant surprise, but it 
turned out she had even more to offer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy with my GS, but I knew that my week wasn't  
over and I couldn't relax because I still had an important event to 
go,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She served notice in the first run when, despite starting 39th,  
she placed 11th, only .49 seconds behind leader Trine Bakke of 
Norway. Her final time of 1 minute, 35.59 seconds was 1.63 back of 
gold medalist Zali Steggall of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd definitely say my first run was better. It was more solid  
and consistent top to bottom,'' Forsyth said. ``On the second, I 
had an excellent top section. Coming onto the bottom, I made an 
error and I didn't ski too well on the pitch. I was a little 
nervous and holding back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top American finisher was Alexandra Shaffer of Aspen, Colo.,  
15th in 1:36.14. That hardly made up for the loss of medal favorite 
Kristina Koznick of Burnsville, Minn., who skied off the course 
early in the first run. Caroline Lalive of Steamboat Springs, 
Colo., also failed to finish and Tasha Nelson of Mound, Minn., 
didn't start the second run after requiring treatment for the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's other starters, Britt Janyk and Genevieve Simard, also  
failed to finish two runs. 
</P>
<P>
	A top-10 finish proved to Forsyth what she'd already come to  
believe: that she could ski with the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought a lot last night what attitude those girls probably  
have,'' she said. ``The attitude I believe they take is that this 
is easy. They've done this before, they've done this so many times 
that they know how to approach the racing. So I wanted to come out 
here today with that attitude. I wanted to make it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really love having a lot of people around cheering me on. I  
always perform better when people are watching. It's big events I 
always do well at. As for the maturity, you have to take every 
aspect you can, to learn from every opportunity that happens to you 
in ski racing. I've learned from my good races and I've learned 
from my bad races, and I think I've pretty much learned how to put 
a good race together.''

	Judge To Rule on Pilots' Sickout  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines and its disgruntled pilots will  
be back in court today as the airline tries to get the pilots back 
to work. American wants a judge to hold the Allied Pilots 
Association in contempt and slap it with fines because pilots are 
ignoring a back-to-work order. The judge says he will rule on the 
request today. Meanwhile, American, the nation's second-largest 
airline, has canceled flights into next Tuesday, meaning several 
thousand passengers will be stranded for the long Presidents Day 
weekend.

	Saudis May Broker Lockerbie Deal  
</P>
<P>
	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia said today that a deal  
to secure the handover of two Libyan suspects for trial in the 1988 
bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, was almost 
complete. The dispute that remains is where the suspects -- Abdel 
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- would serve jail 
sentences if convicted by Scottish judges sitting in a special 
court in the Netherlands. Britain and the United States insist the 
men be jailed in Scotland. The bombing killed 270 people, mainly 
Britons and Americans.

	Bin Laden May Have Left Afghanistan

<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, the Saudi  
millionaire accused by the United States of plotting bomb attacks 
on two U.S. embassies in Africa, has left Afghanistan, Afghan 
sources said today. His whereabouts are not known. The report comes 
just days after the Taliban religious army, which rules most of 
Afghanistan, took away bin Laden's satellite telephone and banned 
him from speaking to the media. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has 
offered asylum to bin Laden.

	Washington Says: Let's Move On  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is campaigning for better  
relations with Congress and the nation after his acquittal by the 
Senate. ``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and 
renewal for America,'' Clinton said. Republicans, battered by the 
defeat, agreed. ``Let's move on. He won,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, 
R-N.H., who twice voted to convict the president and remove him 
from office. One matter that remains unresolved, however, is 
whether Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will indict Clinton on 
perjury and obstruction of justice charges after Clinton finishes 
his term in 2001.

	Albright Coming to Kosovo Talks

<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
is flying to France today to assess the Kosovo peace talks between 
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. With almost all the major issues 
unresolved, the two adversaries in the Kosovo conflict who came 
together a week ago to find a way to stop the fighting in the Serb 
province still haven't found it. Chief mediator Christopher Hill 
described the negotiations as ``a very difficult process ... we are 
going to have to make a lot of progress in the days ahead.''

	Pakistan, India Mull Nuclear Issue  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Lawmakers from Pakistan and India  
said today that bold initiatives were necessary to end 51 years of 
bitterness and hostility between the world's newest nuclear powers. 
Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto urged the two countries to 
sign the global nuclear test ban treaty and resist the development, 
testing and storage of ballistic weapons. The legislators of the 
two countries said misunderstandings and mistrust have soured 
relations between the neighboring countries. Pakistan and India 
have fought three wars since British rule of the subcontinent ended 
in 1947.

possessions will be sold next week in an auction designed to raise 
money to pay a $33.5 million award in the wrongful death suit 
against him. The most noteworthy piece is Simpson's 1968 Heisman 
Trophy. But possible bidders said they felt ``sad'' to take away 
the award. Another says he feels like he's paying a ransom. The 
items were seized from Simpson's home at the behest of lawyers 
representing the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.

<HEADLINE> Kate Hudson Always Compared to Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) ---- Kate Hudson, blond and perky, is resigned to  
being compared to her blond and perky mother, Goldie Hawn.	
</P>
<P>
	``I get either 'She's so cute, she's just like her mom' or  
`She's trying to be like her mom' or `You're nothing like your 
mom.' So I let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hudson, who got her start on the television show ``Party of  
Five,'' is fast on her way to carving her own career. Her first big 
movie, ``200 Cigarettes,'' opens Feb. 26, and her next, ``Desert 
Blue,'' soon follows. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudson was raised by Hawn and Kurt Russell, Hawn's longtime  
live-in lover. Her father is Bill Hudson of the '70s TV comedy 
troupe the Hudson Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	And how does the 19-year-old see herself?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the cool, hard, independent-movie chick. I'm very  
Betty Crocker,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Report: Chiefs QB Signed by Raiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Quarterback Rich Gannon, a backup for  
most of his four seasons with Kansas City, has signed with the 
Oakland Raiders, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the contract were not available, but it is believed  
to be in the range of $16 million for four years, the San Francisco 
Examiner reported Sunday, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Raiders spokesman Mike Taylor not Gannon's agent, Ken  
Kremer, returned phone calls from The Associated Press seeking 
comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders lost Jeff George, their starter the last two  
seasons, on Thursday after he activated a ``void'' clause in his 
contract and became an unrestricted free agent. The team has two 
other quarterbacks under contract -- journeyman Andre Ware and Pat 
Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannon, an 11-year veteran, became a fan favorite in four season  
with Chiefs. He mostly backed up Steve Bono and Elvis Grbac. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Gannon appeared in 12 games, completing 206 of 354  
passes (58.2 percent) for 2,304 yards with 10 touchdowns and six 
interceptions. He also has logged stints in Minnesota (1987-92) and 
Washington (1993). 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Rams also expressed interest in Gannon, 33.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Seeks 5th Medal in Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Four down, one to go for Norwegian ace Lasse  
Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	Having won medals in the first four events of the World Alpine  
Ski Championships to equal a record, Kjus will seek an 
unprecedented fifth medal in the men's slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before every race, I always think I can win,'' Kjus said after  
winning Friday's giant slalom. ``But I'm a bit surprised that 
everything fell so well in place for me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bearded, balding Norwegian, who now owns two gold and two  
silver medals, fashioned the quickest second run to overtake 
Liechtenstein's Marco Buechel, the surprise leader of the first 
run. Kjus' victory margin was a mere .05 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, also benefited from mistakes by four other medal  
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel settled for the silver medal in the best finish of his  
career, and Switzerland's Steve Locher captured the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	In capturing his fourth medal, Kjus matched the record of  
Switzerland's peerless Pirmin Zurbriggen in the 1987 world 
championships in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Both skiers, 
amazingly, won the giant slalom and super-G and finished second in 
the downhill and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he ever imagined winning four medals, Kjus said,  
``Nobody can believe four medals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, the 1996 World Cup overall champion who also leads this  
season's overall standings, trailed Buechel by .25 seconds after 
the first run but forged a second run of 1 minute, 7.75 seconds for 
a combined time of 2:19.31. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel was faster than Kjus early in his second heat, but lost  
time in the middle and bottom sections. He was timed in 1:08.05 -- 
the second-fastest of the afternoon runs, but not fast enough to 
hold off Kjus. Buechel's combined time was 2:19.36. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is amazing, unbelievable,'' Kjus said. ``I knew if I  
wanted a medal, I had to ski aggressively. With a good first run, 
it is easy to be satisfied, to try to save your position in the 
second run. But today I managed to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my greatest victory ever, I think. I enjoy giant  
slalom the most. That's where I think the competition is the 
hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buechel said he was nervous between runs ``but I didn't freak  
out. This was brand new for me. I had never been in the top three 
after the first run. I knew the other guys were really fast. If I 
go 100 percent (in the second run), I can make something. If I 
don't go 100 percent, I watch the others step on the podium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Locher, in fifth place after the initial run, finished in  
2:20.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Fredrik Nyberg and Switzerland's Paul Accola tied for  
fourth in 2:21.14. Italy's Patrick Holzer was sixth in 2:21.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland's Michael Von Gruenigen, who leads the World Cup  
giant slalom standings and is the defending world champion in GS, 
couldn't overcome a ninth-place finish in the first run and was 
seventh overall in 2:21.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria, which has dominated these championships, had its worst  
showing in eight races. Christian Mayer was Austria's top finisher, 
placing eighth in 2:21.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being shut out, Austria retained its lead in medals with  
12. Runnerup Norway has seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., was the top American, finishing  
18th in 2:23.13. Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, was 24th, in 
2:24.23, one spot ahead of Canada's Thomas Grandi, in 2:24.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann Maier of Austria, seeking his third gold medal in these  
championships, was one of three medal contenders who failed to 
finish the second run. He and Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt both 
lost edges on Pepi's Face, the final steep slope before the finish. 
Austrian rookie Benjamin Raich lost an edge and missed a gate early 
in the run. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the steep, I got on my boot,'' said Maier, explaining that  
the side of his boot hit the snow, disengaging his ski. ``I was 
risking full. When I came into the pitch down here, I was maybe too 
aggressive. But I'm very happy. The downhill gold was the one I 
wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephan Eberharter of Austria, another favorite, skied into soft  
snow and skidded wide of a gate, failing to finish the first run.

<HEADLINE> New Bears Head Says Team Will Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- New Chicago Bears President Ted Phillips says the  
team is no longer interested in looking for a new home outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he wants to negotiate a new Soldier Field lease, then  
find a permanent stadium site in the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are 100 percent committed to the city of Chicago,''  
Phillips told the Chicago Tribune in an interview published 
Saturday 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's ready to meet with Mayor Richard M. Daley, whom he  
has never met. The commitment is intended to stimulate talks to 
renew the Soldier Field lease, which expires after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to add a fresh perspective to the stadium situation and  
get past the lack of trust we've had in the past,'' said Phillips, 
who was the lead stadium negotiator under former Bears president 
Michael McCaskey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mayor wants the Bears to stay in the city of Chicago. We  
want to stay in the city of Chicago. Let's not make it any more 
complicated than it is,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who replaced McCaskey last week, said he wants to  
develop a clearly defined management structure for the team and 
said he would not intervene in football decisions.

<HEADLINE> Polls Back Clinton's Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans agree with senators who voted to  
acquit President Clinton of impeachment charges, but they give the 
Senate low marks for its handling of the trial, polls released 
Saturday indicate. 
</P>
<P>
	A CBS News poll conducted after the vote Friday indicated 64  
percent of the public supported acquittal, while 34 percent thought 
Clinton should have been convicted on charges of perjury and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stemmed from his relationship with Monica Lewinsky,  
a former White House intern, and efforts to conceal their affair. 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC News poll taken Friday showed 60 percent of the public  
supported the Senate verdict, while an NBC poll on Saturday found 
56 percent supported the Senate vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those polled for ABC, 71 percent said the Senate vote was  
based on partisan politics. When asked the same question about the 
House vote to impeach in December, 61 percent said that vote was 
purely partisan. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of censuring the president did not draw much support,  
several polls found. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NBC survey, only 28 percent of those polled supported  
censure, while 56 percent said the Senate should just move on. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's poll indicated 54 percent said the Senate should ``drop  
the case without censuring Clinton,'' and 44 percent favored 
censure. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CBS poll, 56 percent disapproved of the Senate's handling  
of the trial and 62 percent said the country would have been better 
off if the Lewinsky investigation never had started. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Newsweek poll, 74 percent of the respondents said the  
Republicans should not make an issue of the way Clinton and the

<HEADLINE> Cleveland's 49er Connection Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- The NFL's newest team is already being called  
the Cleveland 49ers, and for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine players on the new Browns' roster have San Francisco  
connections, and former 49ers president Carmen Policy and director 
of football operations Dwight Clark now run the show in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Irv Smith is one of the Browns' arrivals via the  
California-to-Cleveland pipeline, and he doesn't think he'll be the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't surprise me,'' said Smith, a tight end acquired in  
a trade along with defensive end Roy Barker from the 49ers on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Policy, and then Clark left the 49ers for Cleveland, Smith  
said many of San Francisco's players often thought of doing the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times where in the hot tubs, in the sauna, you're  
just hanging out being guys and you're talking,'' Smith said 
Saturday. ``And you're talking about down the road. I can't tell 
you how many ears and how many lips I heard it from, but I do know 
there are quite a few guys who had their eyeballs pointed like, 
`You know what? That would be a great place to play.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has yet to dip into its nearly $40 million reserve for  
free agents, but could add another 49er in wide receiver J.J. 
Stokes. Stokes is one of the premier unrestricted free agents on 
the market, and is known to be high on the Browns' wish list. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's comfort with working under both Policy and Clark was the  
biggest reason he asked his agent to work out a deal -- for one year 
-- with the Browns, and he knows that should give the Browns an 
inside advantage in luring Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's going to demand a lot of attention from a lot of  
teams,'' said Smith, 27. ``Who knows. But I know if Cleveland puts 
its best foot forward, they can probably get him. He believes in 
what Carmen Policy believes in and because of that I think they 
have a good opportunity. There are some teams who won't have an 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith spent one season with the 49ers after leaving the New  
Orleans Saints a year ago as a free agent. The Browns got Smith and 
Barker from the 49ers for taking cornerback Antonio Langham and his 
huge contract in Tuesday's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Ty Detmer was also included in an initial deal  
between the clubs, but Detmer's refusal to waive the no-trade 
clause in his contract kept him in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	While Smith met the Cleveland media on Saturday, Clark was  
upstairs on a conference call and was unavailable to comment on the 
trade or about Buffalo linebacker Chris Spielman's situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Spielman, who hasn't played in 1 1/2 years, worked out and had a  
physical for the Browns on Friday. Spielman sat out last season 
with the Bills to be with his wife, Stephanie, as she recovered 
from breast cancer surgery. In 1997, he had neck surgery in the 
middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Browns met for a second day with New England center  
Dave Wohlbaugh. Wohlbaugh went to dinner with coach Chris Palmer on 
Friday, but has not yet been signed by Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	A former first-round draft pick from Notre Dame, Smith caught 25  
passes for 266 yards and five TDs last season. Not bad numbers for 
a tight end, especially one competing with Jerry Rice, Stokes and 
Terrell Owens for quarterback Steve Young's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith thinks his numbers can get better, and he takes as much  
pride in delivering a pancake block on a linebacker as making a 
diving catch near the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's time to block, I can block as good as the best of  
them,'' he said. ``And when I catch the ball, I can run with it 
after I catch it. My career high is 45 balls and I think I can blow 
that out of the water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's hard work in the trenches didn't go unnoticed last  
season. After he was selected to the Pro Bowl, running back 
Garrison Hearst rewarded his offensive lineman -- and Smith -- with 
Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed me something the coaches didn't,'' said Smith.  
``Some appreciation.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Grateful for Trial's End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- When Bill Clinton left Little Rock for  
Washington six years ago, he went with the blessings of Arkansans 
he had served as governor for nearly a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that he had been unfaithful to first lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton never seemed to bother voters, who elected him five times 
between 1978 and 1990 -- three times giving him more than 62 percent 
of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monica Lewinsky affair didn't surprise many of these voters.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he was a woman-chaser before all of this. He was  
governor here for so many years,'' said David Miller, who runs a 
Hot Springs novelty store. ``He shouldn't have done what he did. 
But he shouldn't be impeached for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is the kind of man who divides friends and families.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Prescott and Monte Green, both of Little Rock, shared a  
table at the Flying Saucer restaurant near the site of the proposed 
Clinton presidential library. Their views were typical: 
</P>
<P>
	``What the president did was in private. He lied initially to  
protect his family. I think he is doing a hell of a job. I want him 
to stay in office,'' Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Green called Clinton ``one of the most immoral men alive.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he will be remembered for this impeachment process. He  
will be remembered as a slick politician,'' he said. ``He is in a 
very public office. I think his private life is public. We don't 
need an immoral man making public policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Clinton enjoyed big numbers at re-election time, it  
didn't trickle down to Democrats he left behind. When Clinton won 
his second term as president in 1996, Arkansas also elected its 
first Republican U.S. senator ever, Sen. Tim Hutchinson, who voted 
to convict on both impeachment articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians expect little fallout for the state, given that  
Clinton's problems were of his own making. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defining characteristic of Bill Clinton is not that he is  
a Southerner. It is that he is a cad,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior 
fellow at the Brookings Institution at Washington, D.C. ``All 
Southerners aren't cads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Clinton's affair was good for anyone in Arkansas, it was the  
backers of the Clinton presidential library to be built in downtown 
Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Impeachment) is going to make this one of the most studied  
presidencies of all time,'' said Skip Rutherford, president of the 
library foundation. ``What I think is whether you are pro-Clinton 
or anti-Clinton, this is a very historical time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rutherford said the library will balance the impeachment saga  
with issues that speak well of Clinton's presidency, such as the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says, `Aw, this is going to taint his legacy,'''  
Rutherford said. ``I'm not so sure about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If there was any universal sentiment in Arkansas on Friday, it  
was relief at the trial's end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over. I think it's gone on way too long,'' said  
Phyllis Howard of Texarkana, sitting in the lobby of the Excelsior 
Hotel, where the case began. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewinsky investigation grew out of a lawsuit filed by former  
state worker Paula Jones, who claimed Clinton propositioned her in 
the hotel in 1991, when he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
	When Friday's votes were taken, the hotel bar's television was  
off.

	Albright Joins Kosovo Talks  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ready to talk but not bargain, Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright flew in today to join faltering Kosovo 
negotiations with a take-it-or-leave-it proposition to rival Serbs 
and ethnic Albanians. The warring sides are studying a six-nation 
plan to end their conflict in the Serbian province and ``she is 
going to deliver very clear and straightforward messages to both 
parties that it is time to get down to the business of making the 
tough decisions,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 

</P>
<P>
	Marines Would Enter Kosovo Quickly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Marines could enter Kosovo within 10 days  
of reaching a peace agreement in the war-torn province, a senior 
U.S. defense official said today. Officials provided details of 
military planning for a peacekeeping operation after President 
Clinton announced today that the United States would contribute 
about 4,000 troops if warring parties reached a solid agreement. 
Those troops would represent about 14 percent of a projected total 
NATO peacekeeping force of 28,000, a senior defense official said.

	Pilots' Union Held in Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge today held  
American Airlines' pilots union and two top board members in 
contempt and promised sizable fines against them, saying the union 
did not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after a 
court order. More than half a million travelers have been left at 
the gate by the nation's second-largest airline because of the 
large number of pilots calling in sick. Although a judge had 
ordered the pilots Wednesday to quit their job action stemming from 
a dispute with management, about 1,700 of the airline's 9,400 
pilots remained on the sick list this afternoon.

	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland  
will be formally admitted to NATO at a March 12 ceremony in 
Independence, Mo., U.S. officials said today. The ceremony will be 
held at the Harry S. Truman Library, where President Truman 
announced the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
in 1949 to defend western Europe against Soviet expansionism.

	Moderate Republicans Focus on 2000  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, fresh from voting for the  
Republicans' failed effort to convict President Clinton on 
impeachment articles, told a gathering of party moderates Saturday 
that the GOP must move on to important issues. ``The Senate now 
wants to move forward with education and issues that are on 
everyone's priority list,'' said the Arizona Republican. McCain was 
scheduled to be the keynote speaker tonight at the Republican 
Leadership Council's winter meeting. The group is an organization 
of moderate Republicans. Its leaders called for the party to forget 
about President Clinton and start concentrating on the 2000 
elections.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Osama bin Laden, a suspect in the  
bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa, has ``disappeared'' from 
his base in Afghanistan, a Taliban militia spokesman said today. 
Other Afghan sources said he left the country. The Saudi 
millionaire dropped out of sight two days ago, the source said. The 
Taliban spokesman wouldn't say whether bin Laden left the country.

her blood-splattered clothes to reporters, saying police targeted 
her and her colleagues intentionally and injured several people.

villages. The Hungarian, Slovak and Czech armies were all sent to 
help clear blocked roads and assist in rescues. Fourteen people

police said. Temperatures remained well below freezing today, with 
two feet of snow accumulated.

round of the Buick Invitational today, his lowest round as a pro 
and a course record at Torrey Pines South. Woods jumped from nine 
shots back to a one-shot lead over Billy Ray Brown. Playing a 
course he knows well from his junior golf days, Woods was at 
15-under 201 and in position for just his second victory in his 
last 32 PGA starts.

<HEADLINE> Six Bodies Found in Okla. Apartment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Edwin Bell didn't leave a note behind to  
explain his suicide or why he took the lives of his mother, his 
estranged girlfriend and their three young children, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims of Friday's bloody rampage at an apartment were  
identified as Bell's mother, Linda Farris, 45; Markita King, 21; 
and Ebony, 4, Essyce, 2, and 8-month-old Marjonna Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Andy Phillips said Ms. King had moved to Tulsa from  
Oklahoma City, apparently ``to get away'' from Bell. He and his 
mother were in Tulsa to visit the children, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadler Farris, Bell's stepfather, told Oklahoma City television  
station KOCO-TV that his stepson was abusive to Ms. King. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) I never suspected he would kill her nor anyone for that  
matter,'' Farris said. ``Most certainly not his mother. That's the 
most shocking part of all to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the victims appeared to have been shot with a 9mm handgun,  
and it did not appear that there was a struggle or that anyone 
tried to flee the room, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they felt certain it was a murder-suicide  
because of the way the gun was positioned near Bell's body. 
</P>
<P>
	Several relatives arrived on the scene sobbing and wailing.  
Curious neighbors looked on as investigators moved in and out of 
the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hunter, a 43-year-old father of five, shook his head  
sadly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ain't nothing in the world bad enough to make you want  
to do something that bad to your kids,'' he said. ``To anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the deaths were the largest mass killing attributed  
to one person in city history.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Steggall Wins Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Australia's Zali Steggall forged a blistering  
second run to vault from sixth place and capture the women's slalom 
Saturday in the World Alpine Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Steggall, only .13 seconds off the pace following a tightly  
bunched first run, nailed the bottom half of her second run and had 
a combined time of 1 minute, 33.97 seconds -- an impressive .80 
seconds ahead of Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Trine Bakke, the first-run leader, took the bronze  
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Steggall, who became the first Australian woman to win a World  
Cup race in November 1997 and who won the bronze medal in slalom in 
the 1998 Olympics, prevailed in a second-run free-for-all that saw 
the top 10 racers separated by only .28 seconds after the first 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, tied with Steggall after a 46.44-second first run, moved  
into the lead with a solid 48.33 clocking for a total of 1:34.77. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Steggall, skiing next, was .31 seconds slower  
than Wiberg through the first intermediate clocking but was fast 
and flawless through the bottom half and was timed in 47.53. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty amazed when I crossed the finish line,'' Steggall  
said. ``I had heard a huge cheer for Pernilla when I was standing 
in the start and I said, `Well, OK, she's done it again, a good 
second run.' So I said, `Well, I better do it, too.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that I didn't have a chance in the top part because  
it's really not my cup of tea,'' Steggall said. ``I was just 
waiting to get over that last pitch, because that was where I was 
going to be able to make it up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually heard (via the public address system) that I was  
behind,'' Steggall said. ``I knew that I really had to nail the 
steep and just risk, keep that speed moving down the hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Australia's first gold medal in world championship  
history and its first medal of any kind since Malcolm Milne won 
bronze in downhill in the 1970 worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakke struggled late in her run, and her 48.69 time gave her a  
combined 1:35.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never experienced a race that was this close,'' Wiberg  
said of the first run in which 20 skiers were within one second of 
the lead. ``I'll have to be satisfied with the silver today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she didn't maintain her first-run lead, Bakke insisted  
that she ``won'' a bronze medal. ``I've only been on the podium 
twice before, so I'm very happy with making it onto the podium 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Andrine Flemmen, silver medalist in giant slalom on  
Thursday, charged from 13th place after the first run to finish 
fourth in 1:35.06. She had the second-fastest second run of 48.17. 
</P>
<P>
	Finland's Riitta Pitkanen was fifth in 1:35.12, followed by  
Austria's Karin Koellerer in 1:35.22 and Slovenia's Urska Hrovat in 
1:35.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Deborah Compagnoni, the defending world champion in  
slalom, finished a disappointing eighth in 1:35.33. Compagnoni 
trailed Bakke by only .04 seconds in the first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Anita Wachter was ninth in 1:35.34, and Canada's  
Allison Forsyth took 10th in 1:35.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia's Alenka Dovzan, just .02 seconds behind Bakke in the  
first heat, had a slow second run to finish 12th. Teammate Spela 
Pretnar, who trailed Bakke by only .03 seconds, straddled a gate at 
the top of the final steep and did not finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Sabine Egger, leader of this season's World Cup slalom  
standings, also straddled a gate on her second run. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristina Koznick of Burnsville, Minn., America's top hope for a  
medal in these championships, caught an edge and hooked a tip, 
failing to finish her first run. 
</P>
<P>
	Also going out on the first run were Sweden's Anja Paerson and  
Germany's Martina Ertl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakke's bronze gave Norway eight medals in these championships,  
trailing Austria's 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg gave Sweden its second medal. She was one of the  
favorites in this race after winning the combined title with a 
come-from-behind victory in slalom and finishing fourth in giant 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiberg, who increased her medal haul in Olympics and World  
Championships to nine, said she came to Vail looking to add two to 
her collection. ``Now I've done that.''

<HEADLINE> 12-Year-Old Suspended for Mustache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- As Principal Scott Skidmore understands  
school district policy, all students must be clean-shaven, even if 
the student is just 12 years old and even if his mustache looks 
more like peach fuzz to some observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Skidmore, head of the James Brooks Middle School, ordered  
Stanley Diaz Jr. to shave or face indefinite suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Diaz Sr. says the punishment is ridiculous.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's my decision, that's not the school's decision,'' the  
elder Diaz said. ``Why they're picking this age and this grade to 
do this is beyond my understanding. I'm not going to back down 
because they're in the wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley has been serving in-school suspension, isolated from  
other students, while his father mulls legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else can I do?'' the father said. ``I'm going to hold  
someone responsible for his suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute started Feb. 1, when Skidmore pulled Stanley and  
five other students out of class and told them about the 
facial-hair policy. The other students decided to shave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm required in my position to follow district policy,''  
Skidmore said. ``I'm just following district policy that all 
students be clean-shaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley's father said the underlying problem might be cultural.  
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition of Hispanics is that 15 is the age of  
maturity,'' Diaz said. ``Shaving is a very big responsibility. 
You're going to have to do it the rest of your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Armesto, a member of Permian Basin League of United Latin  
American Citizens, said the group also plans to challenge the 
facial-hair policy as vague. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen Stanley Diaz Jr. myself. It's my opinion he has  
peach fuzz at best,'' Armesto said. ``It's hard for me to believe 
that (the district) has such good schools and cannot work with 
parents to amend this policy to a certain age, say 16 or older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There currently is no age limit on the policy, and Greenwood  
Independent School District officials say there are no plans to 
change the rule.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hoyas Coach To Host Radio Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Georgetown basketball coach John  
Thompson will host a one-hour talk show during the NCAA men's 
tournament in March, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's show will be on WTEM-AM, an all-sports talk station,  
from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m., Monday through Friday, the Washington 
Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 57, resigned last month as the Hoyas coach after 27  
seasons and one NCAA championship. He is well known for his 
lectures, particularly on matters of race. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is a man of great depth and breadth, and he's going to  
use (the show) as a challenging opportunity,'' said Thompson's 
agent, David Falk. ``He's going to discuss a wide range of 
topics.''

<HEADLINE> Crabbers Hit by Oregon Oil Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- The state has closed the commercial  
harvest of Coos Bay oysters, blaming a fuel spill from a grounded 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure affects four large oyster farms, which have about  
$10 million worth of young oysters seeded into a bay that ranks as 
the richest oyster-farming area in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't want to take any risk of oiled shellfish getting  
out to the public,'' Deb Cannon of the Oregon Department of 
Agriculture said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabbers and other local fishermen fear that their reputation  
could be sullied by the notoriety of an oil spill amid some of 
their prime harvest zones. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill also prompted state officials to close recreational  
shellfish harvesting on ocean beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the intentionally set fire aboard the New Carissa  
appeared out Saturday and officials said the blaze kept most of the 
ship's oil from dirtying the ocean and coastline. 
</P>
<P>
	The 639-foot Japanese-owned freighter ran aground in the surf  
Feb. 4 a mile north of the entrance to Coos Bay with nearly 400,000 
gallons of diesel and tarlike bunker oil on board. It began leaking 
Monday as the pounding waves widened cracks in its hull, sending 
streaks of goo over six miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts made the decision to burn the fuel before the ship broke  
up and fouled Oregon's scenic coastline. A Navy demolition team 
used 400 pounds of explosives to crack open the fuel tanks and set 
the heavy bunker fuel ablaze within the hull of the crippled ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on infrared images, experts estimated that about  
two-thirds of the fuel had burned away, and that no more than 10 
percent of the load had spilled onto the beaches.

<HEADLINE> NBA All-Star Mark Price Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Price didn't have the flamboyance of Michael  
Jordan, the subtle elegance of Magic Johnson or the dominating 
physical presence of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, though, the guy who looked more like a choir boy  
than a point guard matched up just fine against the best from 
several NBA generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to play against some of the all-time greats,'' Price  
said Friday, announcing his retirement after a 12-year career that 
included four trips to the All-Star game, a spot on Dream Team II 
and the highest career free-throw percentage in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Julius Erving. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Larry Bird. Magic Johnson.  
Michael Jordan. I got to play against all of them. I can tell my 
kids about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost a month to the day after Jordan announced his retirement  
with rock concert-like flair, Price formally closed his career with 
a low-key news conference at Alexander Memorial Coliseum, where he 
starred for Georgia Tech in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Price had to be coaxed into making a public appearance by his  
agent, Richard Howell, and his former college coach, Bobby Cremins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in quietly and I wanted to go out quietly,'' Price  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had offers from several teams to return for another season.  
But Price, who will turn 35 on Monday, was leaning toward 
retirement after being waived in June by the Orlando Magic, and the 
lockout clinched his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Laura, is expecting the couple's fourth child in a  
couple of weeks, and Price was tired of moving after playing with 
four teams the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to settle down, get a few roots going,'' said  
Price, who lives in suburban Atlanta. ``You have to know when to 
say when, and now is the perfect time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6-foot and 180 pounds, Price was hardly an imposing figure  
on the court. But his uncanny shooting touch earned him a spot in 
the NBA, and he became a star by honing his passing skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Price had a career free-throw percentage of .904 and shot better  
than 40 percent from 3-point range. He finished with career 
averages of 15.2 points and 6.7 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	His greatest seasons came with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He made  
the All-Star game in 1989 and 1992-94, and also was a member of 
Dream Team II, which won the world championship in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably the greatest shooter in NBA history,'' said Brad  
Daugherty, a teammate of Price's for eight seasons in Cleveland. 
``If I needed someone to take a shot at the end of the game, it 
would be Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before both were ravaged by injuries, Price and Daugherty were  
the East Coast version of John Stockton and Karl Malone, developing 
an almost psychic bond on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ran the screen and roll as well as anybody,'' said Lenny  
Wilkens, their coach for most of those years in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Cavaliers hit their prime about the same time  
as Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Five times, Cleveland lost to the Bulls in the playoffs,  
including a memorable first-round series in 1989 when Jordan hit 
the winning shot at the buzzer in the deciding game. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Michael doesn't hit that shot in Game 5, I think we have a  
legitimate chance to win the NBA championship,'' said Price, whose 
Cavaliers teammates also included Ron Harper and Larry Nance. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Price made a name for himself by helping transform  
woebegone teams into winners. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Enid, Okla., he signed with Georgia Tech in 1982  
when the Yellow Jackets were at the bottom of the Atlantic Coast 
Conference; three years later, they won the league championship. 
Price wound up as the third-leading scorer in school history (2,193 
points). 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark came here at a time when we were real, real low,''  
Cremins said. ``We needed somebody really special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price started over again with Cleveland in 1986, landing with a  
team known derisively as the ``Cadavers'' after eight straight 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1989, the Cavaliers had the second-best record in the NBA  
(57-25) and seemed ready to challenge for the title. But the Bulls 
were always standing in the way. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Jordan, injuries dogged Price throughout his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the biggest guy in the world,'' he said. ``When you  
keep getting knocked down by those 7-footers, it takes a toll. 
Unfortunately, the injuries do add up over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price tore up his knee in 1990-91 and a broken wrist limited him  
to 48 games during his final season in Cleveland. He was traded to 
Washington in 1995 but played in just seven games because of a foot 
injury. The following season, after signing with Golden State, he 
broke a bone in his wrist. Traded to the Magic in 1997, he was 
hampered by a thumb injury in his final season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the injuries never broke his spirit.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a fierce competitor on the court. Off the court, he was  
a real man,'' Wilkens said. ``He would stand up for what he 
believes, which is keeping God and family first. That's the sign of 
a real man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price hasn't decided what he will do next, but it probably will  
involve basketball in some form. As for his playing career, he 
hopes to be remembered simply as someone who ``gave it everything I 
had when I stepped on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not have made it otherwise,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Casey Takes Tumble, Roll and Skid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Casey Atwood's car hit the wall nose  
first. Then it went airborne, flipped end-over-end and skidded on 
its hood for about 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it rolled four times, sheet metal spewing all over  
the track, before the crumpled frame finally came to rest upright 
on the infield grass near the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what did your 18-year-old do this weekend?  
</P>
<P>
	One of the Busch Series' youngest drivers had the most dramatic  
of six wrecks that turned Saturday's Napa Auto Parts 300 into a 
struggle to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, from Nashville, Tenn., crashed with just one lap  
remaining in the season-opener. Randy LaJoie clinched the victory 
under a yellow flag -- how appropriate -- and finally, the Busch 
drivers picked up the remains of their cars and got the heck out of 
Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most definitely the worst accident I've ever been  
involved in and hopefully it will always be the worst,'' said 
Atwood, who wasn't seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just took a little bump off turn 4 and got turned sideways.  
Then, things got out of control. I look at the way that car looks 
and it's hard to believe I'm OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atwood, one of many young, inexperienced drivers in NASCAR's  
second-tier series, hit the wall after he was tapped on his rear 
bumper by Andy Hillenburg, who finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty wild ride,'' Atwood said. ``I always wondered  
what that felt like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the accident, he was running a solid race. The second-year  
Busch Series driver was competing for second place, trying to 
position himself for a late run at LaJoie as the cars headed into 
the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
	He ended up finishing 17th, joining 18 other drivers in the  
43-car field who couldn't finish the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like bunch of kids at the go-kart track trying to get  
their go-karts to go the fastest,'' said fifth-place finisher Bobby 
Hillin. ``You fight for position and do everything but push each 
other off. That's what you're going to get here every time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even at practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven drivers started in backup cars due to a series of  
accidents at (un)happy hour Friday, where everyone is supposed to 
be on his best behavior while crews make their final adjustments 
before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of weekend that left another 18-year-old -- Adam  
Petty -- feeling like an old man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God there aren't anymore superspeedway races for a  
while,'' said Petty, grandson of seven-time Daytona 500 winner 
Richard Petty. ``If I had to run these every weekend, I don't know 
if I'd be a race car driver. Some of the moves I saw out there, I'd 
never make, even when I'm playing on the computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Petty walked out to the garage area, he was stopped by a  
couple of autograph seekers. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them held the most fitting souvenir from this wild  
weekend of Busch racing: the crushed grille plucked from the garage 
of driver Larry Pearson's wrecked car.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Steel Makers Refute Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A group representing the Japanese steel industry  
has disputed a Clinton administration ruling that Japan may have 
illegally dumped steel in the U.S. market, a news service reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steelmakers face stiff tariffs following Friday's  
finding by the U.S. Commerce Department that they sold steel in 
U.S. markets for less than it cost to make and less than they 
charge at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the U.S. government closely examines data provided by  
Japanese steelmakers, it can understand there are no dumping 
practices,'' an official of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation was 
quoted as saying by Kyodo news service. He did not elaborate on 
what the data showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary ruling has triggered a full investigation that  
could lead to tariffs for Japanese producers by summer. Brazilian 
producers were also cited for dumping steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan, Brazil and Russia  
jumped more than 60 percent during the first six months of 1998, 
compared with the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said steel from Japan might have been  
sold at up to 68 percent below the fair value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The calculation of dumping margins is very regrettable as we  
cooperated with the U.S. government in its anti-dumping probe as 
much as possible,'' Nippon Steel Corp., Japan's biggest steelmaker, 
was quoted as saying by Kyodo. 
</P>
<P>
	The American steel industry blames the surge in imports for at  
least 10,000 layoffs and three company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday's ruling also comes at a tough time for the Japanese  
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Japan's biggest producers -- Kobe Steel Ltd., NKK Corp.,  
and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. -- announced earlier Friday they 
expect losses for the current fiscal year to be larger than 
forecast, partly due to a decline in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's steelmakers began cutting back on sales to the United  
States late last year, fearing the Commerce Department would rule 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Iron and Steel Federation, an industry group,  
Japanese manufacturers have almost completely stopped making new 
contracts for exports to the United States, Kyodo reported. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Asian economic crisis has severely lowered  
demand for steel closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel company officials and industry representatives  
were not available for comment Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Delta Center Not Up to Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If the Salt Lake City Olympic organizers  
think the bribery scandal gave them an image problem, get ready for 
the wrath of the fans who saw Michelle Kwan disappear right before 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who paid hundreds of dollars for tickets to this week's  
U.S. Figure Skating Championships only got to see part of the show. 
Seating started about 15 feet above the floor, giving almost all of 
the fans obstructed views of at least part of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans were on hand to miss the action.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've sat in a couple of different areas and there doesn't seem  
to be a good area where it's not blocked,'' Connie Phelps of 
suburban Salt Lake said. ``I think people would not want to pay 
knowing they wouldn't be able to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee hasn't made a final decision on where  
to hold figure skating during the Olympics, but initial plans are 
to put it in the Delta Center. And on paper, that idea looks pretty 
smart. Capacity for nationals was 10,800, though seating probably 
can be increased by a few thousand to accommodate the figure 
skating fans in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a relatively new arena, so it's easy to maneuver in and has  
amenities like a coffee bar and room for souvenir hawkers. It's in 
the heart of downtown, close to hotels, highways and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Delta Center was built solely for basketball. Unlike  
other, multipurpose arenas, it doesn't have permanent seats at ice 
level. There are temporary seats, but they don't fit when an 
international-size ice rink -- 60 meters by 30 meters -- is put down. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rink this week is set way down and the seats up high.  
That means spectators can't see into the corners or along the 
sideboards on the side where they're sitting. Huge movie screens 
were hung at either end of the rink, but that meant fans were 
flipping back and forth between the ice and the screens -- fine for 
a ping-pong match, but a little annoying for programs that last 
less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little distracting to watch the skater, then watch  
the screen,'' said Shawna Brennan, who came with her mother from 
Marshfield, Mass., to watch nationals. ``It took away from the 
performance having to watch the screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with prices at nationals ranging from $15 to $75 for  
individual tickets and $125 to $375 for packages, that's a lot of 
money to pay to watch part of the event on television. Prices will 
be even higher for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would come if they make revisions,'' Phelps said.  
``If they don't, I don't think I would come. I'd just as soon watch 
it on television, even though I live here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans weren't the only ones dismayed with the setup. Banners had  
to be put up at the ends of the rink so skaters wouldn't get 
disoriented during their programs. A few skaters said they felt 
like they were in ``a pit,'' while others said it was strange not 
to be able to make eye contact with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unusual ... a little strange,'' Kwan said.  
``Probably the fans see the top of your head instead of your 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the venue assignments are being re-evaluated, said Frank  
Zang, spokesman for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. There's a 
possibility figure skating could be moved to the E Center, a 
smaller facility built for hockey and skating that's about 20 
minutes outside downtown. The men's hockey tournament is scheduled 
for the E Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the floor at the Delta Center is another possibility,  
but not a likely one, said Claire Ferguson, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association's representative to the International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it may be a contentious issue,'' Ferguson said. ``I've  
been looking at the seating, trying different seats in different 
areas all around the arena and it's obvious there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this arena also has so much space and that is good for the  
skaters. There is lots of room for television and space to put the 
TV cameras and for the skaters to walk and warm-up, and they have 
big locker rooms and lounges, which makes them more comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But changing the seating or moving figure skating to the E  
Center will have no effect on the abysmal attendance at nationals. 
With only the women's free skate left, only 25,885 had showed up. 
The largest turnout was 4,628 for the pairs free skate Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 4,225 showed up for the men's free skate Saturday, and  
3,804 were on hand for Kwan's short program Thursday night. 
Attendance for the men's short program was the worst so far, 1,776. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like our city's real supportive,'' Phelps  
said. ``I thought it would be jammed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Mickelson, executive director of the LOC, doesn't know why  
attendance has been so bad, but she said timing is definitely a 
problem. The year after an Olympics is traditionally watered down 
as medalists move on to other things. This year is no different. 
Kwan and Kyoko Ina are the only champions to return, though Ina, a 
two-time U.S. gold medalist with Jason Dungjen, is skating with a 
new partner, John Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
	But no-shows haven't plagued other post-Olympic nationals. An  
average of more than 9,000 fans attended each session at the 1995 
nationals in Providence, R.I. That compares with an average of 
3,235 per session here. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless some changes are made, things won't look much better in  
2002.

<HEADLINE> Fans Say Bye to Maple Leafs Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- On a night of tears, cheers and hockey nostalgia,  
the Chicago Blackhawks finished what they started -- winning the 
last NHL game at historic Maple Leaf Gardens just as they won the 
first 68 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfazed by the hoopla of a gala goodbye party, the Blackhawks  
dominated all but a few moments in the second period to break a 
seven-game losing streak and subdue a celebrity-studded crowd 
Saturday night with a 6-2 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	There was symmetry to the outcome, since it was the Blackhawks  
who won the opening game in the Gardens back in November 1931, 
beating the Maple Leafs 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks' Bob Probert had the honor of scoring the final  
NHL goal at the Gardens -- only his third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the puck and I'm going to put it on a plaque,'' said  
Probert. ``I'll never forget this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Gardens will remain a venue for minor league hockey  
and other events, the Maple Leafs will have a new home as of next 
Saturday -- the 18,800-seat Air Canada Centre. The game with Chicago 
marked the NHL's departure from the last of the arenas built in the 
1920s and '30s for the league's Original Six franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs, under an intense media spotlight heading into  
the game, seemed nervous at the start, and Chicago jumped to a 
quick 2-0 lead. Tony Amonte backhanded his own rebound past Curtis 
Joseph at 4:18 for his 28th goal, and Reid Simpson made it 2-0 at 
6:41 with his first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Maple Leafs captain Doug Gilmour stretched the  
Blackhawks' lead to 3-0 on a power-play goal at 3:11 of the second 
period before the Maple Leafs rallied. 
</P>
<P>
	With a two-man advantage for Toronto, Steve Thomas knocked in a  
pass across the crease from Steve Sullivan for the first Maple 
Leafs' goal, and Derek King pulled Toronto within a goal at 8:15, 
beating a sprawling Jocelyn Thibault from close range. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd began to sound hopeful, then was stunned as Chicago  
put the game away with three straight goals in the third period. 
Simpson scored his second goal at 3:48, Eric Daze beat Joseph with 
a high slap shot at 5:19 and Probert scored at 11:05. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans shook off their disappointment and began a standing ovation  
when longtime announcer Paul Morris said, as he had done hundreds 
of times before: ``Last minute of play in this period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, scores of former Maple Leafs players marched one  
by one onto the rink for an hour-long, nationally televised 
ceremony bidding farewell to the Gardens. Resounding ovations 
greeted many of the former stars, including Hall of Famers Lanny 
McDonald, Borje Salming, Darryl Sittler, Frank Mahovlich and Johnny 
Bower. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the alumni was Red Horner, 89, the only surviving member  
of the 1931 team that played the Gardens' opening game. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner dropped the puck for a ceremonial faceoff along with  
Frank ``Mush'' March, now 90, who as a Blackhawk scored the first 
goal at the Gardens in the opener Nov. 12, 1931. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs completed their 68-year run at the Gardens with  
a record of 1,215-768-356. They won 11 of their 13 Stanley Cups at 
the arena, but none since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the final game, Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn reflected  
wistfully on the NHL's shift away from the old hockey rinks to new, 
all-purpose arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've slowly lost our shrines,'' he said. ``As we've moved to  
these monstrous buildings -- that are beautiful and great places to 
showcase our game -- we've lost the old element where it was just a 
place for the everyday guy to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $400 for the worst seats in the house, much  
more for good seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,000  
for a pair of mid-level seats for himself and his 13-year-old son, 
Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high for 
tonight.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Land Grazing Fee Remains Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The fees for grazing livestock on federal land  
will remain the same this year -- a bargain critics say amounts to a 
government-subsidized incentive to overgraze sensitive rangeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department and Agriculture Department announced  
that the $1.35 fee per animal unit would remain in effect for the 
new grazing year effective March 1 on lands managed by the Forest 
Service and Bureau of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's cheaper to graze cattle on public lands than it is to  
feed your pet hamster,'' John Horning of Forest Guardians based in 
New Mexico, N.M., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Plagued by depressed cattle prices, Western ranchers say  
thousands would be run out of business if the government charged 
any more than the $1.35 rate per month per cow and calf. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the current market if you handed us a $3 or $4 fee, you  
would see a large percentage -- if not all -- of the Western ranchers 
who are dependent on federal land going out of business,'' said 
Betsy Macfarlan, executive director of the Nevada Cattleman's 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmentalists say the market demands five to 10 times as  
much -- that inflation alone should have caused the fee to be raised 
higher than $5. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18,000 ranchers paid about $24 million in fees last year  
to graze livestock on federal land, mostly across 264 million acres 
of BLM land in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	A formula sets the fee based on beef cattle prices, the cost of  
livestock production and rates for private grazing land leases. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 fee stays the same because there was a small decline in  
beef cattle prices and a small increase in both private land lease 
rates and livestock production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest fee ranchers have paid was $2.36 in 1980 -- the first  
year the Forest Service and BLM adopted uniform fees. It fell to 
$1.35 from 1985-87 and ranged from $1.81 to $1.98 from 1989-94.

<HEADLINE>  View in Delta Center Is Lacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If the Salt Lake City Olympic organizers  
think the bribery scandal gave them an image problem, get ready for 
the wrath of the fans who saw Michelle Kwan disappear right before 
their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans who paid hundreds of dollars for tickets to this week's  
U.S. Figure Skating Championships only got to see part of the show. 
Seating started about 15 feet above the floor, giving almost all of 
the fans obstructed views of at least part of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fans were on hand to miss the action.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've sat in a couple of different areas and there doesn't seem  
to be a good area where it's not blocked,'' Connie Phelps of 
suburban Salt Lake said. ``I think people would not want to pay 
knowing they wouldn't be able to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee hasn't made a final decision on where  
to hold figure skating during the Olympics, but initial plans are 
to put it in the Delta Center. And on paper, that idea looks pretty 
smart. Capacity for nationals was 10,800, though seating probably 
can be increased by a few thousand to accommodate the figure 
skating fans in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a relatively new arena, so it's easy to maneuver in and has  
amenities like a coffee bar and room for souvenir hawkers. It's in 
the heart of downtown, close to hotels, highways and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Delta Center was built solely for basketball. Unlike  
other, multipurpose arenas, it doesn't have permanent seats at ice 
level. There are temporary seats, but they don't fit when an 
international-size ice rink -- 60 meters by 30 meters -- is put down. 
</P>
<P>
	So the rink this week is set way down and the seats up high.  
That means spectators can't see into the corners or along the 
sideboards on the side where they're sitting. Huge movie screens 
were hung at either end of the rink, but that meant fans were 
flipping back and forth between the ice and the screens -- fine for 
a ping-pong match, but a little annoying for programs that last 
less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little distracting to watch the skater, then watch  
the screen,'' said Shawna Brennan, who came with her mother from 
Marshfield, Mass., to watch nationals. ``It took away from the 
performance having to watch the screen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with prices at nationals ranging from $15 to $75 for  
individual tickets and $125 to $375 for packages, that's a lot of 
money to pay to watch part of the event on television. Prices will 
be even higher for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would come if they make revisions,'' Phelps said.  
``If they don't, I don't think I would come. I'd just as soon watch 
it on television, even though I live here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans weren't the only ones dismayed with the setup. Banners had  
to be put up at the ends of the rink so skaters wouldn't get 
disoriented during their programs. A few skaters said they felt 
like they were in ``a pit,'' while others said it was strange not 
to be able to make eye contact with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unusual ... a little strange,'' Kwan said.  
``Probably the fans see the top of your head instead of your 
face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the venue assignments are being re-evaluated, said Frank  
Zang, spokesman for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. There's a 
possibility figure skating could be moved to the E Center, a 
smaller facility built for hockey and skating that's about 20 
minutes outside downtown. The men's hockey tournament is scheduled 
for the E Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the floor at the Delta Center is another possibility,  
but not a likely one, said Claire Ferguson, the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association's representative to the International Skating Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it may be a contentious issue,'' Ferguson said. ``I've  
been looking at the seating, trying different seats in different 
areas all around the arena and it's obvious there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this arena also has so much space and that is good for the  
skaters. There is lots of room for television and space to put the 
TV cameras and for the skaters to walk and warm-up, and they have 
big locker rooms and lounges, which makes them more comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But changing the seating or moving figure skating to the E  
Center will have no effect on the abysmal attendance at nationals. 
Going into the marquee events Saturday -- the men's and ladies' free 
skate -- only 21,660 had showed up. The largest turnout was 4,628 
for the pairs free skate Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 3,804 showed up to watch Kwan's short program Thursday  
night. And attendance for the men's short program was the worst so 
far, 1,776. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't look like our city's real supportive,'' Phelps  
said. ``I thought it would be jammed.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Go to Mexico Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials admit that Mexico still  
has a ``tremendous problem'' with drug trafficking but are praising 
its eradication efforts in advance of President Clinton's two-day 
trip there that begins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's war against drug traffickers, highlighted by a new $400  
million, land-sea-and-air battle plan, tops the agenda for 
Clinton's meetings with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The setting will be the Yucatan Peninsula, a tourist haven where  
the two presidents and their wives will have a Valentine's evening 
dinner before Clinton and Zedillo get down to business on Monday. 
They have met seven times previously. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drugs, their agenda includes trade, migration and  
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meetings will take place against a background of a  
congressionally mandated review of Mexico's cooperation with U.S. 
counternarcotics efforts in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico could face stiff economic sanctions if it receives a  
failing grade, but all signs point to a U.S. decision to 
``certify'' Mexico as fully cooperative -- as it has been all 12 
years the process has been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking nothing for granted about Clinton's decision, however,  
Mexico declared ``total war'' against the drug chieftains Feb. 4 
through a program that specifies early detection of drug flights 
and sea shipments and a stepped-up counternarcotics role for the 
Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year plan contemplates purchases of aircraft, ships,  
radar, X-ray equipment and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Friday  
that drug control is an important part of the U.S. agenda. In the 
two years since Clinton and Zedillo established a set of common 
objectives, he said, ``We have seen Mexico extradite fugitives, 
eradicate thousands of acres of opium, criminalize money-laundering 
and institute a new screening process for law-enforcement 
officials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, obviously this is a tremendous problem for Mexico, but  
one that they are tackling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, with the certification decision just weeks away, the  
two countries announced a plan outlining joint projects against 
drug consumption, money laundering, gunrunning and narcotics 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	The review process targets about 30 countries deemed to be  
sources for drugs or through which drugs transit. Only a handful 
were decertified a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While seemingly assured a clean bill of health from Clinton,  
there were no such assurances that Mexico's expected certification 
won't be overturned by Congress, where skepticism runs deep about 
the Zedillo government's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting from an internal White House memo, The Washington Post  
reported last week that congressional opponents of certification 
want more than good-faith efforts -- ``They want results, including 
extraditions of Mexican nationals, more prosecutions of corrupt 
officials and more than paper agreements about cooperative 
law-enforcement arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a two-thirds vote, the Congress could overturn a Clinton  
certification, which officials fear could trigger a nationalist 
backlash in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The certification process is widely disliked in Mexico. ``It  
does more harm than good,'' says Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a 
Mexican academic on leave this year at the Brookings Institution. 
He said the process fuels nationalistic feelings that impair cross 
border relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Leiken, an expert on Mexico at Brookings, says Mexicans  
are baffled by the process because they believe the drug problem 
exists only because of the demand for narcotics in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiken questions whether it is realistic to assume that Mexico  
will be able to deal with narcotics traffickers, given its 
inability to cope with a steadily worsening problem of street 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin acknowledged this past  
week that the drug problem may be more than Mexico can handle 
because of the vast resources of the drug runners. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted the certification process does not take into  
account results. ``There is a difference between cooperation and 
success,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's trip to Mexico and other Central American countries,  
originally scheduled for last week, was postponed after the Senate 
set a goal of finishing the president's impeachment trial by 
Friday, when he still would have been out of the country. The 
Senate acquitted Clinton on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexico leg was rescheduled for Sunday and Monday. He will  
visit Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala in March. 
</P>

	Mexico is a major transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments  
from South America. It is also a major producer of marijuana and a 
significant producer of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of Mexican officials visiting Washington admitted  
Wednesday that seizures of illicit narcotics have been down over 
the past year. They raised the possibility that Colombian 
narcotraffickers may be relying more on routes other than Mexico 
for their drug shipments because of increased law enforcement in 
Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Fans Bid Farewell to Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- From tears to beligerence, emotions ran high at  
Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night as raucous fans gathered for 
the historic arena's final NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hordes of revelers pushed and shoved their way into the  
yellow stone building as a lone trumpeter played the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $600 for the worst seats in the house and  
nobody batted an eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,500  
for a pair of mid-stadium seats for himself and his 13-year-old 
son, Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high 
for tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, fans wept openly and fights broke out over game  
programs, which sold out long before the puck was dropped for the 
Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks to begin the end of NHL hockey's 
68-year history in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, just bear with us for a few minutes --  
please!'' urged program vendor Rich Bremner, clearly alarmed as 
hundreds of people crowded into a corner of the arena seeking $10 
glossy game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	His pleas did not go over well with the group.  
</P>
<P>
	``It never changes here,'' complained bystander Beth Kerchove,  
who waited in line for 20 minutes to buy a corned beef sandwich. 
``They never accommodate their fans and they never had enough 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a shoving match broke out in line, a policeman beseeched the  
zealous fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we don't want anybody to get hurt here,'' he said with  
a nervous smile. ``We're all here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd just before game time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Reason, 86, began to weep as announcer Paul Morris noted  
that it was the last night for the Maple Leafs and the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here the first year it opened, in 1931,'' said Reason,  
decked out in a Maple Leafs jersey. ``But I was from Quebec, so I 
was a Canadiens fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans used to yell at me when I cheered for my team, and  
call me a swamp singer: a frog. But my husband brought me over to 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason's son, Jim, said he bought pricey tickets for himself and  
his mother because he had such fond childhood memories of attending 
games with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hot dog and a soda and I was happy in the greys (the worst  
seats in the house),'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hartsells Win Figure Skating Pairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Danielle and Steve Hartsell stood at the  
sideboards for years, watching the champions, trying to read their 
expressions and imagining how great it must feel to stand atop the 
podium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after years of dreaming, reality is almost too sweet to  
believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win nationals is just amazing, and I don't think we really  
know how we feel yet,'' Danielle said Friday night after she and 
her brother easily won their first title at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better than I expected it to be,'' she added. ``I think  
tomorrow it's going to feel even better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brother-sister duo from Westland, Mich., has been on the  
rise since finishing second at a regional intermediate competition 
in 1990. Danielle, 18, and Steve, 21, added the junior world crown 
in 1997 and the gold medal at the 1995 U.S. juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite finishing fifth at last year's nationals, all the  
Hartsells hoped for this year was a spot in the top three and a 
trip to the world championships. They got much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings are the youngest pairs champions since Melissa and  
Mark Militano in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``This performance was probably the hardest performance of our  
career,'' Steve said. ``It was a lot harder than I expected it to 
be. But it was a lot more fun than I expected, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't as much fun for Kyoko Ina, who won the last two  
nationals with Jason Dungjen, who now coaches the Hartsells. Ina 
and new partner John Zimmerman finished second after a crash on a 
split triple twist. Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Ina and Zimmerman have never had problems with the move, but Ina  
crashed into Zimmerman's chest, he tripped over her and they both 
tumbled to the ice. Stunned, they fell behind and Zimmerman was so 
flustered he blew his double axel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did the best we could have considering the circumstances,''  
Ina said. ``We've never missed that, so we didn't know how to 
recover from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who've only been working together for a few months,  
will learn from this, coach Tamara Moskvina said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a kind of a jolt. From now on, we can only move up,''  
she said. ``They need experience not only in working together 
physically, but also with doing a great job in mental 
preparation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a lesson Dungjen has spent months teaching the Hartsells.  
The mental demands of nationals are often greater than the physical 
strain, and it won't be any different at the world championships 
next month at Helsinki, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	His former partner, Ina, who will be making her fifth trip to  
worlds, had her own advice for the new champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll have the time of your life at worlds,'' she  
said. ``It's a great honor to represent the United States and 
there's nothing like the feeling of stepping on the ice at a world 
championships as Americans, especially as American champions. Just 
enjoy it. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, a new era in ice dancing began with the first  
new national champions in four years. Five-time U.S. champions 
Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow moved on after the world 
championships in March, leaving training partners Naomi Lang and 
Peter Tchernyshev as the heirs apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang and Tchernyshev didn't disappoint, sweeping the judges  
panel with a playful tango. Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates were 
second, and Debbie Koegel and Oleg Fediukov were third. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two couples qualified for the world championships at  
Helsinki, but they are longshots for a high finish. Even Punsalan 
and Swallow never managed better than a sixth-place finish at 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the years come, the American teams will develop,'' said  
Lang, who started skating with Tchernyshev in 1996 after he 
hand-wrote her a letter asking if she was interested in a 
partnership. ``We just have to give it time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three couples have a foreign-born man -- a coincidence, not a  
commentary on the state of American ice dancing, Chalom said. 
Tchernyshev and Fediukov are from Russia, and Gates, who skated 
despite having pneumonia, is from Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we really wanted to find is a partner we can skate  
with,'' Chalom said. ``I don't think any one of us had it in mind 
to find someone from overseas ... that's just the way it ended 
up.''

<HEADLINE> Play Ball! Spring Training Is Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez already are limbering up in Tampa.  
Curt Schilling is getting loose in Clearwater, Pat Hentgen is 
playing catch in Dunedin. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus this, just to get the juices flowing: Mark McGwire is  
planning on an early arrival, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always itching and ready to go,'' Big Mac said. ``You  
always get excited at this time of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All baseball fans are eager these days, and for good reason --  
spring training starts Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz from one of the greatest seasons ever has hardly died  
down, and now it all begins again with those magic words that can 
warm even the coldest winter: It's time for pitchers and catchers 
to report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even after all that's gone on this offseason, I feel mentally  
and physically ready to play this season,'' Sammy Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if I hit 10 homers next season -- yes, 10 homers! -- it  
will be a success because I'll be trying my best. But I am 
confident. So I say, `Let the show begin.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Those refurbished Cincinnati Reds, having added 50-homer man  
Greg Vaughn, Denny Neagle, Steve Avery, Michael Tucker and more, 
will be the first camp to open. They'll get going in Sarasota, 
Fla., and within a week, all 29 other teams will join them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty soon, the dispatches will start pouring in from all over  
Florida and Arizona, from places with familiar names that mean 
baseball is in the air -- Vero Beach, Winter Haven and Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, the regular-season opener April 4 in Monterrey,  
Mexico, between Colorado and San Diego seems a long way off. These 
days, there are more pressing questions to answer during baseball's 
own special little season. 
</P>
<P>
	How well will new manager Davey Johnson do with $105 million  
Kevin Brown and the Los Angeles Dodgers? Are Albert Belle, Randy 
Johnson, Mo Vaughn and Roberto Alomar going to succeed with their 
new teams? 
</P>
<P>
	Will the Toronto Blue Jays trade Roger Clemens? Can Darryl  
Strawberry come back from colon cancer and help the World Series 
champion New York Yankees? 
</P>
<P>
	And then there are the rookies, the up-and-comers who often draw  
all the early attention. Will J.D. Drew, Shane Spencer and Ricky 
Ledee repeat their late-season success, and can 21-year-old lefty 
Bruce Chen fit neatly into Atlanta's rotation? 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there's an opportunity for me,'' Chen said. ``I  
prepared myself very good in the offseason, so that should take 
some of the pressure off. ... My confidence level is high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Rabenecker also is confident. He oversees operations at  
Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Fla., the spring home of the 
Montreal Expos and, more importantly, the St. Louis Cardinals. As 
in, the McGwire Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we've got the biggest attraction in baseball,''  
Rabenecker said. ``We think it's going to be the best place to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing Big Mac during workouts will be easy, and getting up  
close for autographs will be possible, part of the reason fans 
often flock to spring training. Seeing him in exhibitions might be 
more difficult -- 10 of the Cardinals' 14 games are close to 
sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabenecker said the folks down there even looked at expanding  
the 7,000-seat stadium by putting bleachers beyond the left-field 
fence, just for fans hoping to catch McGwire's homers. But that 
didn't work out at the 2-year-old park, at least not this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, though, there are plenty of other places to get into  
the swing. It could be in Florida at Joker Marchant Stadium in 
Lakeland (Tigers) and Chain O' Lakes Park in Winter Haven 
(Indians), or in Arizona at HoHoKam Park in Mesa (Sosa and the 
Cubs) or Tempe Diablo Stadium (Angels). 
</P>
<P>
	And there's always this possibility at such places -- seeing a  
Hall of Famer, maybe Willie Mays, Al Kaline, Whitey Ford or Sandy 
Koufax, working with the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	This might also be the last year to see the Dodgers in Vero  
Beach. The ultimate in access for spring fans since 1948, the team 
may leave Dodgertown for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	That would mean no more walking along Vin Scully Way and turning  
onto Duke Snider Street for tiny Holman Stadium, which doesn't even 
have dugouts, just open benches. Only in the recent years has the 
park added outfield fences -- before that, there were only small, 
grass hills ringed with palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, there will be plenty to enjoy from the sights and  
sounds of spring, leading up to the start of the exhibition season 
March 2 when the New York Mets face St. John's University. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees open March 4 at their Legends Field against Toronto.  
Martinez, for one, can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fast offseason when you go to the World Series. Once  
Christmas goes by and New Year's passes ... you get anxious to 
start the season again,'' the Yankees first baseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also worth noting as spring training starts:  
</P>
<P>
	-- A possible Randy Johnson vs. Ken Griffey matchup March 12 when  
the Big Unit's new team, Arizona, plays Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jim Abbott batting with his new team, the Brewers. Born with  
only a left hand, he hit a triple in spring training early in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Brian Jordan, Rafael Palmeiro, Jose Canseco, Edgar Renteria,  
Rickey Henderson and Todd Hundley playing in new places; Jim 
Leyland now managing in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Orel Hershiser, Shawon Dunston and John Jaha, among others,  
still looking for jobs.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Not a Laker -- Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While it appears Dennis Rodman is about to  
join the Los Angeles Lakers, nothing can be regarded as a sure 
thing when it comes to the quirky forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting sources, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that  
Rodman, one of the most effective rebounders in NBA history despite 
standing only 6-foot-8, had decided to play for the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the case, The Worm wasn't a Laker as of Saturday  
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure, I don't know,'' Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal  
said after practice when asked if he knew what was going on with 
Rodman. ``We mentioned many, many times that we wanted him. I think 
it's up to him. The situation is very close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't attend practice at Los Angeles Southwest College,  
but a horde of reporters did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell the world to stop being hysterical,'' Lakers spokesman  
John Black said in announcing Rodman hadn't signed a contract -- 
yet. ``The media's whipped into some wild hysteria on this thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are discussions ongoing. We're not going to get into a  
daily report on everything we discuss. When there's an announcement 
to be made, we'll make one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. He 
has won the league's last seven straight rebounding titles with 
averages between 14.9 and 18.7 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the greatest rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player won seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement last month, the Bulls opted  
not to pursue Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd be a good addition, the guy can play,'' said Robert  
Horry, currently starting at the power forward position for the 
Lakers. ``He's the type of guy who's going to get those extra 
rebounds. Plus, he plays defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Rodman would be the answer for the Lakers,  
considered one of the favorites to win the NBA championship this 
season, Horry smiled and replied, ``The only answer is probably 
someone playing golf right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reference was to Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, there's no telling with him,'' Horry said when  
asked if he thought Rodman would soon be a member of the Lakers. 
``He might just be doing this to keep his name alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Harper, at 37 the oldest member of the Lakers and a  
co-captain despite being signed just prior to the start of training 
camp, said he believes Rodman is ``going to shock the world'' with 
his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he realizes the last thing this young team needs is a  
distraction,'' Harper said. ``I'm thinking he's going to come in 
and work the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an unnamed source that says he's going to come here and  
be normal, if he comes here. I just think he's sick of being a 
distraction. I think he wants to come in and do the right thing. 
I'm really hoping for that. We have a young team. Any distraction 
is going to be a cancer for this team. It's Dennis' responsibility 
to stay in line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper admitted he was ``being hopeful,'' and ``trying my best  
to (send a message to Rodman).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first acknowledged an interest in Rodman two weeks  
ago, but owner Jerry Buss told reporters before the season-opener 
on Feb. 5 it was doubtful Rodman would be signed by the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can only offer him the veterans' minimum of $1  
million -- pro-rated to $600,000 for this lockout-shortened season. 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call made Saturday to a representative of Rodman's  
at International Creative Management was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Jovanovski Out 2-3 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Vancouver Canuck defenseman  
Ed Jovanovski, acquired in the trade the sent Pavel Bure to Florida 
last month, will miss between two to three weeks with a broken 
foot, the team announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jovanovski suffered the injury while blocking a shot during  
Vancouver's 4-3 win over New Jersey on Feb. 9. The No. 1 overall 
pick in the 1994 draft, he has two goals and two assists in 10 
games since joining the Canucks. Jovanovski played with the injury 
in Thursday night's game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the latest Canuck to go down with an injury after the club  
announced Friday that captain Mark Messier will miss between four 
to six weeks after suffering a grade-two medial collateral ligament 
sprain in Thursday's 6-5 overtime loss in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> With New Team, Longley Relaxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Luc Longley wasn't disappointed by the small  
crowd that greeted the Phoenix Suns when they arrived in Los 
Angeles for a game last week. Rather, he was disappointed with 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of being greeted by hordes of fans while with the  
Chicago Bulls, Longley said quiet is good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't miss that stuff at all. Not one little bit,'' Longley  
said. ``Wherever we went, it was an incredible zoo. We'd have 50 
media at every shoot-around. We'd get off the bus at 3 a.m. and 
have 200 people waiting for the doors to open. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the way to the airport, there'd be 20 cars buzzing around  
the bus with people hanging out the sunroofs screaming. I'd had 
enough of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longley, acquired by Phoenix in a trade last month, has been  
adjusting to a new offense and new teammates. And following an 
abbreviated training camp, Longley is averaging 7.5 points and 6.8 
rebounds after four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really happy with things so far,'' Longley said.  
``We've been losing and I've had some rusty moments. There are 
certainly some adjustments to be made, some habits to be broken. 
I've got to get used to playing with these guys and learn to take a 
more aggressive (approach).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back-to-back losses to Sacramento and Utah this week represented  
more home defeats than the Bulls endured in a whole season two 
years ago when they lost just once at the United Center en route to 
an NBA-record 72 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing streaks are new to me,'' Longley added, ``and not  
something I plan on getting used to.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	After a day of unseasonable warmth, people in the Northeast woke  
to freezing temperatures and some light snowfall today. Dry 
conditions dominated in the West and central parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow in central New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine  
should end by the afternoon. Flurries were also expected across the 
Ohio Valley and along the spine of the Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds exceeding 30 mph should sweep through the Great Lakes  
today where up to six inches of snow was possible. The Southeast 
should also have gusty conditions after a few morning showers in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	A front moving across the northern Plains should allow warm air  
to spread across the central United States. Temperatures could hit 
the 60s and 70s in Texas and Oklahoma with 40s and 50s in the 
western Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The southern Rockies and the desert Southwest were expected to  
be clear and dry, but rain and some mountain snow was forecast for 
the western Rockies and Pacific Northwest. Precipitation was not 
expected to be very heavy, but winds could gust to 35 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's hot spot Friday in the lower 48 states was Miami,  
Fla., with a high of 82 degrees. The coldest place was Yellowstone 
Lake, Wyo., with a low of 18 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs today should range from the 20s and 30s in the upper  
Midwest into the 80s in the southern Arizona, with readings in the 
30s and 40s for New England and the northern Plains; 40s and 50s in 
the Southeast, the central Plains and the Northwest; 50s and 60s in 
the southern Rockies and central California; and 60s and 70s in the

<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jamie Silverstein and Justin Pekarek now  
have a national title to add to their world crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein and Pekarek easily won the junior ice dancing title  
Saturday with a mature and passionate free dance, earning marks 
ranging from 5.4 to 5.9. Emilie Nussear and Brandon Forsyth of 
Simsbury, Conn., who were second, had marks ranging from 5.1 to 
5.6. 
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Lynn Beckerdite, of San Jose, Calif., and Matt Healy, of  
Greenville, S.C., were third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just trying to be more mature, express deeper  
emotions,'' Pekarek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstein, 15, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Pekarek, 17, of  
Southfield, Mich., have had a breakthrough season after finishing 
second at junior nationals last year. They won the Junior World 
Championships in November -- the second straight American couple to 
claim the crown -- and swept the compulsory dances, the original 
dance and the free dance at nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	After their free skate, a fan tossed a small plastic album on  
the ice filled with photos of their performance at last year's 
nationals. One of the photos showed their marks -- 5.2s to 5.4s. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple said they've been inspired by five-time U.S.  
champions Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow, who also train at 
the Detroit Skating Club. Punsalan and Swallow even took 
Silverstein and Pekarek out to dinner after they won junior worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	And who knows, there might be more celebratory dinners in the  
future. The duo hasn't decided if they'll move up to seniors next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have broader horizons now,'' Pekarek said. ``We're looking  
more toward the future now in skating. It's not just a junior 
thing. The junior worlds is a stepping stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *A FLIPPANT SENDOFF:* Dan Hollander knew he wasn't going to take  
home a medal from his last nationals, so he figured he may as well 
give the audience a show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander, who was third at nationals in 1997 and 1998, did a  
back flip with about 20 seconds left in his free skate Saturday 
afternoon. The move is illegal, but the audience loved it, letting 
out a huge roar when he landed it. When he finished his program, he 
got a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in my spin at the end and I could hear people  
screaming,'' Hollander said. ``I thought, `Geez, maybe I should 
have done this years ago.' It was a cool moment. It was as nice as 
'96 nationals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander, who was third at nationals in 1996 and 1997, hasn't  
been able to train as he wanted because he's been fighting a groin 
pull for the last year. He was 14th after the short program, and he 
was feeling so awful physically that he called the U.S. Figure 
Skating Association on Saturday morning and told them he was 
withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
	After a quick shower and a ride to the arena, he'd changed his  
mind and asked to be let back in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I decided `No, no, this would be a really good last  
time to enjoy it and be with the audience.' Things were going OK 
and I was having a good time at the very end, so I thought, `Let's 
give this audience a really good show. At the end I thought, what 
the hell, why not?' 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking out at the audience and seeing them smile, it was by  
far worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollander finished 11th.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WITHDRAWALS:* Danny Clausen, Jeff Merica and Morgan Rowe all  
withdrew before the free skates Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe, who was 13th after the women's short program withdrew  
because of an intestinal infection. Clausen, in eighth after the 
short program, pulled out because he was ill. Merica, who was 
second-to-last, didn't give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowe, of Harwich, Mass., was second at the Eastern Sectionals.  
She finished 12th at nationals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clausen, 22, and Merica, 24, both won their qualifying  
competitions. Clausen, of Anchorage, Alaska, won the Upper Great 
Lakes Regionals and the Midwestern Sectionals to earn his first 
trip to senior nationals. Merica, of Annapolis, Md., was first at 
the South Atlantic Regionals and the Eastern Sectionals. 
</P>
<P>
	Merica finished 14th at last year's nationals, his first as a  
senior. He was second at the 1996 junior nationals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHAT A TRIP:* Some young skaters are going to be getting some  
bonus frequent flyer miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle and Steve Hartsell, who won their first pairs title  
Friday, and Trifun Zivanovic and Timothy Goebel, the silver and 
bronze men's medalists, were selected for the inaugural Four 
Continents Championships later this month in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose, who were third in pairs, and  
Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, who were fifth, also will go to 
Four Continents. Scott and Dulebohn were chosen over third-place 
finishers Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler, who were ineligible because 
Tiffany Stiegler is too young. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Savoie, who finished fourth, will be the other men's  
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	National champion Michael Weiss and Kyoko Ina and John  
Zimmerman, who were second in pairs, weren't selected because 
they're competing in the Grand Prix Final the following week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Four Continents, which will be held Feb. 21-28 in Halifax,  
Nova Scotia, is designed as a balance to the European 
Championships. Skaters from the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania 
can compete.

<HEADLINE> IOC Sponsors Urge Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They've paid more than a half-billion dollars to  
be able to use the Olympics Rings to sell everything from insurance 
to hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, angered by the biggest scandal in Olympic history,  
high-level sponsors are demanding their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking ``thorough reform'' to soothe nervous chairmen and  
shareholders, two dozen marketing executives from the biggest 
sponsors of the games told the International Olympic Committee this 
week to clean up its house or face dire consequences, participants 
in the meeting told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to fix the problem,'' one official said Friday. ``If  
they don't fix the problem to our liking, we say, `OK, guys,' and 
pick up our toys and walk away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dramatic meeting Thursday was the clearest sign yet the IOC  
was facing a revolt by the corporations that pay some $50 million 
each to use the five-ring Olympic logo in their ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor representatives, all speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said the companies were worried the rings would lose 
their ``halo effect'' and become devalued as advertising tools if 
the scandal involving bribes in Salt Lake City's winning bid for 
the 2002 Winter Olympics persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the sponsors are totally comfortable with the way  
things are,'' an officer with a longtime IOC company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it had received the sponsors' support at the  
3 1/2-hour session. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was very concerned, but they have been concerned,  
said Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director and one of two 
committee officials at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	But participating sponsors insisted the tone was far different  
from that of similar meetings held since the scandal broke in late 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted `Kumba Ya,' but instead they got `Fire and  
Rain,''' one person in the meeting said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not once did representatives of the 11 companies in The Olympic  
Program, or TOP, the IOC's highest-level sponsorship group, called 
for the resignation of committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
But none offered support for Samaranch, either, said participants 
from four companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, with Payne and IOC vice president Dick Pound,  
involved vice presidents, marketing chiefs and public relations 
directors, who said they were passing along concerns from the top 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told them chairmen and bosses were now telling us that they  
were worried the IOC was not committed to reforms,'' one 
participant said. Another said the IOC was told that ``sponsors are 
really lacking faith in the IOC to take the long-term actions it 
says it will take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the representatives questioned said the sponsors discussed  
four things: 
</P>
<P>
	--change in IOC management ``at the highest level.''  
</P>
<P>
	--''thorough reform'' through the expulsion of any member  
directly linked to the scandal; so far, nine members have been 
expelled or resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	--permanent changes in voting for Olympic host cities, rather  
than one-time-only changes in the June selection of the site of the 
2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	--more public accountability, including open financial records.  
</P>
<P>
	One participant said that unless the IOC adopts such reforms at  
a special assembly March 17-18, ``it faces revolt March 19.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said there were no signs of revolt during the meeting, the  
second large-scale session with the TOP sponsors since mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a contentious meeting,'' the IOC official said  
Friday by telephone from his Swiss home. ``They asked some 
questions of us -- `How serious is the IOC on the reform process?' 
We told them, `Very serious.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said some of the sponsors might be feeling pressure as  
they neared the deadline for locking in ad budgets leading to the 
2000 Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsor officials at the New York meeting said the issue of  
rebates never came up, although an Olympic sponsorship can cost up 
to five times as much as a marketing deal with the NFL or NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The TOP sponsors include Coca-Cola, IBM, John Hancock, Kodak,  
McDonald's, Panasonic, Samsung, Sports Illustrated, UPS, Visa and 
Xerox.

<HEADLINE> Roundup of World Clinton Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada was elected  
last year after he admitted fathering children with several women 
other than his wife. Despite a severe condemnation from the Roman 
Catholic Church, he won an overwhelming victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In many countries, sex scandals in politics are nothing new,  
making it hard for the world to accept the seriousness of President 
Clinton's sexual dalliance with a White House intern. But the issue 
of lying raised by Clinton's impeachment trial is another matter as 
officials in some countries become increasingly accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada, a former movie star who has admitted to having numerous  
flings, once joked unabashedly that he will offer advice to Clinton 
when they meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both President Clinton and I have sex scandals,'' he said.  
``But Clinton has the scandals, and I have the sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Absolutely nothing happened to a Danish legislator who last  
month licked an actress' body on state television. 
</P>
<P>
	Peder Sass, the government's spokesman on youth issues, admitted  
he showed poor judgment in accepting a ``body tequila'' from an 
actress who poured salt on her body. 
</P>
<P>
	The late French President Francois Mitterrand, widely known for  
his penchant for smart, beautiful women, actually saw his 
popularity bolstered by revelations he had an illegitimate daughter 
with his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot, a respected museum 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
	When the mistress and the daughter appeared at Mitterrand's  
funeral next to the first lady and her two sons, the French hardly 
blinked. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much of the world, France has reacted to the Clinton affair  
with bemusement and incomprehension, secure in the knowledge that 
it couldn't happen here. 
</P>
<P>
	But could it? The tougher issues facing politicians today are  
lying and accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Sorman, a conservative political commentator and author in  
Paris, says Europeans have become less tolerant of lies and 
corruption at the highest levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lying was once regarded as part and parcel of governing, a  
justifiable means to an end,'' Sorman said in a telephone 
interview. ``But that mentality is changing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Sorman, the broad immunity of Western European  
leaders is disappearing as the judicial system functions more as a 
counterweight to sweeping executive power. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the case of Roland Dumas, Mitterrand's former foreign  
minister. Dumas is under formal investigation by a judge for 
allegedly taking huge kickbacks arranged by a longtime mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is rare in French politics and blurs the boundaries  
between what is private and public. Christine Deviers-Joncour, 
Dumas' mistress, was hired to lobby him to secure the state-owned 
Thomson company's 1991 contract to build frigates for Taiwan. She 
allegedly shared some of a $12 million commission with Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Dumas is president of the prestigious Constitutional  
Council, guardians of the French constitution and symbol of the 
Republic. He calls the charges an effort to smear Mitterrand and 
has refused to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``French justice is very slow, but it eventually catches up with  
you,'' Sorman said.

<HEADLINE> Could Clinton Saga Help Women? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With the closing credits starting to roll on the  
Clinton-Jones-Lewinsky drama, many Americans and sexual harassment 
experts have an unexpected prediction -- that women in the workplace 
will benefit from the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The public is more aware now of sexual politics and sexual  
harassment than ever before. And the women -- Paula Jones and Monica 
Lewinsky -- were seen as decision-makers, regardless of how one 
viewed their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't help women to be viewed as fragile creatures who  
have to be protected. We had all that protection in the last 
century and it protected women out of a lot of really good jobs,'' 
said Professor Barbara Gutek, an expert on sexual harassment at the 
University of Arizona. ``I think bringing up discussions having to 
do with unequal power and what consent means have to be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts agree, however, that the experience has left more  
questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Will women be discouraged by Jones' harassment lawsuit being  
dismissed? Will the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship open the door to 
more romances between bosses and their subordinates? Have Americans 
lost the distinction between offensive behavior and harassment? Or 
do they know the difference for the first time? 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing definitely had an impact, but it's hard to  
figure out what it is,'' said Paul Tobias, chairman of the National 
Employee Rights Institute in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones sued Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994, claiming he  
propositioned her when he was Arkansas governor and she was a state 
worker. Her lawsuit was dismissed, but while seeking an appeal she 
settled with Clinton for $850,000. An intern in the White House, 
Lewinsky denied her affair with Clinton in a deposition for the 
Jones suit but then admitted it to prosecutor Ken Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Margie Harris, a Houston attorney, says people whose complaints  
don't rise to the standard of harassment come to her citing the 
settlement Jones won from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say, `What I suffered was worse,''' she said. ``But the  
president's case isn't much like reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, says University of California-Berkeley law professor  
Marina Hsieh, is because of politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case with a weak legal theory that got as far as it  
did because a lot of people with a lot of money with political 
motivation took it forward,'' she said. ``I think everyone looks at 
the Jones case and says it's all political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caught in the political tides were traditional feminists'  
groups, most of which came down against Jones on the side of 
Clinton. And when the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship was revealed, 
some feminists suggested the young woman was fantasizing the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were reluctant to take Paula Jones' side because her case  
was financed by a `right-wing conspiracy,' so the traditional 
allies of Jones didn't appear,'' said Tobias. ``I think that was a 
setback for the women's groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls taken during the yearlong Lewinsky saga suggest most  
Americans don't believe Lewinsky was sexually harassed, while they 
were more divided on whether Jones was harassed. Among the results: 
</P>
<P>
	-- About three-quarters of those questioned in a Time/CNN poll  
done last March said the Lewinsky-Clinton relationship would not 
constitute sexual harassment if ``she willingly consented to have 
sex.'' About one out of five said it still would be harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Asked in an April poll for Newsweek magazine if the judge's  
decision to throw out the Jones lawsuit sends the message that 
``sexual harassment laws are weak and allow men to get away with 
behavior that is harmful to women,'' just over half said no, while 
four out of 10 said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Asked if women are more or less likely to report sexual  
harassment after ``seeing what has happened to Kathleen Willey, 
Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky,'' just over half said they were 
more likely to report it. About a quarter said they were less 
likely, and 11 percent said there was no difference in a Fox 
News/Opinion Dynamics poll done in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans sharply differ over whether it is even possible for a  
clerical worker like Jones or a 22-year-old intern like Lewinsky to 
consent to a relationship with someone in such a position of power. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way you could know anything about this and not  
think that (power abuse) was an issue in the Lewinsky case, but the 
whole thing with that underwear, that wiped it out,'' said Dawn 
Bennett-Alexander, an associate professor of employment law at the 
University of Georgia. Lewinsky flashed the president a peek at the 
top of her thong panties during one of their first discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those thongs saved him from the allegation that he was trying  
to use his power in some way,'' she said.

 *Dr. Neil Compton    	
</P>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Dr. Neil Compton, who led the effort to  
secure federal protection for the United States' first national 
river, died Wednesday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1962, Compton and others formed the Ozark Society after  
the Army Corps of Engineers began efforts to build two dams on the 
Buffalo River in northern Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffalo became the United States' first national river in  
1972. Several state and national dignitaries paid tribute to him in 
a June 1997 ceremony celebrating the 25th anniversary of President 
Nixon signing the law that established the Buffalo as a national 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	President Bush also recognized Compton for his preservation  
efforts.

 *Herbert Kline    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Herbert Kline, a documentary filmmaker who  
sneaked into Eastern Europe to film the Nazi conquest and later 
told the story of the Holocaust, died Feb. 5. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Kline wandered as a youth and wound up in Europe during the  
turbulent 1930s. During the Spanish Civil War, he teamed up with 
Hungarian photographer Geza Karpathi to make the 1936 film ``Heart 
of Spain,'' about a Madrid mother who meets the young soldier she 
saved with a blood donation. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1938 he made ``Crisis,'' a film about the German conquest of  
Czechoslovakia. It recently was re-released in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	To film ``Crisis,'' Kline, who was Jewish, bluffed his way into  
Czechoslovakia by pretending to be pro-Nazi. He filmed rallies and 
parades. Nazi storm troopers carried his equipment and follow his 
directions before the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Kline's 1940 film ``Lights Out in Europe'' documented Hitler's  
invasion of Poland. He also worked with famed author John Steinbeck 
on a 1941 film about peasant life in Mexico called ``The Forgotten 
Village.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Kline made ``My Father's House,'' a 1947 account  
of Holocaust victims. He didn't make another film until 1971's 
Oscar-nominated ``Walls of Fire,'' about Mexican artists Diego 
Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. 
</P>
<P>
	He made two other documentaries after that: ``The Challenge of  
Modern Art'' in 1978, narrated by Orson Welles, and ``Acting ... 
Lee Strasberg'' in 1979.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Gideon Rafael, a diplomat who helped found the  
Israeli Foreign Ministry half a century ago, died Wednesday. He was 
86. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael served as the ministry's director general and filled many  
other positions, including ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Germany, he moved to pre-state Palestine in 1934 after  
the Nazis rose to power in his homeland. His first mission was to 
organize illegal immigration of Jews at a time with severe limits 
under the British Mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael retired from the foreign service in 1978 and published a  
book about his career three years later.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Retrospective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When 36 ordinary-looking file boxes were  
unloaded at the Capitol under the gaze of armed officers last fall, 
no one envisioned the tumult sealed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The contents sent by prosecutor Kenneth Starr influenced an  
election, bitterly divided the House, provoked a House speaker and 
his would-be successor to resign and forced -- against a backdrop of 
U.S. warplanes -- only the second presidential impeachment in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama ended Friday with surreal gentility. Senators, rising  
as their names were called, buttoned and straightened their coats 
and then declared William Jefferson Clinton ``guilty'' or ``not 
guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A saga that consumed the Capitol for 156 days ended in just a  
few minutes as Clinton was acquitted on two articles of 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a downer from A to Z, there's nothing noble or  
high,'' said Henry Hyde, leader of the House prosecutors who 
brought the case to the Senate and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, there were some pivotal moments.  

</P>
<P>
                           	 *THE REPORT   	
</P>
<P>
	After receiving Starr's van loads of evidence, the House voted  
to unseal the cartons and spread his salacious report around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	The 445-page report was a riveting, detailed account of  
Clinton's relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky -- sexual 
acts in the White House, lewd late-night telephone calls, and a 
dress with a telling stain. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``absolutely shocking,'' recalled Rep. Constance Morella,  
R-Md. Hyde said there was even more sexually explicit material in 
Starr's report that the House edited from the public version. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *THE VIDEOTAPE   	
</P>
<P>
	The report was followed Sept. 21 by release of the president's  
videotaped testimony to Starr's grand jury. All four hours played 
on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton began his testimony by pulling from his pocket a single  
page and reading through professorial half-glasses a statement 
admitting ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of many pundits and politicians, the president's  
already-strong approval rating bumped even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., called it the ``single most  
important event'' in the course of impeachment. Republicans 
``thought it would make the public mad,'' Frank said. ``Instead, it 
strengthened his support.'' 

</P>
<P>
                          	 *THE ELECTION   	
</P>
<P>
	After the House voted to open an impeachment inquiry on Oct. 8,  
both sides made it a campaign issue. When the Democrats picked up 
five House seats on Nov. 3, stunned Republicans seemed to back away 
from impeachment. But Hyde rallied his House Judiciary Committee 
Republicans, 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'We took a beating, yes, but we have a duty to  
perform,''' recalled Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame for the GOP's poor election fell on Speaker Newt Gingrich.  
He resigned three days after the election. 

</P>
<P>
                      	 *MODERATE REPUBLICANS   	
</P>
<P>
	The Republican majority was expected to push articles of  
impeachment through the partisan, bickering Judiciary Committee. 
The key votes belonged to a handful of moderate Republicans. They 
hemmed and hawed in the unaccustomed spotlight. The White House 
invited them to meet with Clinton; the Judiciary Committee staff 
walked them through the evidence. Democrats accused Majority Whip 
Tom DeLay of twisting arms, which he denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all the moderates came to vote for impeachment.  

</P>
<P>
                          	 *AIR STRIKES   	
</P>
<P>
	In a bizarre twist, impeachment was delayed after the president  
ordered air strikes on Iraq on the eve of the House debate. 
Republicans questioned the timing but grudgingly agreed to a brief 
delay. After one day, the House pressed forward while missiles 
continued falling in retaliation for Iraq's failure to cooperate 
with U.N. weapons inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	During the delay, Rep. Bob Livingston, chosen by Republicans as  
their next speaker, was forced to admit marital infidelities. He 
joined three other Republicans, including Hyde, whose past lives 
had become grist for the scandal mill. 

</P>
<P>
                     	 *LIVINGSTON'S BOMBSHELL   	
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 19, the day of the House impeachment vote, Livingston  
rose to speak. What began as a standard pro-impeachment speech 
suddenly shifted. He called on Clinton to ``resign your post.'' 
Democrats were livid. Some shook their fists; there were shouts of 
``You resign!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston continued.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am willing to heed my own words,'' he said. To the shock of  
colleagues, he gave up the speakership over his marital 
transgressions. 

</P>
<P>
                          	 *IMPEACHMENT   	
</P>
<P>
	Later that day, a weary House approved two articles accusing the  
president of perjury and obstruction of justice, joining Clinton 
with Andrew Johnson as the only two American presidents in history 
to be impeached. The vote fell largely along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich and Livingston had blocked a vote on censure as an  
alternative. ``Censure would have passed, absolutely. Big time,'' 
insisted Rep. Amo Houghton, a New York Republican who opposed 
impeachment. 

</P>
<P>
                       	 *BIPARTISAN SENATE   	
</P>
<P>
	Senators vowed things would be different in their chamber, and  
they were. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed meeting in the Senate's historic old chamber in  
January, senators hashed out a bipartisan set of opening rules for 
the trial, leaving the pesky question of whether to call witnesses 
until later. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators were ordered to stay quiet ``on pain of imprisonment''  
as they listened to two weeks of arguments by House prosecutors and 
White House lawyers. The most compelling moment: a heartfelt speech 
in the president's defense by recently retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, 
D-Ark., the only presenter to address the senators as an equal. 

</P>
<P>
                         	 *BYRD'S MOTION   	
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, guardian of Senate traditions,  
announced he would bring the Democrats' planned motion to dismiss. 
Some had thought the independent, white-haired West Virginian, who 
carries a pocket-sized Constitution in his coat, might vote 
``guilty.'' Now Byrd was calling for a halt to the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	All but one of the Senate's 45 Democrats voted Jan. 28 to  
dismiss the case. The vote proved what many had thought for some 
time -- there weren't 67 votes to convict Clinton. 

</P>
<P>
                        	 *LEWINSKY SPEAKS   	
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors held out one last hope -- riveting the  
nation by calling witnesses to the Senate floor. It was not to be. 
The prosecutors were allowed only to videotape depositions with 
three witnesses -- Ms. Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan 
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
	Snippets of the tapes were shown during the trial's closing  
arguments, giving Americans their first chance to see a composed, 
well-rehearsed Ms. Lewinsky answer questions. There were no 
bombshells. 

</P>
<P>
	 *THE VOTE   	
</P>
<P>
	The Senate ended three days of closed debate -- described by  
those inside as notably civil -- by voting for acquittal. All 45 
Democrats backed their president, and enough Republicans joined 
them to keep either article from getting a majority of votes. A 
chastened Clinton, secure in his final two years in office, said he 
was ``profoundly sorry'' for the upheaval of the past 13 months and 
urged the nation to move forward in a spirit of reconciliation and 
renewal.

<HEADLINE> Excellent Meeting Wins Las Virgenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Excellent Meeting, the 1-9 favorite,  
easily beat Tout Charmant by four lengths Saturday in the $200,000 
Las Virgenes Stakes at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Excellent Meeting covered one mile in  
1:35 1-5 and paid $2.20, $2.20 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-bred daughter of General Meeting has finished first  
or second in eight of her nine career starts and is considered a 
potential threat to the top males in the Triple Crown races this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just encouraged her to be in the race,'' said Desormeaux.  
``But within a hundred yards I'm just slowing her down until inside 
the three-sixteenths pole. From there, even without much 
encouragement, she did the rest on her own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tout Charmant, ridden by David Flores, was second and paid $4  
and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend Squall, with Alex Solis aboard, finished nine lengths  
behind for third place and returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in the ninth race, Laffit Pincay Jr. earned his  
8,700th career victory aboard Young Husband. The win leaves him 133 
victories away from Bill Shoemaker's career record of 8,833 wins.

<HEADLINE> Roundup of Editorials on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in publications about  
President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate: 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From The Washington Post:  
</P>
<P>
	The president and his spokesman both made all the right noises  
in the wake of the Senate vote; no vindication was claimed and the 
president's deep sorrow at his actions was again reiterated and 
with sufficient generality that he didn't have to repeat his 
preposterous distinction between the private wrongs that he 
acknowledges and the public wrongs that he continues to deny. Yet, 
despite the propriety of the White House response to the Senate 
vote, one is left with the suspicion that Mr. Clinton still doesn't 
understand what happened. To the White House, this was mere 
political warfare -- something to be won or lost -- rather than a 
serious question about the fitness to lead of the man at this 
nation's helm. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From The Kansas City (Mo.) Star:  
</P>
<P>
	It has been a long, humiliating and deeply flawed process. But  
the Senate finally arrived at the right place Friday when it 
decided against removing President Clinton from office. 
</P>
<P>
	As Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been pointing out  
for months, Clinton's abuse of the judicial system on which this 
country depends has been atrocious. His actions would have derailed 
a presidential campaign in short order. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bar for removing a sitting president is and should  
remain extremely high. While there is room for reasonable people to 
disagree on whether Clinton's misdeeds were sufficient to trigger 
impeachment and removal from office, we believe that the House 
managers failed to make their case. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From The Times-Picayune of New Orleans:  
</P>
<P>
	After his acquittal, President Clinton committed himself to the  
``work of serving our nation and building our future together.'' To 
do so, he must begin to display -- in his policies as well as his 
public pronouncements -- a level of honesty that has so far proved 
beyond his capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wants to be remembered as anything more than a wily pol,  
he will make honest attempts to tackle the national debt, Social 
Security and countless other problems that can be solved only at 
high political cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton has survived impeachment. He has no more campaigns  
to run. He has nothing left to lose. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times:  
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment trial is over and the vote to acquit was the  
proper verdict. As we said from the start, President Clinton's 
campaign of lies to cover up his sexual exploitation of Monica 
Lewinsky constituted small, tawdry, pathetic, personal crimes that 
did not threaten our democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, this was not the best ending for this ordeal. We, and  
others, felt all along that the impeachment process could have been 
ended by Clinton simply acknowledging that he lied under oath and 
manipulated the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton chose otherwise, putting his interests above those of  
the country. Even his acquittal did not change that. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times:  
</P>
<P>
	There was no surprise to the end of the impeachment trial of  
Bill Clinton. The Senate voted against conviction, as expected, and 
against turning Clinton out of office. But though the Senate voted 
him not guilty, few Americans can believe their president is 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate did not issue a statement of censure. A bipartisan  
excoriation would have expressed what most Americans feel, that 
Bill Clinton demeaned the office he holds in trust from generations 
of Americans past and those not yet born, and that his conduct 
demonstrated little regard for the power and responsibility put in 
his stewardship. It would have been a fitting denouement, second 
only to ouster itself. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the Chicago Tribune:  
</P>
<P>
	It has been widely predicted that Republicans will pay dearly in  
the 2000 elections for overzealously pursuing the removal of a 
popular Democratic president for offenses that most Americans 
considered essentially private and definitely not substantial. 
</P>
<P>
	And pay they may, especially if independent counsel Kenneth  
Starr and his prosecutorial posse persist in their holy war, 
reminding people of just how relentlessly obnoxious and scary a 
Republican with subpoena power can be. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the Detroit Free Press:  
</P>
<P>
	And now it's Kenneth Starr's turn. Between the philandering  
president and the obsessed prosecutor, it is the prosecutor who has 
been the greater threat to the values of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's time to shut down the inquisition, write finis to the  
tawdry drama, and send Starr himself back into the private sector, 
where he can console himself with million-dollar fees from the 
clients and associates who have long hoped he could bring down Bill 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not excuse Clinton to say that Starr has been the  
prosecutor of thoughtful jurists' nightmares. Back in 1940, 
conservative Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson issued the 
classic warning against the rogue prosecutor ``who will pick people 
that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that need to be 
prosecuted,'' who would search the lawbooks or set the bloodhounds 
sniffing to find any offense, no matter how technical or trivial, 
to pin on his target. Jackson could hardly have described Starr 
better. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the Asbury Park (N.J.) Press:  
</P>
<P>
	After his acquittal yesterday, President Clinton asked people to  
forgive him. Perhaps eventually some, who opposed his removal from 
office while holding their noses, might. 
</P>
<P>
	For those whose hatred goes back to the draft and not inhaling,  
Clinton's only hope would be to believe in miracles. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ken Starr, Linda Tripp, Henry Hyde and company, there are  
three words of wisdom to which all those who hold them in low 
esteem should adhere: If you can't say anything nice about 
somebody, don't say anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	From The Dallas Morning News:  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate's gathering at noon Friday lacked the dramatic  
suspense that surrounded Andrew Johnson's narrow escape from 
impeachment in 1868. There were clear signs all week that the 
Senate would not remove President William Jefferson Clinton from 
office on grounds of perjury and obstruction of justice. Perhaps 
the only surprise was that neither charge gained a majority of 
guilty votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, when high noon arrived, and the chief justice of the  
United States asked in a solemn voice, ``Senators, how say you,'' 
the hushed chamber showed the gravity of the vote ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	That solemnity and order Friday should help Americans feel proud  
of their country, despite the ugly matters that brought the vote. 
This nation relies upon process, not bayonets, to resolve its 
conflicts.

<HEADLINE> After Impeachment, Then What? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The second American president ever to have  
been impeached. That bare fact can be set in type for the history 
books of tomorrow, and forever. There is no going back. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when historians are asked to do what they do second best --  
look ahead instead of back -- they are not sure President Clinton's 
impeachment will amount to much more than a forlorn detour where 
the century happened to skid to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be seen as what they sometimes call a sport,''  
predicts historian James MacGregor Burns, using the scientific 
definition of ``sport'' meaning an oddity -- not a game, nothing 
fun. He said people will look back upon ``a political system that 
went haywire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The charges, the trial and the acquittal are indelibly linked  
with Bill Clinton, regardless of whether the case was just and no 
matter what else he does. When readers look up Andrew Johnson in 
the World Book, the first passage they see after his dates of birth 
and death is: ``the only president ever to have been impeached.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fairness of that impeachment, and any good he did when he  
succeeded the assassinated Lincoln in office, is part of a 
narrative that students may or may not go on to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment is the timeless stain, one Clinton now shares,  
despite the bright economy and all else that is right. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeached -- ``that's the one-liner that will be attached to his  
name by any encyclopedia,'' says Joan Hoff, director of the 
Contemporary History Institute at Ohio University and author of 
``Nixon Reconsidered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The single most important factor in a president's later  
reputation is scandal,'' says Tim Blessing, who has surveyed fellow 
historians for 20 years to compile rankings of the presidents. 
``It's more powerful than going to war. It's more powerful than 
being assassinated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact of all this? ``It'll be fleeting for the country,''  
Blessing predicts. ``It'll be long for Mr. Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To some historians, the impeachment was so driven by  
partisanship that it offers no great lessons for future scholars, 
except, perhaps, about the distance between government and 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a far broader context, what we're seeing is part of the  
decline of the state,'' says Yeshiva University historian Ellen 
Schrecker, editor of Academe magazine. ``What happened here is 
showing us that even the presidency is irrelevant. They can do this 
dog-and-pony Monica show and it doesn't make any difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History is certain to be mixed when judging the president who  
survived, the Republicans who wouldn't give up and the people who 
didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 historians signed a petition before the  
impeachment proceedings started saying that drastic step was 
unjustified and would leave the presidency ``permanently disfigured 
and diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nixon, forced to resign under threat of impeachment over  
the Watergate coverup, had no such assist from the intellectual 
wellspring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is history?'' asks Thomas C. Reeves, who teaches at the  
University of Wisconsin and wrote ``A Question of Character'' that 
was critical of John Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer is, history tends to be those 400 historians,'' he  
says. Although a petitioner for Clinton's removal, Reeves suspects 
many historians will make Clinton ``look pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Blessing, whose presidential ranking created a fuss when  
Ronald Reagan came up as ``below average,'' doubts that will matter 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes about 40 years for a president's reputation to settle  
in place,'' he said. ``Those historians are going to be dead. That 
generation will be gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns, senior scholar at a leadership academy the University of  
Maryland named after him, signed the pre-impeachment petition 
warning of damage to the presidency. But now he believes the office 
looks resilient. Clinton has shown ``the presidency just goes on, 
intact; indeed, in a sense, even stronger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoff, for one, does not believe the raw partisanship now fresh  
in people's minds can be used down the road to discount the 
significance of what happened to Clinton. ``Impeachment processes 
are virtual political assassinations,'' she said. ``They are 
viciously partisan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But looking far ahead, she feels the impeachment will hold  
little significance. 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbia University, historian Eric Foner even wonders  
whether the impeachment struggle will turn out to have been ``one 
of the last battles of the 1960s,'' pitting a counterculture 
vaguely represented by Clinton against a rising conservatism now 
embodied by GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they'll stop now,'' he said of the cultural warriors.  
``I hope so.''

<HEADLINE> Some GOP Sens. Say Case Not Proven </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Republican senators who broke with  
colleagues and voted to acquit President Clinton on impeachment 
charges said prosecutors' own witnesses undercut the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Others explained they voted with the president because his  
actions, while reprehensible, did not warrant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, the witnesses, all of whom were sympathetic to or  
allies of the president, provided direct evidence that failed to 
corroborate the House managers' case,'' said Sen. John Chafee, 
R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was one of five GOP senators who voted against both  
impeachment charges -- perjury and obstruction of justice -- after a 
21-day trial and 20 hours of closed-door deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Removing the president from office in the face of a conflict  
between direct and circumstantial evidence, in my view, would be 
mistaken,'' Chafee argued during the closed deliberations. He said 
he favored censure. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks were found Saturday in the Congressional Record.  
</P>
<P>
	All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted to acquit the Democratic  
president on the two impeachment charges brought by the House, and 
ten Republicans voted against one or both the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Explanations of several key senators' votes surfaced Saturday as  
Clinton turned his attention to foreign policy, especially the 
decision to commit ground troops to a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He telephoned congressional leaders, including one of his lead  
antagonists, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, of Mississippi, to 
discuss the Kosovo situation. A White House spokeswoman would not 
say whether the impeachment vote came up. 
</P>
<P>
	Another in the group of Republicans voting down both charges,  
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, agreed the evidence from 
witnesses did not measure up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my view that on this record, the burden of proof has not  
been met, the kind of a burden that would have to be sustained, in 
my judgment, for the Senate to remove an American president,'' 
Specter said in comments printed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins both said  
Clinton's behavior -- an affair with one-time intern Monica Lewinsky 
and attempts to hide it -- did not meet their threshold for ousting 
him. And Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont said he worried about the 
precedent of removing Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am gravely concerned that a vote to convict the president on  
these articles may establish a low threshold that would make every 
President subject to removal for the slightest indiscretion, or 
imperil every president who faces a Congress controlled by the 
opposing party,'' Jeffords said in remarks printed in the 
Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other Republicans split their votes -- no to the charge of  
perjury, but yes to the charge Clinton obstructed justice. But even 
some in that group said they didn't want Clinton removed from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I knew my vote would be the deciding vote here, I would not  
vote to remove this president, despite his unlawful acts,'' Sen. 
Ted Stevens of Alaska said in remarks printed Saturday. ``He has 
not brought that level of danger to the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another in the no-yes GOP group, Sen. Slade Gorton of  
Washington, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The inevitable result of a guilty verdict in this trial is the  
president's removal from office, and I believe that reasonable 
minds can differ on whether or not that consequence is 
appropriate,'' Gorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC News poll taken on the day of Clinton's acquittal Friday  
showed 60 percent of the public supported the eventual Senate 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	A Newsweek poll appears to bear out what the dean of Senate  
Democrats, West Virginia's Robert Byrd, told colleagues: it's time 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	A 74 percent majority said the Republicans should not make an  
issue of the way Clinton and the Democrats conducted themselves 
during the scandal. And 76 percent of those polled said Democrats 
should not make an issue of the way Republicans pursued 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABC poll Feb. 12 had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5  
percentage points. The Newsweek poll conducted Feb 11-12 had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the House prosecutors said Republicans are willing to  
move on and cooperate with Clinton on legislative business. But 
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., doubted the president will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sincerely hope that the president is sincere is his  
extension of an olive branch to work on these issues,'' Barr said 
Saturday. ``We are a little bit skeptical that that olive branch 
may have some rather long thorns attached to it.''

<HEADLINE> Acquittal Liberates First Lady Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before Hillary Rodham Clinton took off across  
the East Room in a tango with the Argentine president, a guest at 
that state dinner asked if she had her campaigning shoes ready for 
next year's Senate race in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady tossed her head back, lifted her arms and let  
them fall. ``Aaah-ah-ah-ha-uh!'' she replied, giving neither a 
quotable syllable nor a clear clue of her plans. She turned to 
greet another guest. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Clinton, who shooed away talk of future roles as long  
as she played stalwart wife through 13 months of scandal, the 
Senate votes Friday to acquit President Clinton of impeachment 
charges freed her, too, to think ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The certainties: Mrs. Clinton will crisscross the country  
promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare proposals. She 
will make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably with 
daughter Chelsea. She will take her ``America's treasures'' tour to 
the West to promote historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Mrs. Clinton's own post-impeachment ``comeback'' strategy  
to salvage the legacy of the administration she and her husband 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see her taking time to say, 'Gee, thank goodness  
(impeachment) is over.' I think she says, 'Gee, thank goodness 
people will start paying attention to our work on the issues,''' 
said Neel Lattimore, a former top aide to Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's acquittal Friday was ``obviously a great  
passage'' for Mrs. Clinton, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. 
``But I don't think it will be considered over for her until they 
get their legacy back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, who logged at least 100 appearances in the 1998  
campaign, also will ``go out enthusiastically'' this year and next 
for congressional Democrats, spokeswoman Marsha Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Mrs. Clinton faring well. The latest, a  
Newsweek poll announced Saturday, showed a third of the people 
saying their opinion of her has improved during the past year, 
while 44 percent said it has remained the same. There was a 4 
percentage point margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican consultant Frank Luntz remarked with envy that Mrs.  
Clinton is ``a home run'' for campaigning Democrats. But he warned 
it will be a tightrope walk regarding those candidates aiming to 
topple the Republican House majority that impeached Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing the public doesn't want to come from this year  
of scandal -- they don't want anyone seeking revenge,'' said Luntz. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Clinton who formulated the strategy early in the  
Monica Lewinsky scandal to attack the president's accusers as part 
of a ``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' On last fall's campaign trail, 
she vilified Republicans as ``the other side,'' bent on ``defaming 
and tearing down'' Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady will campaign in the next round only as an  
advocate for the Democrats' agenda, Berry said. ``She takes her own 
future too seriously to do anything for revenge. That's stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about that future?  
</P>
<P>
	``I want a long vacation when this is all over,'' Mrs. Clinton  
laughed back in April 1997 when campaign-finance investigations 
were the rage. As for herself in elected office, she said then, 
``No, no, no. That's not anything I ever thought of for myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smart money has been on lucrative ventures -- a lecture circuit,  
another book or two, a seat at the head of a foundation or 
corporate board -- because the Clintons owe millions of dollars to 
lawyers. Or, she might claim an ambassadorship or Cabinet post if 
Vice President Al Gore succeeds Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But word now from friends and advisers is that Mrs. Clinton is  
``seriously considering'' pleas from prominent Democrats and New 
Yorkers who want her to seek in 2000 the Senate seat of retiring 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of deferring -- ``after the trial, after the trial,''  
Berry told reporters -- decision time is at hand. But, the 
spokeswoman said this week, ``I don't think a switch is going to be 
flipped overnight. People need to settle down and give her some 
time ... to think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who know Mrs. Clinton best find it hard to envision her  
abandoning her role -- a vocation, really -- as first lady to satisfy 
her separate political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be surprised,'' said Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's  
former press secretary. ``She has managed to carve an invaluable 
national and international niche as an ambassador to the world on 
behalf of women, children and families. ... I see her continuing 
that role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lattimore agreed, guessing the buzz about being a shoo-in for  
the Senate is, at best, flattering for a woman long wronged -- 
before this past year, anyway -- by public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's won hearts,'' said Lattimore. ``But she always stays  
focused on the work at hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Media consultant Mandy Grunwald, yet another former aide  
contemplating Mrs. Clinton as a candidate, said: ``I can't decide 
whether to start making ads or start laughing. ... As interesting 
as the Senate can be, the stage she is used to as first lady is so 
much broader that I think the Senate would feel confining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Mrs. Clinton does, she should keep it nonpartisan, said  
GOP consultant Luntz, lest she face a credibility issue for her 
role in allowing the president's lie denying a sexual relationship 
with Ms. Lewinsky to stand for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have talked to my husband about everything. I can state  
unequivocally that ... these are false allegations,'' she said at 
first. After his confession, she put out word that he'd deceived 
her, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel very sorry for her, but I would not mistake an  
expression of pity for an expression of political support,'' Luntz 
said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Supervision Sought at Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Federal oversight of Texas prisons should  
be preserved so long as they remain brutal places where inmates are 
preyed upon by other prisoners and guards afford little protection, 
lawyers for the inmates told a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing arguments were made Friday at the end of a three-week  
hearing to determine whether Texas will reclaim complete control 
over its prison system or if some federal oversight will be 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
	Inmates appeared during the hearing and testified about sexual  
and physical abuses that were treated with indifference by prison 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The easily forgotten aspect here is that prisoners are human  
beings. At some minimal level ... the constitution requires us to 
respect the rights of prisoners,'' said Donna Brorby, a lawyer for 
the inmates. ``The bottom line is prisoners are not safe on the 
cell block.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those inmates should not lose their federal watchdog, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state acknowledged that some inmates were  
victimized. But they argued Texas prisons have improved vastly in 
the two decades since a federal judge declared the system to be an 
unconstitutional mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual cases are sad, but the state has done what it  
can to minimize those. No state or prison has been able to wipe it 
out,'' said Solicitor General Greg Coleman. ``We have arrived at 
the point where it's time for our prison system to stand on its own 
two feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the federal judge ordered a host of reforms after trial  
of a class-action lawsuit exposed horrible overcrowding and inmate 
abuse throughout the system. Supervision of prisons was kept by the 
federal courts until 1992 when the courts gave back to the state 
most of the day-to-day controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal courts left in place several orders dealing with  
prisoner abuse and the provision of adequate medical care. Coleman 
said the need for those lingering controls has passed, and he 
pledged that state would not revert to its old ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever constitutional problems that once existed, they are  
but a memory,'' he said. ``This is a matter of state sovereignty 
and state pride. We are not looking to terminate the improvements 
and go backward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice -- the very same judge  
who originally declared the system to be unconstitutional -- has 
until March 1 to make a ruling.

<HEADLINE> Judge: SC Must Sell Drivers' Photos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina judge, saying the right  
of privacy does not extend to driver's license photos, has rejected 
the state's attempt to halt photo sales to a company that wants 
them for an anti-fraud system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case involving the traditional concepts of  
exploitation, appropriation or commercialization of one's 
likeness,'' Circuit Judge James Williams ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Safety Department sold 3.5 million driver's  
license photos to Image Data LLC of New Hampshire for $5,000. The 
company wanted the photos for tests in South Carolina aimed at 
helping businesses confirm a customer's identity when a credit card 
or personal check is used. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Houvener, president of Image Data, said the system enhances  
privacy because store customers don't have to show addresses, 
driver's license numbers and other personal information when making 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Charlie Condon had requested an  
injunction against the sale while the state proceeds with a lawsuit 
to cancel its contract with Image Data. 
</P>
<P>
	A Florida judge blocked a similar Image Data deal there and  
Colorado's governor wants to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your photograph can be bought and sold like a used car,  
what other personal information goes on the auction block next?'' 
Condon said. ``What other portion of our life will be deeded away 
by the government in the future?''

<HEADLINE> General Motors May Buy BMW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- General Motors will make an offer to buy  
Bavarian car company BMW in the next few days, a German newspaper 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors about BMW's future have been swirling since its chairman,  
Bernd Pischetsrieder, resigned last Friday amid criticism of his 
handling of BMW's British subsidiary, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW spokesman Joerg Dinner denied the report Saturday in Die  
Welt newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW wants to stay independent,'' Dinner said, adding the main  
shareholder Quandt family remained ``unbroken'' in its support of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors spokesman Dan Jankowski said, ``We wouldn't have  
any comment on the rumor of the takeover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors was one of the few companies that could afford  
BMW's price tag of $7 billion to $9 billion, Die Welt noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes one day after Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported  
Volkswagen wanted its subsidiary Audi and BMW to take a 24.9 
percent stake in each other. VW would take over the ailing Rover 
plant in Britain as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW denied that report, too, though earlier acknowledged VW has  
long been interested in acquiring at least a stake in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion in Rover since buying it  
in 1994. Analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of about $590 
million for 1998.

<HEADLINE> Warren Moon Considers His Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Warren Moon has started working on a new game  
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently released by the Seattle Seahawks, Moon said he has been  
contacted by seven NFL teams and there's a 60-70 per cent chance 
he'll play next season. If not, he'd like to join Houston 
businessman Bob McNair in his attempts to bring an NFL team to 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal right now is to look at the teams that are interested  
in me and see if any of those situations really appeal to me,'' 
Moon told Houston TV station KRIV on Friday. ``I'm also hoping the 
Seattle situation will somehow resurface again because I really 
would like to finish my career there if possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Moon was released Thursday by coach Mike  
Holmgren. The new Seahwaks coach decided to go with Jon Kitna, who 
started the final five games of last season. Holmgren also didn't 
want to pay Moon $5 million in salary to be a backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to remember that I went to Seattle the first time as a  
backup with the understanding I didn't even have a chance to 
compete for the starting job,'' Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
	If his playing career is over, Moon would like to help bring  
another NFL team to Houston where he played 10 seasons for the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have a lot of different relationships within the  
league office at the top levels that could be beneficial,'' he 
said. ``I think I know a lot about the game that could be 
beneficial.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, GOP Try To Rebuild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of scandal and shame, President  
Clinton now must try to rebuild his tarnished presidency. 
Surprisingly, he may discover some unlikely allies among the 
Republicans who tried to force him from office. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what, Clinton will go into the history books with the  
humiliating distinction of being only the second president ever 
impeached. His challenge is to make historians write in the next 
paragraph that he was a successful president nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are in trouble, too. Their zest for impeachment  
backfired and angered voters, who concluded the GOP was more 
interested in lynching Clinton than in fixing Social Security, 
Medicare and HMOs. Republicans sagged in the polls as Clinton 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his Republican adversaries share a common need to  
persuade voters that they can get things done. The president wants 
to repair his legacy; the Republicans want to save their political 
skins. Both sides are angling for advantage in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republicans are as desperate for success as Bill Clinton  
is,'' said Democratic consultant Dane Strother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there going to be personal affection? No,'' said Ralph  
Reed, a Republican strategist. ``Is there going to be a mutual 
institutional desire to get something done to save themselves in 
2000? Yes. Clinton doesn't want to lose the White House, and the 
Republicans don't want to lose the Congress. They're more apt to 
lose if they get nothing done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton steered his way through the impeachment minefield by  
proclaiming himself dedicated to the peoples' business and 
championing politically popular causes such as education and health 
care. He will stick with that successful formula, frequently 
reminding Americans they are living through the longest economic 
expansion in U.S. history. Look for more foreign travel as well, a 
traditional avenue of success for American presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	After the impeachment votes Friday, Clinton pledged to  
``rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and 
building our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a good chance Clinton and Congress could come together  
on two or three big issues such as Social Security, a big defense 
buildup and perhaps a tax cut, said Reed, former director of the 
Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend not to buy into the conventional wisdom that this has  
so soured relations between the White House and Capitol Hill that 
we're not going to see things get done,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strother said Clinton ``will feel enormous pressure to succeed  
in the last two years,'' but at the same time he won't want to make 
the Republican Congress look good. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't forget, Bill Clinton is a fantastic politician,''  
Strother said. ``He will position these issues in a way that to 
oppose him is to oppose the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the impeachment battle was under way, Clinton  
demonstrated he could control the agenda. His mantra last year to 
save Social Security short-circuited Republican hopes for a big tax 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton followed that up this year with a plan to fix Social  
Security with budget surpluses. Added to that were poll-tested 
initiatives to reform managed-care health insurance programs, to 
build more schools, hire more teachers and make schools and 
teachers accountable to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president is in a very strong position,'' White  
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed said. ``He has a strong 
centrist agenda and overwhelming public support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress needs to put the past year behind it and listen to  
the pleas of the American people to stop playing politics and start 
getting things done,'' Reed said. ``I think they will be eager to 
do that. We're always open to deathbed conversions. We won't hold 
this against them, that they've disagreed with us in the past -- if 
they come around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said  
Clinton managed to trivialize the impeachment process, stake out 
the high ground on Social Security and put Congress in the position 
of having to respond to his budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``His prospects for a significant impact on the policy debate  
over the next two years look as good as Ronald Reagan did or Dwight 
Eisenhower did,'' Buchanan said. ``The fight for the center in 
American politics is going to be rejoined over this fight over 
budget surpluses, which looks to be the fight for the next decade 
or so. Those things make him look more significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign policy front, victories have proven elusive for  
Clinton. He was instrumental in promoting the Good Friday peace 
agreement in Northern Ireland, but its eventual success is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's peacemaking efforts in the Middle East have been  
stalled, too. In Bosnia, the bloodshed has stopped, only to be 
replaced by massacres in Kosovo. Clinton hopes to demonstrate 
strong leadership on both fronts in April when leaders of 44 
nations gather in Washington for a NATO summit. He was flying to 
Mexico on Sunday to underscore his commitment to a troubled 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that domestically and overseas there will be a  
greater tendency to question motives than there would be 
otherwise,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy studies 
at Brookings. ``There's a cheesecloth now through which foreign 
policy will be viewed, like it or not.''

<HEADLINE> NFL: Redskins Owners Can't Run Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Things looked almost normal at Redskin Park  
on the first day of free agency. The general manager worked the 
phone to negotiate contracts, and a free agent stopped by for a 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday's business-as-usual routine came only after NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue intervened in the team's operations by 
declaring, in effect, that the people who own the Washington 
Redskins cannot run the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	With the owners -- the trustees of the estate of the late Jack  
Kent Cooke -- no longer able to call the shots, president John Kent 
Cooke and general manager Charley Casserly welcomed free agent 
offensive lineman Orlando Brown, who spent the last three seasons 
in Baltimore and had expected to be the Ravens' designated 
franchise player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm strictly a right tackle,'' said Brown, who would displace  
Shar Pourdanesh at that position. ``I like to beat guys up. That's 
the brute side. The left side is speed and finesse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said he was also scheduled to visit the New York Jets.  
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins' top free agent, quarterback Trent Green, will also  
be traveling. Green's agent, Jim Steiner, said his phone was 
ringing ``fast and furiously'' Friday morning. He said three teams 
expressed serious interest in the quarterback, and Green was 
scheduled to visit St. Louis today. 
</P>
<P>
	That journey could have been avoided had the Redskins been able  
to sign Green before Friday, but Cooke and Casserly claim their 
hands were tied at the negotiating table by the trustees -- a claim 
supported by Tagliabue, who gave Cooke ``full authority'' to 
operate the team until its sale is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees, through lawyers Richard Cass and James Schwab,  
flatly denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no way did the trustees prevent the Washington Redskins  
from signing any player to a contract,'' the lawyers said in a 
statement. ``Any suggestion to the contrary is simply false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's intervention was the climax of a power struggle that  
had been brewing since the trustees, acting under the direction of 
Jack Kent Cooke's will, agreed Jan. 10 to sale the Redskins to a 
group headed by Howard Milstein and Daniel Snyder for a record $800 
million. John Kent Cooke finished well behind in the bidding in a 
failed effort to keep the team in his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, there have been behind the scenes allegations that  
John Kent Cooke has played the role of sore loser and has refused 
to cooperate with the trustees. He's been buoyed by remarks from 
NFL owners, some of whom have said they would prefer that the 
younger Cooke purchase the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, some in the Cooke camp say the trustees, abiding by the  
sale contract, have allowed the Milstein-Snyder group to voice 
opinions regarding team decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	This rankled the NFL, which has ``the right to determine who the  
owners are,'' according to Tagliabue. To break the stalemate, and 
to keep the Redskins from getting burned in free agency, he came 
down on the side of Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of the owners must approve the sale of the team,  
and that won't happen until mid-March at the earliest. Milstein met 
with Tagliabue for about an hour Thursday, but he left with no 
clear indication from the commissioner regarding the status of the 
approval process. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue's move opens the question as to whether the trustees,  
as owners of the team, could fire Cooke or take any other similar 
action that owners normally have the right to take. An NFL 
spokesman declined to elaborate on Tagliabue's statement Friday, 
saying, ``It speaks for itself.'' Cooke, Milstein and Snyder 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources told The Associated Press that the league has  
yet to find anything wrong with the Milstein-Snyder bid. If the 
owners reject it, the NFL could find itself back in court, where it 
historically has not fared well.

<HEADLINE> Auburn a National Power Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Chris Porter started the fast break at one  
end of the court and trailed his teammates down the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	He was at the foul line when the jumper bounced off the rim, so  
he went airborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter caught the ball with his right hand somewhere around his  
ankles and slammed it through the basket in one stunning, 
windmill-like motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd erupted into a deafening 45-second ovation while  
Porter's teammates looked on in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe my eyes,'' guard Doc Robinson said. ``It  
was the most amazing dunk I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been that kind of unbelievable season for No. 3 Auburn,  
which hasn't been ranked this high since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter's dunk, midway through an 80-54 victory over LSU last  
Saturday, was just one of many Auburn plays destined for a 
highlight film. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers (24-1, 12-1) clinched the Southeastern Conference  
West title Saturday with a 102-61 win over Alabama, and had a 
two-game lead over No. 8 Kentucky for the regular season title 
heading into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	They've also spread basketball fever at a school known more for  
its football team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been fantastic, completely unbelievable,'' forward Bryant  
Smith said. ``Who would have ever thought we'd be able to do all 
this at a so-called football school that has never done anything in 
basketball?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, it's done some things.  
</P>
<P>
	Auburn enjoyed success during the 1980s with stars such as  
Charles Barkley and Chuck Person, but it never has been ranked No. 
1. The Tigers spent one week at No. 2 in February 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Cliff Ellis should get much of the credit for the  
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew the basketball program was headed in the wrong direction  
when he arrived from Clemson in 1994. Auburn had only one winning 
season in the six years before he arrived and was coming off an 
11-win 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis didn't waste much time. He reeled off four straight  
winning seasons and received consecutive NIT appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't enough for Ellis, who set three goals for Auburn this  
season -- win at least 20 games, win the SEC West and advance to the 
NCAA tournament for the first time in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Check, check and check.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't like to overstep ourselves, but we know we are making  
a run towards the NCAA and we feel like we have a very good chance 
to go deep into it,'' Smith said. ``It's great because I can't 
remember an Auburn team that went to the Final Four, or even the 
Elite Eight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 14 years since Person took Auburn to the West regional  
final, where it lost to Louisville. These Tigers have every reason 
to believe they're headed back. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is so special because they come to play every day,''  
Ellis said. ``You do not have to coach this team. They know what 
they want and how to go about getting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is led by Smith, a defensive stalwart and one of only  
two seniors, and Porter, a junior college transfer who electrifies 
the crowd with thundering dunks and tremendous leaping ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, which is beating opponents by an average of 22.6 points,  
has had only two close games this season. A 73-70 win at LSU -- the 
only single-digit victory -- and a 72-62 loss at Kentucky Jan. 20 
when at least half the team had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers reeled off six straight dominating wins after the  
Kentucky game. Three of those came while Porter, the team's leading 
scorer (16.2) and rebounder (8.7), was suspended for violating 
undisclosed team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much is said about Chris Porter, Chris Porter, Chris  
Porter, the other four guys get overlooked,'' Ellis said. ``Truth 
is, those other four elevate Porter's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith always has been Auburn's leader. A three-year starter, he  
averages 10.9 points, 6.2 rebounds and keeps the team focused. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a junior guard and the team's floor leader, is coming  
off a remarkable five-game streak with 28 assists and only eight 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not worried about rankings,'' Robinson said. ``Our thing  
is to win as many games as possible and bring our A-game onto the 
court every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore guard Scott Pohlman, a streaky shooter who's averaging  
11.1 points and has a team-high 45 3-pointers, is the Tigers' 
low-key voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goals may be higher now because of the way things have  
been going, but we do not talk about a national championship,'' 
Pohlman said. ``There are too many games left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The starting five is rounded out by shot-blocking center Mamadou  
N'diaye, a 7-foot junior who's still learning the game. Even so, he 
already owns Auburn's career record for blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no one person that is the key to this team,'' Ellis  
said. ``They remind me of a machine. Everything is in place and 
they just go out there and play. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why they win and that's why they are so special.''

<HEADLINE> QVC Auditions Packed With Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *BY RON TODT   	
</P>
<P>
	WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- They arrived by the dozens, waiting  
hours for their alloted two minutes and a chance to talk intimately 
about the joys of collectible dolls, dog leashes, foot massagers 
and all manner of bric-a-brac. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mission: become on-air salespeople for QVC, the television  
shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors, broadcasters, recent graduates and stay-at-home moms  
lined up early Friday for an all-day open call at QVC, trying to 
win one of two dozen coveted sales jobs at the West Chester-based 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners earn a chance to talk for three hours a day about,  
for example, the joys of sterling marcasite demi-hoop earrings -- 
not to be confused with sterling marcasite amethyst earrings, or 
sterling marcasite overlay onyx pendants, or sterling marcasite 
hand-carved cameo bracelets. All available at substantial savings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot of talking,'' said Lisa Robinson, who has been  
selling QVC merchandise on-air for four years. ``If you were 
constantly told to be quiet in school, this could be your 
profession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trish Troilo, 33, of Philadelphia, did not bring a product of  
her own to hawk and worried about her audition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sitting here thinking, 'What do I have with me that I know  
well enough?''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have lots of jewelry,'' suggested Sarah Tinder, 22, from  
West Chester. ``Pretend it's Diamondique.'' That's QVC's brand-name 
cubic zirconium. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no stage lights or makeup for applicants when they  
finally got to the interview room. They simply sat at a table, 
looked into the camera, and heard Jack Comstock, a QVC vice 
president, tell them that he was not looking for a fact-filled 
sales pitch, only an easy conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, that's all I'm looking for, someone who has that  
little spark,'' Comstock said. ``You've got to have that ability to 
really talk to the camera as if it truly was your best friend. If 
we find one or two today, I'll be extremely happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duanne Castellani of King of Prussia waited almost three hours  
before she got to share her Kermit doll dressed in a full tuxedo 
with tails. Castellani made much of the doll's smile and 
durability, its pinstriped trousers and cummerbund, and its ``real 
Kermit-green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of my all-time favorites,'' she said, as sons Adam,  
7, and Jake, 6, looked on. ``I collect these, and I kind of have an 
eye for what to look for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others brought stuffed bears, charm bracelets, a pocket tool and  
an AM-FM headphone radio. 
</P>
<P>
	One man demonstrated a laptop computer but brought along a  
low-tech alternative -- a wooden Australian foot massager. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the product was more perishable.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's often said that you never forget your first love. Well, a  
lot of us, myself included, consider chocolate to be their first 
love, their only love and their truest passion.'' said Denise 
Barton, smiling brightly at the camera and displaying a dish of 
popcorn hand-dipped in white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have zero cholesterol, you have no fat, you have no  
sodium, you have high fiber -- this is about the healthiest thing 
you could possibly have for a snack,'' Barton enthused. 
</P>
<P>
	QVC said only five to 10 of the 400 folks who auditioned Friday  
would be invited back for a second performance, and Barton, 31, 
made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see if she can sell something totally different,''  
said Comstock, who sometimes pulls an object out of his pockets and 
asks candidates to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a stay-at-home mom from Morton who once worked in  
sales, said she ``came out of retirement for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some people are born salespeople, but I think in a way  
they can teach you that -- but they can't give you a personality,'' 
she said. ``You've got two minutes to prove you have the one thing 
they can't give you. If you don't give them that in two minutes, 
then forget it.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Republicans Backed Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLOWELL, Maine (AP) -- Maine's habit of rewarding political  
independence is facing a new test after its two Republican senators 
were among those who broke ranks and voted to acquit President 
Clinton of impeachment articles. 
</P>
<P>
	Within the state GOP, some are rankled at the votes of U.S.  
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, others resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a core of our constituency -- a very large core who  
help us elect Republicans -- very, very upset about the votes,'' 
Maine Republican Party Chairwoman Kathy Watson told about 60 
members of the Republican State Committee on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither senator attended the regularly scheduled meeting, though  
both sent their Washington chiefs of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no open rebellion, though GOP activists were lukewarm  
and chose their words carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that each rank-and-file Republican, even though they  
may not like it, they're going to have to live with it,'' said Doc 
Birdwell, the Republican chairman in Aroostook County from Collins' 
hometown of Caribou in northernmost Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, Collins mingled easily with party loyalists at  
the Androscoggin County Republican Committee's Lincoln Day Dinner 
Saturday night in Lewiston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very good. ... Even those constituents  
who disagree with my position, once I explain it, they 
understand,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	In breaking ranks from the national party, the votes by Snowe  
and Collins recalled Republican William Cohen's crossover a 
quarter-century ago to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen went on to carve out a reputation as a maverick in the  
House and Senate before ending up in Clinton's Cabinet as defense 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Split roughly by thirds over the years among Democrats,  
Republicans and independents, Maine voters have elected two 
independent governors including incumbent Angus King in modern 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Ross Perot even edged part-time resident George Bush in  
the state's presidential balloting, though Clinton carried the 
state then and again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right wing to the Republican Party in every state,  
but it's weaker in Maine than most places,'' said Oliver Woshinsky, 
a professor of political science at the University of Southern 
Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Potholm, a professor of government at Bowdoin College,  
pegged the political harm from Friday's votes by Snowe and Collins 
at an emphatic ``none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a few weeks of ``moaning or groaning'' by some  
Republicans, but that's all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give them both credit for doing what they both think was  
right and in the best interest of the country,'' he said. ``But 
having voted their conscience, it strengthened their position 
because most people in Maine agree with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Snowe is one of three Republican New Englanders up for  
re-election next year -- from states that Clinton carried in 1996 -- 
who voted against removing Clinton from office. The others were 
James Jeffords of Vermont and John Chafee from Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins won't face the voters before 2002.  
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a poll taken as the Senate began deliberations by  
Strategic Marketing Services showed that about two-thirds of Maine 
voters approved of the job the president has been doing and wanted 
him to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committeeman Ken Cole said Saturday that  
Snowe and Collins are more likely to benefit than suffer for their 
stands, whatever the short term reaction within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``They listened to all the evidence, I didn't,'' Cole said. ``As  
much as everybody says that was an easy way out for them, I don't 
think so. I think it was a hard way out for them.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Lead U.S. Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss will lead  
one of the most inexperienced contingents to the World Figure 
Skating Championships in U.S history. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, a two-time world champion (1996, '98), and third-place  
finisher Angela Nikodinov both are 18. U.S. nationals runner-up 
Naomi Nari Nam is only 13 and too young to go to worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be replaced by Sarah Hughes, who also is 13, but can go  
to worlds because of an International Skating Union rule allowing 
medalists at the World Junior Championships to compete at the next 
worlds. Hughes was second in that event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a deplorable instance of age discrimination,'' said Nari  
Nam's coach, John Nicks. ``She's been discriminated against all 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born on July 6, 1985, Nari Nam missed the cutoff date for the  
1999 junior worlds tryouts by five days. She will be eligible to go 
to next year's worlds, but only if she finishes in the top three at 
nationals and then medals at the junior world championships, 
scheduled for March 5-12, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior worlds are March 19-26, 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure our association will be taking steps to remedy the  
situation,'' Nicks said, referring to the U.S. Figure Skating 
Association, which can petition for an exception to the age rule. 
``It can affect the U.S. entries of future world championships. 
There's a lot of ramifications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Weiss, a first-time U.S. champion, will be Trifun  
Zivanovic and Timothy Goebel. Both will make their debuts at senior 
worlds, as will Nikodinov. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs group includes Kyoko Ina, who was to four worlds with  
former partner Jason Dungjen. She and new partner John Zimmerman 
were second at nationals to Danielle and Steve Hartsell, who also 
will make their world debut. So will Laura Handy and J. Paul 
Dinnebose, third this week. 
</P>
<P>
	In dance, Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won the U.S. crown  
and make their first trip to the world championships. Runners-up 
Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates went in 1997, finishing 17th.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Stage 2nd Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One week into a cramped, lockout-shortened  
season, the Washington Wizards are getting a six-day break. No one 
is complaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play four games, another training camp,'' guard Mitch  
Richmond said. ``We need it. Definitely. We need to get a rhythm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other team, the Boston Celtics, will have such a long  
layoff, an odd scheduling quirk in a season in which teams, 
including the Wizards, will be playing three consecutive nights. It 
happened in part because this weekend would have been the All-Star 
break under the original schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of watching 3-point shootouts or slam dunk  
competitions, the Wizards are staging a second training camp of 
sorts. There won't be three-a-days or even two-a-days, but it is a 
chance to review film from the team's 1-3 start and give new 
players, such as Richmond, and late camp arrival Rod Strickland a 
chance to build some badly needed chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the last time we're going to be able to have  
this kind of contact,'' coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. ``Because 
once this is over, you're playing 16 games in 24 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland, who re-signed one day before the season opener after  
bitter contract negotiations, was especially grateful for the 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we can get together as a whole unit,'' Strickland said.  
``I know I have a ways to go, no doubt about it. But I know it's 
going to come. It's going to take getting my legs underneath me so 
I can play hard night in and night out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland says he hurt the team defensively in Wednesday's  
101-88 loss at New York, but there's plenty of blame to go around 
on that end of the floor. Opposing teams are shooting 54 percent 
from the field in the first half, averaging 52 points. The Wizards 
have yet to hold a halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday morning, coach Bernie Bickerstaff reviewed film from two  
of the four games, focusing on defense. It's back to the film room 
for the other two games Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about team defense,'' Bickerstaff said. ``This is  
something you learn in junior high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bickerstaff said his players' effort was fine, but he  
acknowledged of wide array of problems: no bone fide starting 
center, lack of chemistry between Strickland and Richmond and 
spotty play off the bench. But at this point, there's no use 
wishing the team had more talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality,'' he said, ``is this is what we have.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Losing Players Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The first day of the 1999 free-agent season was like quite a few  
others: The Pittsburgh Steelers lost players. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important was Carnell Lake, the versatile  
safety-cornerback who signed with Jacksonville, Pittsburgh's AFC 
rival. The signing came only a day after Pittsburgh declined to 
protect the 31-year-old 10-year veteran with a franchise player 
tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake will rejoin Dom Capers, the new Jacksonville defensive  
coordinator as the Jaguars try to revamp a defense that finished 
25th overall in the NFL. Capers, the former Carolina coach, was 
defensive coordinator in Pittsburgh during Lake's early years 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our style has always been to be well-organized and to strike  
fast,'' said coach Tom Coughlin of the Jaguars, who also raided 
another division rival, Tennessee, for defensive tackle Gary 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt we're a better defensive team with these two players  
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, which made the playoffs for six straight seasons  
until last year despite its free-agent losses, also lost linebacker 
Donta Jones, who signed with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	And New England's punter Tom Tupa, who can also serve as a  
backup quarterback, chose the New York Jets over Cleveland, 
rejoining coach Bill Parcells, for whom he played with the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, teams continued to re-sign their best players in what  
looks like a free-agent season like last year's, when most of the 
top players remained where they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's All-Pro middle linebacker, Zach Thomas, agreed to a  
$22.5 million, 5-year deal with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always concerned about giving big bonuses and a big  
contract to a player,'' coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``But with Zach, 
you're never going to be concerned about that because you know that 
every day, he's going to give 100 percent. He'll always make you 
proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins also added running back Tyrone Wheatley from the  
New York Giants for a seventh-round draft choice. Wheatley, the 
Giants' first-round pick in 1995, was in trouble from the start 
with the two coaches for whom he played -- first Dan Reeves and then 
Jim Fassel -- and was active for only five games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moves involved teams keeping their own.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota re-signed safety Robert Griffith, who could have  
become a free agent and Green Bay did the same with defensive 
tackle Santana Dotson and linebacker George Koonce. 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receivers Antonio Freeman of Green Bay, Arizona's Rob Moore  
and San Francisco's Terrell Owens were designated franchise 
players, meaning their teams can match the offers or let them go 
for two first-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The most desirable players left unrestricted include cornerback  
Dale Carter of Kansas City; wide receiver J.J. Stokes of San 
Francisco; defensive end Chad Bratzke of the Giants; linebackers 
Jamir Miller of Arizona and Ed McDaniel of Minnesota; and offensive 
linemen Orlando Brown and Wally Williams of Baltimore and Dave 
Wohlabaugh of New England. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the busiest teams are the 49ers and Browns, who are  
somewhat intertwined because Cleveland is being run by Carmen 
Policy and Dwight Clark, who were with San Francisco as recently as 
a last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	They made one deal.  
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, continuing to cut salaries, sent defensive end Roy  
Barker and tight end Irv Smith to Cleveland for past 
considerations. But a deal to send backup quarterback Ty Detmer to 
the Browns was apparently put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns also brought linebacker Chris Spielman, who hasn't  
played a down in the NFL since 1997, in for a workout and a 
physical. Spielman, 33, belongs to Buffalo, which gave him 
permission to talk to the Browns after sitting out the 1998 season 
while his wife, Stefanie, was treated for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The other teams, meanwhile, continued to watch expansion  
Cleveland, which has $40 million in cap room left after its 
expansion draft -- far more than any other team. That allows them to 
outbid anyone for players, even if they have to overpay them, the 
main reason the 49ers protected Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to get anyone they want,'' Colts president Bill  
Polian said of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Not quite.  
</P>
<P>
	The Browns wanted Tupa, a former star at Ohio State. He was even  
present at the news conference when they introduced their coach, 
Chris Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he joined the Jets.

	Senate Votes To Acquit Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton won bipartisan acquittal in  
the Senate yesterday. Two Senate votes fell far short of the 
two-thirds needed to convict. The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 
against, with 10 Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not 
guilty. The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with 
five Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats. After the 
votes, Clinton told Americans he was ``profoundly sorry'' for what 
he said and did in the Monica Lewinsky affair that triggered it 
all. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton May Send Troops To Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce in his radio  
address that the United States is prepared to contribute ground 
troops to a NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo if Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians agree to a political settlement, a senior administration 
official said yesterday night. Any decision to send U.S. troops 
would depend upon Serbs and ethnic Albanians reaching an agreement 
to end their fighting, U.S. officials said, speaking on condition 
of anonymity.

	Judge To Rule on American Today

	DALLAS (AP) -- Swarms of anxious holiday travelers were left  
stranded when American Airlines again scrubbed more than a thousand 
flights yesterday after its pilots defied a court order and 
continued their mass sickout. Today, a federal judge is set to rule 
on whether the pilots be held in contempt for ignoring a 
back-to-work order he issued. The nation's second-largest airline 
has canceled hundreds of flights for all of the long holiday 
weekend.

	Ukraine May Face AIDS Outbreak  
</P>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Health authorities in Ukraine may be  
spreading HIV by using blood transfusions from infected people who 
were tested on faulty equipment, a former top AIDS official 
charged. Ukraine's government banned imports of HIV-testing 
equipment in January 1998 to support domestic industry and cut 
costs by using cheaper, Ukrainian-made testers. But the domestic 
testers are detecting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in only 
about 40 percent of cases, Valeriy Ivasiuk, former chairman of the 
state committee for AIDS prevention, said yesterday.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A 10-man gang armed with  
knives attacked a group of 19 American tourists who were visiting a 
preschool in a black township yesterday. The robbers interrupted a 
play being presented at the school, forcing Americans who sat in 
the audience with local children to empty their pockets and hand 
over passports, jewelry and cameras, said Inspector Gideon 
Thessner, the police spokesman. There were no injuries.

	FDA Approves New Hepatitis C Test  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government approved a more accurate test  
for hepatitis C yesterday, a move that could help blood banks more 
accurately track people who may have caught the dangerous liver 
virus from pre-1992 blood transfusions. Under new government rules, 
blood banks are testing leftover samples of pre-1992 transfusions. 
When a test indicates a batch of blood could have contained 
hepatitis C, hospitals will track people who received that blood 
and urge them to be checked for infection.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell yesterday, led by a decline in  
technology shares as the Dow dropped 88.57 to close at 9,274.89. On 
the NYSE, losers led gainers 2,235-824. Broader stock indicators 
also fell, including the technology-laden Nasdaq, which was down

	Sampras Wins at Sybase With 12 Aces  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- He began with an ace and ended with  
another. In between, Pete Sampras had 10 other aces and a move that 
would have made most ballet dancers proud. The top-seeded Sampras, 
who has not faced a break point throughout the tournament, reached 
the semifinals of the Sybase Open with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Bernd 
Karbacher last night. Sampras will play third-seeded Mark 
Philippoussis, a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0) winner over Justin Gimelstob, 
today.

<HEADLINE> Fans Bid Farewell to Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- From tears to belligerence, emotions ran high at  
Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night as sometimes raucous fans 
gathered for the historic arena's final NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hordes of revelers pushed and shoved their way into the  
yellow stone building as a lone trumpeter played the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $600 for the worst seats in the house and  
nobody batted an eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,500  
for a pair of mid-level seats for himself and his 13-year-old son, 
Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high for 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, fans wept openly and fights broke out over game  
programs, which sold out long before the puck was dropped for the 
Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks to end NHL hockey's 68-year 
history in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, just bear with us for a few minutes --  
please!'' urged program vendor Rich Bremner, clearly alarmed as 
hundreds of people crowded into a corner of the arena seeking $10 
glossy game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never changes here,'' complained bystander Beth Kerchove,  
who waited in line for 20 minutes to buy a corned beef sandwich. 
``They never accommodate their fans and they never had enough 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a shoving match broke out in line, a policeman beseeched the  
zealous fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we don't want anybody to get hurt here,'' he said with  
a nervous smile. ``We're all here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers grew belligerent when they were told they could  
only buy one program each. Worried vendors tried to reassure them 
that programs were still for sale at city book stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end it got a little bit tense,'' said constable Peter  
Phillipo of Toronto police, who often works at the Maple Leafs 
games. ``But we don't anticipate many problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the nostalgic post-game show was still going on, thousands of  
fans encircled two city blocks, shut down for the celebration. They 
played street hockey, waved flags, cheered and chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teen boys caught up in the revelry, scaled the Maple Leaf  
Gardens sign and did a little dance. They came down after five 
minutes and were not caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are like fleas on the big dog,'' said constable  
Tim McMannus, one of a line of cops circling the crowds' perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The home team's 6-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks didn't seem  
to diminish the spirit of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad game, good party,'' said Peter Florian, who had painted  
blue leafs on his face and dressed for the occasion in a goalie's 
mask and blue and white team paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd just before game time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Reason, 86, began to weep as announcer Paul Morris noted  
that it was the last night for the Maple Leafs and the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here the first year it opened, in 1931,'' said Reason,  
decked out in a Maple Leafs jersey. ``But I was from Quebec, so I 
was a Canadiens fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans used to yell at me when I cheered for my team, and  
call me a swamp singer: a frog. But my husband brought me over to 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason's son, Jim, said he bought pricey tickets for himself and  
his mother because he had such fond childhood memories of attending 
games with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hot dog and a soda and I was happy in the greys (the worst  
seats in the house),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath rows of black-and-white photos of former Maple Leafs  
greats in the arena's hallways, vendors hawked T-shirts, 
sweatshirts, collector's plates and silver and bronze commemorative 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
	T-shirts reading ``I was there for the last game, February 13,  
1999'' were selling fast, said vendor Ernie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're cleaned right out,'' Williams said at mid-game. ``But we  
anticipated this. We set up at 10 a.m. and we've been going all 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the audience, thousands of fans wearing Maple Leaf colors  
resembled an uneven blue-and-white patchwork quilt. They sang 
songs, snapped photos and cheered at the most minor of plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's talking to each other,'' marveled Maureen  
Bellmore, 27. ``It's crazy, everybody's sharing in the moment, 
everybody's so pumped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellmore was particularly happy that the Maple Leafs were  
leaving the fabled hockey shrine on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing incredible this year, which makes this night all  
the more exciting.''
