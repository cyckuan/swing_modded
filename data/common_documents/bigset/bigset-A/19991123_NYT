UCLA MISSING THE POINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's spin masters are at it again, this time
putting a positive twist on Baron Davis' departure to the NBA.
Although they won't bash Baron directly, school officials and
basketball staffers have hinted for weeks _ with straight faces, no
less _ that they'll be better without the draft's No. 3 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasoning goes something like this: As the point guard and
best player, Davis dominated the ball and took all the important
shots. That made the opponent's job easy: Stop Davis, stop UCLA.
Without Davis, the Bruins are diversified, thus harder to defend.
That, they claim, will make them more successful.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, they might be right. Perhaps this team is better
than the Davis-led version of a year ago. It's older, wiser
(presumably) and stronger, and it has fabulous freshman Jason
Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   But no way are these Bruins better without Davis than with him.
Just ask the Pac-10 coaches. They couldn't wave goodbye fast
enough. What's next from the UCLA spinmeisters? Dan Gadzuric:
better than Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   At least the players get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baron's a once-in-a-lifetime player,'' UCLA junior
guard/forward Rico Hines said. ``We'd be great with him. We could
be great without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have gone from dictatorship to democracy, from one
star to six moons. In theory, if the defense collapses on the big
men, Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso, the Bruins will strike from long
range. If defense extends to the perimeter to stop Earl Watson, Ray
Young, JaRon Rush and Kapono, the Bruins will pound it inside.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great, but so does a second-half lead over Detroit Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   To improve on last year's 22-9 record and survive the first
round of the NCAA Tournament _ much less the Sweet 16 _ the Bruins
must resolve the following issues:
</P>
<P>
   __ Floor leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This means you, Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was a maestro in the open court. Now, it's Watson's
responsibility to set the offense, direct the personnel and
distribute the ball on the fast break. Can he do it? Unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as a secondary ballhandler, Watson had 142 assists
and 127 turnovers. Last week, in a ragged exhibition game, he threw
the same risky passes _ including those halfcourt alley-oops _ he
tried as a freshman and sophomore. Officially, he had three
turnovers in the exhibition; unofficially, six.
</P>
<P>
   __ Late-game scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was UCLA's best clutch performer last year. He had the
talent and confidence to take _ and usually make _ the winning
shot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, if the Bruins trail Oregon by one point in the final
seconds in rowdy McArthur Court, who fills that void? Coach Steve
Lavin believes the Bruins will be tougher to defend in those
situations because any of five players could take the shot. But can
any of them make the shot?
</P>
<P>
   __ Personnel questions.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it's a talented roster. But there are several players
with potential problems, problems that could derail the collective.
</P>
<P>
   Will Gadzuric's tendinitis-ravaged knees survive the season? And
is he willing to play through the inevitable pain?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stay healthy and it starts with Dan,'' Hines said.
``He gives us an inside presence. He sets the tone defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Moiso, whose talent is exceeded only by his self-doubt,
become a forceful and physical presence in the low post? He and
Gadzuric are two halves of a fabulous whole, one skilled (Moiso),
one physical (Gadzuric).
</P>
<P>
   Will reserve forward Matt Barnes solve his academic problems and
become eligible after the fall quarter? As one of two frontcourt
reserves _ Sean Farnham is the other _ Barnes is a valuable
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our biggest concern is frontcourt depth when you
add injuries and potential foul trouble,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   What of guard Ray Young's injured right (shooting) thumb?
Without surgery, there's a chance the partially torn ligament will
nag him throughout the season. The Bruins desperately need his
3-point marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's troubled sophomore forward JaRon Rush, whose
pressure-filled personal life has been well-documented. Can Rush
last the season without an emotional crisis or lapse in judgment?
</P>
<P>
   __ Halfcourt offense.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it's called a high one-four, with an initiator
stationed 25 feet from the basket and four players positioned along
the foul line extended. It's designed to spread the court and
create room for Gadzuric and Moiso to maneuver in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the freewheeling motion offense Lavin ran for
three years, the one-four requires precision passes, cuts and
screens. It relies less on athleticism and more on skill _
something the Bruins failed to display last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's either a brilliant stroke or a desperate move. The answer,
like UCLA's fate, won't be clear for months.

SPRINT PUTS A FRESH FACE ON ITS PHONE SERVICE PITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years, Sprint
brought us Candice Bergen as the Dime Lady. Well, ladies and
gentlemen, say hello to Sela Ward, who will perhaps become known as
the Nickel Lady as the new pitch person for Sprint.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her new role, Ward, currently starring on ABC's ``Once and
Again'' as a divorcee struggling with sex, dating and kids, will
tout the goods on Sprint's local and long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ward has been doing voiceover work for Sprint for about
a year, most recently on its Sprint Nickel Nights launch this past
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Field, Sprint's director of marketing, said the
telecommunications giant deliberately chose a woman, first for
voiceovers and now as a representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint has always been more of a female voice,'' Field said.
``Trust me, we get a lot of guys who call and ask a bunch of
questions and then say, `Well, let me call you back after I talk to
my wife.' Women are the telecommunications decision makers in the
household.''
</P>
<P>
   Field said Ward's voice was rich and resonating.
</P>
<P>
   And on the camera? Well, wow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for somebody who could come across as
extremely honest and trustworthy,'' Field said. ``And I can tell
you, when you see her on camera, she just eats the lens.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to tip the competition, Field declined to elaborate
on the story line for the ads, which will break next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will say it's pretty straightforward,'' Field said.
``It's Sela on camera in situations where consumers cannot only
hear about the product but have a visual representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Aylward, president of Kansas City advertising agency
Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners, said there was no hard and fast rule
as to when an advertiser should use a celebrity to pitch its wares.
Barkley Evergreen has no ties to Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say Sela Ward is as relevant to Sprint as Paul Reiser
is to AT&AMP;T or Michael Jordan and Elmer Fudd are to MCI,'' Aylward
said. ``In fact, if anything, I'd say she's a little fresher, a
little hotter and has more momentum than the others I mentioned, so
given that, it's probably a smart move.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, many men, including Anthony F. Ferrugia, an A.G.
Edwards analyst who follows Sprint, have no clue as to who Sela
Ward is. Or at least they don't recognize her name.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferrugia said to him that didn't make any difference. He
trusts Sprint to be a savvy marketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, Sprint was known as an engineering company that
was all thumbs when it came to marketing, but as we moved through
the early and mid-1990s, Sprint sort of grew up and they got to be
pretty good at marketing,'' Ferrugia said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also raises the specter of the looming merger between
Sprint and MCI WorldCom and how, if it's completed, it will affect
Sprint's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in another year or so what they do at 2330 Shawnee
Mission Parkway isn't going to make any difference anyway because
it's all going to be coming out of Jackson, Miss.,'' Ferrugia said.
``But until then, this is the Sprint we all know and love.''

FARMLAND-CENEX MERGER VOTE TODAY FOLLOWS A RANCOROUS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Today is election day
in the biggest merger of farm cooperatives ever. Win or lose, the
co-ops' leaders will emerge a bit shell-shocked by a surprisingly
rancorous and sometimes bitter campaign.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vote is whether Kansas City-based Farmland Industries Inc.
and Minnesota-based Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives should merge.
They want to become United Country Brands starting March 1, with
the headquarters in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, they're the two biggest farmer-owned co-ops in the
nation. Still, they say they need this merger to compete with
agriculture's even-bigger investor-owned corporations: Cargill
Inc., ConAgra Inc., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and others.
</P>
<P>
   But in the country, where the farmer-owners are smarting from a
steep recession in agriculture, debate hasn't centered on this
reshaping of the agrarian landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that ever went wrong in agriculture is an issue in
this campaign,'' said Noel Estenson, chief executive officer of
Cenex Harvest States.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest discontent has come from the Cenex side. And that
means the strongest attacks have been against Farmland, one of the
area's few Fortune 500 businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have called the merger a Farmland financial rescue.
Members on both sides also have chafed against multimillion-dollar
merger payments to top co-op officers.
</P>
<P>
   The vilification got so strong that Farmland chief Harry Cleberg
sent a memo last month to all employees, defending the
organization's financial condition and the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The most heartfelt dissent has questioned whether managers of
the cooperatives are still working for their farmer-owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our co-op heritage,'' said Steve Carney, a Montana
farmer and national Cenex director who is fighting the merger. ``Up
here in the northern tier of states, there's a strong sentiment
that they're out to jab the farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg and Estenson announced the merger in May, saying members
had asked them to make it happen. The co-ops had failed in earlier
attempts to merge. And these managers thought they had found a way,
promising $500 million in savings to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson said experts had warned that the four biggest battles
from members would be about the merged co-op's name, its
headquarters, its chairman and its chief executive officer. It
hasn't turned out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of those are on your list,'' he said of the campaign's
hot topics.
</P>
<P>
   And that has caught Cleberg, Estenson and others by surprise.
Although both executives think they have the majority of their
members behind them, a vocal minority in opposition has at least
Estenson uncertain about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Approval requires a two-thirds vote by both co-ops. Results are
expected to be announced today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident the Farmland ownership community will pass
the consolidation with a rather significant margin,'' Cleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the benefits of the merger were clear to all but a
few Cenex members in the north, who were ``uncomfortable with
anything that is going on'' in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson said the Cenex vote was too close to call. Opponents
had tapped into the ``negative energy'' in several Northern states
where farm conditions are particularly depressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In heading off a dispute over who would lead United Country
Brands, Cleberg and Estenson ignited a firestorm of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The two chief executive officers agreed that neither of them
could take the helm and expect owners of the other co-op to approve
the deal. So each agreed to retire after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   As they leave, each will take away the equivalent of three
years' salary and bonus in addition to what they normally would
make this year. Outsiders have estimated the payoff at $7 million
for the two men combined.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson said that figure was ``way too high'' but didn't offer
another number. Cleberg didn't offer a number either. But his
salary and bonuses, disclosed through public documents, indicate
his payment would be at least $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, even some who like the merger have focused on the
exit payments.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Kreuscher, a 78-year-old Farmland member and former state
agriculture official in Nebraska, urged one Farmland director to
tie the payments to the success of the merger. Put the money in an
escrow account for three years, Kreuscher said. If the merger pays
off, then the exiting managers can collect. His idea hasn't been
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuscher said he opposed the merger only because of the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that anybody who supports the farmer-producer
would support these transition payments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said the payments were part of a plan covering 44
Farmland and Cenex managers to ensure they focus on making the
merger happen rather than on saving their jobs in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The money also ensures the co-ops won't lose their essential
managers to corporate headhunters sent out by rivals during the
merger, Cleberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers covered by the plan will get an extra year's pay for
making the merger happen. Those whose jobs are at risk would get an
additional year's pay if they do get laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg and Estenson will get essentially a third year's pay
because they've agreed not only to retire early but also to not
compete with United Country Brands and remain as consultants until
they're 65. Both men are 61.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carlson, president of the North Dakota Farmers Union and
a Cenex member, is fighting the merger. Carlson contends Farmland
is over its head in debt. A ``very shaky'' Farmland, he said, needs
to merge with Cenex to gain access to its capital resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a Farmland member, I'd be for it because it's looking
like my co-op is in trouble,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Carney shares Carlson's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A national director for Cenex, Carney voted against the merger
when 85 percent of the board agreed to recommend it to members. In
the past, he'd lost on other issues and still supported the board's
majority. But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Carney sent members a long letter focusing on Farmland's debt,
challenging the merger payments to executives and raising many
questions about the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My issue is Farmland's financial troubles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those troubles, he thinks, is an enormous potential tax
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The liability stems from a 1983 sale of a Farmland operation
called Terra Resources Inc. After a decade of debate, the Internal
Revenue Service rejected Farmland's tax treatment on the gain and
demanded $70.8 million more in taxes. Farmland and the IRS went to
tax court in 1993, and the case still is unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 16-year dispute, interest on the original tax
bill has ballooned the potential tax liability to more than $400
million. The merger itself is estimated to save $500 million over
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said a decision to speed up the merger had triggered
more weariness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes some of our members suspicious that there's something
else about to drop out there, maybe Farmland's tax liability,''
Carlson said. i 41.98 ]
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg rebutted charges that Farmland needs Cenex's capital,
has more debt than it can handle or would strain from losing the
tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Farmland's above-average debt levels were intentional.
He said the co-op traditionally had borrowed more heavily than
others so it could build new business lines, establish the Farmland
consumer brand and create a $104 million information system that
not only avoids the year 2000 computer bug but also would be the
system United Country Brands uses if the merger happens.
</P>
<P>
   Had Farmland not borrowed as it has, he said, it would still be
a relatively small company, with no hope of challenging rivals such
as Cargill.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg and Estenson said United Country Brands planned to rely
less on debt than Farmland has. Savings from the merger will be
used in part to reduce debt, Estenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland's higher debt isn't cause for concern, said Kenneth
Drucker, a analyst of co-ops for Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp., the
credit rating agency. Farmland will be fine without the merger, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Standard &AMP; Poor's doesn't give Farmland a stellar credit
rating. Farmland's BB\P rating falls one notch short of being an
investment grade rating, making it the best speculative grade
rating S&AMP;P offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do carry quite a bit of debt for an agricultural
company,'' Drucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker also said the Terra tax case was an important issue,
though hard to quantify. Losing the case wouldn't threaten
Farmland's ability to pay its bills, he said, but it would cause
Standard &AMP; Poor's to reassess its credit rating for the co-op.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Cenex owner, that's definitely something I'd be
concerned about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg and Estenson said Cenex members didn't need to worry.
Plans for paying the tax, if Farmland loses the case, shield Cenex
members' equity, they said. And though it would mean adding debt to
make the payment immediately, funds to cover the borrowings over
time are available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took all the members through all of that...,'' Cleberg
said. ``It's a nonevent for the Cenex Harvest States owners coming
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts hired by the co-ops have calculated that United Country
Brands would save between $84 million and $140 million a year.
Thirty percent of that would come from combining their agronomy
operations and their feed operations in joint ventures, although
they could do such joint ventures without merging otherwise.
Another 30 percent would come from cutting transportation costs in
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said, however, that the biggest part of the savings, 40
percent, would come from the corporate side. This includes cutting
306 jobs in administration. The co-ops together employ 22,000
worldwide. Farmland has 2,000 employees locally.
</P>
<P>
   Drucker said he hadn't passed judgment on the merger. He'll wait
to see the vote before meeting with the co-ops. He thinks, however,
that the vocal discontent stirred by the merger probably has more
to do with the farm recession than the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going through difficult times,'' he said. ``If
this merger were done in good times ... you probably wouldn't be
getting those comments.''
</P>
<P>
   But merger opponents have questioned the very underpinnings of
the co-ops. Kreuscher and Carney complain that their local co-ops
don't treat them any better than commercial competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend is to take care more of the employee than the
farmer,'' Kreuscher said. ``And I'm not the only one who believes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney said the co-op's grain prices often weren't competitive _
that the co-op is trying to make too much money off its own
farmer-owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us we have to think more like a corporation, like
Cargill. I want to be a co-op again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they're unhappy, Carney, Carlson and Kreuscher each
said he would remain with the co-op system.
</P>
<P>
   Cleberg said that, win or lose, Farmland would hold its usual
winter meetings with members and take on any problem, ``whether
it's real or perceived,'' that was stirred during the merger
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Estenson also plans to get out to the country after this
election and dress some wounds. He wants to hear what members
expect of their co-op and make sure they realize what the co-op has
done for them.

SEARCH IS ON FOR HEIRS TO $30 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A man from London
showed up in Kansas City on Monday looking for two persons who may
have been born in Kansas in the early 1960s.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why? They may have $15 million coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual story of murdered millionaire Horst ``Hans''
Grahlmann and the search for his heirs will be told in an upcoming
episode of America's Most Wanted, tentatively scheduled for 8 p.m.
Dec. 4 on the Fox Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere sitting there is this estate, and we are trying to
sort it out,'' said Kenneth Crutchlow of London, who held a news
conference Monday at the Westin Crown Center hotel. ``Kansas, we
believe, is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahlmann, 57, was killed with an assault weapon in his northern
California home in Monte Rio on Oct. 23, 1998. Also killed was
Jason Aaron Blore, 26, who worked at one of Grahlmann's bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma County Sheriff's Department has yet to establish a
motive, Detective Russell Davidson said Monday. Four persons who
had disputes with Grahlmann and one who had a dispute with Blore
have been cleared, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hope a re-enactment of the crime on the television
program will produce new leads, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible someone might know something about a hunting knife
that the killer is believed to have dropped, Davidson said. The
knife hasn't been manufactured since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Grahlmann owned a string of bars and nightclubs in and around
San Francisco, most of which catered to gays and lesbians. He made
a fortune in real estate, and left an estate valued at $12 million
to $15 million. No will has been found, and there is a tussle over
who should get his money.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hackett, a former business partner of Grahlmann who is the
trustee for a trust that Grahlmann set up in 1988, said Grahlmann
told him that he had walked out on a woman and two children in
Kansas sometime in the early 1960s. Hackett says he believes those
children and the woman _ if she was his wife _ should share in the
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are out there, I sure...would like to find them,''
Hackett said in a telephone interview from a small town north of
San Francisco. ``That's what this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he also believes that the fortune should be shared
by the heirs of a man with whom Grahlmann lived for 20 years.
Hackett believes he himself is entitled to about $175,000 from his
business dealings with Grahlmann.
</P>
<P>
   No beneficiary list for the trust has surfaced, and Hackett said
he didn't even know he was the trustee until February. He has filed
a claim against the court-appointed administrators of the estate.
The administrators say the money should go to a mentally disabled
half-brother of Grahlmann.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he tried looking for the Kansas children himself
but ran into dead ends. Crutchlow, whom Hackett met through a
mutual acquaintance, suggested that Hackett make it easy for the
children to find him.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Kansas City news conference got scheduled, as
well as a news conference held recently in London.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Grahlmann's former associates believe there is an
abandoned family.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend of Grahlmann, Bill Brown, said he had no
knowledge of any children or marriage, The San Francisco Chronicle
reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't give this any credence whatsoever,'' Brown told
the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, when he was 18, the German-born Grahlmann traveled to
Kansas to visit an uncle named Michael Paul. For a time, Grahlmann
worked as a chef in his uncle's restaurant, possibly at a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are trying to find Grahlmann's heirs wish they knew
more about Paul, said Otto Meyer of Guerneville, Calif., a friend
of Grahlmann who is among the searchers. Paul could hold a clue to
Grahlmann's past, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know so little about (Paul),'' Meyer said, not even what
Kansas city he lived in. Paul is believed to have died in the
1960s, Meyer said, but persons who knew him could still be around.
</P>
<P>
   While in Kansas, Grahlmann met a woman who is believed to have
been born in England. Grahlmann told several friends that he had
two children with the woman, Crutchlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked out on them, plain and simple,'' he said. ``It was
pretty bad the way he treated his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahlmann told many people that the English woman had a habit of
drying her stockings on the stove, Crutchlow said. ``That was
something that really drove him crazy, being a chef and all,''
Crutchlow said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said it is possible that the children do not even know
what their father's name was. Grahlmann apparently did not keep in
touch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because no will was found, the estate was to go to Grahlmann's
mother, who lived in Germany. However, she died in August. The
administrators of the estate now say the money should go to
Grahlmann's half-brother, Hackett said. When the half-brother dies,
he said, the money will go to a Lutheran church in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Grahlmann ``would never agree to have his money to go to a
church,'' Meyer said.

ASHCROFT'S SUPPORT OF SPRINT-MCI MERGER UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ In May, at a meeting of
Sprint's political action committee, the board of directors voted
``decisively,'' according to a company spokesman, to support Sen.
John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, in his re-election bid.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months later, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen.
John Ashcroft announced he was ``strongly inclined'' to support
Sprint's merger with MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The merger with MCI was billed as the nation's largest at $129
billion. The proposal pleased Wall Street, but concerned consumers
and Kansas City area residents.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by Sprint's PAC helped net Ashcroft at least
$22,000 through the first half of 1999, apparently his
second-largest corporate cluster of campaign cash. Not
surprisingly, the sequence of events generated criticism from
political foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only John Ashcroft will ever know how all that money affected
his decision, particularly in light of how quickly he threw his
support behind (the merger),'' said Marc Farinella, campaign
manager for Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat who is running against
Ashcroft in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint and Ashcroft see no link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was influenced by the capacity of the merger to improve the
work and competitive environment, which would strengthen Missouri
workers' positions,'' Ashcroft said Friday. ``That was exclusively
it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Fisher, spokesman for Sprint in Washington, said, ``It's
insulting to suggest this kind of money would buy his support for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the judiciary hearing on Nov. 4, Ashcroft said he had been
assured it would create, not reduce, jobs in the Kansas City area.
He made his remarks before hearing testimony from people who
opposed the merger on grounds it would help create a
telecommunications monopoly and could drive up costs for small
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Farinella said, ``One would hope, particularly given how many
Missouri residents might be affected, that our senator would be
interested in hearing the facts before making a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said Friday that he had his own concerns about the
merger and had met privately with the chief executives of the two
companies before making his statement Nov. 4. Nothing he heard in
later testimony changed his mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which had its own
hearing Nov. 8. The merger is being reviewed by those committees,
but formal approval has to come from the Justice Department and
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not trying to pre-empt them,'' Ashcroft said.
</P>
<P>
   Through June 30, Ashcroft had raised $3.1 million for his
re-election bid. His donation total from Sprint-related sources was
second to the $55,000 he got from the PAC and employees of
Enterprise Leasing, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. Campaign contributions made since June 30 will not be
reported until January.
</P>
<P>
   When the 18 Sprint employees who make up its PAC board voted in
May to back Ashcroft instead of Carnahan, they also agreed to
donate $3,500 to the Republican's campaign, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of
Sprint, was co-host for a fund-raiser for Ashcroft that month.
Esrey and several other Sprint officials have given the maximum
$2,000 allowed to Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's PAC did not pressure any employees to give to Ashcroft,
said J. Richard Devlin, Sprint general counsel and executive vice
president. At least three employees gave to Carnahan, records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage employees to participate in the political
process,'' Devlin said. ``We don't get any promises back. We don't
get any commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom's PAC also is an Ashcroft supporter, donating
$2,500 through the first half of 1999. The company said that
support stemmed from Ashcroft's involvement in telecommunications
issues on the commerce committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Ashcroft is a smart man,'' said Peter Lucht, MCI WorldCom
spokesman. ``It does not take a campaign donation for him to
recognize that this merger is good for consumers and his state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint PAC vote and the fund-raiser came two months before
MCI first approached Sprint about merging, Sprint officials said.
In a filing with the FCC on Nov. 5, MCI WorldCom said it contacted
Sprint on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects of a merger were there before July. Esrey
contacted MCI WorldCom last spring to discuss a relationship in
which MCI would sell Sprint's wireless service as a branded
wholesaler. Those talks ultimately led to merger discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's PAC gave to 48 senators and representatives during the
first half the year, including $3,000 to Rep. Dennis Moore, a
Democrat whose district encompasses Sprint's Westwood headquarters.
Moore has not taken a stand on the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's PAC and its employees were also strong supporters of
Sen. Kit Bond, a Missouri Republican, in his re-election bid last
year. Their total of $32,250 ranked them fifth among contributing
groups to the senator. Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican,
also got money, including $5,000 from the Sprint PAC.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan called Sprint officials earlier this year to request a
meeting about the Senate race but no one called back, Farinella
said. Sprint employees and its PAC in Missouri gave more than
$7,500 to Carnahan's 1996 re-election bid, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents historically enjoy an advantage in raising money,
especially lawmakers in a position to be influential on matters
such as the Sprint-MCI WorldCom merger, said Derek Cressman of the
Public Interest Research Group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly gives the appearance to regular voters and
watchdog groups such as us that something fishy is going on and an
exchange is being made,'' said Cressman, who is democracy campaign
director for the Public Interest Research Group in its effort to
sharply reduce campaign contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, ``The other possibility is he may very well think
this is the right thing to do for the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton said Carnahan is hardly immune
to scrutiny when it comes to comparing his public actions with
campaign donations. Carnahan, for instance, vetoed a partial birth
abortion bill this year and has received $15,000 from two groups
that advocate abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the partisans who criticize Sprint contributions view as
suspect the abortion industry's bottomless checkbook for
Carnahan?'' Hilton asked. ``If not, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has not taken a position on the Sprint merger, said his
spokesman, Jerry Nachtigal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor feels it's important to wait until all the facts
are in before endorsing or denouncing the merger,'' Nachtigal said.
``There are factors to be examined, like the impact on jobs in the
Kansas City area. It's a little early in the game.''

STARTING LINEUP COULD BE SHUFFLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Phil Jackson has eight wins in 12 games as
Los Angeles Lakers coach and he gets one of his top scorers back in
about a week. But he isn't satisfied with results to date, and Kobe
Bryant's probable return won't solve all the Lakers' problems _ the
lack of scoring beyond Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice, the
instability at power forward, the recurrent lapses on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's rotation will therefore continue to change game to
game, and next on the agenda could be a change to the starting
lineup. That would be a first _ Jackson has started the same five
(O'Neal, Rice, A.C. Green, Ron Harper, Derek Fisher) for all 12
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who play on this team will have to be ready to play
two minutes or 20 minutes, depending on the night. It could be just
an instinct, a whim,'' Jackson said. ``But in fact, the starting
lineup I've been pretty consistent with. I'm dickering with
changing that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As to when, Jackson wouldn't say, and as to who, he simply
grinned and said, ``I'm not going to give you any clues,'' but he
added he might make changes at two positions. Of course, one change
is likely anyway if Bryant's broken right hand is healed and he
returns as expected around Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Jackson continues to mix and match players in a
constantly evolving rotation. In Sunday's loss to Toronto, he
started Rick Fox over Green at power forward in the second half in
an attempt to generate more offense. Fox contributed four assists
and four rebounds but scored just two points.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson likes the Rice-Fox frontcourt, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried it off and on during the course of this season and
it's worked well for us, but it certainly didn't last night,''
Jackson said. ``Rick didn't have an offensive game going for him,
but we played better. It gives us a little more team speed and he's
a good enough player in the size department to rebound and play
power forwards of the ilk of Charles Oakley.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slumping: Fox emerged as the Lakers' sixth man early in the
season, scoring in double figures four times in the first six
games. But he hasn't scored more than eight in any game since and
over the last six games has averaged 5.0 points and shot 31.6
percent (12 for 38).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, good thing I'm not the focal point of the offense,'' Fox
joked. He admitted he's struggling to find good shots as opponents
find ways to shut down the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are defending it differently,'' he said. ``I'm noticing
the shots I got earlier are really being defended a lot better. So
now I have to find the other nuances in the offense. And until
then, things may not be looking as crisp.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Separation is a key element in a passing attack. The best
wide receivers make getting separation from defensive backs look
easy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas' preparation for its annual matchup with Texas A&AMP;M this
week will include discussion about separation.
</P>
<P>
   But that talk will not be about an offensive game plan. Instead,
it will be about an overall attitude and approach to an important
game against a big rival.
</P>
<P>
   After 12 people were killed as a result of the collapse of the
Aggie Bonfire stack at Texas A&AMP;M on Thursday, the separation talk
will be about how to get ready to play a football game in the wake
of a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've got to do is separate the game from the tragedy,''
said Texas coach Mack Brown, whose Longhorns practiced Monday for
the first time since the day of the accident. ``I don't think it
can be the same thing. From my standpoint and my players'
standpoint, and the university's standpoint, it wouldn't be fair to
talk about the loss of a life and a football game in the same
breath. I've thought about that a lot, and I really don't think
it's fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've got to do this week is make sure that I handle my
emotions enough to focus on what's important to our football team,
and separate at the same time what I can do to be supportive in a
secondary role to A&AMP;M, those families, (A&AMP;M coach) R.C. (Slocum)
and those players.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Texas' support of A&AMP;M, the school canceled its annual
Texas A&AMP;M Hex rally, electing to have a Unity Gathering that
included the darkening of the UT Tower on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game's a game, and I'm going to coach it that same way I
would have coached it if the kids had not been in the tragedy, but
my feelings about the kids are totally separate from the game,''
Brown said. ``My feelings about the kids are for their families and
their friends, and that's not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to practice Thursday, and again Monday, Brown talked to
his players about the tragedy. A host of Longhorns were on hand
Friday as more than 250 donors gave blood for those injured in the
incident. Representatives of the Central Texas Blood and Tissue
Center said that number was five times the norm for a blood drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place that I feel like we're in is to be as supportive as
we can of A&AMP;M as an institution and a family and not intrude in
their grieving or mourning process,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Major Applewhite said, ``This puts everything into
perspective, because the most precious gift is life. The gift to be
able to play football at the college level is up there, but it is
nowhere even close to the gift of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he thought the team looked good in Monday's practice.
The Longhorns may be back to focusing on the game, but on their
days off it was difficult not to think about what happened at A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite said just as the Aggies will want to play well to
honor those lost and injured in the tragedy, the Longhorns will
want to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two ways they can look at it _ either they can be
flat, or look at it as inspiration,'' Applewhite said. ``Whether
those kids (who died) went to our school or not, I think we can
look at it the same way. I think a lot of guys on this team are
playing this game for those kids as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I look at it, I figure why try to separate Texas from
Texas A&AMP;M? This is a tragedy that we all share. It's a terrible
loss to them and a terrible loss to us. There are human lives
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams can play it in memory of those who lost their lives
but also in respect to the traditions that have gone on at both
universities, and in the spirit that has filled this game and made
it one of the best rivalries in college football.''
</P>
<P>
   A foursome of former Texas greats _ Roosevelt Leaks, Doug
English, William Graham and Bryan Millard _ spoke to the team
Sunday night about what the rivalry with Texas A&AMP;M means to the
university and the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore cornerback Ahmad Brooks said the talk was inspiring
but was meant more for players who had not been through the
Texas-Texas A&AMP;M experience. He said once was enough for him to
recognize its importance.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the situation, Brooks said the atmosphere before and
after the game may be different, but he is sure both teams will
play to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart and my prayers go out to the victims' families, and
I'll think about them before and after the game,'' Brooks said,
``but I have to block that out for 3{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play with a lot of class. Even without the tragedy, it's
one of those things where we celebrate big plays and we celebrate
if we win, but we don't rub it in. I don't think that'll change if
we win this week. But after the game might be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a game. It's still a game. They're going to (come
to play), I guarantee you, so we're going to have to.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Board of Regents on Monday cleared
the way for the City University of New York to begin to exclude
students from its bachelor's degree programs who cannot demonstrate
that they are ready to begin college-level work in both mathematics
and English.
</P>
<P>
   In making the most fundamental change in standards since the
policy of open admissions was instituted nearly three decades ago,
the Regents, by a 9-to-6 vote, expressed a lingering wariness by
setting certain conditions on CUNY's policy and saying they planned
to monitor and audit the results closely.
</P>
<P>
   One compromise called for a 12-month delay until September 2001
for the starting date at City College and Lehman College, the
colleges whose overwhelmingly minority populations would be most
affected by the new policy. CUNY will be allowed to begin to
enforce the policy at four of its senior college campuses _ Queens,
Brooklyn, Baruch and Hunter _ in January.
</P>
<P>
   Public universities from Florida to California have been trying
to reduce the remedial courses they offer and raise their
admissions requirements, saying that such steps are necessary to
sustain the value of their diplomas. But education experts say that
CUNY's four-year colleges will now be among the few campuses in the
nation that will admit students based on their high school averages
and standardized test scores and then bar them from enrolling if
placement tests show that they still need remedial work.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the State Education Department said that 81 percent
of the nation's public four-year colleges now offer remedial
courses to enrolled students.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, students who are accepted into bachelor's
degree programs but fail proficiency tests in English or
mathematics would be steered to CUNY's community colleges or to
immersion programs that would prepare them for college-level work.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY figures show that about 1,400 of the approximately 14,000
freshmen who typically enter the senior colleges each year will be
kept out. Critics predict that many more students will be
discouraged from even trying to get into the senior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access has already been diminished, because some students have
been discouraged from attending CUNY,'' said Roscoe Brown, former
president of Bronx Community College, who has fought the remedial
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The approval was a political victory for CUNY's trustees and for
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has attacked CUNY for its low
graduation rates and inadequate standards and pressed for the
policy approved on Monday. The mayor applauded the Regents on
Monday for their action, saying it affirmed the trustees' decision
``to raise academic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote taken today is another critical step in making sure
that CUNY students are given the education that they will require
to compete and succeed in the next millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's education adviser, Herman Badillo, who is also
CUNY's chairman and was the primary architect of the policy, called
the Regents' vote ``a historic accomplishment,'' and ``a vote for
access with standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, including students and faculty members who
alternately heckled and applauded from the side of the room as the
Regents deliberated in a ballroom at the Marriott Hotel in
Brooklyn, said the decision would reduce access to a university
that is mandated under state law to keep its doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making a mistake,'' said Felipe Pichardo, a City
College senior studying education history and anthropology, who
called the adoption of the policy a ``political game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of the board who went to private schools don't
understand how CUNY runs,'' he added. ``They're going to have to
face up to it as things go down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Regents said that their approval extended only through
December 2002 and that they would use outside auditors to make sure
there were no unintended consequences. Richard P. Mills, the state
education commissioner, who endorsed the CUNY policy, told the
Regents that if problems arise, there will be opportunities for
``midcourse corrections.''

SUBSTANDARD NURSING HOME CARE REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Residents in nearly one of five Los Angeles
County nursing homes that receive federal funding suffered from bed
sores, broken bones, waste-tainted bed baths, malnutrition or other
serious violations, a congressional investigation released Monday
reported.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when America's aging population demands more long-term
care, the report found serious deficiencies in many nursing homes
across the county, including the San Fernando Valley and
neighboring valleys, more than a decade after federal laws were
passed to reform the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, asked for the investigation in
light of growing concern about nursing home conditions. Earlier
this year, the U.S. General Accounting Office issued reports that
found widespread health and safety violations in more than
one-fourth of nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions are simply intolerable. They are scary,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nursing homes have a legal and moral obligation to provide
adequate care for the vulnerable residents in their care,'' he
said. ``Our senior citizens are truly America's greatest
generation. We as a society owe them the opportunity to live out
their final days in dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives contend nursing homes don't have the
money to pay for improvements because two-thirds of their residents
rely on state and federal assistance that doesn't match long-term
care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are symptoms that point to an industry that is
struggling right now,'' said Betsy Hite, spokeswoman for the
California Association of Health Facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality of care is our foremost goal. The people at these
facilities clearly try to do the best they can with the limited
financial resources that they have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was the nation's first to analyze the most
recent inspections of nursing homes on a county level. The
Democratic staff of the House of Representatives' Committee on
Government Reform conducted the study, based on annual inspections
that occurred between November 1997 and August of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The findings could bring new reforms, including linking federal
funds to compliance with health and safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real eye-opener. It's very important for the public to
know what's going on,'' said Charlene Harrington, a University of
California, San Francisco, sociology and nursing professor and
national nursing home expert.
</P>
<P>
   With more baby-boomers facing the prospect of placing parents in
nursing homes, the report should bolster calls for more reforms,
Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of for-profit-making homes that just aren't
doing the right thing in providing care. They're jeopardizing the
health and safety of their residents, and it's widespread,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Health Care Financing Administration, which
administers the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs, contracts
with states to conduct annual inspections. Inspection teams
interview a sample of residents, staff and family members, as well
as review a sample of clinical records.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found:
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Fewer than 3 percent of the 493 county nursing homes that
accept residents covered by Medicaid or Medicare were in full or
substantial compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Of the rest, 19 percent had violations that caused actual
harm or had the potential to cause death or serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!More than 10 percent of the nursing homes were cited for
more than one violation that caused actual harm or had the
potential to cause death or serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also randomly selected for in-depth review 30
homes cited for violations at the level of actual harm or above.
</P>
<P>
   At a Lancaster nursing home, state inspectors found four of 10
residents randomly selected had bed sores. The inspectors found the
home did not turn the residents every two hours and didn't treat
the sores properly.
</P>
<P>
   At the nursing home with the worst bedsore problems, in
Chatsworth, 62 out of the 112 residents had bed sores. A total of
147 treatments were required, yet the home had only one licensed
nurse.
</P>
<P>
   State inspectors at the same Chatsworth nursing home observed a
resident with vomit on her neck and shoulders, as well as on the
floor. No staff member was attending to the resident and a nurse
aide walked by and offered no assistance, despite the inspectors'
presence.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of a North Hollywood nursing home who was completely
dependent on staff for help told a state inspector no one had
brushed her teeth in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Other violations included failing to prevent falls and
accidents, failing to provide proper medical care and failing to
provide adequate nutrition and fluids. The report also found
residents restrained either physically or with drugs, improper
practices that triggered the original federal reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now while things have improved slightly in some areas, we're
still seeing intolerable conditions in L.A. County, and I think
it's probably reflective of nursing homes around the country,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman said the report should be considered a snapshot of
overall conditions and not conditions at an actual nursing home,
where conditions might have improved or deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The report also stated that inadequate staffing was an
underlying cause of many violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very solid core of nursing staff. That's a
relatively small but stable percentage. But then we have a very
high turnover for certified nurse assistants,'' said Hite, with the
state nursing home association.
</P>
<P>
   There is high turnover because nursing assistants often earn
little more than $7 an hour. Driving the low pay are state and
federal payments for long-term care, Hite said.
</P>
<P>
   The association represents 1,400 nursing homes. Hite said the
industry is struggling, with 109 homes recently filing for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman acknowledged more funding is needed and noted that recent
increases in state MediCal and federal Medicare funding should
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for some of these nursing homes, it doesn't seem like
money makes a difference. They just seem to have a callous
indifference to their residents,'' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, the nursing home expert, contended too many
operators place profits ahead of patient care. She said needed
reforms include tougher enforcement of existing regulations, which
can include a $10,000 fine per violation or placing homes in
receivership, and linking federal and state funding to
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a crisis. People don't really understand how
bad it is,'' Harrington said.

ROBITAILLE MIGHT NOT BE BACK FOR A WHILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For a team that has dropped its last two games and does
not have a power-play goal in its last three, it should be good
news for the Los Angeles Kings that star left-winger Luc Robitaille
skated Monday for the first time since learning more than two weeks
ago that he had broken his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings (12-6-4) know Robitaille cannot help them tonight
when they try to rebound in the first of back-to-back games against
the Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He only skated 10 minutes and we got him out of there,'' Kings
coach Andy Murray said after watching Robitaille work out at the
team's Iceoplex training facility. ``He is still a ways off.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille had predicted he would be back in three weeks after a
Nov. 4 MRI revealed a small fracture in his left foot. Team doctors
thought six weeks was more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who did not make the trip, hopes to skate again
today. But if there is any discomfort, he will be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Robitaille did not discuss his playing status. He didn't
have to. When he said, ``It is best to take care of it while the
season is still young,'' Robitaille revealed that he will be out
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Without Robitaille and first-line center Jozef Stumpel
(abdominal surgery), the Kings power play has faltered after some
early success with replacements Vladimir Tsyplakov and Len Barrie.
The Kings, who once had the league's third-best power play, were 0
for 6 in a 3-2 loss to Phoenix last Thursday and 0 for 7 in a 6-3
loss to lowly Montreal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy with the power play, but we feel the biggest
problems have come on defense,'' Murray said. ``The power play will
occasionally go in and out, but the defense has to remain constant.
We gave up far too many scoring chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' problems actually began during last Tuesday's 3-2
victory over the Chicago Blackhawks. They were outshot 23-1 in the
third period after taking a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well against Chicago and not against
Montreal,'' Murray said. ``I was pleased with the effort against
Phoenix. That was a hard-nosed game. Now we face two teams
(Colorado, Dallas) that have been struggling and want to break
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The losing goalie against Phoenix and Montreal was Jamie Storr,
who took over two weeks ago when Stephane Fiset suffered a deep
bone bruise on his right hand in pregame workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had hoped Fiset could return last Saturday against
Montreal, but now he might not be ready this Saturday when the team
returns from Thanksgiving for a home game against San Jose.

NHL NOW A DIFFERENT WORLD FROM WAYNE'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not the time to be tugging on Superman's cape,
especially with Wayne Gretzky's induction Monday night in Hockey's
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In the sport he helped shape _ to everything from salaries to
expansion to an international consciousness _ it is highly unlikely
he could duplicate his scoring feats in today's NHL.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds absurd since he retired just last April. But since
the early to mid-1980s, when Gretzky was in the midst of eight
consecutive scoring titles and averaging more than 200 points for
four consecutive seasons, the game has changed drastically.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr has won scoring
titles with point totals about half of those in Gretzky's prime.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks' Teemu Selanne led the NHL last season with 47
goals. Gretzky reached 50 nine times, including once in the
season's first 32 games, and 60 six times.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he retired from the New York Rangers last April with
more than 90 regular-season and playoff records, Gretzky was asked
about his legacy as the greatest player to ever play the game.
</P>
<P>
   Typically humble but always astute, Gretzky responded that the
sport has never been more exciting and will be continue to improve
in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   That can't be said of football, basketball or baseball. The
players in those sports are more athletic than ever, but the
changes to the sport have been more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is clearly better.
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen? Will there ever be a player as dominant as
Gretzky, who finished with 894 goals and 2,857 points during the
regular season with 122 more goals during the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to say that there are records that will never be
broken,'' said Luc Robitaille, Gretzky's former teammate with the
Kings. ``But I don't see how anyone will ever score 92 goals in one
season again. That's like hitting 100 home runs in a season.
They're hitting a lot these day, not like that. Hockey has become
something bigger and faster than it was even 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat all the scoring of the past 20 years, the game has
been slowed by a defensive strategy between the blue lines called
the neutral-zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest change is the massive migration of players from
Europe _ finesse players much like Gretzky who have helped turn the
NHL into a speed game.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the league was 98 percent Canadian and had a
rough style of play developed through that country's junior hockey
system. Today, the NHL is 48 percent Canadian. And you thought the
Canadian dollar was doing badly.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky was a generation ahead of his time, bringing an
extraordinary vision to the ice that many say will never be
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   But through conditioning and strength-training programs, players
are bigger and faster than 15 years ago, when Gretzky's Edmonton
Oilers won four Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went into games knowing there was no chance they could
lose,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said. ``Today, no team can say
that. By bringing in the Europeans, you created greater balance.
The skill level is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Every move is scouted on videotape. There are very few secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille agreed. ``Teams used to have maybe two top defensemen
that would challenge the best players,'' he said. ``Now everyone
has four or five very skilled defensemen to take them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine put it best: `It's not that it is so much
better than it used to be, but it is so much harder to do what you
used to be able to do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In today's NHL, Edmonton is an afterthought. The Oilers generate
the same revenue as the Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, but
because of the exchange rate, they must take $12 million off the
top.
</P>
<P>
   With escalating salaries brought on by free agency, the
small-market Oilers would have no chance of maintaining a club that
included future Hall of Famers Mark Messier, Paul Coffey, Jari
Kurri and Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   Kurri and Messier each scored more than 600 goals in their
careers. What could you pay them today in Canada, where the dollar
is worth less than 75 cents in U.S currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the weakened Canadian dollar, it wouldn't be possible for
Edmonton to keep it together,'' Murray said. ``There was so much
talent there. Wayne Gretzky was the dominant player of any era, but
he had some great talent beside him.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE BLUELINE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
While Wayne Gretzky was inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame on
Monday night, there were plenty of others taking bows. Take Toronto
banker Jim Anstett, who recently was honored at a reunion for
assisting on Gretzky's first goal in organized hockey 32 years ago.
Gretzky, then just 6, scored just one goal for the 1967-68
Brantford Novice All-Stars. ``I took a shot that hit the goalie and
(Gretzky) shoved it in,'' Anstett said. ``I said `Kid, an assist is
more valuable than a goal.' Wayne took it to heart, went out and
changed the game forever.'' Three years later, Gretzky compiled 278
goals and the legend was born. &QL; 
DUCK LUCK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks' 6-3 loss at Detroit last week should not have
come as a surprise. They are 4-24-5 lifetime against Detroit, which
includes 0-8 in the playoffs. What is surprising is the team's poor
showing on special teams. Last year, the Ducks had the league's
best power play with 83 goals in 82 games, and their penalty
killing was average. But this season, the Ducks power play is 9 for
67 (13.4 percent), fourth-worst in the league. Their penalty
killing is last in the league at 17 for 63 (73 percent). &QL; 
BACK TO EARTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After four straight victories in place of Dominek Hasek, Sabres
rookie goalie Martin Biron has come back to earth, losing the next
three. Biron lost to lowly Tampa Bay and was yanked against
Pittsburgh after giving up three in the first period, even with
Jaromir Jagr out with a bad groin. All this came after Biron was
named NHL Player of the Week. &QL; 
FATHER KNOWS BEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's Alexander Selivanov, who scored 14 goals on only 32
shots in his first 17 games with the Oilers, used to play for Tampa
Bay and future father-in-law Phil Esposito. ``He came to me and
asked me if he could marry (daughter) Carrie before he asked her. I
said, `You want to do what?' I thought he was just going to ask for
more ice time.''  &QL; 
PASSES FOR PAVEL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Florida's Ray Sheppard was considered one of the
premier goal scorers in the NHL. From 1991-96, he and Jagr were the
only two players to score at least 30 goals in those five seasons.
The season that ended the string was 1996-97, when Sheppard scored
29 goals for the Panthers. Now back in Florida after signing a
one-year, $750,000 contract, Sheppard will be asked to score. But
he has a bigger job now, feeding superstar Pavel Bure, who has
struggled to find a compatible linemate. &QL; 
BURKE STAYS HOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Sean Burke moved from Florida to Phoenix this past week,
a move the Coyotes made when it became apparent restricted free
agent Nikolai Khabibulin will not be back this year. Khabibulin
wants between $4 million and $5 million. The Coyotes won't pay him
or honor his trade request. Phoenix looked fine when backup Mikhail
Shtalenkov was named NHL Player of the Month for October. But then
he lost his first four November starts. Bob Essensa is 5-0-1,
including a victory over the Kings last Thursday, but the team
isn't ready to give him more playing time.

chemicals, called volatile organic compounds, generally occur in

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF it were just about football for the Houston Cougars, only a
matter of finding someone who can match X's and O's with the best
of them, then Chet Gladchuk has to make just one call.
</P>
<P>
   The UH athletic director picks up the phone, dials up Texas
offensive coordinator Greg Davis and asks just one question:
``Mayflower or United?''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the moving company, the rest should be just details.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk already knows Davis from their days together at Tulane,
where Gladchuk was the athletic director who promoted Davis to
replace Mack Brown in 1988 after Brown moved on to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk himself moved on to become AD at Boston College in
1990, where he made the superb hire of Tom Coughlin. The man knows
how to hire a head football coach. But here and now at UH, Gladchuk
knows he needs more than just a coach. The question is, Can Davis
be the one who does what Kim Helton never could? That is, fill
stadiums as much as the win column.
</P>
<P>
   It says here, yes, he could, and for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Davis ultimately was axed from his first head coaching job at
Tulane in 1991. And who knows exactly on what terms the
Gladchuk-Davis relationship stands today? But there is no doubt
that much has happened since Davis' first stint as a Division I
head coach, and he deserves a look.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is from Groves, having played at Port Neches-Groves. He
then coached at PN-G and developed relationships with high school
coaches across the area. Over the years, he has developed a diverse
and highly successful offense, particularly at Carolina, where he
rejoined Brown in 1993. Over the past two seasons at Texas, Davis
has shown a superb ability to not only call an offensive game but
build an offense perfectly around the talent available to him.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Davis put together a record-setting offense around a
Heisman-winning tailback. This year, he has everything revolving
around a quarterback who is putting up record-setting numbers and
might be a Heisman candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If this crucial Cougars hire was only about football, then no
one else need apply. But then, if it was just about football, Kim
Helton still might be head coach.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt Helton's seven-year record with the Coogs was
subpar (24-53-1), but the 7-4 season he had this year generally is
not the kind that gets a coach fired.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's biggest problem was that he alienated a contingent of
powerful alumni and failed to recruit Houston the way many hoped he
would, despite the state-of-the-art facilities at his disposal. But
most significant, Helton never put together a team that excited the
masses and put fans in seats.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this firing was all about, and that's why Helton's
replacement must be someone who can captivate imaginations, the way
Bill Yeoman did all those years ago with the veer and Jack Pardee
did more recently with the run-and-shoot.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cougars need is a football version of Clyde Drexler _
someone with a passion for the school who can cut straight to the
front of the line with virtually every recruit in Houston. What
they need is someone who can put out a product that can fill
Robertson Stadium and turn heads on the recruiting trail.
</P>
<P>
   Gladchuk has seen immediate and significant dividends paid by
hiring Drexler. Of course, when it comes to UH football, there is
no one out there quite like Drexler. What are the Coogs to do? Hire
former Heisman winner Andre Ware, as some have foolishly suggested?
They might as well ask sprinter Carl Lewis or golfer Fred Couples
to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Gladchuk's greatest challenge is finding either a big-name
coach who can wow recruits or an offensive-minded coach who can
rack up big numbers and get this city's casual football fans
excited about heading to Robertson on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the man for the job would do both _ someone like
Purdue's Joe Tiller or Kentucky's Hal Mumme. But good luck trying
to get either one of those rising stars to take Gladchuk's call.
Mumme already has taken himself out of the running for the vacant
LSU job. Do you honestly think he'd consider Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Like Tiller, Mumme probably will not move again until a huge,
nationally recognized program comes calling.
</P>
<P>
   Two other names tossed around have been Terry Bowden and John
Mackovic. But Bowden has just signed a new television contract;
he's not going anywhere. And Mackovic's personality would make
Helton look like Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious the Cougars faithful are desperate to get their
program righted, as well they should be. Already, a ``Bring Back
Jack (Pardee)'' campaign has begun on the Web pages. But that's not
the answer, either.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Doug Drabek throws his hat in the ring, Gladchuk might
want to go ahead and make that call to Austin.

   LOS ANGELES _ Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid learned a few hard
lessons following Sunday's 2-0 loss to D.C. United in the MLS
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The free-flowing creative soccer that has become the signature
of Los Angeles' play needs a little toughness.
</P>
<P>
   When Robin Fraser was knocked from the game in the fifth minute
after a Roy Lassiter shove resulted in a broken collarbone for MLS'
top defender _ the Galaxy didn't react with any kind of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it got bullied by United in every way imaginable _ the
same way Chicago bullied the Galaxy from the Western Conference
finals a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid also learned he's not at UCLA anymore. He earned respect
from the officials after 19 seasons and three national
championships with the Bruins _ but it might take a while before he
starts getting the benefit of the whistle in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to become more aggressive in our style of play, I
thought that was pretty evident,'' said Schmid as the team arrived
at Los Angeles International Airport Monday. ``We also need to get
more respect from the referees.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid was bothered because nothing was called when Fraser went
down. Later, he felt Cobi Jones was taken down in the penalty box,
but nothing was called there, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in big games before as a coach whether it was a
national team, a youth team or at UCLA,'' said Schmid, ``There are
times when you get beat and you say I just got beat. But I can't
remember any time where I felt, yeah, we made mistakes to give them
goals, but the refereeing made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (the referee) makes that call on Cobi, then it's 1-1
most likely and the game is completely different. Instead, they go
on get that second goal a minute later.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more pressing issues to deal with now, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has hinted he might leave the MLS and start a career in
Mexico, as Eric Wynalda did this spring. Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman is also considering Mexico if the MLS doesn't meet his
salary demands.
</P>
<P>
   And of course Carlos Hermosillo, who's season with the Galaxy
came with mixed reviews, will likely finish his career in Mexico,
where he is 34 goals shy of becoming his country's all-time leading
scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of questions, a lot of if's ands or buts right
now,'' said Schmid. ``If all those go negative, there will be a lot
of changes, but hopefully some will go positive and not all
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is concerned with the Galaxy's age, especially up the
middle of the field. The two central defenders, Fraser and Paul
Caligiuri, are 32 and 35 respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Midfield playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos is 31 and Hermosillo 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at making our team younger,'' said Schmid.
``The core nucleus of our team is all over 30. That's something we
have to slowly change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you change it all in one year, it's a shock to the system,
but ifyou do it part by part it makes it a little easier. We need
to sit down anddecide how we want to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid did make it clear, however, that if Hermosillo wants to
remain with the Galaxy, he would like to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Carlos the option is his,'' said Schmid. ``He's a
player who deserves how he wants to end his career for all
he'sdone. If he wants to make this his farewell season in the MLS,
that would begreat for the fans. If he decides he'd rather finish
it in Mexico, I respect that choice too.''

DUCKS ARE CURE FOR CANADIENS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It has gotten to the point this season where
the legendary Montreal Canadiens have been dubbed the Hab Nots.
Ravaged by injuries and struggling to stay out of the Eastern
Conference cellar, Montreal twice looked to be easy pickings for
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   But for the second time in less than two weeks, it was the
Canadiens who made the Ducks look foolish. This time it was a 2-1
Anaheim loss before 12,496 at the Pond on on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, the Canadiens beat the Ducks by the same score in
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time this season, the Ducks tried to put a third
consecutive win on the board and once again they failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden scored the game-winner at 7:51 of the third period
as the Ducks fell back to a familiar spot _ .500 (10-10-2-1). After
the final horn, all Steve Rucchin could do was throw his stick in
frustration after the Ducks were unable to apply any pressure in
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens were coming off a 5-3 win over the Kings on
Saturday, but the heads of coach Alain Vigneault and general
manager Rejean Houle have been on the chopping block almost since
the season began.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has been hit with a devastating string of serious
injuries: Patrice Brisebois (back), Benoit Brunet (back), Vladimir
Malakhov (knee), Igor Ulanov (broken foot), Turner Stevenson (back)
and Brian Savage (fractured vertebrae in neck). But to the faithful
in Montreal, that was no excuse for a 6-14-1 record coming into
Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   They were trailing 1-0 midway through the second period and only
some excellent goaltending by Guy Hebert kept them that close.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal was dominating the second period and had a chance to
take a two-goal lead when Tony Hrkac took a penalty. The Canadiens,
however, couldn't take advantage and just after Anaheim killed off
the penalty Ted Donato provide a much-needed burst of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nielsen broke up a centering attempt deep in the Anaheim
zone, and with Montreal's defense caught in deep, Donato skated the
length of the ice and slipped a backhander past Jose Theodore at
8:26 for his fourth goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, it was all Ducks the rest of the period, but
Theodore stopped everything headed his way.
</P>
<P>
   The young goalie had a bit of luck _ Teemu Selanne missed a
wide-open net from point-blank range and Fredrik Olausson hit the
post _ but he stopped Selanne and Marty McInnis from the slot
during a Anaheim power play that included a 32-second two-man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore saved the best for last when he stopped Paul Kariya on
a partial breakaway. Kariya got Theodore to commit by faking a shot
from the left circle and appeared to have an open left side of the
net to work with, but somehow the Montreal goalie reached back and
gloved the low shot.
</P>
<P>
   All those missed opportunities certainly came back to haunt the
Ducks when Linden, who was acquired at the cost of first-round
draft choice, scored just his second goal of the season. A
five-time 30-goal scorer, Linden took a centering pass and drove it
through the legs of Oleg Tverdovsky and past Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's beleaguered penalty-killing unit, ranked last in the
NHL, had killed off eight consecutive penalties since returning
home. But it was a little too much to ask when Pavel Trnka was
slapped with a very questionable holding call and Pascal Trepanier
took an ill-advised boarding penalty in a 17-second span late in
the first period.

HOLMGREN TURNS HUNCHES INTO VICTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ It sounds too simplistic to credit Mike Holmgren for
the transformation of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a simple fact: The man has a feel for this game.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain a team that has not had a winning season
since 1990 and not been to the playoffs since 1988 being 8-2 and
having a comfortable lead in the AFC West, despite ranking 19th in
offense and 25th in defense?
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as coach of the Seahawks, Holmgren is making
a habit of reaching some of his most fruitful, and most difficult,
decisions with an intuition rooted in the same calculated hunches
he has been playing since his days as high school coach in the San
Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great feel, an unbelievable feel,'' quarterback Jon
Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask Holmgren to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct is part of this thing,'' he said Monday, after
grading the video of the team's performance in its statement-making
31-19 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all just statistics and computer printouts and that
kind of stuff,'' he added. ``If it was just strictly scientific,
then it would take some of the fun out it, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have all these decisions to make based on the rules of
football and then there's a good part of it that's just feel. It's
part of the fun of coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that said, Holmgren offered, ``I didn't really answer
the question, did I?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but yes.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren's hunches might be based on a conversation he has with
a player on the sideline. Or the emotion he reads on a players'
face or in his eyes. Or something he gleaned from his hours of
video study each week. Or something else he sees an opponent do in
a game. Or maybe even how Jupiter is aligned with Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. It is working.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine seasons of a decade of decay for the
franchise, the Seahawks were 20-44 in road games and had an even
worse record in games played against AFC West opponents (18-46).
</P>
<P>
   After their win at Arrowhead Stadium, the new-attitude Seahawks
are 4-1 on the road and 3-1 against the division. Their best
efforts to this point in the '90s were 4-4 in each category _ both
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same team. It's the same talent,'' one NFL executive
said when asked about Holmgren's impact on the club. ``Only one
thing has really changed. That's the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The best explanation for this marked improvement comes from the
way Holmgren's gut feelings translate into what happens on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he unveiled a formation called ``Robust,'' which
featured Ricky Watters lined up behind fullbacks Reggie Brown and
Brian Milne. It wasn't something buried deep in Holmgren's
telephone book-sized offensive playbook. It was something he came
up with last week. He sensed a need to run the ball against the
Chiefs' aggressive defense. He had an urge to get the recently
signed Milne more involved in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The power-I formation produced a 45-yard run by Ricky Watters in
the third quarter that set up a touchdown to ice the victory, in
part by giving the Chiefs a look they had never seen from the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of Holmgren's feel is how he sidesteps the
temptation to force the ball to receivers. Leading receiver Derrick
Mayes did not catch a pass against the Chiefs, and Joey Galloway
caught just one. There were times when the offense bogged down and
could have used the type of spark Galloway can supply. But rather
than alter the course, Holmgren stayed the course. Sean Dawkins had
the big receiving day (five catches, 114 yards and a 45-yard
touchdown) and the Seahawks scored 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too hard, unless you have a couple of special plays for a
particular receiver, to say, `OK, we're going to this guy.' I don't
want to do that,'' Holmgren explained. ``I want our offense to flow
and work, and I want Jon to feel like he has a bunch of guys he can
go to. One week, Dawkins is going to make the plays. Next week, it
might be Galloway. They might share. The important thing is, we
won. I don't care who catches the ball, I really don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success can spoil you that way,'' Holmgren said. ``But right
now, they don't seem to care who gets the credit and that's a very
healthy thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Kitna put it, ``That's how winning teams do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning team and Seahawks have not been synonymous since the
mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   That's the biggest feeling of all _ the one Holmgen has inspired
in his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say in the NFL teams take on the personality of their
coach,'' Kitna said after the game Sunday. ``Right now, we have the
personality of our head coach and that is the personality of a
winner.''

 GAY GOP GROUP ANGRY AT BUSH'S REFUSAL TO MEET  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a gay Republican group, angered by Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's public refusal to meet with them, accused the
GOP presidential front-runner Monday of deserting his pledge to
make the party more inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call yourself `a uniter, not a divider,' and a
`compassionate conservative,' you would think you would meet with
people,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin
Republicans, the nation's largest gay Republican organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very bad sign for a man who wants to be president to
say, `I'm not going to meet with people who don't agree with me,'
'' Tafel said.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to win the endorsement of gay Republicans in next year's
election, they warned, would cost the candidate not only gay votes
but also the support of millions of swing voters who are turned off
by the GOP's social conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage was prompted by Bush's response to a question Sunday
on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Asked whether he would meet with the
Log Cabin Republicans, Bush responded, ``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a huge political scene,'' Bush explained. ``I am
someone who is a uniter, not a divider. I don't believe in group
thought, pitting one group of people against another. And all that
does is create kind of a huge political, you know, nightmare for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify how meeting with the group would be divisive,
officials at Bush headquarters in Austin said the governor believes
it would prompt a polarizing debate on issues such as gay marriage,
gay adoption and hate-crime legislation _ all of which he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush doesn't want to politicize this issue and their
agenda,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, who have 11,000 members, endorsed Bob
Dole in the 1996 presidential election. The group sent Dole a
$1,000 donation, but he initially returned it. Dole then reversed
himself and accepted the group's money with a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush would accept the group's money or endorsement,
McClellan said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He welcomes the support of all people. (But) I can't imagine
that they would want to (endorse him),'' McClellan said. ``They
differ on a number of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Republican group, which distributes about
$100,000 to candidates each election through its political action
committee, said the Bush campaign had previously agreed to a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They said the candidate's rebuff may be part of a calculated
effort to win conservative votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises serious questions about Gov. Bush that go beyond
the gay issue,'' Tafel said. ``He said meeting with gay Republicans
would create a political nightmare for people, and the only people
he could be referring to are those on the far right that his
campaign is busy claiming Bush is not captive to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay leaders say they are perplexed at Bush's comments in light
of his earlier statements advocating that the party open its doors
to Latinos, African Americans and even gays. Last year, after the
Texas Republican Party barred the Log Cabin club from setting up a
booth at the party's annual convention, Bush stepped in and
admonished the party to ``stop the name-calling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly sending a message that the early campaign of a
compassionate conservative _ the message that attracted moderate
support _ doesn't square with him personally,'' Tafel said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is also seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, met with the Log Cabin Republicans in
Washington two weeks ago. McCain, like Bush, opposes gay marriage
and adoption and new hate-crime laws, though he told them  &LR; the
group he would work to end discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unashamed, unembarrassed and proud to work with you,''
McCain told the group, according to participants in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes, who has courted the religious
right in his quest for the GOP nomination, also diverged from Bush
on the issue of the Log Cabin Republicans, saying that while he has
strong disagreements on policy matters, he'd be happy to meet with
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which had not originally planned to talk with Forbes,
is now scheduling a meeting.

SUVS MEET THEIR MATCH IN MARIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a jungle out there, but we're ready for
it.
<P>
   In the parking lot of the Northgate Shopping Mall in Marin, the
rains left a very wide but very shallow puddle, maybe three inches
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Adamsbaugh says, ``I stood there watching as a lineup of
big-ass SUVs ever-so-gingerly maneuvered around the puddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Those brawny beasts can climb the Rockies in a single bound and
ford roaring rivers to reach the kids' soccer games, but you don't
want those deluxe chrome wheels to get rusty.
</P>
<P>
   HEY, STANFORD is in the Rose Bowl!
</P>
<P>
   Who are they playing, Cal Tech?
</P>
<P>
   Actually the Cardinal's opponent will be Wisconsin. But the
California Institute of Technology used to play its home games in
the Rose Bowl. Many years ago, I was assigned to cover the big Cal
Tech vs. Tijuana Tech game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Tech Beavers and their fans waited and waited, but
Tijuana Tech never showed. It turned out that the Tijuana Tech bus
was turned back at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the U.S. Border Patrol didn't believe there was such
a thing as a Tijuana Tech football team. It's like Santa Claus _
you either believe or you don't.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford shouldn't have that problem, since there's no border
crossing between Palo Alto and Pasadena, although both halves of
the state would like one. The Stanford team bus driver, Rusty
Wheeler (I made that up), phoned Triple-A this morning to get
directions to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford will have the added motivation of being the
disrespected underdogs, since they represent the stumblin',
bumblin' Pac-10. My friend G. Howie Barks refers to the
Wisconsin-Stanford matchup as ``Bratwurst vs. Leastworst.''
</P>
<P>
   NO WAY MUNI'S going to get caught with its electricity down on
New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   My source says Muni's game plan for the big night includes
taking all the trolley coaches (electric buses and streetcars) off
the streets by 7 p.m. and replacing them with diesel buses. Also,
they'll shut down Muni Metro by 11 p.m. and replace that service
with more diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is betting on the likelihood of a major power
failure,'' the insider says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city is asking Muni to add 100 runs to the
regular service that Friday night, and the P.D. will use some buses
to shuttle cops around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Which is great, but where will Muni get all those extra buses
and drivers?
</P>
<P>
   POKESCAM: The D.A.'s consumer fraud unit, responding to an item
here, did some checking of retail places that promise Pokemon stuff
with your purchase but don't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   The manager at the Burger King on Powell told the D.A. that the
store gets only two shipments per week, 600 toys per shipment, and
they're gone in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   BK's prez took out an ad in the New York Times apologizing,
saying the demand exceeded all their expectations. That statement
makes me hungry for a baloney sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   The D.A.'s office assured me it is monitoring the situation.
``We always get our Pokemon,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   BACKING A WINNER: Joe Shea spotted a storefront on Clement, near
7th, with two large posters in the window:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Elect Bill Fazio D.A.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Re-elect D.A. Terence Hallinan''
</P>
<P>
   If this place were a laundromat, they could call it Wishy-Washy.
</P>
<P>
   A HOLIDAY TALE, just to get you in the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   A woman I know has a housecleaner from Central America who
speaks a little English and reads none. Last December, the maid
bought her boss a Christmas gift, and a large, colorful holiday bag
to carry it in.
</P>
<P>
   The woman walked around town with the bag, then caught a bus,
and proudly delivered the present in the festive bag bearing the
very large message: ``MERRY F_ING CHRISTMAS!''
</P>
<P>
   HENRY WHO? A recent sophisticated literary reference here to
Walden Pond reminded English teacher Annie Samuels of her
transcendental adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided it was time to finally read Walden,'' she says,
``and I set off to a shopping mall. The first bookstore didn't have
it. The second stop was a Waldenbooks, and the clerk had never
heard of the book or of Thoreau. When I pointed out the name of the
store, he just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third store, I couldn't find the book so I asked the clerk,
who said, `Of course we have it, over there in Fiction.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which could inspire a new parlor game, reclassifying books in
their proper section. ``Moby Dick'' and ``Bambi'' in Hunting &AMP;
Fishing. ``Gulliver's Travels'' in Travel &AMP; Leisure, of course. ``I
Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' in Animal Training. ``Grapes of
Wrath'' in Gardening.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if Hank Thoreau drove an SUV when he went to Waldenbooks.

FEDERAL DRUG AGENCY BATTLES LEGALIZATION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The voters in California, Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, Nevada,
Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized the use of
marijuana for medical reasons. It hasn't made any difference to the
Drug Enforcement Administration. To the DEA, marijuana is a
Schedule I drug, and, therefore, must be strictly regulated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Controlled Substance Act of 1970 also listed peyote, a
hallucinogenic cactus button, as a Schedule I drug. But Congress
exempted the Native American Church from the prohibition against
the use of peyote. Members of NAC use peyote as a sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also allowed states to create their own exemptions for
the use of peyote. In Arizona, members of The Peyote Way of God and
The Peyote Foundation can use peyote. In Minnesota, members of the
American Indian Church can use peyote as a sacrament. In Oregon,
those with sincere religious intent may use peyote. In Colorado,
New Mexico and Nevada, those who are members of bona fide religious
organizations may use peyote as a religious sacrament.
</P>
<P>
   One can be exempt from the legal restrictions on a Schedule I
drug for religious reasons, but not for health reasons. There's
something seriously wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   The medical marijuana prosecutions in California are a warning
to the tens of thousands of seriously ill citizens who use
marijuana to ease their pain and nausea. The case of author and
publisher Peter McWilliams of Los Angeles is illustrative of how
federal drug agents and federal prosecutors are targeting those who
are ill and using state authorized medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of his ability to defend himself in a federal trial, on
advice of counsel, McWilliams has thrown himself to the mercy of
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, McWilliams was diagnosed with AIDS and the AIDS-related
cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In that same year, California
passed Proposition 215, which allows seriously ill patients, with a
doctor's recommendation, to grow and use marijuana. McWilliams was
arrested by federal drug agents and originally charged with
numerous marijuana crimes.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams used marijuana to control his nausea with his AIDS
medications. It's the only anti-nausea drug that has worked well
for him. Since his arrest, McWilliams' health has declined
precipitously because he has had to use an anti-nausea drug that is
much less effective for him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge George H. King ruled that McWilliams
could not mention his illness or Proposition 215 in his defense
during the trial. The judge also ruled that McWilliams could not
argue medical necessity as a defense. In other words, McWilliams
was not allowed to defend himself in court. According to
McWilliams, it's the draconian nature of the laws in drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Nov. 19, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture
and distribute marijuana. In the plea agreement, McWilliams waived
his right to appeal. He now faces a maximum of five years in
federal prison. At the scheduled hearing on Feb. 28, Judge King, if
he is so inclined, can take McWilliams' health into account and
give him less time in prison _ or even home detention. McWilliams
sees any mandatory prison time as a probable death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   That's the warning to the citizens of America: Cross the federal
marijuana laws and your state laws won't protect you. It doesn't
matter if you suffer from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or multiple
sclerosis; you will end up in prison. Non-violent marijuana
offenders often receive longer prison sentences than those who
commit violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recent report from the National Academy of Sciences'
Institute of Medicine acknowledges that ``marijuana's active
components are potentially effective in treating pain, nausea, the
anorexia of AIDS wasting, and other symptoms.'' The federal drug
czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, in a Nov. 16 debate on ABC News, said the
report ``condemned the dangers of smoking marijuana.'' It didn't.
The report says that dangers to health associated with chronic
smoking of marijuana ``awaits the results of well-designed
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the popular movement to legalize the use of
medical marijuana continues. The states of Massachusetts, Minnesota
and New Hampshire have legislation pending that would legalize the
use of marijuana to treat the effects of serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   And the state Senate in Hawaii has adopted a resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to pass legislation allowing individual states to
determine their own policies with regard to medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., introduced a bill in the U.S. House
(HR 912 _ Medical Use of Marijuana Act) on March 2, in order to
move marijuana from a Schedule I drug of the Controlled Substances
Act to a Schedule II drug of the act. The bill would allow ``the
prescription or recommendation of marijuana by a physician for
medical use,'' and allows ``producing and distributing marijuana
for such purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank's bill has 11 co-sponsors, only one a Republican, Rep. Tom
Campbell of California. Currently, the bill languishes in the House
Subcommittee on Health and Environment. Meanwhile, citizens who are
ill face drug prosecution if they turn to medical marijuana, as
provided by state law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the DEA's chief administrative law judge, Francis L.
Young, ruled that because marijuana is a safe therapeutically
active substance, marijuana must be transferred from a Schedule I
to a Schedule II drug, according to the Controlled Substances Act.
Schedule I drugs have no known medical use. The judge wrote: ``It
would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to
continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this
substance.'' That was 11 years ago _ nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Drug busts often lead to the defendant losing most of his
property to forfeiture laws. Since the Clinton administration made
marijuana busts its priority, according to the National
Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws (NORML), someone is arrested
on a marijuana charge every minute.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1980 the Justice Department bragged that it had
obtained drug-related forfeitures that amounted to over $90
million. Clearly marijuana and other drug busts are a cash cow that
the federal drug agencies don't want to give up. No wonder the DEA
resists moving marijuana to a Schedule II drug.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the people to act in their states and petition
Congress to pass the Medical Use Marijuana Act.

LINCOLN'S PARADOXICAL THANKSGIVING VISION ECHOES THE PSALMS 
</HEADLINE>

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``In everything give thanks,'' St. Paul advised in his letter to
the Thessalonians in the Christian New Testament.
 &HT;    With a booming stock market, high employment, the frontier-like
energy of cyberspace and millennial optimism, it is easy to follow
Paul's dictum as we pause for our yearly Thanksgiving celebration.
 &HT;    There's that nagging Y2K computer glitch problem, but otherwise?
This Thanksgiving seems the harbinger of a prosperous new century.
 &HT;    Americans tend to equate Thanksgiving with material prosperity.
``Dear God,'' runs our national prayer, ``Thank you for everything
we have. And bless all those poor people who don't have as much as
we do. Amen.''
 &HT;    Paul's words, ``in everything give thanks,'' serve as a
discomforting reminder for our national celebration. ``Everything''
means giving thanks in all circumstances: good and bad, rich or
poor, health or illness, peace or war. In all things, give thanks
to God.
 &HT;    Although New Englanders have celebrated it since 1630,
Thanksgiving Day only became a national holiday in 1863 when, in
the midst of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln instituted it as a
yearly celebration.
 &HT;    In 1863 the war was a stalemate. Generals won battles and lost
them. The Union gained ground in the West; the Confederacy held
firm in the East. On both sides, troops deserted the army.
 &HT;    Civilians tired of the whole thing. In the summer of 1863,
antiwar riots broke out in Boston and Richmond. Even that year's
Emancipation Proclamation failed to rally expected popular and
political support. General Sherman urged Lincoln to turn the
conflict into total war: ``If need be, take every life, every acre
of land.''
 &HT;    In his annual message to Congress that year, Lincoln himself
showed the war's strain. Ill, lacking his usual insight, and
suffering from recurring nightmares, the president stated that
``Under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning
a new life.'' But what new life? Lincoln did not say. It was too
dark for even the usually visionary president to see.
 &HT;    Although hope was obscured, Lincoln still issued his
Thanksgiving Day Proclamation echoing St. Paul's command: ``in
everything give thanks.'' Until World War II, there was no worse
season in American history than the fall of 1863. Give thanks? For
what? Political crises, death, uncertainty, war?
 &HT;    And to whom? Certainly God could not be thanked for such
suffering. America's traditional Protestant God seemed far away.
Countless citizens turned to alternative beliefs -- such as atheism
and spiritualism -- to try to answer the difficult questions raised
by the war.
 &HT;    Lincoln, mired in his own internal religious struggles,
nevertheless believed that human affairs unfolded under the rule of
God. God's will, however imperfectly understood or recognized, was
working itself out through the conflict.
 &HT;    Lincoln did not identify God's cause with that of the Union
Army. Instead, he understood himself as a sinful servant upon whom
God's judgment rested. The only ``side'' is God's. Human beings can
only approximate it.
 &HT;    Therefore, the North should not only give thanks for great
military victories. Rather, the nation should give thanks because,
however mysteriously, God's will was being accomplished through the
suffering. From evil, good. From death, life. Give thanks because
God is found in and through all things.
 &HT;    Lincoln's paradoxical Thanksgiving vision echoes that of the
Psalms in the Hebrew Bible. ``Give thanks to the Lord, for he is
good; for his steadfast love endures forever.'' The Psalms portray
the full range of human experience. Joy, anger, love, hatred, fear,
prosperity, suffering, victory, rage. But they consistently give
thanks to God for everything from God's gracious provision to God's
presence in the midst of evil. In everything, give thanks.
 &HT;    Thankfulness places us rightly before God. By thanking God in
all circumstances, we are reminded we are not ultimately in
control. When we have much, prosperity is a gift. When we have
little, we rest in God's comfort.
 &HT;    Thankfulness is an attitude of mind that keeps us from thinking
too highly of our achievements or thinking too little of our worth
as God's children. Thankfulness breeds the contentment that,
whatever the circumstance, God is with and for us.
 &HT;    This Thanksgiving, give thanks. Not because we invested in the
right stock. But because God is with us, even in the midst of our
prosperity. God has not abandoned America to material success but
is, mercifully and persistently, calling us to remember who we
really are.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``There's nothing else like it in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no sentence more frequently uttered along
Seventh Avenue, one used liberally by eager salesmen seeking to
describe a garment, a fabric or design as truly distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a sentence less likely to be true in an industry
dominated by a culture of copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Knockoffs, it is said, have been part of fashion ever since Eve
saw Adam's fig leaf and designed one of her own. They have a
storied history, from the legitimized couture copies sold by some
of the leading U.S. department stores in the '50s and '60s right up
to today's phenomenon of dress adaptations made by ABS and Victor
Costa that mimic clothes worn during the Academy Award
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a practice so commonplace, and one not clearly prohibited
by law, that most designers who have been copied have felt helpless
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several recent legal challenges, and now
that the Supreme Court has taken up a case with the potential to
define what constitutes a violation of existing trade dress law,
the practice of knockoffs is under the spotlight, raising questions
among manufacturers of what the ramifications of such a decision
could be.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court got into the design business in October when
it took up an appeal by Wal-Mart Inc., which lost a $1.25 million
judgment to a children's playsuit maker in 1996. In the case, to be
decided sometime next year, the justices will define what makes a
product's look or image so distinctive it can't be legally copied.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have made their names by aping others' designs,
it's a tricky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there has been a garment business, people have
always been inspired by others,'' said Allen B. Schwartz, design
director of ABS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about who puts what spin on it,'' he said. ``Gaultier
or Galliano will put their spin on it, I'll put my spin on it, but
fashion isn't anything unless everyone is buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is the self-anointed King of Copycats and promotes the
practice proudly _ he says he can turn out a designer adaptation
nearly overnight and have it in stores within a few weeks. He's
appeared on numerous television programs displaying this talent,
and even paid his own airfare to Chicago this year to show his
Academy Awards-inspired collection on ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `original' does not exist in fashion,'' Schwartz
said. ``Everything starts from some sort of inspiration. If Calvin
or Ralph or Burberry think they invented plaid, a slip dress or a
bias cut, they need to get to a couch. They are just reinventing it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers like Schwartz and Victor Costa, who also claims to be
the fastest at getting Oscar looks into stores, argue that they are
performing a service to customers who want, but can't afford, to
look like celebrities in custom-made designer gowns. The designers
they imitate, however, rarely appreciate the flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada, in a 1996 profile, decried the mass adaptations
of her designs, calling the knockoff artists ``vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing an incredible attack from people who want
to know what we are doing,'' she said. ``They hang around our
fabric mills, they want to see our prototypes _ it's really
becoming unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so aggravating,'' said Vera Wang. ``If I were Miuccia
Prada, I'd take a gun and shoot everyone in the shoe industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang has seen her bridal designs knocked off throughout the
industry, and looks she created for celebrities at the Academy
Awards copied within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that most consumers know the difference, so
therein lies the problem,'' she said. ``Most of the real design
houses end up becoming design studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang said since his firm has been frequently quoted as
one of the most influential fashion houses of the '90s, ``for this
award we take obviously the good and the bad which goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta called it the ``highest form of flattery,''
but added, ``What would really upset me is if no one copied me.
Today you deal with a consumer who is highly sophisticated. She
knows that what I'm selling not only has a certain look, it also
has a certain quality of manufacturing. That cannot be knocked
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nova USA designer Tony Melillo said, ``At first, you feel like
somebody is making money off what you did, but in the end, you feel
at least you're doing something right. It came up recently with the
Gap photographing everything with judo pants, which I've been doing
since I started. In the end, I actually feel a little bit weird
about it, but it's life.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, Jean-Jacques Picart _ Christian Lacroix's former
partner _ said, ``In the old days, there was copying; now people
are hijacking the very identity of designers. It's turned into a
real handicap for us. Copies are like mosquitoes. One bite doesn't
matter _ just an irritation _ but 100 bites give you a fever that
can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was made in reaction to Yves Saint Laurent's
successful lawsuit against Ralph Lauren, in which YSL charged in
Paris courts that his couture tuxedo dress had been knocked off by
Lauren. He demanded damages of close to $1 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren counterattacked, and demanded $174,000 in damages for
defamation of character for statements in Women's Wear Daily by YSL
president Pierre Berge, who accused the American of ripping off
YSL.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauren and YSL dresses were modeled in court before Judge
Madelaine Cotelle, who pointed out the differences in fabric, how
YSL's version had pockets and how one had gold buttons and the
other did not. Lauren was found guilty and both were fined _
Lauren, $393,000 for copying the dress; Berge, $89,295 for
``denigration'' of Lauren's character.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch also lost a high-profile case against
American Eagle Outfitters in which it said American Eagle had
unfairly copied the look and the printed wording on some of its
garments. That suit was dismissed in July in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati, although A&AMP;F has vowed further appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Whether apparel firms can do anything about it, though, has
garment industry executives talking about the potential
ramifications of the case before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   While many demand stronger legal protection from piracy, they
also fear a storm of litigation would arise if the High Court
upholds the case, opening the way for suits against anything
perceived as a knockoff, even something as basic as a cargo pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really help the industry if they could get something
like this (a specific law) done, because you would end up with more
diversity of product,'' Konheim said. ``But the thing is, if you do
a cargo pant and somebody else does a cargo pant, is that
copying?''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller copyrights each of the prints she designs, and the
firm has successfully filed more than 1,500 infringement cases
since 1986 related to firms that copy the designs. While prints are
clearly protected under law, silhouettes are a tricky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a copy,'' Konheim said. ``That's a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Azria, president of BCBG, who has frequently been accused of
copying top designer lines, blasted the practice of knocking off
other designers, and said his line is as subject to knockoffs as
anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from the mass market copy you and can put you out of
business,'' he said. ``I spend $10 million to $20 million in
product development a year, only to be knocked off by a contractor.
The question is not what is right or wrong, the question is why
America does not have any law that would protect us from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schwartz added that all designers look to others for
inspiration. ``I eat, live and breathe fashion. I watch CNN every
morning. I read every magazine,'' he said. ``Nobody has a lock on
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz stressed that even though he has a reputation as a
copycat, he's really a kitten. His Academy Award group accounts for
about 5 percent of his business, ``and 5,000 percent of my
publicity,'' but the rest of the ABS line is made up of
``original'' interpretations of what is happening in fashion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Where a designer could really get into trouble, he said, is by
copying a print, since that is protected by law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the version of the John Galliano gown that Cate Blanchett
wore to the Academy Awards in March seemed a little daring,
considering it was copied right down to the fluttering hummingbird
embroidered on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Schwartz said. ``Mine was a seagull.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``There's nothing else like it in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no sentence more frequently uttered along
Seventh Avenue, one used liberally by eager salesmen seeking to
describe a garment, a fabric or design as truly distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a sentence less likely to be true in an industry
dominated by a culture of copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Knockoffs, it is said, have been part of fashion ever since Eve
saw Adam's fig leaf and designed one of her own. They have a
storied history, from the legitimized couture copies sold by some
of the leading U.S. department stores in the '50s and '60s right up
to today's phenomenon of dress adaptations made by ABS and Victor
Costa that mimic clothes worn during the Academy Award
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   It is a practice so commonplace, and one not clearly prohibited
by law, that most designers who have been copied have felt helpless
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been several recent legal challenges, and now
that the Supreme Court has taken up a case with the potential to
define what constitutes a violation of existing trade dress law,
the practice of knockoffs is under the spotlight, raising questions
among manufacturers of what the ramifications of such a decision
could be.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court got into the design business in October when
it took up an appeal by Wal-Mart Inc., which lost a $1.25 million
judgment to a children's playsuit maker in 1996. In the case, to be
decided sometime next year, the justices will define what makes a
product's look or image so distinctive it can't be legally copied.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have made their names by aping others' designs,
it's a tricky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there has been a garment business, people have
always been inspired by others,'' said Allen B. Schwartz, design
director of ABS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about who puts what spin on it,'' he said. ``Gaultier
or Galliano will put their spin on it, I'll put my spin on it, but
fashion isn't anything unless everyone is buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz is the self-anointed King of Copycats and promotes the
practice proudly _ he says he can turn out a designer adaptation
nearly overnight and have it in stores within a few weeks. He's
appeared on numerous television programs displaying this talent,
and even paid his own airfare to Chicago this year to show his
Academy Awards-inspired collection on ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `original' does not exist in fashion,'' Schwartz
said. ``Everything starts from some sort of inspiration. If Calvin
or Ralph or Burberry think they invented plaid, a slip dress or a
bias cut, they need to get to a couch. They are just reinventing it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers like Schwartz and Victor Costa, who also claims to be
the fastest at getting Oscar looks into stores, argue that they are
performing a service to customers who want, but can't afford, to
look like celebrities in custom-made designer gowns. The designers
they imitate, however, rarely appreciate the flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Miuccia Prada, in a 1996 profile, decried the mass adaptations
of her designs, calling the knockoff artists ``vultures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are experiencing an incredible attack from people who want
to know what we are doing,'' she said. ``They hang around our
fabric mills, they want to see our prototypes _ it's really
becoming unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so aggravating,'' said Vera Wang. ``If I were Miuccia
Prada, I'd take a gun and shoot everyone in the shoe industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang has seen her bridal designs knocked off throughout the
industry, and looks she created for celebrities at the Academy
Awards copied within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that most consumers know the difference, so
therein lies the problem,'' she said. ``Most of the real design
houses end up becoming design studios.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang said since his firm has been frequently quoted as
one of the most influential fashion houses of the '90s, ``for this
award we take obviously the good and the bad which goes with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta called it the ``highest form of flattery,''
but added, ``What would really upset me is if no one copied me.
Today you deal with a consumer who is highly sophisticated. She
knows that what I'm selling not only has a certain look, it also
has a certain quality of manufacturing. That cannot be knocked
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Nova USA designer Tony Melillo said, ``At first, you feel like
somebody is making money off what you did, but in the end, you feel
at least you're doing something right. It came up recently with the
Gap photographing everything with judo pants, which I've been doing
since I started. In the end, I actually feel a little bit weird
about it, but it's life.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1994, Jean-Jacques Picart _ Christian Lacroix's former
partner _ said, ``In the old days, there was copying; now people
are hijacking the very identity of designers. It's turned into a
real handicap for us. Copies are like mosquitoes. One bite doesn't
matter _ just an irritation _ but 100 bites give you a fever that
can kill.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was made in reaction to Yves Saint Laurent's
successful lawsuit against Ralph Lauren, in which YSL charged in
Paris courts that his couture tuxedo dress had been knocked off by
Lauren. He demanded damages of close to $1 million at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren counterattacked, and demanded $174,000 in damages for
defamation of character for statements in Women's Wear Daily by YSL
president Pierre Berge, who accused the American of ripping off
YSL.
</P>
<P>
   The Lauren and YSL dresses were modeled in court before Judge
Madelaine Cotelle, who pointed out the differences in fabric, how
YSL's version had pockets and how one had gold buttons and the
other did not. Lauren was found guilty and both were fined _
Lauren, $393,000 for copying the dress; Berge, $89,295 for
``denigration'' of Lauren's character.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch also lost a high-profile case against
American Eagle Outfitters in which it said American Eagle had
unfairly copied the look and the printed wording on some of its
garments. That suit was dismissed in July in U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati, although A&AMP;F has vowed further appeals.

   ``It would really help the industry if they could get something

diversity of product,'' Konheim said. ``But the thing is, if you do

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The great Internet land grab continues.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce pioneers, some with huge advertising budgets, are out
to generate sales, surely, but they're also looking to build brand
loyalty, capture ``mindshare'' and squash the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has in effect become advertising's newest category.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Web sites and Internet services is invading
every media vehicle, from prime time TV to local newspapers, as
well as a host of creative new venues, from store kiosks to
18-wheelers. And it's growing more pervasive every day.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet fashion frontier, where a dominant player such
as Amazon.com has yet to emerge, competition is intense. The
medium's exponential sales growth and potential are adding fuel to
the flame, making advertising more crucial than ever, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   New online business is indeed up for grabs in fashion and
related categories. Total Internet retail sales are projected at
$14.9 billion for 1999 and $23.1 billion for 2000, up from $7.8
billion in 1998. Fashion, footwear, health and personal care areas
should generate around $1 billion in 1999, and $1.9 billion for
2000, according to Jupiter Communications, a New York consulting
firm that tracks the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With an infusion of new investment money from recent IPOs and
venture capital, young online companies are stepping up to the
plate with multi-million-dollar advertising budgets that in some
cases rival total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com, a designer outlet with 200 brands at discount
prices, had a second-quarter 1999 marketing budget of $2.48
million, compared with sales of $1.14 million for the same period.
And with a $10 million capital infusion from financier George
Soros, the company is expected to spend heavily over the next three
years to build business, with advertising an important priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to gain share of mind, to dominate, and it's something
we intend to do with a big commitment over the next few years, not
over the next few generations,'' saidiff, chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly.com's campaign _ a stylized woman in a lounge chair with
a martini and Chinese takeout food _ includes the copy ``Tuesday,
11:15 p.m. _ buying a new dress.'' Rather than touting discount
prices, the message stresses the benefits and convenience of
Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Camdens, a Web site focusing on upscale corporate
gifts, uses advertising to promote a message of luxury,
personalization and customization, one that sharply contrasts with
much of today's offbeat Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the avalanche of dot-com advertising, many companies use
shock value, such as shooting gerbils out of a cannon, to get
attention,'' said Fred Reffsin, ceo of Camdens. ``We're trying to
emphasize services, image and what the Internet can do for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reffsin said the money and time it takes to acquire new
customers is justified by the enormous potential of the gift
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, we can be a first mover, so we have to get out a
strong, compelling message,'' he said. ``It takes money and time to
convince people to change shopping behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' annual advertising budget of over $20 million includes
a combination of broadcast and print media to build its brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' target customer represents a ``new luxury buyer,''
Reffsin said. The new luxury customer, who may come from
middle-class origins, buys for personal rewards, rather than
status, he continued. ``Unique product, such as a teak mousepad and
matching monitor, stands for individualized expression for the
sender as well as the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the name out, in any way possible, is the first step in
brand building, a challenge that can be especially daunting and
expensive to new, relatively unknown companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora.com, which launched a beauty Web site this month, has a
leg up by having established stores first, said Jim Kenney, ceo.
With 33 U.S. stores, and 50 scheduled by yearend, the two channels
are designed to complement each other. Customers can reorder store
items online and return online items at stores.
</P>
<P>
   A $25 million ad campaign features a strong fourth-quarter push
that integrates the store and web site messages, which both stress
ease of shopping and elegant presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond traditional offline media, online advertising is evolving
from simple banners to partnerships, such as portal agreements.
That alone can cost millions. Online advertising, which totaled
$2.8 billion in 1999, allows focused, targeted messages that reach
potential shoppers and result in sales conversions, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, such as Fashionmall.com, seek a smart strategy
through a combination of offline and online advertising that pays
off in measurable costs and sales results.
</P>
<P>
   In business since 1994, Fashionmall.com is ancient compared with
many Internet players. The company's ad budget grew from $500,000
last year to $8 million this year, following an IPO and a total
redesign of the site last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just throw money at advertising; you have
spend money smartly,'' said Ben Narasin, ceo. ``We've learned
through mistakes over the past few years what works best.''
</P>
<P>
   Offline spending includes traditional print and television, as
well as telephone kiosks, a Times Square wall, the ``7th on Sixth''
fashion show and even sandwich boards. A ``tease and reveal''
campaign featured a man and woman staring at a black dot with no
copy, with the company name and logo added later.
</P>
<P>
   The company's online investment went beyond banner advertising,
which has proven ineffective, to partnerships that really generate
traffic and acquire customers, said Narasin.
</P>
<P>
   Online partnerships are key for Ashford.com, a luxury goods
retail website launched in April 1998. With sales of $30 million
for fiscal 1999, the company's annual advertising budget is $17
million, with $10 million for fourth quarter alone, in anticipation
of big holiday demand.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 percent budgeted for online advertising, Ashford.com has
established multi-million dollar partnerships with AOL and Yahoo to
drive traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is cost of customer acquisition,'' said
Kenny Kurtzman, ceo. ``Online advertising is efficient and highly
measurable in cost terms, while offline advertising is harder to
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   For offline spending, Ashford.com will use TV, radio and print.
For holiday, magazines include both fashion, food and financial
publications, such as Bon Appetit, Harpers, Fortune, Vanity Fair,
Vogue and Money.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty and fragrance sites, such as Jasmin.com, launched in
August, are finding direct mail and sampling to be as effective as
traditional media in promoting product. With an $8 million
marketing budget, Jasmin.com will promote its exclusive
distribution of the Hugo Boss fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmin.com's all-offline strategy includes over 30 million
on-page samples with fragrance on a gauze strip and a Jasmin.com ad
on the flip side. The Jasmin.com ad _ a woman surrounded by a green
veil _ conveys a sensual, emotional message meant to resonate with
fragrance buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the Internet clutter, the crazy spending, and many of
the dot com companies not being marketing experts, brand building
can still be hard,'' said Dale Dewey, president and ceo. ``But even
with the Internet, the normal ad rules still apply, and a good,
creative ad campaign can take you a long way.''

   Bluefly.com's campaign _ a stylized woman in a lounge chair with
a martini and Chinese takeout food _ includes the copy ``Tuesday,
11:15 p.m. _ buying a new dress.'' Rather than touting discount
prices, the message stresses the benefits and convenience of
Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Camdens, a Web site focusing on upscale corporate
gifts, uses advertising to promote a message of luxury,
personalization and customization, one that sharply contrasts with
much of today's offbeat Internet ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the avalanche of dot-com advertising, many companies use
shock value, such as shooting gerbils out of a cannon, to get
attention,'' said Fred Reffsin, ceo of Camdens. ``We're trying to
emphasize services, image and what the Internet can do for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reffsin said the money and time it takes to acquire new
customers is justified by the enormous potential of the gift
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, we can be a first mover, so we have to get out a
strong, compelling message,'' he said. ``It takes money and time to
convince people to change shopping behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' annual advertising budget of over $20 million includes
a combination of broadcast and print media to build its brand
image.
</P>
<P>
   Camdens' target customer represents a ``new luxury buyer,''
Reffsin said. The new luxury customer, who may come from
middle-class origins, buys for personal rewards, rather than
status, he continued. ``Unique product, such as a teak mousepad and
matching monitor, stands for individualized expression for the
sender as well as the receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the name out, in any way possible, is the first step in
brand building, a challenge that can be especially daunting and
expensive to new, relatively unknown companies.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora.com, which launched a beauty Web site this month, has a
leg up by having established stores first, said Jim Kenney, ceo.
With 33 U.S. stores, and 50 scheduled by yearend, the two channels
are designed to complement each other. Customers can reorder store
items online and return online items at stores.
</P>
<P>
   A $25 million ad campaign features a strong fourth-quarter push
that integrates the store and web site messages, which both stress
ease of shopping and elegant presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond traditional offline media, online advertising is evolving
from simple banners to partnerships, such as portal agreements.
That alone can cost millions. Online advertising, which totaled
$2.8 billion in 1999, allows focused, targeted messages that reach
potential shoppers and result in sales conversions, say experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, such as Fashionmall.com, seek a smart strategy
through a combination of offline and online advertising that pays
off in measurable costs and sales results.
</P>
<P>
   In business since 1994, Fashionmall.com is ancient compared with
many Internet players. The company's ad budget grew from $500,000
last year to $8 million this year, following an IPO and a total
redesign of the site last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to just throw money at advertising; you have
spend money smartly,'' said Ben Narasin, ceo. ``We've learned
through mistakes over the past few years what works best.''
</P>
<P>
   Offline spending includes traditional print and television, as
well as telephone kiosks, a Times Square wall, the ``7th on Sixth''
fashion show and even sandwich boards. A ``tease and reveal''
campaign featured a man and woman staring at a black dot with no
copy, with the company name and logo added later.
</P>
<P>
   The company's online investment went beyond banner advertising,
which has proven ineffective, to partnerships that really generate
traffic and acquire customers, said Narasin.
</P>
<P>
   Online partnerships are key for Ashford.com, a luxury goods
retail website launched in April 1998. With sales of $30 million
for fiscal 1999, the company's annual advertising budget is $17
million, with $10 million for fourth quarter alone, in anticipation
of big holiday demand.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 percent budgeted for online advertising, Ashford.com has
established multi-million dollar partnerships with AOL and Yahoo to
drive traffic to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is cost of customer acquisition,'' said
Kenny Kurtzman, ceo. ``Online advertising is efficient and highly
measurable in cost terms, while offline advertising is harder to
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   For offline spending, Ashford.com will use TV, radio and print.
For holiday, magazines include both fashion, food and financial
publications, such as Bon Appetit, Harpers, Fortune, Vanity Fair,
Vogue and Money.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty and fragrance sites, such as Jasmin.com, launched in
August, are finding direct mail and sampling to be as effective as
traditional media in promoting product. With an $8 million
marketing budget, Jasmin.com will promote its exclusive
distribution of the Hugo Boss fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmin.com's all-offline strategy includes over 30 million
on-page samples with fragrance on a gauze strip and a Jasmin.com ad
on the flip side. The Jasmin.com ad _ a woman surrounded by a green
veil _ conveys a sensual, emotional message meant to resonate with
fragrance buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the Internet clutter, the crazy spending, and many of
the dot com companies not being marketing experts, brand building
can still be hard,'' said Dale Dewey, president and ceo. ``But even
with the Internet, the normal ad rules still apply, and a good,
creative ad campaign can take you a long way.''

   &UR; By DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hottest celebrity in America is a TV star with no
discernible talent who is 66 years old--that's 462 in TV
years--whose partner is the most detested woman on television, and
whose claims to fame are an evening game show that almost no one
wins (``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'') and a morning talk show
where nothing happens (``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee''). Yet Regis
Philbin deserves all his acclaim and more.
</P>
<P>
   Regis has not come from nowhere. He has come from everywhere.
Until he hit big with ``Live'' in the late '80s, he was the
quintessential loser, a 25-year also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   A Notre Dame grad and Navy veteran, he got his start in the
early '60s hosting a talk show in San Diego, Calif., and spent the
next quarter century anchoring shows in New York, St. Louis and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, these stints would be interrupted by a shot at the
big time, which Regis would invariably blow. In 1964, he succeeded
Steve Allen as host of Westinghouse's marquee late-night show. It
flopped, and Philbin was dumped for Merv Griffin. In the late '60s,
Philbin spent three years as Joey Bishop's sidekick on another
doomed late-night show. Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' spanked
Bishop in the ratings. In the mid-'70s, Philbin bombed as host of a
couple of game shows. In 1981, he tanked as anchor of a national
morning program.
</P>
<P>
   No one could explain why Regis didn't work. He was too spastic
perhaps--''just a nerve ending'' as Bill Zehme, who co-wrote
Philbin's delightful autobiography, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Regis returned to New York in 1983, took over a morning show,
hooked up with Kathie Lee Gifford (then Kathie Lee Johnson) two
years later, and went national with the show in 1988. ``Live'' has
been a monster hit ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Regis and Kathie Lee quickly became figures of ridicule, the
embodiment of unhip. He was the toothy moron; she, the unbearable
crooner. ``Live'' sounds like a joke, an hour of nothing: 20
minutes of ``host chat'' between Regis and Kathie Lee, celebrity
interviews, lame stunts, a trivia question. Watch it once, and it
seems pathetic. Watch it twice, and you begin to see genius.
</P>
<P>
   As host of ``Live'' (or ``Millionaire,'' or anything else he has
ever done), Regis displays no evident talent. He does not interview
guests well. He does not tell jokes. He lacks empathy. He displays
no particular intelligence. He speaks in a bizarre voice, equal
parts Bronx, sinus, and helium.
</P>
<P>
   So why is he the most watchable person on television? In the
autobiography, ``I'm Only One Man,'' he explains his success this
way: ``I started small and learned to keep it small. Small is
friendlier and more real. Small lasts longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This captures one of Regis' gifts. He has a modest but
captivating comic persona. He is the master of umbrage. Walloped by
a generation of rejection, failure, and sidekickdom, he has
perfected the persona of the aggrieved little guy.
</P>
<P>
   His hyperactivity has mellowed, but not too much. In ``host
chat,'' his specialty, Regis turns the mundane details of his
life--a lost wallet, a urinary-tract problem, a disagreement with
``Live's'' producer--into comic gems. Most performers mask their
insecurity with ego. Regis shares his insecurity. (He can take
offense at anything.) He is cotton candy, spinning TV sugar out of
thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee, endlessly chipper and extra-perfect, serves as
superb foil for Regis' peevishness. He jabs her, mocking her
singing and her tedious stories about her son. She punches right
back. It is an amusingly petty domestic drama, enacted every
morning at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Regis' comic persona reinforces his second gift: a perfect
relationship with the camera. No one talks to the screen better
than Regis. ``He is the last of the true broadcasters who can go on
the air and spout about nothing,'' says Zehme. ``He is never at a
loss to speak to the camera as if it were you.'' This is one reason
why David Letterman, Larry King, and other TV celebs idolize Reege.
</P>
<P>
   Regis seems genuine on camera in part because his personality
and TV persona have joined. Profiles of Philbin are tedious because
he has revealed everything on the show (his latest squabble with
his wife, etc.). There is no secret life of Regis Philbin. While
criticizing sensationalistic, confessional talk shows, he divulges
everything about himself. He just doesn't have anything salacious
to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It is too bad that so many Americans are meeting Regis as the
host of ``Millionaire.'' Though ``Millionaire'' has brought ABC its
first sweeps win since, oh, the 19th century, the show does not do
Regis justice. He is a creature of sunny day, not shadowy night. He
is restrained on `Millionaire,'' forbidden to indulge in his
stories, ad-libs, and insults.
</P>
<P>
   His job is to make the contestants sweat, but he's no good at
it. He's too light to play the heavy. The dark suits he wears make
him look like a lounge singer, not an enforcer. His voice cannot
convey menace. His attempts to daunt contestants are more genial
than ominous (although ``Is that your final answer?'' has become a
national catchphrase).
</P>
<P>
   And Regis certainly doesn't exude the Olympian wisdom you'd
expect from the host. He often seems more surprised to learn the
answer than the contestants do.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Reege may be the ideal game show host for this ironic
age: He allows the show to be both deadly serious and parody.
``Millionaire'' is portentously heavy, yet run by a man with no
gravitas. It concerns itself with something that matters--a million
bucks--yet Regis' presence makes it frivolous. With a somber host,
``Millionaire;; would be oppressive. Thanks to Regis, it is the
perfect '90s experience: You can enjoy it as challenge, kitsch, or
both.

   LUNNAN OIL BASE, China _ The fearsome Taklimakan Desert, one of
the earth's last great natural barriers to human penetration, is
grudgingly yielding up some of its liquid treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But not without a desperate fight.
</P>
<P>
   With its dreaded sandstorms called ``black hurricanes'' and its
almost indecipherable underground rock formations, the mighty
Taklimakan has managed to frustrate some of the world's smartest,
most tenacious oil hunters for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Known to centuries of camel travelers as ``the sea of death,''
the Taklimakan looks like a set for ``Lawrence of Arabia'' with its
endless undulating dunes of golden powder-fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that China, the world's most overcrowded
country, could include an egg-shaped ``empty quarter'' 600 miles
wide that is reminiscent of the most desolate deserts of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan ranks as the most inaccessible part of the world,
lying further from the sea than any other point on the globe. It is
protected on three sides by walls of mountains leading to Siberia,
Afghanistan and Tibet, and on the fourth side by China's Gobi
Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago China's national oil company hit a gusher smack
in the middle of the Taklimakan. An international rush for oil was
on, centered in the desert a few hundred miles north of the ancient
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   That first discovery shaft sunk by China National Petroleum
Company tapped into a world-class oil feposit said to be 70 miles
long. Within months Western oil companies plunged in to lease
quadrants of the desert fringes put up for wildcatting by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chinese and Western drillers were gambling that this
austerely beautiful terrain would yield a string of super-giant oil
fields and turn China's western frontier into another Caspian Sea
bonanza. But it hasn't happened, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of bidding British Petroleum (now BP/Amoco),
Exxon and Agip paid the Chinese a total of $500 million in 1993 for
the right to explore and share in any commercial-sized oil finds.
The deal was that the Western companies would pay for the
exploration and keep a 49-percent share of profits if oil was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The following year Chinese geologists told the World Petroleum
Congress that the Taklimakan and the surrounding wasteland of the
so-called Tarim Basin had potential reserves of 88 million barrels.
Thus, this nearly uninhabited desert about half the size of Texas
was said to be perched on top of four times the proven oil reserves
of the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before a spread in the National Geographic
magazine told of ``an enormous underground pool of oil'' beneath
the Taklimakan. Western companies bought up more drilling blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some geologists still think there could be numerous super-giant
``elephant'' oil fields lurking somewhere beneath these shifting
sands. But so far they've only found a few baby elephants, not
nearly enough to justify the ambitious Chinese oil estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Through enormous expense and almost inhuman endurance by 4,000
Chinese oil workers, China's national oil company is managing to
squeeze 75,000 barrels a day of oil from the desert and its
northern fringe.
</P>
<P>
   From March to June of each year, wind currents slash down from
Siberia and collide with northbound airflows from the Tibetan
plateau. The result is killer sandstorms in which the sky blackens
and the air fills with sand and gravel that hits like bird-shot.
That's why Taklimakan in local dialect means ``go in and don't come
back out.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer isn't much more pleasant. The sun bakes the desert
floor until the temperature reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In the
winter, the wind blows and the desert chills to 20 degrees below
zero.
</P>
<P>
   One of every four barrels produced in the Tarim Basin comes out
of the ground here at the Lunnan Oil Base, a cluster of buildings
and oil processing apparatus huddled on hardscrabble wasteland 70
miles north of Taklimakan's first ridge of flowing sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the difficulties of working in the Tarim Basin, the
Chinese are finding increasing volumes of brackish water flowing up
the well casing along with the oil in Lunnan. And even though
Lunnan's 67 wells have been producing for only a decade or less,
the Chinese are being forced to install some big mechanical
rocker-arm pumps to bring up crude that used to flow up freely
under natural pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarim Basin now ranks as China's seventh-largest oil field,
far less than its original promise.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the oil, Chinese drillers have found impressive
supplies of natural gas, which may be piped to eastern China and
help replace dirty coal as the main heating source in Shanghai and
other heavily polluted cities. Tarim's proven natural gas reserves
are estimated at 200 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning we hoped we could discover a huge oil reserve
here,'' acknowledged Jia Chengzao, deputy chief of China's Tarim
oil and gas prospecting zone. ``But from our experience, we have
found more gas than oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese have had some successes on their own
exploration blocks, nothing the Western drillers have tried here
has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Because the suspected oil layers lie up to 20,000 feet below the
dunes, drillers are forced to use new and expensive wildcatting
tricks, including three-dimensional seismic modeling, digital
simulation and high-pressure jetting for super-deep drilling. And
the high-tech hasn't been working.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon, which has been hunting for oil in the Taklimakan since
1993, is the only Western company still drilling. Unless Exxon's
fortunes get better, it may pull out before long.
</P>
<P>
   An Exxon spokesman in Dallas said the oil company was not
currently drilling in the Tarim Basin, but Jia confirmed that Exxon
is now drilling a wildcat well on one of its New Jersey-sized
lease-holdings on the northwestern edge of the desert and should
learn within two months if it is a winner. Jia said Exxon already
abandoned another similar-sized block after another wildcat well
found no commercial-sized oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon spokesman did not return follow-up phone calls from
Cox Newspapers inquiring about the exploratory well of which Jia
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum, which won one of the first lease blocks in
1993, has already dropped out after finding nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Agip, which hold the rights to explore a territory
bigger than Wisconsin, have drilled two dry holes and have told the
Chinese they have no plans for further exploration, according to
Jia. The Agip-Texaco leases are due to expire at the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
   The Taklimakan hasn't been tamed so far. Maybe it never will be.

 &HT;    Young Harry Potter casting spells in our house
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The book is never where he left it.
Sometimes we find it in plain view on the dining room table,
sometimes it's hidden under a denim pillow on the couch. More often
than not, though, it's on the floor by my side of the bed, squarely
on top of the Crate &AMP; Barrel Christmas catalog.
</P>
<P>
   After Harry Potter came into our lives, I started doing what any
decent mother would do when she and her 8-year-old son are sharing
the same novel from The New York Times bestseller list. Night after
pathetic night, I sit calmly and patiently outside the child's
bedroom door yelling: ``It is very late. Put that book down NOW. Go
to sleep. You are getting sleepy. Very sleepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, the second my shouting soothes the boy to sleep, I scurry
in there and steal ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Across continents, the stories of the young wizard with the
wire-rim glasses and the lightning-bolt scar have kick-started
family reading hours and turned young video drones into bookworms.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares about the nation _ or the world, for that matter?
_ when the books are taking over my very own household? For months
lately, I've been trying to get into a good book. I've started
``The Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' a million and one times. I tried ``Singing
in the Comeback Choir.'' Nothing felt right. Then one afternoon,
after hearing about Harry from both the national press and the
neighbors, we bought a Harry Potter book and read Chapter One. That
night, the third-grader commandeered the family copy. ``This book
is glued to my hand,'' he told me. He's almost not exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   The books _ ``The Sorcerer's Stone'' is the first, and there are
two more: ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry
Potter and the Prisoners of Azkaban'' _ center around a young boy
named Harry Potter. Harry was orphaned when he was just a baby,
raised by his cold aunt and uncle, made to put up with his selfish
cousin, and then whisked off to wizard school when he is 11.
They've made a millionaire out of J.K. Rowling, the single mother
from Scotland who used to wheel her baby girl to the local cafe so
she could sit and drink tea and make up Harry stories in longhand.
She still writes with pen and paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's wonderful stories are refreshing and intriguing and
funny and fascinating. And we better enjoy it now. The good news is
that there are four more books to come.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is Warner Brothers has the rights on the toys and
the rights on the movie, which is due out in 2001. Pretty soon it
will be Harry, Harry everywhere. I figure that will pretty much
kill the magic.
</P>
<P>
   Kylene Beers, an assistant professor of reading and literature
at the University of Houston who was hired by Scholastic Inc. to
write the classroom study guides for the Harry Potter books, puts
it like this: ``I'd love it if there were never a movie and never a
toy. Most of the kids, they don't want a movie and they don't want
a toy. I'd love not to see the commercialization of Harry Potter.
But that's the grown-ups. That's greed.'' Which is a shame, because
the Harry Potter books are meant to be read. Word for beautiful
word:
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts:
wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere
different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that
you had to remember to jump. Then there were the doors that
wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly
the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but
solid walls just pretending....''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is a wizard, except he spends the first 11 years of
his miserable life not knowing it. He lives with his aunt and uncle
and their son, Dudley. He's never really mistreated, never really
abused. But he only gets leftover presents, and he never gets quite
enough to eat. He sleeps in a cupboard beneath the stairs. He's
left behind with the weird old neighbor lady during all the best
family outings. Worst of all, Harry is just plain not loved. Yet he
perseveres.
</P>
<P>
   All his life, Harry has gotten in the doghouse for his
unexplained ``talents.'' Once his hair grew back after auntie
shaved it. Another time a boa constrictor went after Dudley. And
that wizardry aspect of the books has spawned some flak in a few of
the Bible Belt states. Parents in small school districts in South
Carolina and Georgia launched rather weak protests, trying to get
the books banned in schools. No action on that yet. A conservative
group in Virginia started an anti-Harry Web site. The argument?
Harry promotes wickedness and dark and evil. He represents ``the
dark side of religion,'' said one group. But I figure the truth is
this: Those people represent the dark side of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as
they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a
single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt
strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he
swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and
looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right
up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled.
The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret
magic....''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Rowling's books will focus on one year of Harry's life
at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He'll age from 11 to
17 in the series. Hogwarts is where he meets his best friend, Ron.
It's where he piles his plate with food and learns how to cast
spells and eats candy with names such as Bertie Bott's Every Flavor
Beans (they come in peppermint AND spinach), Chocolate Frogs,
Cauldron Cakes and Droobles Best Blowing Gum. It's where ghosts
greet you in the halls and pictures wink and owls serve as
household pets.
</P>
<P>
   The story of J.K. Rowling and how she came to fame is magical
itself. Rowling started writing the first Harry book in 1990 when
she was married to a Portuguese journalist. The marriage ended in
1993, and she returned with her young daughter to Edinburgh, where
she went on public assistance. Her first advance on the book was
for $3,300. Today, she's a millionaire many times over. The first
two books were published in 28 languages and have sold 7 million
copies. Rowling, who recently finished a U.S. book tour, is back in
Scotland writing and is refusing interviews. ``She can't do
publicity all the time,'' said her spokesman with Scholastic.
``She's got to write.''
</P>
<P>
   In longhand. On scraps of paper. About a boy named Harry. Word
by magical word.

 &HT;    Hot-dogs, hotheads leave this fan cold
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If organized youth sports are to
continue, we can't have parents, in their enthusiasm, running onto
the field to bite an official's nose off over a disputed call. Must
our more demonstrative parents be trussed up on the sidelines like
Hannibal Lecter?
</P>
<P>
   Since human nature hasn't changed since Achilles sulked in his
tent, it is puzzling why parents are suddenly deciding that when
the coach pulls your kid out of the game, the thing to do is to go
to your car for your gun and teach the coach a lesson. When I was a
kid, a few parents did make fools of themselves, yelling at
coaches, heckling opposing players and throwing tantrums when their
kids were benched.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't remember any parent running out on the field or
getting violent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what I remember is feeling embarrassed for the players
whose parents behaved badly and thinking, ``When I grow up and have
kids, I'll check myself into an insane asylum before I show my big
red and purple baboon rump like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So when did boisterous bad manners turn into assault with intent
to kill?
</P>
<P>
   It happened when being cut off in traffic became punishable by
death. It happened when getting fired was reason enough to buy out
a gun store and make everybody sorry.
</P>
<P>
   It began to happen when sports heroes stopped behaving like
adults.
</P>
<P>
   I remember a time before the in-your-face fist pump when a home
run was celebrated by everybody but the slugger, who modestly
trotted the bases as if it were no big deal. I remember when a sack
was not followed by a sack dance. I remember a time before the
end-zone spike when a back concluded a dazzling run by handing the
ball to the referee.
</P>
<P>
   I remember before John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors there was John
Newcombe, who would challenge a line call by glancing briefly at
the umpire, and if the call wasn't reversed, shrug indifferently
and resume play.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the root of the problem: Inside everybody is a nasty,
despicable gloater.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when you played Monopoly as a child and there was this
one kid in the neighborhood who started cackling and rubbing his
hands as you approached his hotel-laden Park Place and Boardwalk
and how you sweated blood trying pass Go and survive another
go-around? And how when finally you landed on Boardwalk, this evil,
gloating, prancing, chortling spawn of Satan leaned over and raked
away all your currency, then did the dirty hula in your face?
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, you had to kill him and you tried, upending the
board and sinking your thumbs into his windpipe until an adult
intervened:
</P>
<P>
   ``There, there, children, is that any way to play?''
</P>
<P>
   No, that wasn't the way to play, and we learned that rubbing it
in was a good way to get rubbed out. And then _ if you were of my
generation _ you learned from your sports heroes that when you
pulled off a good play, you were cool about it. You let others sing
your praises. To act full of yourself was to be called a
``hot-dogger.''
</P>
<P>
   It all gets down to sportsmanship, and understanding that while
winning is good and gives wings to the spirit, losing is bad and
consideration for the other guy must limit your jubilation.
Unrestrained glee leads to the other guys' demoralization. Push the
disappointed too hard and you may find his thumbs on your windpipe.
</P>
<P>
   Taunting and chest-thumping and trash-mouthing comes at a
societal cost. When the winner is a bad sport about winning, the
loser becomes a worse sport about losing. Life becomes a World
Wrestling Federation steel-cage death match.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage, job rage and Little League rage become epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes
to you.

   These are just two of the many responses from editors across the
country who have published ``Ain't Done Yet: A Newspaper Novel
About the So-Called End of the World'' _ 29 suspenseful
installments, by ROY PETER CLARK, the Poynter Institute senior
scholar and well-known writing coach. It's available exclusively
from The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   The novel tracks a doomsday cult with a charismatic,
wordplay-loving leader and explosive plans for New Millennium Eve.
It features an unforgettable cast of characters. Mystery. Romance.
Spine-tingling suspense. Tears. Laugh-out-loud laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't Done Yet,'' commissioned as a millennium project by The
New York Times Regional Newspaper Group, is an exceptional
editorial/marketing opportunity that can start working for your
newspaper immediately.
</P>
<P>
   THE SPECIFICS ...
</P>
<P>
   _ It is written to be read in short, digestible, six-minute
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is marvelously illustrated with line drawings by Limbert
Fabian, artist for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune and NYTRENG. The art
is available on NewsCom and the Wieck Photo Database.
</P>
<P>
   _ It combines an action-packed narrative with
spiritual/philosophical themes that make it a
holiday/turn-of-the-century special event _ a natural for
imaginative advertising sponsorships. (The novel ends minutes after
midnight, Jan. 1, 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be distributed as an advertiser-supported giveaway at
newsstands, with two or three episodes as a lure to bring readers
to the newspaper series.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can run for as long as a month, building readership, and
converting Sunday readers to every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ It can be posted on your Web site, as a sure-fire traffic
draw. There new readers can catch up with the narrative, or collect
all the chapters. The novel will also spark reader exchanges on the
Web, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is accessible immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best of all ... it is very affordable.

scholar and well-known writing coach. It's available exclusively
from The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>

New York Times Regional Newspaper Group, is an exceptional
editorial/marketing opportunity that can start working for your

<P>
   _ It is written to be read in short, digestible, six-minute

 &HT;    A hairy situation
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;   c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few days ago I was sharing minimal
breathing space with a most pleasant gentleman. From the confines
of our coach-class airline seats, we discussed the weather and deep
sea fishing _ two subjects about which I know nothing. Better to
fake it though than to bring up what was really on my mind _ how to
tell him his hair was on crooked.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not unfamiliar with situations like this. My old friend
Roscoe had a piece that was forever coming unglued and planting
itself over one ear making him look like he'd been too long at sea.
When this happened, rather than let
</P>
<P>
   him walk around looking like the absent-minded history professor
he was, I would give his ginger-colored toupee a shove back into
place. He'd just grin and mutter, ``Thank ya' sweetly.''
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe and I used to do some amateur theatre together in the
little west Georgia town we called home. Frequently, his hair
created a drama of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a performance of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,''
Roscoe was so deep into his emoting that when he flung one arm wide
in helpless supplication, a gesture he'd never tried in rehearsal,
he knocked over a lighted, 10-foot Christmas tree. I dodged just in
time but the set was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Pro that he was, Roscoe began ad-libbing as he stooped to pick
up the tree, and just when it looked like the moment had been
saved, a wayward limb snagged his hair and swept it half-way across
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Still in character, Roscoe dropped the tree, retrieved his hair,
slapped it
</P>
<P>
   back on his head and went on: ``This house is going crazy! Mr.
Whatsisname won't go home, the Christmas tree is ruined, and . .
.'' here he paused, raised a hand to his head in theatrical
frustration and discovered the worst, ``and . . . and . . . Oh
Lord! Now my (cuss cuss) hair's on backwards!'' The audience went
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at curtain calls, folks cheered Roscoe so wildly that,
caught up in
</P>
<P>
   the moment, the big ham responded by sweeping off his hair and
waving it at the audience while gallantly bowing from the waist.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't theatre and the gentleman sitting next to me
might not share Roscoe's artless approach to hair.
</P>
<P>
   I'd really like to tell him about the time Roscoe was playing
Snoopy in
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' How we'd had to build a
giant doghouse sturdy enough to support our 300-pound dog who spent
most of the play straddling it and complaining about the
sharp-clawed birds perched on his stomach or waxing poetic over his
food dish.
</P>
<P>
   Our Snoopy wore a white turtleneck, black pants, and a hairpiece
that for
</P>
<P>
   one scene had to be quickly removed and replaced with a leather
flying helmet for his World War I flying ace monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Timing and lighting made this scene work. Snoopy would be
napping atop his dog house when the group action ended and the
stage went dark. He had 10 seconds to take off his hair and lay it
on the steps hidden behind the dog
</P>
<P>
   house, slip on the helmet, and be ready to go before the lights
came back up. At the end of the scene he had another 10 seconds to
reverse the action. Helmet off, hair on, lights up. After a couple
of weeks' rehearsal, it was going quite smoothly. Then we opened.
</P>
<P>
   Snoopy's monologue went brilliantly. But when the lights came
down we could hear the dog snarling in the darkness, ``I can't find
my hair!'' Then louder, ``Who took my (cuss cuss) hair?'' The
lights came up just in time to catch Charlie Brown tossing Snoopy's
wig to Linus. Later, at the cast party, we joked about having added
another ``great moment'' to theatre, comparing Roscoe's hair
</P>
<P>
   scene with Olivier's Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   But the passenger next to me was a stranger, not someone I'd
known since we both were pups. And he might have been offended had
I leaned over and
</P>
<P>
   stage-whispered above the jet drone, ``Excuse me sir, but your
hair's on
</P>
<P>
   crooked.''
</P>
<P>
   I decided to leave it alone and hope he had a friend who'd
straighten it for
</P>
<P>
   him.

 &HT;    `Spiders' spinning profits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors have piled an astonishing amount of money into index
mutual funds: $244 billion as of last week.
</P>
<P>
   That's a hard number to grasp. It is, by way of comparison,
about the same amount the government spends on national defense
each year.
</P>
<P>
   We could think of that $244 billion as a testimonial to our
thriftiness. We can certainly see that it's enough money to attract
hungry competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competitors now are ``spiders,'' an investment
alternative that is mostly like a stock and a little bit like an
index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Spider is the salesman's term for a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
depositary receipt. Technically, a spider is a unit investment
trust. To you and me, it acts like a stock.
</P>
<P>
   A spider owns huge amounts of all the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500
index. When you buy shares in the spider, you are buying an
interest in all those companies at once. In that respect, it's
pretty much like an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The name may be laughable, something only a marketer could dream
up. But spiders are attracting serious money.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for that popularity, other than advertising, is
that spiders can be bought or sold at any time of the day or night.
``I like the ability to trade it like a stock,'' said William J.
Kring, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``If you want to
place an order at 10 o'clock, you can do that. You have full
liquidity during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, mutual funds are traded only at the end of the
market day, at whatever price they are worth at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of trusts is increasing rapidly. Now you can buy
spiderlike trusts that track the Dow 30 (Diamonds, ticker symbol
DIA), the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (Qubes, ticker symbol: QQQ)
and the S&AMP;P Midcap 400 index (midcap SPDRs, MDY).
</P>
<P>
   More adventurous investors can pick trusts that hold the stocks
of 17 countries (World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS) and nine
industrial sectors tracked by Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, you could construct an entire diversified portfolio
buying only spiders and their cousins.
</P>
<P>
   So which is best, index funds or trusts?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has to be: It depends.
</P>
<P>
   _ For short-term traders, as distinct from investors, spiders
are attractive. You can duck in and out at will. You can buy
spiders on margin or sell them short, if you like that kind of
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   _ For long-term investors, it's a toss-up. ``Both of them are
suitable for the long term,'' said Kris Culp, who manages $8
billion in the five index funds run by T. Rowe Price. ``The things
that make them different probably don't matter that much to
long-term investors.''
</P>
<P>
   _ For slow and steady investors who put in a small amount each
payday, spiders are a terrible idea. That's because there's a sales
commission for each transaction, just like with other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you use a deep-discount broker and pay as little as $10
per each transaction, the cost is too high. If you can afford to
invest $50 each payday, for example, the sales commission would eat
20 percent of your investment. Stick with index funds, very few of
which charge a front-end load.
</P>
<P>
   _ If taxes drive you buggy, spiders and their kin are worth an
extra look.
</P>
<P>
   Even index mutual funds sell stocks. That usually means capital
gains, which are distributed to shareholders and are taxable.
Spiders are fixed portfolios, meaning they almost never sell any of
their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar, the Chicago-based funds researcher,
the Vanguard 500 Index fund distributed capital gains of $2.08 per
share from January 1993 through May 1999. Spiders distributed only
9 cents.
</P>
<P>
   One other consideration is cost. Spiders involve a sales
commission; index mutual funds usually have none. Be sure to check
before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Operating expenses also are important. They ought to be very
low, because you are paying a manager to do almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Spiders have annual expenses of .18 percent. On the mutual fund
side, you can buy S&AMP;P 500 index funds with about the same expense
levels from USAA, Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the mutual funds, and some of the narrowly focused
trusts, may cost much more.

 &HT;    Earmuffs shield a practical man from the rat-a-tat of chat
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man went shopping last
week.
</P>
<P>
   He bought peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   For $17.99.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant stroke was necessitated by his boss, a woman who
takes inexplicable delight in trying to shake the practical man's
calm repose. Her quest is folly, for the practical man is
unflappable, but her latest gambit required immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a change, Practical Man,'' she said. ``You'll
sit there from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the Desk of Doom, a cozy but cursed cube that
lies in a killing field known to the practical man as the Bedlam
Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The triangle is flanked on one side by a gossip columnist who
spends all day on the phone with his Palm Beach ``contacts,'' most
of whom have apparently misplaced their hearing aids, for no juicy
tidbit is secured without a shoutfest that would shame a football
fan. A second side is sealed by the clerk who collects birth
announcements, which, the practical man is delighted to report,
arrive at the paper at roughly the rate of 2,000 per day. At the
base of the triangle squats the copy desk, a surly beast with 10
heads that can't decide whether ``cheese ball'' is one word or two
without a protracted summit, including filibusters all around.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man's powers of concentration are considerable,
but even they were no match for the cacophony that accompanied his
new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   So he went to a gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   Pistols, rifles, shotguns, grenades. Bah, tempting but too
expensive. The practical man instead had his eye on a pair of
bright-red muffs designed to protect the ears of gun nuts who blast
away hay bales on the shooting range. He broke a twenty and went
back to work with change in his pocket and a solution on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The muffs instantly plunged the practical man into a calm and
quiet pool of productivity _ precisely, of course, where he wanted
to be. But their true beauty didn't dawn on him until a few days
later: The muffs repelled pointless chitchat.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers no longer stopped by to ask the practical man how he
was doing, how were his kids, how was his weekend. They found
someone else to flap to about the great movie they saw last night,
or the big game coming up Sunday. They dared to intrude upon the
practical man's peace only when they had something important to
say.
</P>
<P>
   What a bonus! It was as if the practical man had purchased the
perfect toolbox, then found it was stuffed with gold.
</P>
<P>
   On to the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: I just read how Burger King and McDonalds
are coming out with competing lines of movie-related toys in a ploy
to have the nation's spoiled brats repeatedly drag their wimpy
parents into the two grease-emporiums. When did our nation's
parents devolve into such bottom-dwelling fools that they let their
kids decide where they eat? _ George
</P>
<P>
   When our nation's parents decided making money and feeling
``personally fulfilled'' were more important than raising kids.
</P>
<P>
   When both parents work, or when parents are divorced, the
parents know in their hearts they've wronged their children. They
feel guilty and try to make up for it by acting more like aunts and
uncles than moms and dads. They stop in every so often, pay the
kiddies some attention, buy them a treat and then hustle back into
self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   A crappy Happy Meal and a two-bit toy is a cheap fix for lousy
parents. It lets them feel, at least for the 20 minutes it takes
the kid to munch the burger and break the bauble, like they're
doing right by their kid.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: The other day my wife openly mocked the
clothes I was wearing, not for their look (she's done that before)
but for their ``over practicality.''
</P>
<P>
   Wounded, I reassessed the staples of my wardrobe: Loafers (no
laces to tie), wrinkle-free slacks (no dry-cleaning bills), and
golf shirts (no ironing).
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm wondering if I should forsake convenience for a little
bit of flair. Can you be fashionable and functional? _ Roy

 &HT;    The common things of Camelot on display at Kennedy exhibit
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the same week grocery-store tabloid
stories offered a guide to Kennedy graves and the headline ``Jackie
O. Branded a Thief,'' the Florida International Museum opened John
F. Kennedy: The Exhibition. Whether it's sleaze or scholarship, 36
years after JFK was slain in Dallas, the public's insatiable
fascination with the Kennedy family remains durable and undiluted.
</P>
<P>
   In the downtown St. Petersburg museum, which was once a Maas
Brothers department store, the exhibit opened Nov. 12 and runs
through May. It includes hundreds of personal items _ papers,
letters and clothing _ once belonging to JFK, Jackie, John Jr. and
Caroline that show just how common this uncommon family really is.
</P>
<P>
   A child's white terrycloth robe worn by JFK Jr. Caroline's
drawings and the crayons she kept in her father's Oval Office desk.
Doodles made by the 35th president during high-pressure meetings _
``Blockade Cuba!'' Jackie's note to JFK's secretary, Evelyn
Lincoln, after her husband was assassinated: ``Dearest Evelyn.
There will never be Camelot again.'' Two of JFK's signature rocking
chairs and his christening ring. Glass case after glass case turn
the mundane into a mosiac of history.
</P>
<P>
   With a cassette player and self-guiding audio tape (free with
admission), you can walk through JFK's life as represented in 20
themed galleries. The Kennedy White House years are designed to
evoke JFK's Oval Office, Lincoln's office and The Rose Garden. The
first lady also has a gallery. Another gallery, JFK: The Floridian,
is highlighted by the shots of veteran Palm Beach photographer Bob
Davidoff.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent photo panels detail the history and complement the
audiotape for visitors, who can count on spending at least an hour
seeing the exhibit, which also includes two short films.
</P>
<P>
   You can even start a Kennedy collection of your own. The
museum's gift shop sells everything from obligatory coffee mugs
($9.99) and T-shirts ($14.99 to $19.99) to a denim jacket and JFK
Ray Ban sunglasses (both $99.99). Souvenir coconuts are similar to
the famous one with a message from JFK that led to his WWII Pacific
Island rescue ($9.99).
</P>
<P>
   The Florida International Museum opened in 1995. Of its six
exhibits, TITANIC: THE EXHIBITION in 1998 was the biggest, drawing
830,000 people, and Alexander the Great was not so great, selling a
disappointing 170,000 tickets. The JFK exhibit, with $13.95 adult
tickets, needs to attract 220,000 to break even. So far 40,000
advance tickets have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Anything Kennedy would seem to be a Baby-Boomer slam dunk as a
museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't think it was a slam dunk at all,'' says Sheila
McPhelin-Mutchler, Florida International Museum's director of
exhibitions. ``But I did think we could put together something that
would be popular enough with visitors that we'd be able to draw
people in. On that I was sure.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no ``John F. Kennedy: The Exhibition'' if Lincoln
wasn't a pack rat. The Nebraska native was with JFK from 1953 until
Nov. 22, 1963, when she collected the contents of his pockets after
he was murdered in Dallas. She was then dispatched to the White
House by Lyndon Johnson to clean out JFK's Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln died in 1995. Her will designated a trunk of personal
effects to go to the Kennedy family and filing cabinets of papers
to The Kennedy Library. The rest went to Kennedy memorabilia
collector Robert White of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600 items on display in St. Pete, he owns 80 percent.
White, 51, a former industrial cleaning supplies salesman, began
collecting Kennedy stuff at age 11 when he sent a letter to Lincoln
asking for the president's autographed photo. That anonymous
request blossomed into a friendship that resulted in her leaving
him nearly 25,000 pieces of Kennedy memorabilia when she died.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall doubled his collection, which included boxes and
boxes holding thousands of pieces of paper, hundreds of political
buttons, hundreds of newspapers. White filled his basement and part
of his mother's cellar.
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of opening a JFK museum and said so on talk show and
radio interviews. Turning it all over to an existing museum wasn't
an option. ``I always, in the back of my mind, felt that someday,
somehow, some way, my collection would come forward and I would be
able to make a living at my collection without selling it,'' White
says. ``That's the dream of every collector.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of Keeper of the Kennedy Stuff came with chronic
worries. ``It was costing me my sanity to deal with this material
on a daily basis when I knew in my heart, I knew in my gut, I had a
world-class collection and I couldn't get to first base with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the constant criticism that crested in 1998.
In a weird cause and effect, White decided to auction 230 pieces of
Kennedy memorabilia. That prompted Caroline Kennedy and the late
John F. Kennedy Jr. to trash Evelyn Lincoln with a statement that
began: ``It is now clear that Mrs. Lincoln took advantage of her
position as our father's secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   White says he was simply auctioning off doubles and triples of
things that sold for $1.2 million. ``That's not a lot considering
what I went through, and I had legal bills which were in excess of
$400,000,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually made nice with the Kennedy family by giving them a
JFK wallet, a money clip and other personal items. In return, he
says, the Kennedy family gave him rights to everything else Lincoln
had left him.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida International Museum got wind of White wanting a
home for his collection and struck a 30-year lease that pays White
$115,000 annually. He also gets $1 for every exhibition ticket past
125,000. At any time during the agreement, the museum can buy
White's entire collection, appraised at $10 million, for $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing in the exhibition that White may find hard to
part with. His favorite item is JFK's mauve-colored, cloth-covered
rocking chair. ``Mrs. Lincoln said there have been more famous
rears in that chair than any chair in history. Eleanor Roosevelt,
Douglas McArthur, Martin Luther King have all sat in that chair,''
reports White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything to me and everything to my collection, the
icon symbol.''

   Nov. 22, 1963: A president killed, a little girl changed
</P>
<P>
   By Douglas Kalajian
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Carol Cromwell wore her best autumn
dress: blue and white. The boys all wore ties. The brightest
students from Miss Patsy Gee's fifth-grade class in Crowley, Texas
(population back then: 1,100), knew they'd been chosen to take a
very special class trip on Friday, Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just going to Dallas, the big city, was so exciting, because
you just didn't go there very often,'' Cromwell recalls. ``But
having a chance to see President and Mrs. Kennedy was beyond
anything we could imagine. Nothing in your whole life could compare
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy's visit to Texas was on everybody's mind in
the rural ranchland where Cromwell grew up. It was also a hot topic
around the country, where it was seen as an early but essential
stop in the president's campaign for reelection the following year.
</P>
<P>
   President Opens Texas Visit Today
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALIC) (AP Nov. 21, 1963)
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS _ President Kennedy comes to politically shaky Texas
today for three days. His pending trip has accented the divisions
in the Texas Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The President and Mrs. Kennedy, along with native son Lyndon B.
Johnson and Mrs. Johnson, will visit cities which produce 36
percent of the Texas vote. Then the party will spend the night at
Vice President Johnson's ranch before returning to Washington,
probably after noon Saturday. (END ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Gee's class was consumed for weeks, cutting out newspaper
stories about the president and never missing the nightly TV news.
Other studies weren't neglected. The relentlessly serious Miss Gee
reminded her class often that only A and B students would be
allowed on the trip. Everyone was trying to make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that I couldn't sleep the night before, because I
was so excited,'' says Cromwell, now 46 and living in West Palm
Beach. ``I was really tired that morning when we got on the bus. It
was still dark outside. The ride was only about an hour, but we
kept falling asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The school bus pulled into a lot alongside so many others.
Dozens of classes like Miss Gee's had come from all over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked to a very nice park,'' says Cromwell. ``I remember
lots of grass and trees. We got very close to the street along the
motorcade route.''
</P>
<P>
   Which park? Which street? A 10-year-old wasn't concerned about
such things, but it must have been somewhere along Elm Street at
Dealey Plaza, where the motorcade turned west about 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was waving,'' she says. ``The adults were all nice.
They stepped back so the children could see everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell never saw the president. She saw the first few cars of
the motorcade roll past. She saw the crowd wave. She heard cheers
all around.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard: pop . . . pop . . . pop . . .
</P>
<P>
   Firecrackers, she had no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, all of a sudden, I couldn't breathe,'' she says.
``Someone pushed me to the ground, and something heavy was on top
of me, pressing me down. I realized it was Miss Gee.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other adults on top of the teacher. Cromwell could
turn her head just enough to see the other kids on the ground, and
people running in every direction. Adults were screaming. Miss Gee
remained calm but immovable. She instructed her students: Stay
down, and stay quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't afraid,'' Cromwell says. ``But I wanted these people
to get off me. Miss Gee and the two adult sponsors who came with us
kept us on the ground for a long time. We had no idea what was
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   When the adults finally got up, they ordered the children to run
back to the bus. Cromwell ran, and listened. The adults were saying
that the firecrackers were really gunshots. Miss Gee looked pale,
and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just imagine now what the adults were going through,''
she says. ``But they just told us to be quiet. No talking on the
bus. Everyone was silent, all the way back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The children filed into Miss Gee's classroom with instructions
to remain silent. The teachers stayed in the hall and talked a
while. Cromwell looked down at her grass-stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to go home,'' she says. ``We all knew something
was very, very wrong. Then Miss Gee came back into the classroom.
She said the president had been shot. Her voice cracked. She never
did anything like that before.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Gee's voice may have faltered, but her instincts didn't.
She asked the children if they wanted to talk about what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody did,'' Cromwell says. ``They wanted to know: Is he
going to be OK? Are we going to be attacked by Russia? She did her
best to handle all those questions. She really did.''
</P>
<P>
   The school day ended early. When Cromwell got home, her mother
met her at the door with the news that President Kennedy was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents were both in mourning, but they were glad I was
OK,'' Cromwell says. ``I felt guilty. All I could think was that
while he was dying, I was lying on the ground worrying about
messing up my dress.''
</P>
<P>
   School didn't resume for several days after that weekend of
national trauma. When it did, Miss Gee's class stayed on topic:
President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started paying tribute,'' Cromwell says. ``We wrote papers.
We painted. Everybody had to do their bit. Things didn't get back
to normal for a week or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell never talked much about her experience. She did not
recall until her mother reminded her many years later that she had
nightmares for a long time after, and that she never wore her
blue-and-white dress again.
</P>
<P>
   She did not become obsessed by the assassination, but she did
take away a life-long interest in public affairs and politics. She
worked in the State Department and later in the White House
communications office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no big deal,'' says Cromwell. ``Half the people in
Washington have done that sort of thing. But I was fascinated by
politics and government. I had to get involved.''

 &HT;    Lucky leap saved couple in deadly cruise ship fire
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Seeing Carl and Wilhelmina Apuzzo
sitting there in their Sewall's Point home, holding hands like a
couple of teenagers, makes it easier to imagine their last moments
on the burning deck of the cruise ship Yarmouth Castle 34 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Flames rushing toward them, smoke billowing up from below, the
Apuzzos looked into each other's eyes and threw their arms around
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Then they jumped, as one, into the dark sea far below.
</P>
<P>
   It was the best decision of their lives. Eighty-nine of their
fellow passengers and two crew members died in the flaming wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Chance had nudged them aboard the aging ship: Wilhelmina won the
overnight Bahamas cruise in a lunch-time drawing at a
long-forgotten restaurant. Carl, then a Coral Gables architect,
liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a boat person since I was 10,'' he says. He knew the
sea well enough to design and build a sleek 26-foot fishing cruiser
before World War II. The Yarmouth Castle belonged to an
even-earlier era.
</P>
<P>
   Launched as the Steam Ship Evangeline in 1927, it might well
have been rechristened the S.S. Kindling by the time the Apuzzos
set sail in 1965. Whatever strength remained in its 379-foot steel
hull, the wood staterooms, decks and railings were fragile and
desiccated.
</P>
<P>
   The danger was a mystery to no one but the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Newer ships used less flammable material and carried more robust
sprinklers and fire-detection systems. Some older ships were being
refitted, but not the Yarmouth Castle: replacing wood with steel
would have made it top-heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The ship fell short of numerous safety standards, but the Coast
Guard had limited authority because the American-built vessel flew
the Panamanian flag. Months before the Apuzzos' cruise, California
congressman William S. Mailliard had cited the Yarmouth Castle when
he introduced a bill requiring that such ships be upgraded or
banned from American ports.
</P>
<P>
   The bill failed. The Apuzzos set sail from Miami for Nassau,
less than 200 miles to the east, a little after 4 p.m. Nov. 12. The
ship carried 374 other passengers and 176 crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember looking around and thinking, `There isn't much more
than paint holding this ship together,''' says Carl, now 89. He
followed his sailor's instinct and checked for vests and lifeboats,
but he kept his concerns to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think much could happen between here and the
Bahamas,'' he says. ``At worst, I thought, the ship would break
down and we'd have to get towed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apuzzos settled into cabin 835 on the promenade deck and
then quickly joined the fun: Dinner, drinks, dancing. Among the
revelers were 70 members of the North Broward Senior Citizens Club.
The shipboard festivities were still going strong when the Apuzzos
retired to their cabin just before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Byron Voutsinas turned in about the same time, with the
ship more than halfway to Nassau. At 12:30 a.m., a crewman spotted
smoke in a ventilator shaft. The chief engineer searched for 15
minutes before alerting the captain. It was 1 a.m. when the crew
traced the smoke's source: Fire was raging through a storage room
below the main staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, flames funneled up the staircase and fanned throughout the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a night owl,'' says Wilhelmina, 87. ``So I was still awake
after 1 o'clock when I heard the commotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl opened the cabin door and found the passage filled with
smoke. Passengers were screaming. He closed the door and grabbed
the life vests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strapped one on her and she strapped one on me,'' he says.
``Luckily, being along the promenade deck, we had a window instead
of portholes. I raised the window and we crawled through.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wearing pajamas and clutching his shaving kit; she was
wearing a nightgown, her white purse containing the cabin key was
slung over one shoulder. Although they landed on the outer deck,
they were soon choking on thick smoke. They covered their mouths
and felt their way to the steep ladder-stairs leading up one deck
to the ship's highest point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We climbed up, but the fire was spreading,'' Carl says. ``We
were toward the front of the ship. Flames were coming out of the
bridge behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The captain had already spotted the fire on the bridge and gave
the order to abandon ship at 1:25. It's unclear whether anyone but
the crewmen nearby heard him. He ordered them to lower a boat.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:45, the captain sailed away from the ship. There were four
other people in his lifeboat. It had a capacity of 42. The Apuzzos
saw one crew member lower a boat and dive in, alone; they found
another boat waiting, but no one to help lower it.
</P>
<P>
   Then a woman behind them cried that she couldn't find her
husband. In an instant, she disappeared behind a wall of flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl said, `Mommy, we have to jump,''' Wilhelmina says. She
couldn't swim, but she didn't question his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a tough decision, Carl says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was jump or broil,'' he says. ``What would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the rail they went, down 40 feet or more, feet first.
Wilhelmina felt the pain in her back the instant she hit the water.
She passed out. Carl held her head up as he struggled to draw them
out of the path of the still-moving ship.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was struggling to draw them back. Two ships, a Finnish
freighter and another cruise ship, spotted the fire and sent
lifeboats to pick up survivors. Carl was waving, shouting and
swimming toward them when a searchlight turned their way. The
Apuzzos were in the water more than 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Apuzzos were taken aboard the Bahama Star, which worked its
way so close to the foundering Yarmouth Castle that its flank was
singed. Rescue efforts were kept up through the night. The two
rescue ships took aboard more than 450 passengers and crew but
turned one lifeboat away _ the one carrying Capt. Voutsinas.
</P>
<P>
   The hulk of the Yarmouth Castle sank at 6:05.
</P>
<P>
   The Apuzzos landed in the Bahamas later that day, still in their
wet night clothes. Wilhelmina was wrapped in a sheet and taken to a
hospital. Carl, who wasn't hurt (''except I felt like I'd been
spanked''), was taken to an inn and given pants and a shirt donated
by a local merchant.
</P>
<P>
   They flew back to Miami a day later, after Wilhelmina was
released. She had a severely bruised back and three broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yarmouth Castle still ranks as one of the worst cruise ship
disasters. Many of the dead were from South Florida, including 23
members of the North Broward Senior Citizens Club. Many of the
victims were trapped in interior cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot ensured they'd be
remembered by writing and recording the five-minute-plus Ballad of
the Yarmouth Castle in 1969. (''God help the ones who sleep below
and cannot find the way. Thank God for those we rescued upon this
awful day! Now the heroes they are many but the times are goin'
slim, And now from stern to bow she's a-blazin'.'')
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the tragedy, wood was banned in construction
of cruise ships and tougher fire-safety regulations were adopted
for all ships picking up passengers in U.S. ports, regardless of
flag. The cause of the Yarmouth Castle fire was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Voutsinas was sharply criticized by Coast Guard
investigators but not punished; he left the shipping industry to
open a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the crew followed his example and left passengers
to fend for themselves, there were exceptions. Purser Terry Wise, a
Canadian who wintered in Boca Raton, was later commended for
bravery.
</P>
<P>
   The Apuzzos retired to Sewall's Point in 1977. They've been on
two cruises since the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look around first,'' Carl says. ``And I check the
life vests.''

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The crew grumbled about rotten wages and
her father grumbled about rotten service, but Doris Wacker was too
thrilled to pay much attention. A luxury cruise to Havana was one
dazzling high school graduation present in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 18-year-old then wasn't as worldly as today,'' she says.
``I thought it was all just wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Morro Castle had been sailing between New York and Cuba for
four years in high style but low spirits, at least below deck.
There were rumors, even then, of smuggling and strife that neared
mutiny. Havana was little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we docked, we saw soldiers with rifles,'' she says. ``It
was a very difficult time in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   It was soon far worse on board the Morro Castle. Capt. Robert
Wilmott collapsed and died as the ship neared the end of its return
voyage. The cause was reported as severe indigestion; it was later
suspected to be a heart attack, or perhaps poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to have a gala farewell dinner on the last
night,'' Doris recalls. ``When the captain didn't appear, they
announced he had died and all festivities for the night were
canceled. It put everyone in a somber mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Officer W.F. Harms took command as a furious storm began
to rock the ship. Doris went to a friend's stateroom. ``We decided
to stay up all night,'' she says. ``We were changing clothes and
getting ready to dock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was early Saturday, Sept. 9. At 2:15 a.m., a crewman reported
a fire in a store room full of blankets. The new captain, his
attention focused on the storm, declined to order a distress
signal. The fire quickly spread out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend and I finished changing and walked out on deck,''
Doris says. ``We saw flame and smoke. I found a steward, but he
said, 'Everything's fine. Don't worry.' I decided to go get my
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   She found them just as they'd begun to search for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was mass confusion,'' Doris says. ``We got no
instructions from the crew. We'd never had a fire drill. My father
decided we should put our life jackets on, but no one had shown us
how.''
</P>
<P>
   The family was struggling to tie on the bulky, cork-filled vests
when the cruise director appeared. ``He herded everyone to the
stern,'' Doris says. ``You couldn't go forward into the flames.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship, just miles off Asbury Park, N.J., was still moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck was hot, the air was smoky, and the flames were
fanning,'' Doris says. ``I thought, 'I'll take the water over fire
any day.' So when the ship finally stopped, I jumped.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Wackers joined dozens of others who rushed to the railing,
lowered themselves from a rope and jumped into the roiling ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could swim, but my parents couldn't,'' she says. ``We all
stayed together and rode the swells, which were very high. We could
see the New Jersey shore, but every time there was a swell you'd
get turned around again and pushed away.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours, they fought just to breathe. It was impossible to
keep from swallowing sea water.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and I expelled most of it, but my father finally
just gave up,'' she says. ``He couldn't fight any longer. That's
how he died.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven hours in the water, they were spotted by a search
plane carrying the governor of New Jersey. A fishing boat was sent
to their rescue. ``But they'd wouldn't take the dead,'' Doris says.
``That was traumatic for my mother. She didn't want to leave my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   His body was later brought to shore, but her mother was too ill
and distraught to attend the funeral. Doris recovered quickly and
went on to become a dance teacher. She got married, became Doris
Manske and moved to Florida in 1949. She's now 83 and lives in Palm
Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The Morro Castle and its 134 victims became one of the sea's
great mystery stories. Doris testified at much-publicized hearings
the following year. The inquiry ended with no cause determined and
no charges filed.
</P>
<P>
   The acting captain was cited for negligence because he didn't
order an SOS, but there's reason to wonder if a signal would have
been transmitted: The chief radio operator was later discovered to
have a history of arson and was convicted of attempted murder in an
unrelated case. He remains the prime-but-unofficial suspect in many
accounts of the Morro Castle disaster.

 &HT;    Boys didn't have to win to make this dad proud
 &HT;    By Dan Neal
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ My sons are football players, but I'm no
football fan.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to high school, I'd lost interest in the game.
I was in the band, had my mind on music _ and my eyes on the
majorettes. The action there seemed so much more compelling than
the monotonous back and forth on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Later, although I tried, I couldn't pass on my distaste for
football to my boys. Travis, 16, has carried on a 10-year love
affair with the sport, and his brother, Danny, 11, wants only one
thing in life: To be like Travis.
</P>
<P>
   So week after week for the better part of our marriage, my wife
Judie and I have trudged to the gridiron for pee wee world titles,
flag football face-offs, junior varsity jamborees. We've cheered
and booed, cajoled and encouraged through years of weekend games
and weeknight practices. Their tiny dramas have cost us plenty of
tears, but the boys were just having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Then this year Travis, a junior, made the varsity squad. It was
something he'd been practicing for almost all his life, something
he'd been desperate to achieve since he was a freshman on the JV
team. He was proud and so were we, but the fun stopped with the
first game.
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately apparent, even to this football idiot, that
his team, the Falcons, weren't going to just lose every game this
year. They were going to get creamed. They were few and small. The
other teams were bigger, faster, more skilled.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, they were led to the slaughter _ 47-6, 30-0,
47-0. Week after week, Judie and I watched the massacre _ I in
quiet resignation, she in loud defiance.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few games, Judie cheered wildly for victory. It's
27-0 in the first quarter, the stands are nearly empty and the band
didn't bother to show up, but she's standing on the bleachers
hollering, ``Come on, Falcons! You can do it!''
</P>
<P>
   By the final few games, she was more realistic. ``Come on
Falcons! Don't fumble this time!''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too tough to watch your kid lose _ we had seen that
many times. But it's unbearable to watch a son who's thrown his
heart into it, who's spent hours practicing every day after school,
who's wanted nothing in his life more than to win this game,
destroyed, helpless, hanging his head, without hope.
</P>
<P>
   After the first game, I told Travis there'd be no shame in
transferring to another school. It was only the captain who had to
go down with the ship. No, he said, he couldn't leave the team.
After he got his first car in early October, I told him there'd be
no shame in giving up football so he'd have more time to work. Cars
and girlfriends cost money. No, he said, he couldn't leave the
team.
</P>
<P>
   At age 38, it's hard to understand the logic of 16. Adults with
families to feed and bills to pay can't afford to persist in
failure. They can't be loyal to lost causes, for the stakes are too
high. But they can recognize courage, and they know nothing demands
more of it than losing.
</P>
<P>
   So when people tell me _ as they invariably do _ that the
Falcons' season ``built character,'' I tell them they're wrong.
Those boys had plenty of that all along.

 &HT;    Strike now to gain upper hand in inevitable cold war
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first part of this fall was fairly mild, but,
from here on out, it probably will get colder and colder through
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Start thinking now about preparing your house for really cold
weather.
</P>
<P>
   GUTTERS, SPRINKLERS NEED ATTENTION
</P>
<P>
   You've probably cleaned your gutters at least once already.
Check them again after the last leaves fall to be sure they're
still clear.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've done your last gutter-cleaning of the year, you
probably won't need your outdoor water supply. Turn off the water
using the valve leading to the outdoor faucet. Disconnect and store
the hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the outside water on invites frozen pipes.
</P>
<P>
   If you have an automatic sprinkler system, the water should be
blown from the pipes to prevent freezing damage.
</P>
<P>
   It may be time to turn on the humidifier. Signs that it's time
to increase humidity are static electricity buildup, dry leaves on
house plants, dry skin and dry throat.
</P>
<P>
   Clean your summer tools, including the lawn mower, and put them
away. Pull out the winter tools such as shovels and snow blowers,
and check to see if they're in working order before you need to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when it's not too cold outside, is a good time to improve
your storage areas. Add shelves, baskets and hooks to put tools,
chemicals and other supplies away neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful when storing fertilizers and pesticides. Use clearly
marked containers and place them out of the reach of children.
Store liquids where they won't freeze.
</P>
<P>
   PREPARE ROOFS, PIPES FOR COLD
</P>
<P>
   House roofs in this part of the country don't usually get ice
dams; our winters aren't very severe. But it only takes one
occurrence to allow water to seep under shingles and damage
ceilings, insulation, wallboards and framing timbers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the process of creating an ice dam is heating the snow
from below. A good layer of insulation in your attic keeps heat
from your living area from reaching the roof, and proper
ventilation lets cold outside air flow through your attic, keeping
the underside of the roof cool.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unlucky or don't prepare properly, and an ice dam
forms, your best bet may be to wait it out. It's almost impossible
to chip off the ice without damaging the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Water pipes that run along outside walls or through unheated
crawlspaces can freeze in severely cold weather, cutting off the
water supply to some taps.
</P>
<P>
   To keep water pipes from freezing when it gets really cold, open
vanities under sinks and raise the temperature in areas with
exposed pipes by turning up your thermostat or using a space
heater.
</P>
<P>
   If pipes leading to a particular faucet often freeze, turn on
the cold water at that tap to let water trickle continuously when
the weather is coldest.
</P>
<P>
   Insulating wraps for water pipes near outside walls might help,
but you also might have to request that a plumber move pipes that
have been installed in areas that are vulnerable to the cold.
</P>
<P>
   If a pipe still freezes, try to melt the clog by using a blow
dryer to heat the cold-water pipe at the point it approaches the
outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   Electric pipe wraps also are available at home-supply stores. A
space heater placed in front of an open vanity might thaw pipes
under a sink, but never use a torch or flame to try to melt an ice
clog.
</P>
<P>
   STAY SAFE WHILE STAYING WARM
</P>
<P>
   Your furnace works hardest, of course, when the weather is
coldest. If you can lower your thermostat and still be comfortable,
you'll save money and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing warmer clothes and adding humidity to dry rooms will
enable you to lower thermostat settings for the hours your family
is active.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't already have a programmable thermostat, get one.
These devices turn down your home's heating system during the hours
you are usually asleep or away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Close the registers in rooms that aren't being used, but don't
let the temperature in any room drop below about 60 degrees.
Weather-strip around the doors of rooms that are closed for most of
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Change the furnace filter every month.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cutting off drafts at doors and windows with rolled-up
towels, tape or plastic sheeting reduces demands on your furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Space heaters can make your house warmer, but they are dangerous
if improperly used.
</P>
<P>
   Keep space heaters at least three feet from any combustible
object, such as furniture, drapes or bedspreads.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave young children or pets alone with a space heater.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a space heater, get one that automatically
shuts off when it is bumped or knocked over. Also make sure that
any fuel-burning space heater you buy is rated for indoor use. A
heater meant for outdoor use can cause a build-up of deadly carbon
monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Go outside when putting fuel in kerosene heaters and use the
right type of kerosene. Do not put gasoline in a kerosene heater _
that can cause an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the wick is clean on a kerosene heater. Dirty wicks
can cause carbon-monoxide poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use electric heaters in the bathroom, where they can get
wet.
</P>
<P>
   Some people light their fireplaces in cold weather. However, an
open, wood-burning fireplace is primarily decorative. It draws warm
air from the room and sends it out the chimney, forcing your
furnace to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   Enclosed fireplaces, gas fireplaces, wood-burning stoves and
fireplace inserts generally are more efficient.

 &HT;    Brandon gets by with a little help from his friends
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Brandon Taylor's down to morphine and a
miracle. Doctors say his future is almost all used up. Bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors have sent the 19-year-old home to a small white
house in Riviera Beach, Fla. No cutting-edge cure, no long-shot
surgery is scheduled. But convincing Brandon, his mom, Linda, and a
couple of guys with the Miami Fusion soccer team that there's no
hope is another matter altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon has a T-shirt: ``Pain is nothing compared to what it
feels like to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know.
</P>
<P>
   When Brandon was 9, he was in a flag-football league. His leg
hurt beyond a twist or bruise. The mysterious, foolproof, psychic
link between a mother's instinct and her child's body went on high
alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the type of kid,'' says Linda, ``who can be gushing blood
and won't say anything because it would mean he couldn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   When West Palm Beach doctors saw the X-ray, they sent him to
Shands Hospital in Gainesville, where kids with cancer are the
specialty. That was in 1989. Doctors gave him chemotherapy and
partially amputated his right leg. By 1992, moving amazingly well
with a prosthesis, Brandon was given a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   The next four years allowed the family to climb back from the
bills that cancer causes and insurance doesn't cover. After three
years, dad, Ambrose, and his lawn maintenance business was
bolstered by the return of his No. 1 and only employee, Brandon.
Linda resumed her in-home health-care job. Ginger, Brandon's dog, a
chow, was back to regular walks. And with Brandon at Forest Hill
High School, his sisters, Canetta and Amber, had big brother at the
ready to help with their math.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headaches of high school,'' says Brandon, smiling, not
meaning a word of it. Physics and history came easy. He joined
student government. Helped coach the girls soccer team. Looked
snazzy on Prom Night.
</P>
<P>
   And then it all dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Four years of routine cancer checkups had shown no problems, but
in 1997, a tumor was found in his thigh and another on his back.
Brandon was sent back to the cancer ward, back to the pastel halls
where doctors plot protocols against a dark disease no one fully
understands.
</P>
<P>
   Chemo followed to stop and shrink the tumors, with Linda always
remembering what Brandon's first cancer doctor had told them: ``
`If you get it again, you die.' He must have said it 10 times. I
had to tell him, `Stop, we get the picture.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, told that the cancer had spread, Linda sat at Brandon's
hospital bed crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't worry, Mom, I'll be fine.' I believed him. He
told me a joke. We started laughing and the nurses came rushing in
thinking something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's second three-year cancer fight has frozen family
projects, such as the family room addition Ambrose started but has
no time or cash to finish. It has forced Linda to stop working and
Ambrose to work harder with no help. Cancer costs have turned the
mundane money matter of a car payment into a monthly major
obstacle. The debt the family crawled away from after Brandon's
first cancer go-round is back and worse than ever. Linda and
Ambrose do the best they can when they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda is doing an exceptional job,'' said Teri Moran, director
of the Connor Moran Children's Cancer Foundation in West Palm
Beach. ``I've never ever heard her complain, and she's had some
really shoddy medical treatment and never once spoken out or been
bitter that the cancer came back. She's just spinning so many
plates in the air right now and doing an incredible job.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber, 11, and Canetta, 10, help before they're asked. On the
rare good day, Brandon can leave the metal hospital bed in his
small bedroom, load into a wheelchair and sit outside in fresh air.
The pain is always there. He'd be totally out of it if he took
enough morphine and other painkillers to feel anything approaching
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Music helps. Eagle Eye Cherry, Jon B., Bob Marley and Natalie
Imbruglia. He's on the Internet, helped by his mother, who's taking
night classes to learn to build Web sites. On TV, he won't miss
Friends, can't wait for the recent Star Wars: Episode I to hit
videocassette. Father and son watch TV together. Anything about the
Civil War. Any John Wayne movie. They channel surf. They like The
Three Stooges, -- guy thing that drives Linda and the girls nuts.
</P>
<P>
   And there are phone calls. ``Bye, baby,'' Brandon purrs to end a
recent call. And Ambrose is all over him. ``Bye, baby,'' he
repeats, laughing so hard that Brandon wants to be cool and ignore
him, but starts laughing, too.
</P>
<P>
   And there are visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Hudson, the Miami Fusion's community relations director,
heard about Brandon and loaded goalkeeper Jeff Cassar into the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought you some Fusion stuff, Brandon. Can you stand it?''
Ray said, handing over an autographed soccer ball and jersey.
Animated, effortless, they talked soccer. A reporter showed up with
her cameraman. Ray and Jeff invited Brandon to Major League Soccer
spring training in late January to hang around with the Fusion.
Brandon said sure.
</P>
<P>
   That night, after the report aired, Linda answered the door. She
was surprised to see one of Brandon's doctors, who had seen the
story on t.v.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon's in denial,'' the doctor told Linda, ``that's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda was no less shocked when she recounted the story a few
days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I'm not dealing in reality. I hear what they're
saying, but there's always hope. You have to keep going. What
should I do? Set aside 10 percent of every day to talk about dying?
Brandon knows the situation and I know the situation, but we can't
afford to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a purpose to this. God's molding us for something.
That's become a family motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denial,'' she concludes. ``That's not denial. That's hope.
There's always hope.''

 &HT;    PREP ATHLETES _ Concussions: A heads-up
 &HT;    By Steve Dorsey and Julius Whigham II
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The sensations were familiar to Bubba
Wilson. Light-headed and dizzy, the Benjamin School linebacker
staggered to his coach after a jarring collision during practice
and passed out.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had sustained his fourth concussion as a high school
player, but this time a blood vessel had burst in his brain and
Wilson almost died that day during a three-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   That was during Wilson's junior year in May 1995. He never
played football again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say I'm a walking miracle,'' said Wilson, now
a junior majoring in sports management at Florida State University
and an undergraduate assistant for coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's experience is an extreme example of the dangers of
concussions, but today head injuries on the high school level are
being carefully studied. A recent series of articles on brain
injuries in the Journal of the American Medical Association
suggests that teenagers who sustain two or more significant
concussions might have impaired thinking years later. Sixty-three
percent of the concussions in the JAMA report were among football
players.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Guskiewicz, director of the Sports Medicine Research Lab
at the University of North Carolina, said he is ``not ready to
conclude that a couple of concussions are going to lead to chronic
mental disorders.'' But Guskiewicz, who recently completed a
three-year study of head injuries among high school and college
football players, said more caution needs to be exercised when
dealing with blows to the head. Guskiewicz's study included almost
10,000 high school players and concluded that about 6 percent of
those who sustained head injuries had suffered concussions. Fifteen
percent of those who sustained a concussion had a second concussion
that same season.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``having your bell rung'' has long been used in
football to describe hits that didn't necessarily knock out a
player, but left him dazed and often unable to recall events from
that day. Bubba Wilson's father, Scott, remembers when a concussion
``was a battle scar, something to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely learned my lesson,'' said Scott Wilson, now coach
at Bradford County High in Starke. ``(Bubba's fourth concussion)
almost cost him his life, and almost cost me my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Powers, the team physician for St. Lucie County
schools, has another name for ``getting your bell rung.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a concussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers also said one of the most difficult aspects of treating
concussions is damage from mild blows often goes unrecognized. In
many cases, Powers said, players continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a coach doesn't even know a kid has (a
concussion),'' said Frank DeLucia, the Cardinal Newman High School
football team doctor for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   DeLucia said a player who suffers a Grade 1 concussion, in which
there is no loss of consciousness and no amnesia, likely would be
allowed to return to competition if he shows no signs of prolonged
confusion. If there are more severe aftereffects, DeLucia said,
``we might ask them to sit out the rest of the season or have more
extensive tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Radspinner, a veteran certified athletic trainer for Gold
Coast Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach,
oversees trainers at six local high schools. According to her
records, 17 athletes _ all football players _ sustained a mild
concussion the first two months of this season. She said all were
cleared to play again within a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, injuries no longer
are left in the hands of coaches. ``It used to be you had to fend
for yourself and dial 911,'' Palm Beach Gardens Athletic Director
Jay Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   Now certified trainers are on campus during athletic events, a
practice UNC's Guskiewicz lauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most high school players are going to tell a coach they're
fine,'' he said. ``An athletic trainer might know differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Radspinner said the first thing trainers do when an athlete has
taken a blow to the head is ask a series of simple questions _
their name, what day it is, where they are, their address. If an
athlete experiences headaches, dizziness, nausea or confusion,
Radspinner said he has some sort of brain trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to the parents and tell them to keep an eye on them,''
Radspinner said. ``If they do something like get in the shower with
their clothes on, then you need to take them to see a doctor or to
the emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   Area coaches and athletic directors agree that in recent years
more attention has been paid to detecting and treating concussions.
In football, they credit improved helmets, the mandatory use of
mouthpieces and stricter tackling techniques for minimizing head
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take great pains daily telling our players that we want
contact to be made with shoulders and not with the head,'' Atlantic
coach Verryl Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools have helmets inspected and refurbished during the
off-season. Newman coach Sam Budnyk said he replaces nearly 10-15
helmets each year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's always the danger of ``getting your bell rung'' _
and not just in football.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Heers, the boys soccer coach at Summit Christian in West
Palm Beach, said one of his players, John Leite, sustained a mild
concussion this season when he was hit in the back of the head by a
hard-kicked ball from short range during practice. Heers said it's
``the first documented concussion we've had in my nine years of
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Leite experienced some dizziness and nausea that night
but was cleared to return three days later and scored a hat trick
(three goals) in each of his next two games.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies also raised concerns about the practice of
heading soccer balls, especially in youth leagues. The American
Academy of Pediatrics' sports medicine committee has cautioned
coaches and parents about heading drills during practice in which
players repeatedly bounce balls off their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The JAMA report on concussions tracked how often they occurred
in football, wrestling, soccer, basketball, softball, baseball,
field hockey and volleyball at 235 high schools nationwide from
1995-96 through 1997-98. There were 1,219 concussions and 99
students suffered two or more. The JAMA also said nearly 63,000
high school athletes a year suffer mild concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major public health issue that has been given the
short shrift,'' Michael W. Collins, a neuropsychologist at Henry
Ford Health System in Detroit who was involved in the JAMA studies,
told The Associated Press. ``And this is information parents should
know.'' The Florida High School Activities Association does not
keep records of head injuries, but Deputy Commissioner Ron Allen
said they're considering a process to keep track of them.
</P>
<P>
   John Carroll had two football players _ defensive linemen Justin
Tedder and Justin Harnage _ who sustained concussions this season
against Cardinal Newman. Harnage was injured in the first half,
finished the game, but afterward had trouble with his memory. He
was examined that night at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Tedder was hit in the head while making a block in the third
quarter. He was taken by ambulance to St. Mary's Hospital, where he
had a CAT scan and stayed until 3 a.m. Tedder said he experienced
dizziness during the week before the game after tackling a
teammate, but didn't tell anyone. Tedder and Harnage finished the
season, though the injury has Tedder thinking about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have told me if it happens again it can be more
severe,'' he said. ``I'm willing to take the chance and I just pray
every night that it doesn't happen again. If it does happen again,
that's it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Wilson would understand that decision. After his third
concussion, he listened to his doctor and sat out the remainder of
the season. He hardly could wait until spring practice a few months
later. Then came the near-fatal injury, and the end of his playing
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made my peace with it,'' Wilson said. ``It's not worth
what I put my family through.''

 &HT;    New vision device could revolutionize surgery
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ Martin Satter already has given some thought
about how he'll ask patients needing brain surgery if they would
mind letting the surgeon wear something that looks like
virtual-reality goggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll say, `Would you rather have your neurosurgeon _ while
he's working on the most vital part of you _ looking around at
monitors kind of like he's watching a tennis match, or would you
rather have him wear this sort of helmet that will enable him to
focus exclusively on the job at hand?''' says Satter, a Ph.D.
physicist with Kettering Medical Center's Wallace-Kettering
Neuroscience Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering soon will be the only medical center in the country to
test and help develop a device that shines an image directly onto a
surgeon's retina. Microvision, the suburban Seattle manufacturer of
similar goggles for military pilots, calls it a ``wearable display
system.'' Using it, a surgeon can see essential CAT, MRI or PET
scan images and vital-sign monitors in a corner of his vision
without taking his eyes off of the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to have your neck craned to the side,'' says
Dr. Ted Bernstein, a Kettering neurosurgeon. Besides creating the
advantages that come with a more comfortable surgeon, retinal
display has better resolution than HDTV and is never limited by a
small screen size.
</P>
<P>
   The improved resolution helps a surgeon distinguish which shade
of gray is the spinal disc to be removed and which is, say, the
patient's nerve root, Bernstein says. The wider visual field and
the ability to overlay images on top of each other give him access
to more information about what he's doing. As Satter says, ``Any
information the surgeons want is information that you want them to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The goggles aren't quite ready for patients yet, and surgeons
will use them in spine surgery before graduating to brain surgery.
But the dramatic possibilities already hint at what might be
realized by Kettering's still-early cooperative agreement with
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to transfer technology between the
military and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are beginning to see things with their eyes that were
previously visible only to sophisticated image scanners that make
the basic X-ray look as archaic as a Brownie box camera.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons often must work without a direct sight line to their
targets, which are obscured by bone, skin or other tissue. So they
look at television or computer monitors that show the target area
through a tiny camera, as in arthroscopic knee surgery, or an image
of the area as captured by MRI or CAT scanning. They often need to
see those images from more than one angle.
</P>
<P>
   In neurosurgery and cancer surgery, the anatomical images of MRI
or CAT scans might not show an especially small tumor, so the
surgeon also needs a functional PET scan image. PET scans can
pinpoint tumors by showing which tissue is unusually hungry for
glucose. The retinal display can put all those images at the
borders of the surgeon's field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   With the right software, Satter says, a computer will also be
able to factor in the surgeon's viewing angle and put the PET scan
directly over the brain it represents. The surgeon will see both at
once, the PET image literally pointing to the hidden tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're not doing that yet,'' he says, ``but this is the
stuff we're working on here in the next year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Satter compares the difference in views to someone driving and
looking at a map. While the driver now must look back and forth
from his lap to the road, he says the same technology will one day
allow him to put on goggles and read a map with the road in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Other wearable visual displays are available and cheaper, he
says, ``but this potentially could be the best.'' Besides its
unmatched resolution and ``screen size,'' the Microvision goggles
can add and subtract several images, none of which block the
surgeon's view of his hands and the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neurosurgeon doesn't want to be flipping on and off glasses
during surgery,'' Satter says.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's neuroscience center has concentrated on bringing
more visual information to surgeons since it opened in 1994. About
a year and a half ago, Satter ran across Microvision's Web site and
thought its display unit for pilots might give doctors better
access to all that new information. He says Microvision has spent
about $1 million since then to develop a prototype for the more
demanding specifications of neurosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial period, Microvision and Kettering will refine
the device to make it practical. For example, Bernstein says,
``It's bulky. I wouldn't feel comfortable doing a long procedure
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the goggles shine red, green and blue lasers
on the retina in the manner of an old front-projection big-screen
TV, but until now no one has been compelled to condense blue lasers
into little solid-state boxes. Satter expects the device to shrink
to a quarter of its present size, from that of a virtual-reality
game player's helmet to maybe a carpenter's safety goggles.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to shine on a surgeon's eyes. Standards already have
been set for laser eye surgery, and Satter says the maximum power
this system can put out is only one-tenth of anything that might
damage the retina.
</P>
<P>
   The view is also easy to get used to, Bernstein says. ``Just
like watching television. If you made the images so strong that you
had to take them on and off, that would be a problem. But if you
fade it so you can actually see through the image, it doesn't
bother you at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As the goggles improve, Bernstein envisions better surgical
techniques using a microscope, for example, because the entire
staff will be able to see through the scope. Satter expects the
technology will migrate to all kinds of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine in the future, the average cardiac bypass will
be able to be done through a 1-inch incision rather than a 12-inch
incision,'' Satter says. ``You'll be able to do it all through
optical telescopes. Everything that's going on inside will be
projected onto the cardiac surgeon's retina.''

 &HT;    Beginning astronomers will need five things before looking up
 &HT;    By Michael Alicea
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Want to be a backyard astronomer? Here
are five things you'll need to get started:
</P>
<P>
   1. A good book on astronomy. ``Astronomy for All Ages,'' by
Phillip Harrington and Edward Pascuzzi (The Globe Pequot Press,
$20), is a great book for both young and old stargazers. It is full
of information on everything from Alpha Centauri to Zubeneshamali
and beyond. It also has easy-to-read star charts and lessons on how
to use them. You can even learn how to build your own refractor
telescope! And despite some complex terminology, it is still very
easy to follow, even to those who cannot tell a star from Flight
110 to Newark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practical Astronomer _ From Naked Eye Observation to Using
a Telescope: Every Enthusiasts Guide to the Skies Above Us'' by
Brian Jones (Simon and Schuster, $15) is also a great book for
beginners. It includes comprehensive maps and guides to the night
skies, and detailed yet simple explanations of almost every
heavenly occurrence during the year.
</P>
<P>
   2. A comfy lawn or beach chair. One night of stiff-necked
staring at the sky from a standing position is sure to send you to
the store for one of these. When you get there, remember to test
chairs for stargazing before you buy. Will it lean back? Pull flat?
Fold up and fit in your car?
</P>
<P>
   3. An astronomy magazine. Astronomy Magazine is the most popular
choice. It can get technical, but it has an easy monthly star map
to follow and a list of astronomical events _ like planetary
occultations and such _ which are charted on the maps. In addition
to the news and listings, Astronomy is a beautiful magazine to look
at, with pictorials from both professionals and amateurs on
everything from eclipses to galaxies far far away.
</P>
<P>
   Sky &AMP; Telescope is another good choice. Like Astronomy, this
magazine has all the latest news on the heavens you could want, as
well as monthly events. It also has well-written features on the
latest events, discoveries, and theories.
</P>
<P>
   4. Binoculars. Binoculars are a good beginner's tool, and there
are several kinds available, ranging from $50 to $300. Try them out
in the store before purchasing any. Make sure that they are
comfortable to hold, simple to operate and easily adjusted.
However, Bushnell has come out with a line of Xtra-Wide(at)
binoculars, and these will wow you the first time you look through
them. Unlike regular binoculars, these give you a wide field of
view that blends into one image with virtually no border to
distract you. They are available in 4X, 7X or 10X. They are perfect
to peer at everything from a partial eclipse to a night shuttle
launch. Suggested retail value for these binoculars ranges from
$150 to $220.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to go deeper into the solar system and beyond, you
will need a telescope instead. For viewing the transit of Jupiter's
moons or exploring the craters of the moon, a small telescope beats
binoculars any day. A good quality telescope can be found at the
mall or at a camera shop. Three reputable companies that make
high-quality optics are Bushnell, Orion and Meade. But remember,
don't be lured by the promise of high magnification. Magnification
is nothing without a good aperture, the light-gathering opening _
and all this is useless without quality eyepieces.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you want to get into deep-space viewing _ don't get a
telescope with anything smaller than a 6-inch aperture. Do some
comparison shopping on a couple of models before investing in
larger scopes. A good one will run from $400 to a few thousand.
</P>
<P>
   5. Patience. The sky can be a wonder if you just take the time
to let things happen. You can see everything from fireballs to
satellites if you have information first, the right tools _ as
needed _ and the patience to wait and watch for things to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Happy hunting.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ No matter how many amendments the Congress
tries to shove into our Constitution, one banning flag burning will
have no consequence in Athens, or Baghdad, even Belgrade. They're
beyond our Constitutional reach. Where they get all those flags to
burn is of interest to me, as I would like to buy into what must be

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few days ago I was sharing
minimal breathing space with a most pleasant gentleman. From the
confines of our coach-class airline seats, we discussed the weather

Better to fake it though than to bring up what was really on my

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After Harry Potter came
into our lives, I started doing what any decent mother would do
when she and her 8-year-old son are sharing the same novel from The
New York Times bestseller list. Night after pathetic night, I sit
calmly and patiently outside the child's bedroom door yelling: ``It
is very late. Put that book down NOW. Go to sleep. You are getting
sleepy. Very sleepy.'' Then, the second my shouting soothes the boy
to sleep, I scurry in there and steal ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' (Minor, Palm Beach Post) Parents in small
school districts in South Carolina and Georgia launched rather weak
protests, trying to get the books banned in schools. No action on
that yet. A conservative group in Virginia started an anti-Harry
Web site. The argument? Harry promotes wickedness and dark and
evil. He represents ``the dark side of religion,'' said one group.
But I figure the truth is this: Those people represent the dark
side of parents. MOVED.

 &HT;    Seven Sisters Inn No. 1 in splendor
 &HT;    By Louis Hillary Park
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. _ The Seven Sisters Inn is what you wish your
grandmother's house had been, and so much more.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1888, it was purchased by husband-and-wife innkeepers
Ken Oden and Bonnie Moorehardt in 1989 and has since been restored
to something better than its 19th-century elegance. Most of the
eight guest rooms have a telephone and a TV and all have private
baths. Many have Victorian soaking tubs or Jacuzzis.
</P>
<P>
   When you dry off and are ready to snuggle under the powdered,
hand-pressed sheets, you'll be sliding into a queen- or king-sized
bed framed by a canopy or buttressed by wrought iron. Prop on the
comfy pillows and enjoy a book from one of the inn's shelves or
just soak in the ambience of another era in the shifting light of a
gas fireplace. But don't worry, there is plenty of air conditioning
to combat the Florida summers; many rooms also have ceiling fans.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked among the top 12 inns in America by ``Country Inns Bed &AMP;
Breakfasts'' magazine, each room at the Seven Sisters is different,
though all feature period furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   I settled into one of the less expensive rooms, just down the
hall from the kitchen. Named for the owner, Bonnie, the room was
large enough to feel spacious but small enough to feel secure and
snug and very cozy. The queen-sized, wrought-iron bed was
complemented by window trim of Battenburg lace. A teal border of
ribbons and bows topped pink stipple-painted walls, giving the room
a French flavor.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of room still for side tables, two low, deeply
padded chairs, a writing desk and chair, and an armoire that held
the television.
</P>
<P>
   The bathroom has two pedestal sinks and book-patterned wallpaper
up to the high ceiling. There's no tub in Bonnie's Room, but a
stack of thick, soft towels invites you to enjoy a wonderfully
powerful shower with no shortage of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Awakening is as much a treat as going to bed at Seven Sisters
Inn, because breakfasts are worthy of anticipation. Fresh juice and
fruit are presented in the sunny dining room, along with smooth,
dark coffee. On the morning of my stay, the centerpiece of the meal
was a large, light biscuit under a delicious pecan white gravy.
</P>
<P>
   While dinner is not regularly served at the inn, arrangements
can be made for a romantic five-course meal prepared by a European
chef. In fact, Ken and Bonnie and their staff pride themselves on
catering to the whims of their guests, especially the romantic
ones. Some of the bedrooms _ such as Ken's Room _ are large enough
to allow in-room dining. A picnic basket filled with goodies can be
delivered to the smaller spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Built among the eaves and sharp angles of what had been the
attic, Lottie's Loft occupies all 1,200 square feet of the third
floor, and is the perfect place for a family stay, with a
king-sized bed and two twins. Recently enclosed for privacy's sake,
the loft breaks away from the antique style of the rest of the inn
to create a South Beach tropics feel. It features glass brick
accents and a whirlpool tub big enough for two set in the middle of
the main room. (There's also a more discreet shower).
</P>
<P>
   Seven Sisters soon will double in size when the Victorian next
door _ built in 1891 and also on the National Register of Historic
Places _ becomes part of the inn. The two-story Rheinaur House is
being updated and augmented for space, but with the same careful
eye that earned the present inn Florida's Best Restoration Award.
It will feature rooms keyed to geographic locations _ Paris,
Argentina, China and more _ and filled with treasures brought from
around the world by Ken and Bonnie, both of whom are active airline
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The Rheinaur House is scheduled to open for guests at Christmas
time.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: The Seven Sisters Inn, 820 S.E. Fort King St., Ocala, FL
34471; (352) 867-1170 or (800) 250-3496.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Take Interstate 75, to Ocala.
</P>
<P>
   RATES: $95 (Sunday through Thursday), $115 (weekends and
holidays) for Norma's room _ the smallest; to Sylvia's Room $165
(weekdays), $185 (weekends, holidays). Rates include full
breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks; a two-night minimum is
required for weekends.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: Try Harry's of Ocala, 24 S.E. First Ave., on the town
square. A nice atmosphere, friendly staff and decent New
Orleans-style fare. Add a little hot sauce from one of the bottles
on the table, and Harry's gumbo is just about right. Or, if you're
out exploring the area, stop for lunch at The Front Porch
restaurant on U.S. 41 just on the south side of the Withlacoochee
River bridge in Dunnellon. Good home-style cooking with a Florida
twist _ try the gator and any of the delicious desserts.
</P>
<P>

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ No matter how many amendments the Congress
tries to shove into our Constitution, one banning flag burning will
have no consequence in Athens, or Baghdad, even Belgrade. They're
beyond our Constitutional reach. Where they get all those flags to
burn is of interest to me, as I would like to buy into what must be
a profitable business of supplying particularly incendiary American
flags to foreigners. (Kleinberg, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When did boisterous bad

</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ A few days ago I was sharing
minimal breathing space with a most pleasant gentleman. From the
confines of our coach-class airline seats, we discussed the weather
and deep sea fishing _ two subjects about which I know nothing.
Better to fake it though than to bring up what was really on my
mind _ how to tell him his hair was on crooked. (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After Harry Potter came
into our lives, I started doing what any decent mother would do
when she and her 8-year-old son are sharing the same novel from The
New York Times bestseller list. Night after pathetic night, I sit
calmly and patiently outside the child's bedroom door yelling: ``It
is very late. Put that book down NOW. Go to sleep. You are getting
sleepy. Very sleepy.'' Then, the second my shouting soothes the boy
to sleep, I scurry in there and steal ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' (Minor, Palm Beach Post) Parents in small
school districts in South Carolina and Georgia launched rather weak
protests, trying to get the books banned in schools. No action on
that yet. A conservative group in Virginia started an anti-Harry
Web site. The argument? Harry promotes wickedness and dark and
evil. He represents ``the dark side of religion,'' said one group.
But I figure the truth is this: Those people represent the dark
side of parents. MOVED.

   KENNEDY-EYEWITNESS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Carol Cromwell
recalls being an eyewitness to President Kennedy's assassination.
She wore her best autumn dress: blue and white. The boys all wore
ties. The brightest students from Miss Patsy Gee's fifth-grade
class in Crowley, Texas (population back then: 1,100), knew they'd
been chosen to take a very special class trip on Friday, Nov. 22,
1963. ``Just going to Dallas, the big city, was so exciting,
because you just didn't go there very often,'' Cromwell recalls.

   What an unenviable task for President Clinton and his policy
planners _ to assess the West's options for responding to Russia's
relentless military campaign in Chechnya. It is as if all the
contradictions and inconsistencies of Western and particularly U.S.
post-Cold War policies have merged into one big international
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the scale of the tragedy unfolding in Northern
Caucasus, the loss of life and destruction, is similar to if not
worse than what happened in Bosnia and, more recently, in Kosovo.
Yet the West's outrage is muted and its morality-driven willingness
to act, so evident in Kosovo, is now absent.
</P>
<P>
   The military option, which the United States and NATO used so
willingly against Yugoslavia, is simply out of the question when
dealing with Russia, a nuclear power. Thus, ``the Clinton doctrine
of humanitarian intervention,'' tentatively proclaimed during the
Kosovo crisis, has been shown to be at best selective _ a policy
that can be modified opportunistically depending on other
priorities and on U.S. military capabilities vis-a-vis the current
transgressor.
</P>
<P>
   Economic or financial penalties do not fare much better.
Although Russia would like to get some money from the International
Monetary Fund _ whose lending decisions take account of political,
military and economic travails _ the West is reluctant even to call
for the IMF to withhold the next tranche of its Russian loan.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the loan is meant to repay previous IMF handouts.
What is more, failure to provide it could upset the entire
structure of delicate debt rescheduling compromises between Russia
and Western public and private financial institutions _ something
the West clearly does not want.
</P>
<P>
   Given the anti-Western sentiment now prevailing in Russian
politics and, increasingly, among the people, economic sanctions
would be counterproductive. With its oil and gas prices to foreign
clients at their highest level in years, Russia could for a while
do without the IMF money, and many Russians would just say good
riddance.
</P>
<P>
   And as for longer-term consequences, people don't think about
them in the heat of recriminations that are, more and more,
beginning to resemble the time of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's offensive in Chechnya was just beginning, there
was talk in the West of using the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, held last week in Istanbul, to
call Russia to account and make it change its behavior. But both
before and during the summit, it became increasingly clear that
little could be achieved there.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin's sharp rebuttal of any attempt to ``interfere in
Russia's internal affairs'' was to be expected. Perhaps Bill
Clinton had hoped that praising the Russian president, for the
umpteenth time, for ``standing on that tank'' and thus thwarting
the hard-line coup in August 1991 would sway him in the right
direction. But this is a situation where a compliment is as
ineffective as a threat would be. To some, it looked awkward; to
others, pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the OSCE is a weak organization and thus not the
best vehicle for meaningful policy initiatives. Even if better
avenues were available for the West's pressure tactics, though, the
result would likely be the same. For Russia can only be influenced
by countries it sees as friendly and that it feels treat it with
respect. And that is where the problem lies.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing how quickly the reservoir of good will and
apparent mutual respect that Russia and the United States shared in
the early '90s disappeared during the past few years. It takes two
to tango, and it takes at least two to break up the dance _ so, of
course, Moscow should take part of the blame for the relationship
turning sour. But try to look at it from Russia's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus there is that for years America was rather
cynically using Russia for its own political purposes. A recent
indiscretion _ remarks by a ``senior administration official''
reported by Jane Perlez in The New York Times _ illustrates just
the sort of attitude Russians dread _ and why that may be more than
just paranoia. As regards NATO expansion and Kosovo, the U.S.
official rather arrogantly staid, ``we knew what the Russians ought
to do and, by the way, they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they ``did it'' _ Russia had to put up both with NATO's
enlargement and the bombing of Yugoslavia, but only a very naive
person could think that such humiliation would leave no scars. For
the Russians, the bottom line is that they ``got no respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians generals and politicians keep pointing out that what
the United States and NATO did in a foreign country, Russia has a
right to do in its own Chechen territory. They invoke the pretext
of fighting international terrorism, reminding the world of U.S.
cruise-missile attacks on Osama bin Laden's ``terrorist camps'' in
Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   There is much self-serving hypocrisy in these arguments but it
cannot be denied that Clinton's administration has been much more
willing than some of its predecessors to use force abroad under
very flimsy pretexts and without much regard for international law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration should therefore not be surprised that it has
lost credibility in Moscow and that many people there and elsewhere
see much of its foreign policy as based on a cynical double
standard. In fact, both Russia, a former superpower, and the United
States, the sole remaining superpower, are arguably guilty of what
that famous Communist icon Karl Marx called ``the greatest of human
vices, hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a good basis on which to build a new world order _ or even a
good bilateral partnership.

   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.

<P>
   TRANSLATING TECHNOLOGY. Since the '60s, the demand for more
sophisticated hardware and efficient software has grown faster than
one can say ``DSL,'' writes Benjamin Sun in this excerpt from A.
magazine. New millionaires emerge every day as new technology
companies are launched, bought and sold. For Asian-Americans, this
new environment provides a win-win situation. Asian-American
engineers, programmers and tech wizards alike have been stepping
out of back rooms and into the spotlight. Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and
Hotmail creator Sabeer Bhatia revolutionized the Internet. Former
Intel vice president Vinod Dham developed the ``pentium'' which
shook technology geeks and Wall Street. Sun is the president and
CEO of CommunityConnect.com, parent company of the interactive
online community, AsianAvenue.com.
</P>
<P>
   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.
</P>
<P>
   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

   HAPPY THANKSGIVING? A NATIVE-AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE
</P>
<P>
   ``Like it or not, American Indians are forever tied to the
Thanksgiving holiday,'' writes Native-American Karen Lincoln
Michel. ``Occasionally, around this time of year, some non-Indian
will smile at me and say something like: `There would be no
Thanksgiving if it wasn't for your people.' That's right. If tribes
hadn't shown white folks the ropes, we'd probably give thanks each
day that we still had our land.''

   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.

   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.

   TRANSLATING TECHNOLOGY. Since the '60s, the demand for more
sophisticated hardware and efficient software has grown faster than
one can say ``DSL,'' writes Benjamin Sun in this excerpt from A.
magazine. New millionaires emerge every day as new technology
companies are launched, bought and sold. For Asian-Americans, this
new environment provides a win-win situation. Asian-American
engineers, programmers and tech wizards alike have been stepping
out of back rooms and into the spotlight. Yahoo!'s Jerry Yang and
Hotmail creator Sabeer Bhatia revolutionized the Internet. Former
Intel vice president Vinod Dham developed the ``pentium'' which
shook technology geeks and Wall Street. Sun is the president and
CEO of CommunityConnect.com, parent company of the interactive
online community, AsianAvenue.com.

   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.

   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

   ``Like it or not, American Indians are forever tied to the
Thanksgiving holiday,'' writes Native-American Karen Lincoln
Michel. ``Occasionally, around this time of year, some non-Indian
will smile at me and say something like: `There would be no
Thanksgiving if it wasn't for your people.' That's right. If tribes
hadn't shown white folks the ropes, we'd probably give thanks each
day that we still had our land.''

   CRITICS OF JACKSON AT DECATUR IGNORE ONE CENTRAL POINT.
Eisenhower High School in Decatur, Ill., was recently catapulted
into national focus when it expelled seven black male students for
two years because of their involvement in a brawl during a
nighttime football game at the school. The Rev. Jackson deemed the
punishment too harsh and went to Decatur to seek reconsideration _
a much lighter sentence for the youths based upon the absence of
weapons, bloodshed and injury. In this commentary, columnist Vernon
Jarrett supports Jackson's appearance and ponders what might have
happened to these teens had Jackson not gotten involved. ``If
Jackson had not journeyed to Decatur, seven youths, who were never
tried with respect for due process, would have been cut from the
educational process _ maybe permanently,'' he writes.

<P>
   A DISGRACEFUL USE OF AN APACHE LEADER. Geronimo, the great
Chiricahua Apache warrior and leader, would spin in his grave if he
knew the U.S. Census Bureau was using his portrait in an
advertising campaign aimed at American Indians, writes columnist
Tim Giago. U.S. Census 2000 hopes to make up for the shortcomings
of the 1990 Census that missed so many people, particularly
minorities. American Indians were among the minority groups that
were miscounted. In this commentary, Giago recounts the life of
Goyathlay (One Who Yawns) _ known to the white man as Geronimo _
who was taken from his homeland in chains because he stood up as a
patriot to defend his people and who died in exile far from his
beloved mountains of Arizona.

   PRO-GAY CATHOLICS &AMP; ALLIES CALL FOR JUSTICE AT HOME. When the
U.S. Catholic bishops meet this week in Washington, D.C., one topic
that probably won't be on their agenda is the outrage over the
Vatican's barring an American nun and priest from continuing their
nearly three-decade-long ministry to gay Catholics. Many outraged
Catholics do not intend to let the controversy be swept aside. A
six-page public statement _ with more than 4,000 signatures,
printed this week as a signature ad in the National Catholic
Reporter _ calls on the bishops to appeal the Vatican's decision
and reinstate the gay-affirming clergy. Columnist Chuck Colbert
comments on this historic event.

   THE TEXAS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TAKES A LEAP FORWARD. From virulent
anti-immigrants to a pioneering New York Hispanic politician,
Herman Badillo, people are pointing fingers at Mexican
schoolchildren for their failure in the American educational
system. From California to New York, Atlanta to Chicago, educators
weep how ``Hispanic'' children aren't supported by their parents,
don't do their homework, have problems with English and drop out of
school too early. So why are they excelling in Texas? Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras comments on how Texas has reformed its
educational system and how students of Mexican origin are
benefiting from that progress. (Slugged:

   ``Like it or not, American Indians are forever tied to the

Michel. ``Occasionally, around this time of year, some non-Indian
will smile at me and say something like: `There would be no
Thanksgiving if it wasn't for your people.' That's right. If tribes
hadn't shown white folks the ropes, we'd probably give thanks each
day that we still had our land.''

 &HT;    EXHIBIT CELEBRATES CONTRIBUTIONS TO ART BY BLACK COLLEGES
 &HT;    For Friday, Nov. 26

   WASHINGTON -- In an image bordered in gold leaf, a butler deftly
fills glasses as he holds a tray with one hand, a twinkle in his
eyes and a half-crooked smile on his face. A rare portrait of a
black man born into freedom, less than five years ago the painting
was packed away in a storage room.
</P>
<P>
   Layers of dirt obscured the artist's signature. The title was
unknown. No one realized then that it was a long-missing
masterpiece from a prominent 19th century artist.
</P>
<P>
   Painter Thomas Waterman Wood's portrait of Charles Wilson
Freeman Jr., now sits among more than 150 works of art in ``To
Conserve a Legacy,'' a national touring exhibit that celebrates the
contributions black colleges have made to the American art
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is part of a multi-faceted project to conserve,
document and showcase works owned by Clark Atlanta University, Fisk
University, Hampton University, Howard University, North Carolina
Central University and Tuskegee University. It is currently on view
at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was co-organized by the Addison Gallery of
American Art in Massachusetts and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
Sponsors of the exhibition and national tour are AT&AMP;T and Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes paintings, prints, drawings, photographs
and sculpture from such artists as Romare Bearden, Roy DeCarava,
Lois Mailou Jones, Jacob Lawrence and Georgia O'Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   Black colleges not only assembled significant art collections
but served as the primary training grounds for African-American
artists, art historians, professors and museum curators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true heroes are Clark Atlanta University, Howard
University and others who maintained these collections long before
a project like this came to the public eye,'' said co-curator Jock
Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wood's butler, each work bears its own story of restoration
for the exhibit. Mostly victims of old age, some works presented
challenges for conservationists. The curators weren't even sure
that some works could be conserved.
</P>
<P>
   Some pictures were so caked with paint that their frames could
barely hold them. A few sculptures were cracked right down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-year process of restoring them, however,
conservationists never doubted the intrinsic value of each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cooper, an intern from Howard, said her group recognized
during the project that ``we were walking on hallowed ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The images show various aspects of black history, culture and
progress. Charles White's mural ``Progress of the American Negro''
includes such icons as Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington,
Frederick Douglass, Marian Anderson, and George Washington Carver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mural shows the contributions each individual gave to
American history, but they are still indisputably a part of
African-American history,'' said Dr. Tritobia Hayes Benjamin,
curator of the Howard University Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works reveal little-known facts about various
figures in black history. A portrait of scientist Carver standing
in front of an easel reveals his artistic gifts. Other works
provide a sense of rural life, schools and churches. Benjamin said
the numerous portraits of individuals speak to the importance of
the individual in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable work is ``Mr. and Mrs. Barton'' by John
Reynolds, a painting of the artist's in-laws, said co-curator Dr.
Richard Powell, a graduate of two historically black schools,
Howard and Morehouse College. The portrait captures the texture of
hardwood floors with ``photograph-like accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that people see the importance of
conserving your legacy,'' said Powell, chair of the Department of
Art and Art History at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   ``These works of art have aesthetic value, cultural value and
historic value. The first step is recognizing the value. If we
don't recognize it, no one will, or when someone else does we'll be
left out in the cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tour schedule for ``To Conserve a Legacy'' is:
</P>
<P>
   Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. - April 2000
</P>
<P>
   Clark Atlanta University with the High Museum, June - Sept. 2000
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Central University Art Museum with Duke
University Museum of Art and the Center for Documentary Studies,
Durham, Oct. - Dec. 2000

<P>
   Fisk University with Tennessee State Museum, Nashville, Jan. -
March 2001
</P>

University, Hampton University, Howard University, North Carolina
Central University and Tuskegee University. It is currently on view
at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was co-organized by the Addison Gallery of
American Art in Massachusetts and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
Sponsors of the exhibition and national tour are AT&AMP;T and Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes paintings, prints, drawings, photographs
and sculpture from such artists as Romare Bearden, Roy DeCarava,
Lois Mailou Jones, Jacob Lawrence and Georgia O'Keefe.
</P>
<P>
   Black colleges not only assembled significant art collections
but served as the primary training grounds for African-American
artists, art historians, professors and museum curators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true heroes are Clark Atlanta University, Howard
University and others who maintained these collections long before
a project like this came to the public eye,'' said co-curator Jock
Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wood's butler, each work bears its own story of restoration
for the exhibit. Mostly victims of old age, some works presented
challenges for conservationists. The curators weren't even sure
that some works could be conserved.
</P>
<P>
   Some pictures were so caked with paint that their frames could
barely hold them. A few sculptures were cracked right down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-year process of restoring them, however,
conservationists never doubted the intrinsic value of each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cooper, an intern from Howard, said her group recognized
during the project that ``we were walking on hallowed ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The images show various aspects of black history, culture and
progress. Charles White's mural ``Progress of the American Negro''
includes such icons as Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington,
Frederick Douglass, Marian Anderson, and George Washington Carver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mural shows the contributions each individual gave to
American history, but they are still indisputably a part of
African-American history,'' said Dr. Tritobia Hayes Benjamin,
curator of the Howard University Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the works reveal little-known facts about various
figures in black history. A portrait of scientist Carver standing
in front of an easel reveals his artistic gifts. Other works
provide a sense of rural life, schools and churches. Benjamin said
the numerous portraits of individuals speak to the importance of
the individual in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable work is ``Mr. and Mrs. Barton'' by John
Reynolds, a painting of the artist's in-laws, said co-curator Dr.
Richard Powell, a graduate of two historically black schools,
Howard and Morehouse College. The portrait captures the texture of
hardwood floors with ``photograph-like accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that people see the importance of
conserving your legacy,'' said Powell, chair of the Department of
Art and Art History at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   ``These works of art have aesthetic value, cultural value and
historic value. The first step is recognizing the value. If we
don't recognize it, no one will, or when someone else does we'll be
left out in the cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tour schedule for ``To Conserve a Legacy'' is:
</P>
<P>
   Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. - April 2000
</P>
<P>
   Clark Atlanta University with the High Museum, June - Sept. 2000

   ALBANY, N.Y _ With a chance to wrest control of the State Senate
from the Republicans in a high-turnout presidential year beginning
in only weeks, New York's
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party faces great opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, those opportunities are disguised as horrendous
problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's Al Gore. Still his party's front-runner for the
presidential nomination, Gore
</P>
<P>
   strikes many voters as six feet of solid veneer. Polls reveal
that voters view him as phony and artificial. Whatever public
suspicions might exist concerning John McCain's emotional stability
and George W. Bush's basic brain power, it doesn't seem at this
point that Gore could beat either of them.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans
5-to-3, but Ronald Reagan won it because Jimmy Carter had
credibility problems with New Yorkers. Meanwhile,
</P>
<P>
   the central rationale for Bill Bradley's candidacy seems to be
the unique sensitivity to racial issues that he gleaned from
exchanging elbows with tall black guys.
</P>
<P>
   For New York Democrats, none of this is the stuff of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, though, is the tentative, semi-candidacy of
Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate. For months now, the
Republicans have been trying to scare her off by contending that
many New Yorkers intensely despise her and her husband. Nowhere was
this tactic illustrated more vividly than in an unscientific,
on-line readers poll conducted recently by the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Readers were asked to vote for the 25 most evil people of the
last 1,000 years. A total of 19,184 readers responded that Adolf
Hitler was the vilest person of the millennium. Bill Clinton came
in second. Hillary Clinton came in sixth _ ahead of Saddam Hussein,
Charles Manson, Genghis Khan, Ted Bundy, Ivan the Terrible and Vlad
the Impaler.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president and First Lady were write-ins.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so one can reasonably presume that the Republicans stuffed
the ballot box on that
</P>
<P>
   one. But most independent polls show her losing to New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the likely Republican nominee. Also, the
Post came back with a John Zogby poll in which 53 percent of New
Yorkers said they don't want her to run. Tellingly, they were not
asked that question of Giuliani, a guy with a rare capacity of his
own to inspire loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all this _ combined with some private Democratic Party
internal polling that shows Mrs. Clinton with really scary negative
ratings among New York voters _ has prompted State Democratic chief
Judith Hope to publicly advise Mrs. Clinton to get into the race
formally or get out of it. And Ronnie Eldridge, a member of the New
York City Council with a strong base on Manhattan's leftish upper
west side, now says that the First Lady shouldn't run here.
</P>
<P>
   So, now what? Clearly, if Mrs. Clinton wants to be the
Democratic Party's Senate candidate in New York next year, the
nomination is hers. If she decides not to run, though, Hope will be
reduced to begging Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Andrew Cuomo to
</P>
<P>
   square off against Giuliani on depressingly short notice.
</P>
<P>
   What nobody is saying aloud is that Mrs. Clinton's biggest
problem isn't her husband
</P>
<P>
   or her carpetbag. It's her gender. Women have won statewide in
Texas, California, New Jersey and elsewhere. Historically, though,
New York women lose statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Liz Holtzman. Ask Geraldine Ferraro. Ask Catherine Abate.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that Hillary Clinton can't beat Giuliani in
2000. It does mean, though, that she can't play coy for much
longer. If she drags her feet on this, she could wind up too far
behind to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope is right, Mrs. Clinton. If you want in, then get in
and start campaigning. Otherwise, take a hike.

 BETTER WAY FOR WOMEN TO HIT THE JACKPOT-HNS   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the joke has it, the wife comes home and says
to her husband, ``Pack your bags, I won the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful,'' the husband says. ``Should I pack for the
mountains or the seashore?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' the wife says. ``Just get the hell out.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke was recently on a Los Angeles woman who won $1.3
million in the lottery in 1996. She immediately filed for divorce,
but never mentioned winning the lottery. If it weren't for a stray
letter, her husband never would have found out.
</P>
<P>
   A judge decided the woman had violated California's
asset-disclosure laws and awarded all the lottery winnings to the
husband. Give the woman credit for trying, though. She came close
to achieving the new American dream, winning the lottery and losing
a boring spouse at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Half the winnings, paid out in installments over 20 years,
wouldn't have been enough. Thirty-three grand a year won't support
a Miata and a condo, but 66 grand will get you all that, and maybe
a handsome personal trainer, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you be tempted to keep it all, if your marriage was
bad?'' said Heidi Evans, the author of a new book ``How to Hide
Money from Your Husband ... and Other Time-Honored Ways to Build a
Nest Egg'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999, $20).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I had to admit it. I might be tempted. But make that a
Harley and a beautiful personal trainer, and please forward all
mail to my post office box in the Caymans.
</P>
<P>
   This may all sound very amoral, and Evans doesn't condone the
hiding of the lottery money. But what we're talking about here is
divorce. Divorce is war and a sour marriage is cold war. Money is
both the weapon and the object of war.
</P>
<P>
   According to Evans and a lot of women she cites in ``How to Hide
Money from Your Husband,'' men can be very devious and
self-righteous about hiding money from their wives, preventing
their wives from working, or stripping the joint account before
running off to Mexico with the trophy blonde, so women have to be
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Evans quotes a woman banker as saying that many men
have secret accounts with statements mailed directly to their
offices. ``And if there is the smell of divorce in the air, watch
out,'' the banker says. ``The first one who gets to the bank is the
one to empty the joint accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How to Hide Money from Your Husband,'' then, is not a guide to
larceny, but a self-help book to try to get women, who on average
make less money and have fewer job skills, to build their own
divorce insurance. As Evans points out, people buy life insurance,
but divorce is more likely to strike a middle-aged couple than
death.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of useful hints. Get to know your spouse's
``money personality,'' before marriage, if possible. Watch out for
previously married guys, those veterans of financial wars. Make
copies of tax returns and other documents that could be used in
divorce proceedings. Keep records. Open your own accounts. Get
stocks in your own name. And, of course, take money and hide it.
Evans recounts the stories of women who systematically hid their
tips, took cash from their husbands' pockets or housekeeping money,
and even got jobs under assumed names, and then accumulated
thousands of dollars in drawers, socks, boxes and, in one case, a
freezer where the non-cooking husband would never look.
</P>
<P>
   The book evolved from a Wall Street Journal story she once did
on this phenomenon involving women of all income and cultures. ``I
never realized what a sisterhood there was,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   Once she was on a stuck subway train and asked the woman next to
her if she hid money from her husband. ``Honey, doesn't
everybody?'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Women hide money from men for all kinds of motives besides
self-defense and wanting that ticket out. They keep money out of
free-spending men's hands to build ``a nest egg'' for the kids'
education or a new home. Evans even suggests that many men,
``secure men,'' will be happy to learn their wives have squirreled
away thousands of dollars when the time comes for the kids to go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   My advice as a secure man: Women, don't ever tell your secure
men. Security is a facade. Keep saving that money, and as Evans
advises, take it out of socks and drawers and put it into something
with a higher interest rate.

TEXAS GUARD PREPARES FOR PEACE DUTY IN BOSNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT POLK, La. _ Machine-gun fire rips through the air and angry
mobs take to the streets as soldiers from the Texas Army National
Guard and Army regulars work to protect international officials in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mock exercise, held in the safety of a U.S. Army base,
but was intended to demonstrate the perils that the soldiers will
face on peacekeeping duty in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at these soldiers, they are enduring a lot of
harassment here and they're taking it real well,'' retired Army 1st
Sgt. Bob Allen said as the mock crowd surrounded a patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take an average person off the street and put them in
that same type of scenario, the same type of situation, there's no
telling what would happen,'' he said. ``Somebody would get hurt.
Somebody would definitely get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no casualties this day at Fort Polk's Joint Readiness
Training Center near Leesville, La. The stones were ``Nerf rocks,''
fluffy balls that bounced harmlessly off the roofs of buildings,
and the mob was a group of hired hands _ a mixture of soldiers,
area residents and real Bosnians paid to prepare American forces
for what to expect when they are deployed as peacekeepers.

   Nearly 4,000 Army and Texas Army National Guard soldiers
recently put the final touches on their transformation from
warriors to peacemakers. The Austin-based Guard's 49th Armored
Division will make U.S. history in February by commanding Army
regulars for the first time. That is a source of deep pride for
many members of the 49th, who cannot forget the days when they got
second-rate equipment and were put down as ``weekend warriors.''
</P>
<P>
   Old hands like Staff Sgt. James Mercure and Staff Sgt. Guadalupe
Garcia, both of San Antonio, relish the chance to show the world
what a few good Texas Guards soldiers can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago people didn't really look up to us,'' Mercure,
a 19-year veteran, explained. But today, he said, ``we get along
all right. There's not that stigma anymore about 'you're better
than us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, an 18-year veteran of the Guard: ``It's our chance
to shine, and we're going to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Peril, however, casts a long shadow over that promise and the
ever-optimistic Guards members, all of them volunteers who will
spend eight months away from their families. It has been four years
since the Dayton Agreement brought an end to horrific ethnic and
religious fighting that ravaged Bosnia from 1992 to 1995. The deal,
negotiated at an air base in Dayton, Ohio, divided the nation
roughly equally between the Muslim-Croat Federation and the ethnic
Serbs and stopped the bloody war but has yet to deliver a lasting,
true peace.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of violence prompted the international peacekeeping force
there to recently announce it would delay a planned reduction of
its presence in Bosnia until after municipal elections are held in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Fort Polk, neither the blood nor the bullets were real
at this exercise, dubbed ``Lone Star Challenge,'' which concluded
on Nov. 19. It was the post's third such event this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian society was recreated at Fort Polk, right down to the
``COBS'' _ civilians on the battlefield. The exercise took place on
the streets of the post's $70 million urban warfare training
center, said Maj. Lester Simpson, a 19-year-guard veteran from
Rowlett, a Dallas suburb. Nearly 200 Bosnians were paid up to
$3,000 to be role-players in the ``box,'' an 80,000-acre training
area that occupies almost half the post.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of violence is always at the heart of the training
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   That violence is rooted, in part, in the Dayton accord, which
left the resolution of deal-breaking disputes for another day,
Balkans expert Brad Blitz said. Moreover, parts of the agreement
have not been implemented, such as the capture of war criminals and
the creation of functioning economic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a question of political will, meaning really
wanting to go and apprehend war criminals, meaning taking a
critical look at what Dayton was about and where it should go,''
said Blitz, a program officer for the Balkans with the
congressionally funded, nonpartisan United States Institute of
Peace in Washington.

</P>
<P>
   Guard Sgt.1st Class John Sampa, a state trooper in Houston,
fears violence could run ``like a cancer'' in Bosnia if it is not
stopped now.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Daniel Pons Jr., 45, with eight years in the Guard. He
calls peacekeeping a moral imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to allow genocide to exist, we refuse to allow
genocide to exist and to happen and keep our eyes open,'' Pons
said. ``You've got to be a hypocrite if you go to church and then
you see your brother being murdered and you don't do a thing about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing sentry outside Base Camp Demi, one of four tent cities
at Fort Polk, Army Spec. Gilbert Valerio looked ahead to his
mission in Bosnia, where he will man an M-60 machine gun on a
Humvee. He will be making ``presence patrols'' through urban
streets, literally sticking his neck out of the vehicle, a
dangerous job.
</P>
<P>
   Still, peacekeeping for him is preferable to another soldier's
duty. ``Being a soldier in the military, I do prefer there to be
peace,'' said Valerio, 26, of San Antonio. ``In the end, nobody
wants to have to serve our role as warriors.''

   Unlike actress Drew Barrymore, who got caught by surprise a few
days ago when a photographer snapped her with her pants down at
L.A.'s Four Seasons Hotel (she was merely putting on her jogging
shorts, she says), six local surfers dropped their drawers at
Malibu Beach for a new Jockey advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The professional surfers, from left, are Erik Carpenter of San
Diego, Danielle Martin of Malibu, Matty Morisaki of Santa Monica,
Sean Newhouse of Malibu, Daize Shayne of Del Mar and Sean Spraker
of Capitol Beach.

   New Yorkers are getting a glimpse of their larger-than-life
image in Times Square, and others around the country can see them
in several fashion magazines this month.
</P>
<P>
   The hula-happy underwear collection for spring 2000 is aimed at
youth, says Jockey spokesman Mark Hogan, and includes Polynesian
and batik prints, in long shorts and string bikinis. The clothing
is expected to arrive in department stores by January. &QL;

   Brace yourself, people. We're heading down the home stretch of
the 20th century, and for the next six weeks we're going to be
flooded with an endless tsunami of stories about the best, worst,
funniest, saddest, biggest, smallest, stupidest, smartest,
whatever-est, people and places and things of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And the decade.
</P>
<P>
   And the century.
</P>
<P>
   And the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Best band ever? The Beatles! Worst team of all time? The 1962
New York Mets! Most evil world leader? Hitler! Funniest sitcom?
``The Simpsons''! Niftiest car? The '57 Chevy!
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'll be able to resist the temptation to indulge in one
or two such columns of my own, e.g., this one. In fact I've already
begun researching my ``10 Best After-School Snacks of the
Millennium'' story, which should be ready for publication any day
now. (Not to give it away, but yes, Hostess Ding-Dongs made the
list. Zingers did not.)
</P>
<P>
   Best book of the century? ``The Catcher in the Rye''! Greatest
entertainer? Frank Sinatra! Best movie? ``The Godfather''! Most
beautiful skyscraper? The Chrysler Building in New York! Crowning
medical advancement? The polio vaccine!
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural that the media close out each year with
special issues looking back on the biggest news stories, the most
memorable songs, the notable celebrity deaths, the wackiest trends,
etc., of the past 12 months. I'm all for marking events in neat
bundles according to the Gregorian calendar, and I enjoy collecting
souvenir videos and newspaper articles (with titles like ``1990: It
was Hammer Time in the World of Music''). One day they'll help me
remember a specific slice of time in my life.
</P>
<P>
   But this 1999 deal, it's too much. Not only do we have the
year-end stuff, but we also to have to remember the 1990s, the
1900s and the thousand-year block of time that began in 1000, when
Bob Hope was a spry, wisecracking kid and there were only eight
teams in the American and National Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'll admit not too many people are really focusing
that much on, say, the 12th century _ unless it comes up as a
question on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Seems like most of
the books and TV specials and Internet sites and newspaper articles
are about the last century, as we in the media are obsessed with
compiling lists in nearly every imaginable category, no matter how
obvious and unsurprising the selections might be.
</P>
<P>
   Worst financial event? The stock market crash of '29! Most
tragic water-related disaster? The Titanic! Lousiest American
president? Nixon! Most horrifying fashion craze? Leisure suits!
Leading choice of footwear? Shoes!
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Gallup organization released the results of a
poll ranking the biggest news events of the 20th century. The
landslide winner: Kirstie Alley replacing Shelley Long on
``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding. The actual top vote-getter was World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Quite an upset, eh? I mean, didn't we kind of already know that?
And didn't we already figure out that the other contenders on the
list _ including The Holocaust, World War I, the assassination of
JFK and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 _ were also among the most
significant events in modern history?
</P>
<P>
   In that same vein, aren't we already aware that FDR and Winston
Churchill should be at the top of anyone's list of great historical
figures of the 20th century; that Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe
are among the most famous celebrities; that the Yankees and the
Celtics and the Canadiens are the foremost sports dynasties; that
Clark Gable and Katharine Hepburn are always near the top of any
movie-star ranking; that the Beatles and Michael Jackson sold
kazillions of records? What difference does it make if Led Zeppelin
is No. 6 on the list of the 10 Best Rock Bands and the Who are No.
7, or vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   Most awe-inspiring moment? Man sets foot on the moon! Greatest
toy? The Slinky! Best TV series opening? Mary Richards throwing her
hat into the air! Biggest media spectacle? The O.J. trial!
</P>
<P>
   For the next 39 days, you will not be able to flip through a
newspaper or magazine, click around the TV dial or log on to the
Internet without seeing some kind of list ranking the
best-worst-greatest something or other of the year, decade, century
or millennium. In the meantime, we're cavalierly ignoring the
imminent arrival of the weirdest set of numbers any of us have ever
seen on our calendars, checkbooks, Palm Pilots and Filofaxes _ not
to mention the fact that we haven't even figured out what we're
going to call this next decade. The ``Zeroes''? The ``Oh's''? The
``Aughts''? Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about ranking the best hot sauces and dance crazes of the
millennium. There are 6 billion people about to enter the 2000s,
and not a one of us can find a word to describe it. Help!

RIPENING ALMODOVAR HAS RIGHT TOUCH IN `MOTHER'

(Eds: Fact box at bottom) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're among the few who have caught Pedro Almodovar's last
couple of ``mature'' movies, you've probably questioned the
usefulness of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent and complex as ``Flower of My Secret'' and ``Live
Flesh'' were, they were stiffs compared to the exuberant outrages
the Spanish auteur served up earlier, those wacky examinations of
outlandish passions and libidos such as ``Matador,'' ``Women on the
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' and ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
</P>
<P>
   But the more sober approach of recent years has been a necessary
step in Almodovar's development, and his great new film ``All About
My Mother'' is the happy result. Emotionally deeper, with a bigger
heart and wider imaginative scope than his earlier, post-Franco
freakouts, ``Mother'' also incorporates the anything-goes
playfulness missing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a demented but beautiful ode to womanhood and the maternal
impulse, as well as a celebration of creativity in all its forms,
from classical to downright alarming. Packed with dire plot turns
but forgiving and hopeful in convincingly pragmatic ways,
``Mother'' earned Almodovar the directing award at this year's
Cannes Film Festival for a vital reason _ it's the finest film he's
ever made, and he's made many fine ones.
</P>
<P>
   The poised center of this behavioral spinning top is Cecilia
Roth's Manuela, a Madrid transplant coordinator who trains medical
personnel in the delicate art of coaxing bereaved relatives into
donating their loved ones' vital organs. The single mother of
bright, lovable teen-ager Esteban, Manuela is put to a horrendous
test when the boy, her only child, is hit by a truck the night of
his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela deals with her grief by returning to Barcelona, where
she last saw the father her son never knew (and who never knew
about him). She intends to seek out her ex, but we see early on
that a lot of distractions will delay the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Her first act on the Costa Brava is to taxi to a prostitute
pickup field. Far from lost, Manuela's searching for an old pal,
the feisty transsexual La Agrado (Antonia San Juan). Agrado, as you
might expect, has a few problems, as do the other females Manuela
soon encounters.
</P>
<P>
   There's the pregnant, HIV-positive nun Sister Rosa, played
without glamour by the stunning Penelope Cruz. There's Huma Rojo
(Almodovar favorite Marisa Paredes), a theatrical grande dame whose
traveling stage production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' was a
prominent factor in Esteban's death, and her drug-addicted, much
younger co-star and lover Nina (Candela Pena).
</P>
<P>
   Manuela finds herself playing den mother to these volatile
souls, and in the process brings out each individual's particular
brand of feminine strength. Manuela's natural acting ability takes
on more and more facets as she rises to fulfill the expanding
demands of her ad hoc family of women.
</P>
<P>
   Almodovar has always been a genius at depicting the opposite sex
and, to a lesser extent, men whose female characteristics dominate
their self-image. He goes for broke with all of that in ``All About
My Mother,'' but that's not all. The signature Almodovar style of
bright, splotchy primary colors and kitschy/severe decor is present
in accenting ways here, but toned down to a subtler yet somehow
more evocative level.
</P>
<P>
   As in most of the director's films, The cultural iconography is
rich and delirious here _ the film's title is a remarked-upon
tribute to the Bette Davis camp masterpiece ``All About Eve.'' But
like so many aspects of this movie, such stuff is delivered with an
offhanded gravity that invests it with resonant feeling and
politicized humor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this is new to Almodovar's body of work. But
finding a new depth in one's identifying traits is the greatest
thing that this movie is all about.

OPENING DOOR OF GOVERNMENT A LITTLE WIDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Still trying to find their voice as the loyal
opposition, Texas Democrats gleefully seized upon the recent
revelation of how many dollars it was costing Texas taxpayers to
protect Gov. George W. Bush as he roams the country seeking the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that he's taking money that could be used for
public schools and health care and spending it on his own personal
ambitions,'' protested state Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth
Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is essentially a tempest in a teapot, but it is made
more interesting than it otherwise would be by the fact that it was
Attorney General John Cornyn, a member of Bush's own party, who
gave the Democrats a new opportunity _ albeit small _ to exercise
their vocal chords.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be noted that when the shoe was on the other foot
several years ago, then-Attorney General Dan Morales, a Democrat,
failed to extend a similar courtesy to Republicans trying to get a
handle on Democratic Gov. Ann Richards' jet-setting political
travels.
</P>
<P>
   The question of paying for Bush's state bodyguards initially
surfaced a few months ago, when the would-be president and his
security detail started spending more time outside of Texas than at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revived when Cornyn told the Texas Department of
Public Safety, for whom Bush's protectors work, that, under the
Public Information Act, it had to release the total cost of
providing the governor's security.
</P>
<P>
   The tab so far this year is about $1.8 million, or several times
more than the DPS normally spent on executive security during the
years before Bush started running for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS and the governor's office didn't want to release any
information to the news organizations that initially sought it.
They turned the matter over to Cornyn, pleading that the public
release of the information would jeopardize Bush's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn agreed with the governor and his protectors on several
points and allowed the agency to keep secret such details as the
number of state troopers assigned to Bush, the amount of overtime
they are paid and their specific travel records.
</P>
<P>
   But the attorney general held that there wasn't any security
risk in releasing the agency's total costs of protecting Bush. He
said the total had to be released, and it was, apparently for the
first time for any governor.
</P>
<P>
   When this issue first surfaced, I wrote _ and I still believe _
that Bush is entitled to his taxpayer-paid protection, regardless
of how he spends his time. And before the campaign gets much older,
the federal Secret Service will take over his protection, and all
the country's taxpayers will share the bill.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush were to voluntarily spend some of the more than $56
million that he has raised in political funds for his presidential
campaign to reimburse the state for his security costs, it would be
a nice gesture. But that's up to the governor. He certainly isn't
obligated to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Give Cornyn credit, meanwhile, for opening the door of state
government a little wider, if not by much. It is a better
performance for open government, in any event, than that turned in
by his Democratic predecessor, Morales, when Republicans were
tracking Democrat Richards' out-of-state political travels.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted, among other things, copies of Richards'
security expenditures and detailed daily schedules, including a
period when Richards was on a fund-raising tour for Kathleen Brown,
an unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial candidate in California.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS, pleading _ you guessed it _ security concerns, refused
to release the information and turned the Republicans' request over
to Morales for an open-records ruling in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Morales sat on it, as he did many other such requests while he
was in office, because, unlike now, there was no deadline for the
attorney general to respond to open-records requests. After several
months, the Republicans went to court to force the issue, and in
late June 1994, another Democrat, state District Judge John Dietz
of Austin, ruled against them. So Richards' detailed schedules
remained secret.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn ruled on Bush's security costs two days before his
deadline for doing so. Would he, like Morales, have ignored the
public information request without the deadline?
</P>
<P>
   I like to think not, since Cornyn has publicly committed himself
to enforcing open government. But that deadline is a nice safety
net for the public, and, in this case, his ruling helped keep the
political pot boiling.
</P>

STEVE ALLEN  WRITES MUSICAL `CHRISTMAS CAROL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Not for use before Wednesday, Nov. 24) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom)  
(Eds: Correction inserts `live' in second graf) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; There have been great ``Christmas Carols'' and deadly
``Christmas Carols,'' high-tech productions at Madison Square
Garden and thrift-shop productions in suburban church basements.
</P>
<P>
   But there had never been a  &UR; live &LR; musical version of Charles
Dickens' timeless holiday parable. Or so Steve Allen briefly
considered when he decided to sit down and write one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me one of the best ideas that I had ever had,''
says Allen, whose tuneful adaptation of Dickens' seasonal classic
will have its world premiere tonight at Theatre West, across from
Universal City. ``I could not believe, however, that I was the
first to ever think of it _ and indeed I was not.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that a bunch of overqualified Brits, including
Albert Finney and Alec Guinness, had beaten Allen to the punch with
the 1970 musical feature film ``Scrooge.'' Released in the
Oscar-winning wake of ``Oliver!'' _ another Dickens novel turned
musical property _ ``Scrooge'' is memorable today mainly for the
image of Finney romping through faux-Victorian streets warbling
``Thank You Very Much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't there room for another try?
</P>
<P>
   There was, and now Allen has written 17 songs for it with titles
such as ``We Are One,'' ``Greed'' and a pull-out-the-hankies number
called ``God Bless Us Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me there had to be a song sung by dear little
Tiny Tim called `God Bless Us Everyone,' because that's the
best-known line,'' says Allen. ``Fortunately, Dickens is easily
accessible. You can take chunks of conversation just as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring as world-class skinflint Ebenezer Scrooge will be
Harold Gould, the five-time Emmy nominated actor (``Rhoda,'' ``The
Golden Girls'') who recently starred in the Pasadena Playhouse
production of ``Visiting Mr. Green.'' Allen will appear onstage at
most performances as Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   A prodigious actor, composer and author of 53 books, and the man
who created and first hosted ``The Tonight Show,'' Allen has led
popular culture more often than he has followed it. At 78 he still
puts in a full seven days of work, either at his Encino home or his
Van Nuys-based Meadowlane Enterprises (named for his wife, actress
Jayne Meadows), where he keeps a handful of hard-working assistants
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing songs comes easily to Allen, so easily that he composed
one of his major hits, ``This Could Be the Start of Something
Big,'' in his sleep (he says the song came to him in a dream).
Officially, he's the world's most prolific songwriter, with more
than 8,000 composing credits, including ``Impossible.'' You can
look it up in the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hide the point?'' he says evenly. ``I can write beautiful
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allen, once called ``the most talented man in America'' by
no less a multifaceted talent than Noel Coward, makes no particular
claims for what he refers to as his ``freakish'' musical aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have understanding of it. I don't even read music.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he take credit for having any special new insights into
``A Christmas Carol's'' enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Dickens scholar,'' he says. ``I'm not a scholar of
any kind. In fact I never even graduated from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly credentials or no, Allen is happy to chat about his
new show in relation to, say, the social theories of Metternich and
Marx or the formation of the modern welfare state. He believes that
``the question of what the rich should do about the poor, in fact,
(is) more with us today in some ways than it was when (Dickens) was
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to do something (to assist the needy),'' he
says. ``That's just common sense. But common sense isn't very
common.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season, if you stop by the rescue-mission shelters
in downtown Los Angeles you may spot Allen and his wife serving a
holiday meal to the homeless, as the couple does every year.
</P>
<P>
   But you're more likely to find him shepherding some of his 12
grandchildren to Theatre West to witness a new musical about a very
lucky old man who somehow finds a way to grow happier with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, of all the things I've done, my favorite
role is Grandpa,'' Allen says. ``I've just noticed when I'm with
the kids, my face smiles more.''
</P>

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team is dying. Attention must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots sit, this morning, as close to the
bottom of the AFC East as they do to the top. They have the same
division record (2-3) as the team their fans love to hate, Bill
Parcells's New York Jets, and they actually are closer to the Jets
than either the Dolphins or Colts because they have already been
swept by Miami and trail Indianapolis by a game in division losses
and two in conference losses.
</P>
<P>
   So if the playoffs were beginning next Sunday, which mercifully
they are not, the Patriots would be home _ as in going home, not
hosting a game. They would be O-U-T, which is the way they are
headed if they continue to play as they have the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In six days, New England lost to the Jets and Dolphins, dropping
to 6-4 and causing fans to get their knickers in a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, as this space tried to explain following the Monday
night loss to New York, the Patriots are actually doing about as
well as should be expected under the present regime. They are what
they are, and what they are is a flawed team with a leadership
problem at the top, strategical problems at the core, and personnel
problems in too many places that resulted from both poor
decision-making and from personality clashes between the head coach
and players.
</P>
<P>
   When it was written in this space after the Jets game that there
was no longer ``anything special about them,'' the e-mail delivery
system at the Globe nearly exploded. That seemed to hit a nerve
among fans. Although they had been warned for months that this was
the case, they did not want to believe what three years of play and
their own eyes were telling them.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to believe the hype, so they sent e-mails and faxes
and even a few XXX-rated letters this way. More than a few should
have carried a disclaimer that ``adult language'' was being used,
although adult thinking often was absent.
</P>
<P>
   So let's try this again, but this time let's merely look at the
record of the team as dispassionately as possible and try to see if
it reveals anything about the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 6-4. After a 4-0 start, they have gone 2-4 to
fall into fourth place in the division, a roller coaster pattern
that has held since Pete Carroll's arrival. They already have four
conference losses, more than any playoff contender but Buffalo
(which also has four), and three division losses, more than any of
the teams ahead of them in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's see what they've done against whom.
</P>
<P>
   Of their six victories, only one came against a team with a
winning record. The Patriots came back from a deep deficit to beat
the 8-2 Colts. Other than that, the combined record of their five
other victims is 18-33, a winning percentage of .352.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, only one of the four teams that have beaten them
(Miami did it twice) has a losing record (the 4-6 Jets). The
combined winning percentage of those teams, if Miami is included
twice, is .625. If Miami is counted once, the winning percentage is
.564.
</P>
<P>
   What can we conclude from this?
</P>
<P>
   That the 1999 Patriots, as a rule, beat bad teams and lose to
good ones seems pretty evident. If that holds true for the
remainder of the season, they would lose at least three more times
and win twice, with the Dallas game a tossup because the Cowboys
are 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, injuries and personnel matchups can alter that
scenario, some but if history is a tool for predicting the future,
the future is not good for this edition of the Patriots for one
simple reason: They are what you've been told they are, whether you
like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   They're a team that is nothing special.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make them bad guys, nor does it mean they are
without talent. In some areas they have as much talent as any team
in football. But football really is a team game. Football really is
a sport where a team is as strong as its weakest link, as much of a
cliche as that is. Football is not about individuality _ endless
end zone dances notwithstanding _ and that has to apply to the
coach as well as the players. They all have to be willing to take
one for the team from time to time, even if it means using a player
someone doesn't particularly want to invite to the Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a sport about me. It is a sport about we, and if the
we in question is this year's Patriots, it should be spelled wee.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is not that they stink and are useless human
beings. It does not mean they deserve to be abused as they walk up
the ramp at Foxboro Stadium after a loss. Nor does it mean they're
a worthless football team unfit for your loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It just means they are what they are, and what they are is a
team mired somewhere in the great middle of professional football,
neither great nor awful. Unfortunately, they are tragically flawed
in major ways, and that, in the end, is what will kill them this
season as it has the past two.
</P>
<P>
   They not only cannot run the ball, they don't even try. On
Sunday, Miami defensive lineman Trace Armstrong was asked about the
Dolphins' first victory over New England and how they managed to
come back from an early 14-0 deficit that was the product of two
interception returns for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd keep throwing it,'' Armstrong said. ``That gave
us a chance to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   We knew they'd keep throwing it. Even with a 14-point lead,
Miami was confident that the Patriots would keep throwing it, and
so they did, and when they didn't hit, it gave Miami a chance to
come back. The rest is history. By the time this season is over,
the Patriots' playoff hopes will be history as well for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult in sports or in life to alter your destiny in
midstream. Frankly, the Patriots are likely to roar into Buffalo
Sunday and defeat the Bills, something they've done three of the
four times they've played them since Carroll took over. That has
been their pattern at the moment they seem ready to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But they have six games to go, and half of them are against
teams with winning records, and their history under Carroll is not
good in such situations. Worse, they have no margin for error. They
have done what they have always done since this collection of
players was first put together seven years ago: They have dug
themselves a hole and left no room for a misstep. That is not what
smart teams do. It's also not what an elite team allows to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if they win the rest of their games and go 12-4,
they'd probably win the division, but do you really think that's
likely?
</P>
<P>
   They could finish 11-5 and certainly make the playoffs and
possibly win the division, but do you feel comfortable gambling on
that?
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that they go 4-2 or 3-3 and end up where most
people said they'd be when this season began.
</P>
<P>
   Just short of their dreams. Just short of their hopes. Just
short.

THOMAS TO STUDY A SCHOOL PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, Isiah Thomas said he is not in the business of
stealing players from the NCAA to play in his CBA. Nor is he
interested in denying anyone a quality education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in education,'' said Thomas. ``There has to be a way
for kids to play in the CBA and maintain their college
eligibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas wants to sit down with NCAA officials to discuss a
potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and CBS recently signed a $6 billion deal that includes
broadcast, cable, satellite, and Internet rights. The deal gives
the NCAA a steady stream of revenue for the next 11 years while
providing CBS with quality sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be a problem if the nation's top high school
players start to skip college to play in the CBA as an avenue to
the NBA. Some analysts have argued that the value of the NCAA
tournament, which is already taxed by star upperclassmen's
defections to the NBA, would be further diminished because of the
lack of even younger talent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas doesn't want to compete with the NCAA for players. In
fact, the CBA could actually steer kids toward college.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a year of, say, Adrian Griffin beating them up, that kid
will look at college a lot differently,'' Thomas said. ``The kid
will be a better player and ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Right now, Thomas can offer only ``life-skills''
courses in the CBA. He said the NCAA could play an integral part in
providing college-level courses throughout the year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's tough being the worldwide leader in sports these days. The
production on ESPN pieces has been inconsistent. For example,
Solomon Wilcots did great reporting on a Ben Coates feature, which
included interviews with Drew Bledsoe, Ernie Zampese, and Bruce
Armstrong. But viewers did not hear from Coates, nor did they
receive an explanation from Wilcots (Coates, in fact, declined to
be interviewed). Wilcots's standup was left on the editing-room
floor to make room for a bizarre combination of rock music and
Coates highlights. More troubling is ESPN's double standard. Chris
Berman rightly criticizes NFL players for making a throat-slashing
gesture after making a good play. But ESPN then runs an
expletive-laden, locker room interview with New York Jets
linebacker Brian Cox. Producers bleeped out the curses for
``SportsCenter'' but let them roll during ``Prime Time.'' Tsk, tsk
. . . The Arena Football League has a new television deal worth an
estimated $25 million with ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and The Nashville
Network. TNN, a CBS cable subsidiary, signed a three-year contract,
with two one-year options. ESPN/ABC signed a one-year deal, with a
one-year option. The 14-week regular season starts in April, with
telecasts probably on Thursdays. Playoff games will be shown on all
three cable networks; ABC airs the Arena Bowl on Aug. 19.

Simms work the second half of the doubleheader, Colts-Jets. Fox's
Dick Stockton and Matt Millen call the 4 p.m. game between Tampa

<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Tocco could step off the pages of Seventeen magazine
with her wardrobe: Steve Madden 3-inch platform boots, shrug
jackets, a puffy vest, bra-strap headbands, a jean jacket, even a
prom dress from hip retailer Cache.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: Tocco isn't 17, she's 47. ``If I think it
looks good, I wear it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Tocco isn't alone. Many baby boomers are dressing these days in
cargo pants, glittered bracelets, stretch shirts with
three-quarter-length sleeves, embroidered jeans, and capri pants.
Retailers and designers recount tales of mothers borrowing clothes
from their teenage daughters, and daughters, in turn, opting for
clothes _ such as ball-gown skirts and coordinating cardigans _
from their moms' wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big change from a generation ago, when most teens
wouldn't be caught dead dressed like their mothers: in pantyhose,
hats, gloves, and suits. ``In the past, mothers were extremely
conservative,'' says Jane Rosenthal, a 40-year-old who frequently
wears capri pants, a Prada body bag, and trendy power-bead
bracelets. ``For them, wearing Keds sneakers was a big deal. They
wouldn't wear jeans. When I was a teenager, my mother seemed very
old to me. She looked old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, society is more casual, and youthfulness _ not
appropriateness _ is culturally revered. ``The feeling is, if you
wear younger clothes, you'll look younger and feel younger,'' says
Ruth P. Rubinstein, a sociologist at the Fashion Institute of
Technology in New York and author of ``Dress Codes: Meanings and
Messages in American Culture.'' ``We no longer really have
appropriateness . . . life is less constrained.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical fitness craze means more 40-something women can
actually fit into younger styles. People are also living longer,
which means 50 isn't considered old anymore. And the popularity of
plastic surgery has meant more women are trying to have
young-looking bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of our clients have had work done that we've had to
increase the cup size on our shirts. We've gone from a B to a C
cup,'' says Mark Mendelson, president of Tahari Ltd., a New York
clothing company. ``Nobody wants to get older. My mom is 57. She
rollerblades and comes to step (aerobics) class with me in the
morning. These days, it's more about attitude than age.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural cycle of fashion is also a factor in the trend.
Classic styles like sheath dresses, A-line skirts, and cardigan
sweaters ``look good on a 13-year-old as much as a 60-year-old,''
says New York designer Betsey Johnson. ``I always believed the
person made the clothing. A black slip dress can look completely
different on 10 different people. The wearer changes it based on
who she is, how she accessorizes it, and how she walks.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all women are stocking up on Mickey Mouse
T-shirts and the like. Kim Johnson Gross, an InStyle magazine
columnist and coauthor of 24 Chic Simple fashion books, says she is
not swapping clothes with her daughters, 11 and 15. ``You can't
pretend you're 20 years old anymore,'' she says. ``Your style
should evolve to embrace who you are. . . . You don't have to hide
in a sack. But you should definitely show your best features.''
</P>
<P>
   That means trendy looks like cargo pants and exposed bra straps
are a no-no, she contends. ``I generally don't think cargo pants
are very flattering on most women. It's a real teen thing. . . .
Kids don't like it when their mothers dress like them. . . .
They're embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, in an age when there are no rules, it wouldn't take
much for a woman to go too far and lose track of common sense.
Jessica Tocco, 16, was horrified recently when she spied a
40-something woman with butterfly clips pinned all over her hair.
``It was a fashion disaster,'' she says. ``Butterfly clips are for
little kids. . . . I think a lot of people are trying to look
younger. Some people can pull it off. Others, it's like `Oh God.'
When I'm older, I won't go shopping at the Limited Too.''
</P>
<P>
   But, once you hit 40, is it more acceptable to dress in a frumpy
fashion? Not according to Jessica's mom, Barbara, a professional
decorative painter. ``I think the majority of women in my age
bracket dress boring. . . . They're either preppy or elastic-waist
people. . . . Somehow, it just lacks something,'' Barbara Tocco
says.
</P>
<P>
   Tocco doesn't hesitate to borrow liberally from her three
teenage daughters' closets, including donning an $80 leopard-print
dress the family bought recently from Bloomingdale's that they all
plan to share and a dark purple Empire-waist dress that Andrea
Tocco, 17, wore to her prom last spring. Tocco says she plans to
wear the prom dress on a cruise. ``My prom dress fits my mother.
It's kind of scary,'' laughs Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she believes her mother has the figure and personality to
wear the clothes. ``She's kind of thin, so it doesn't look like
she's trying to squeeze into small pants. She can wear Abercrombie
&AMP; Fitch pants and they don't look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I want to get her a different look, more
sophisticated. But that's her, so I can't change it. . . . I'm glad
my mother doesn't dress in wicked tight clothes and short dresses.
That would definitely aggravate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hwa Wu, a 20-year-old junior at Boston University, says
exchanging trendy clothes with her 47-year-old mother, Jade, has
``drawn us closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu routinely overstuffs her suitcase when she goes home to Los
Angeles during school breaks so her mother and grandmother can
check out the latest East Coast fashions. ``Girls, no matter what
age they are, want to be on top of fashion,'' she says. ``When the
hot new color is pink, my grandmother wants to get a pink sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom wears my capri pants and a lot of my sweaters. . . .
She's a professional with tons of suits so she's interested in
borrowing my cool T-shirts, my jeans, my cardigan sets. . . . I
love her Chinese dresses, her A-line skirts. What's special is that
no one else has it,'' Wu says. ``We go together and get things
tailored so they fit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Samantha Rosenthal says her mother, Jane, is her
biggest style influence. ``Ever since I was little, I always
thought my mom was so cool,'' she says. ``My friends always say,
`Does your mom borrow your clothes?' I say, `Actually, I borrow my
clothes from her.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rosenthal's job certainly helps. She works part time at
Pink Domino, a trendy girls' clothing store in Newton, Mass. aimed
at mostly 7- to 14-year-olds. Pink Domino carries hot brands like
Bulldog and Hard Tail as well as up-to-the-moment accessories like
power-bead bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear a lot of jeans and capri pants. I usually set the trend
and then Samantha wants the same thing,'' says Rosenthal. ``I
couldn't see my mother wearing any of this way back. Mothers are
just more hip now.''

ANNOYING SKITS OFTEN POINTLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Used to be that being a rapper was all about having skills on
the mike. It was about the soul connection between an MC and a DJ,
the delicious gumbo of smooth-as-silk flow and jaw-dropping lines
hugged up nice with tantalizing beats. Back in the day, it was
Run-D.M.C., Public Enemy, EPMD, and the Cold Crush Brothers laying
straight-up beats and rhymes that got your hands in the air, and
waving around like you just didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Now, listening to some of the latest hip-hop offerings, it seems
as if rappers want to be Stanley Kowalski as much as they want to
be Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   What is up with all these skits on rap CDs?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's those fat eight-digit Hollywood paychecks Will Smith
is cashing these days, or the sight of Ice Cube acting circles
around George Clooney in ``Three Kings.'' Perhaps, hip-hop nation
has just spent too much time watching and pimping scenes from their
adopted ghetto classics, ``The Godfather,'' ``Scarface,'' and
``GoodFellas.'' But lately rap CDs _ from last year's
multiple-Grammy-winning ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' to
Eve's recent solo debut, ``Ruff Ryders' First Lady,'' to Dr. Dre's
much-anticipated ``2001'' _ are littered with annoying skits.
</P>
<P>
   For the hip-hop uninitiated, skits are mini-dramas or short
comedy (well, at least they're supposed to be funny) routines
sandwiched between tracks. Sometimes, they serve as a setup to
upcoming tracks like ``Whispering Playa,'' which precedes TLC's
bad-brothas brushoff ``No Scrubs,'' on ``Fan Mail.'' Other times,
such as with the strange, sexually raw fake phone call ``Ken
Kaniff'' on Eminem's ``Slim Shady LP'' it's just a gratuitous space
filler, which can bring a created mood to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   This happens way more than necessary on Dr. Dre's long-awaited
follow-up to his 1993 classic ``The Chronic.'' Out of 22 tracks,
there are four skits, none of which add anything to an otherwise
tight CD. (And yes, it's typically hard on women, and drops more
N-bombs than a weekend marathon of ``Def Comedy Jam,'' but this is
Dr. Dre, kids.) Among the skits are ``The Car Bomb,'' wherein a
bickering couple is wasted when they turn the ignition; ``Pause 4
Porno,'' which pretty much explains itself. Then there's a diatribe
by scratchy-voiced comedian Eddie Griffin, best know from TV's
``Malcolm and Eddie.'' It's more profane than anything Redd Foxx or
Doug Clark and His Hot Nuts could have mustered, and nowhere near
as funny.
</P>
<P>
   Even clean skits, such as the classroom discussions that run
through parts of Lauryn Hill's stellar solo debut are irritating
and distracting. Imagine Nelson Riddle dropping one of those
frightening Rat Pack skits with Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Joey in the
middle of Frank Sinatra's ``In the Wee Small Hours of the
Morning,'' and you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hip-hop skits aren't new. They've been around for at least a
decade, and when they began they seemed smart and fresh. For all
practical purposes, big-brain producer Paul ``Prince Paul'' Huston
pioneered the rap album skit with De La Soul's ``3 Feet High and
Rising'' in 1989. The CD opens with a fake game show, complete with
cheesy organ music and contestant introductions, zips into
``Chopsticks,'' and a of fashion don'ts from do-rags to
``acid wash-bell-bottomed-designed-by-ya-mama'' jeans. It was
funny, unexpected, and, coming a year after the blow-to-the-head of
N.W.A's ``Straight Outta Compton,'' proved that rap still had a
potent sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the original skit may well be the
country-bumpkin-devoured-in-the-big-city closing of Stevie Wonder's
``Living for the City.'' In ``Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists,''
Prince Paul calls Wonder's 1973 contribution, ``still the all-time
greatest _ the first and best one ever.'' More than anyone, Prince
Paul is expanding the possibilities of hip-hop skits, with his solo
projects ``Psychoanalysis (What Is It?)'' and most notably with
last year's ``A Prince Among Thieves,'' his concept album of a
friendship undermined by greed and violence. Every skit forwarded
the story, since this was essentially a hip-hopera.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Paul's latest effort, Handsome Boy Model School's ``So .
. . How's Your Girl?'' a collaboration with Dan the Automator,
continues his pastiche of samples, sounds, and skits, including
excerpts from the Chris Elliot sitcom ``Get a Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But few rappers are reaching Prince Paul's experimental heights
with their skits. Like any good idea, this one has been played out
and run into the ground, and now most hip-hop skits sound like
auditions for Master P's next straight-to-video ghetto opus. Where
hip-hop should be about gettin' a party started or, to paraphrase
N.W.A., witnessing ``the strength of street knowledge,'' these days
many rappers seem interested only in letting Hollywood know they
are ready for their close-up.
</P>
<P>
   When I buy a hip-hop album, I want hip-hop. If I want skits,
I'll watch reruns of the ``The Carol Burnett Show.''

 NORTHAMPTON, Mass.: ... speed ahead.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, Amy MacKenzie and Stacey Styles, their daughter,
then 7, and their dog posed for a portrait on the front porch of
the home they shared in Amherst. They were a poster family for a
new lifestyle, featured in the exhibit and book ``Love Makes a
Family.'' Now, laughs MacKenzie, 43, a vocational instructor for
disabled adults, ``The dog is dead. The kid is grown. The house is
sold. The family is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the two mothers separated, trading a not-so-peaceful
coexistence for the shuttle diplomacy of joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the history of lesbian parents, we all want
to have perfect families,'' says Styles, 41, a violin restorer.
``We want to be good examples for our minority. I guess I have to
allow myself to be as flawed as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   That gay and lesbian families are ``as flawed as everyone else''
spurred the Gay &AMP; Lesbian Advocates &AMP; Defenders, in 1998, to
convene lawyers, social workers, and mediators to develop standards
the community could promote to protect children when their
homosexual parents separate. The result was a document, published
in April, that encourages coparent adoption and voluntary, rather
than litigious, resolution of custody issues.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later the SJC, in its landmark ruling on a case from
Martha's Vineyard, set legal precedent in a situation that was
rarely litigated and, when it was, had been decided on a
case-by-case basis in lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   As much as gay advocates hail that decision, it is limited. It
grants the de facto parent temporary visitation while her complaint
is pending in probate court, but is silent on her request for joint
custody and adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas of law are virtually untested. Must a biological
mother notify her child's de facto parent if she moves out of
state? If a biological mother moves to a state without coparent
adoption, does the adoptive mother still have rights and
responsibilities? Can a biological mother let her new partner adopt
the child she bore while living with her former partner?
</P>
<P>
   The SJC ruling could also have an impact in situations where
domestic violence is alleged, says attorney Sandra Lundy. A de
facto parent who endured abuse rather than move out and risk losing
contact with children may now feel empowered to leave. A de facto
parent who battered may also have new rights. In these cases up
till now, says Lundy, ``that was it. You were out of the game. In
the heterosexual context, you'd at least get visitation, even if it
was supervised.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie and Styles separated with all the legal protection
afforded gay families. MacKenzie is the biological mother and
Styles, since 1995, the adoptive mother. Yet while Styles is
confident their shared custody would have worked whether or not she
had adopted their daughter, MacKenzie pauses at the same question.
``If Stacey hadn't adopted,'' she confesses, ``I think there were
times I would have been tempted to pull rank.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare wrote that ``a rose by any other name would smell as
sweet,'' but, in Amherst, 17-year-old Gwendolyn Bass would tell the
Bard that names do matter.
</P>
<P>
   She has two parents, the biological mother she calls Mom and
another she calls Juju, because in 1982, when Lois Bass and Judith
Evans were pioneers forming a lesbian family, they decided against
being two mommies. When Gwen was 4, Evans took a job in
Switzerland, leaving Gwen to see her a few times a year and Bass to
suffer Gwen's rage alone. ``I'd throw tantrums all the time,'' Gwen
says. `` `Mommy, I hate you. I don't want you. I want Juju.' For
her, it must have been horrible to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1989, Evans and her new partner, Ellen Ilfeld, declared
their love in a commitment ceremony in California, which Gwen
attended, but not without first crying because ``it meant it was
over between her and my mom.'' In 1992, Evans moved back to Amherst
and back to her life, to her softball games and school plays.
Finally, in January 1999 Evans moved to the Netherlands to work in
The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain to people her significance to me,'' says
Gwen. ``Justifying my emotions about it. What it meant to me when
she moved away this time. People were like, `That's cool. You have
a contact in Europe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as much trouble as Gwen has finding words to convey her
personal life to her public world, Shakespeare had a point.
Substitute ``Dad'' for ``Juju'' _ and call Ilfeld a stepmother,
instead of wondering, as Gwen's friends did, what to make of one
more woman in her life _ and you can understand Gwen's family.
</P>
<P>
   Once Gwen asked Evans if she could call her ``Dad'' for a day.
Bass once told Evans, ``If I wanted a husband, I would have married
a man.'' And Evans, 57, who raised a son from a marriage that ended
in divorce and calls Gwen her daughter, feels she's been in the
``very bizarre'' position of having been a mother once and a father
once. The latter role, she says, ``is not nearly as intimate a
relationship with a child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me,'' says Bass, a 52-year-old social worker,
``resents her ability to decide when she wants to be a parenting
presence and when she doesn't, as if it doesn't make a difference
in my life and Gwen's life. It would matter more if she
disappeared. She loves Gwen. There's no question about that. She
just does it differently than I've been able to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans sends money to Gwen and telephones her weekly. They've
seen each other four times since she moved to Holland, and Gwen
will spend Christmas with Evans and Ilfeld and Evans's son (``my
brother,'' says Gwen). They sound like a complicated, blended
heterosexual family in which Dad accepted a faraway job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry, but I wouldn't admit I was angry,'' says Gwen.
``I felt like her commitment to me wasn't as important as other
things. Then I realized she wasn't leaving me. She was making a
life decision, a career decision. I was upset for a long time. It
was hard to feel I had two parents of equal status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If she really were to get as angry at me as she probably
feels,'' says Evans, ``I'm sure at some level she feels I would
disappear. I know I wouldn't, but I'm not sure she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen dreams of traveling with Evans after college to learn about
international child development programs, then returning to open a
bilingual preschool and some day have her own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want tons of kids,'' she says. ``I feel like stability is
really important. I know it wasn't Judith's intention to hurt me by
leaving, but it's not an easy thing for a kid.''

OBJECTIVE WITNESSES JUDGE PRONOUN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The little language drama played out at lunch, wrote Marcia
Mitchell of Cambridge, where one friend was showing the other
photos of a recent holiday trip.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She taps her finger on a photo that shows two women standing in
an open-air market. ``This is Ruth and I,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her companion winces. ``Me,'' she says reflexively. ``Ruth and
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' her friend glares. ``I know this rule down cold. When
you answer the phone and the caller asks for you, you say, `It is
I.' The rule is the same. If the picture were of me alone, I would
say, `This is I.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you wouldn't. What you really said was, `This is a picture
of Ruth and me.' Just because you chose to leave out the words `a
picture of' doesn't change the grammar involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The traveler remains unconvinced. The stay-at-home grammarian
offers to provide printed authority . . . (but can find) no
specific statement that the rules governing a situation remain the
same even when the speaker has elided the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you help?'' Mitchell asks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not much _ there are at least two questions embedded in
this disagreement, and neither one has a simple, workable answer.
But maybe a dissection of the issues will help the disputants agree
to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the question of elision _ the mind-reading
question. Even if the traveler has truncated a thought, her friend
can only guess at the long form she intended. Sure, she might have
been thinking ``This is a picture of Ruth and me on the Spanish
Steps.'' But she might equally well have been thinking ``This is
Ruth and I on our way to dinner at Tre Scalini.'' You could design
an experiment to find out how most people would fill in the blanks
_ but even that wouldn't prove what was in the speaker's head.
</P>
<P>
   Even in conventional expressions, these assumptions can change.
Today, we say ``Her and her vacation photos!'' when we've had
enough, or ``Him and his delphiniums!'' We've agreed that an
unspoken thought _ ``I'm so bored with'' _ governs the phrase,
making it objective case.
</P>
<P>
   But in other times, other conventions rule: In a short story
from the mid-'30s, Agatha Christie chooses the nominative case. A
parlormaid is grousing to her boyfriend about her employer, who
insists on called her Jane instead of using her real name. ``How I
wish the old cat could see me now!'' says the young woman. ``She
and her Janes!'' Here, you'd have to supply the end of the sentence
rather than the beginning: ``She and her Janes drive me batty!''
</P>
<P>
   But even if it's clear which half of the sentence is missing,
that's not the end of the problem. English has been debating the
merits of it's me since the 18th century, and even 200 years ago,
some were defending it's me on the grounds that it was customary,
never mind that Latin rules of grammar demanded it's I. Since real
speakers have never followed the theoretical rules, and usage
guides have been forced to concede _ some reluctantly, others
cheerfully _ that in many situations, it's me and it's her are
simply the way English does it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bergen and Cornelia Evans's Dictionary of
Contemporary English Usage, published in 1957, lists situations
that should demand the nominative _ I, she, we _ and then adds,
``These rules do not represent standard English practice.'' The
Evanses would rather you told a phone caller This is she, but ``the
objective form is acceptable in all other constructions, such as
that is him. In more complex sentences,'' they add, the nominative
pronouns are almost never used, ``except in the most artificial
prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Partridge, writing a few years earlier, declared it's me
``defensible'' in British usage and ``acceptable colloquial
English'' in America. (``That is,'' he explained, ``it is used in
good speech. There is no occasion to write it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Why is it impossible to tame these wayward pronouns, despite the
efforts of strict constructionists? The usage experts say it's
because, in a positional language like ours _ where the meaning
depends more on word order than inflection _ we expect sentences to
unfold in the usual subject-verb-object order, and a word found
after the verb feels the gravitational pull of this expectation.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just casual speakers who waffle on pronoun choice:
Would it raise a red flag for you, the reader, if you came across
Virginia Woolf's ``It was not her one hated but the idea of her''?
No matter how strict your grammatical training, you have probably
read over thousands of ``wrong'' uses like this one without
noticing a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The moral for the ladies who lunched? This is Ruth and I is
correct; so is This is Ruth and me. When there's an is in the
middle, friends do let friends be nominative, even if they prefer
to be objective.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... me going.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swander runs the program with his wife, Laura, and they factored
some fun into our tight schedule. We visited Broughton Castle, a
short drive from Stratford. Lord and Lady Saye and Sele graciously
provided a tour of the castle, with tea afterward. While the
castle, which has been in the family since 1377, has been a regular
stop on the trip for several years, this year was particularly
interesting given that ``Shakespeare in Love'' was filmed there. If
you rent the video, watch for the scene when Gwyneth Paltrow is
dancing with Joseph Fiennes. That was filmed in the Great Hall,
where our group gathered among the armor. Fiennes, by the way, is a
cousin of the Saye and Seles.
</P>
<P>
   We did quite a bit of castle-hopping. We spent part of a day
exploring the turrets, torture chamber, and lovely grounds of
Warwick Castle, one of the most historically important castles in
England. Later, we saw the royal Windsor Castle, beautifully
restored after its devastating fire in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Those not in the Shakespeare School, which had classes, had
mornings free for sightseeing. I bought a pass (about $18.50) for
all five Shakespeare houses, including his birthplace and the Anne
Hathaway cottage, where his wife lived before they were married.
The town has several good walks: I did a 4-mile walk along the
locks of the Avon River and followed a guidebook ramble through
farms that had me climbing over stiles and crossing fields filled
with perturbed goats.
</P>
<P>
   With the bucolic part of the trip over, we then bused into
London, and settled for the next two weeks in two neighboring West
End hotels, the Marlborough and the Kenilworth. Swander has worked
with these hotels so often that we got good rates for quite nice
rooms, (about $135 for a double, or $120 for a single, including
breakfast).
</P>
<P>
   In this leg of the trip, we saw a range of plays in a variety of
settings, from the re-creation of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre to
the Art Deco Savoy Theatre to the large and modern Olivier Theatre.
The plays included: ``Candide'' (the Leonard Bernstein musical
about Voltaire's novel), ``Money'' (a surprisingly good but rarely
done play by Edward Bulwer-Lytton), Noel Coward's ``Hay Fever''
(with a manic and very funny Geraldine McEwan), ``The Weir'' (an
Irish play, voted Best Play of 1998), ``Copenhagen,'' (voted Best
Play of 1999), and our second production of ``Antony and
Cleopatra.'' This one, at the Globe, had an all-male cast, as it
would have had in Shakespeare's time.
</P>
<P>
   It took about 10 minutes to get over the idea that Cleopatra was
played by a man (Mark Rylance, the very talented artistic director
of the Globe, who also played Hamlet at the American Repertory
Theater in the 1991-'92 season). I thought his Cleopatra ran around
the stage too much and seemed more the impetuous girl, rather than
the woman ``of infinite variety'' that so besotted Antony, but it
was still a worthy production. And nothing beats seeing Shakespeare
performed in the Globe Theatre, with its thatched roof and milling
crowd of ``groundlings.''
</P>
<P>
   Swander still has the same shock of white hair and beret that he
had when I was a student, and is still incredibly busy. Before one
of the shows, I managed to pull him aside for a quick chat. We sat
along the south bank of the Thames, now a popular pedestrian
walkway, while a member of a street theater taped wires nearby in
preparation for that evening's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days,'' Swander said, ``I used to come three times
a year, see everything in London and Stratford, and talk to
extraordinary, talented people. What that did was shape my whole
career. I was learning from those directors and actors, not just
seeing them in theater but talking with them in classes. It
combined my teaching and research as a strange sort of
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thinks the relationships he has developed with the
actors are quite rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed that with all the Americans coming over to see
theater here, that no one had ever asked them to (speak to a group)
before,'' he said. This year, Michael Frayn, who wrote the popular
``Noises Off,'' came to talk to us about his new play,
``Copenhagen.'' Juliet Stevenson (who starred in the film ``Truly,
Madly, Deeply'') agreed to talk to us between the matinee and the
evening performances as Amanda in ``Private Lives,'' quite a
testament of her friendship with Theatre in England.
</P>
<P>
   In London, I also squeezed in some morning sightseeing. The
hotels were a half-block from the British Museum and a 20-minute
walk from the National Portrait Gallery. I steered clear of more
crowded tourist attractions, but did break down and tour Buckingham
Palace. The palace is mobbed (reserve a timed ticket ahead of time
and skip the lines) but worth seeing. One favorite among our tour,
especially the older folks, was the Cabinet War Rooms, the
underground command bunker from which Churchill ran England's war
effort during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   So would you think that after seeing 14 plays performed by some
of the best actors in the world we would choose to spend our last
night watching the Shakespeare School put on a rough production of
``Love's Labour's Lost?'' You betcha. After all we'd done together,
we'd become a big family, and we cheered for ``our'' students as if
they were the Royal Shakespeare Company.

'TWAS NOT YET THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this is Christmas: no wreaths on the doors, no stockings hung
by the chimney (with or without care), and no colorfully wrapped
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the way it was in 1830s New England. ``Sometimes I
feel like the Grinch,'' says Jack Larkin, research director at Old
Sturbridge Village, a re-created village museum from that era.
``Many of our visitors are looking for a New England Christmas with
all the trimmings _ but our historical research tells us it just
wasn't so for the vast majority of people in early rural towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of New England's founders, Larkin says, were English
Reformed Protestants (Puritans) who were determined to ``prune
away'' all observances not described in the Bible, which never
gives the date of Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on three Sundays in December, Old Sturbridge Village does
offer something seasonal: the quiet beauty of a winter village. At
``The Beginnings of a New England Christmas,'' from 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. on Dec. 5, 12, and 19, visitors can play 19th-century parlor
games, enjoy hearthside tales as well as music and dance, and
stroll the Center Village, which is lighted by candles at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   They'll learn more about the holiday's origins, too. ``The
village gossip will talk about the odd goings-on in places like New
York City, with St. Nicholas and stockings and presents,'' says
Larkin. ``And you can go into the Bullard Tavern and hear that
strange New York poem, `The Night Before Christmas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The tavern will also display New England's first Christmas tree.
Such trees, Larkin says, were a German custom whose New England
appearance was begun in 1832 by a German Unitarian professor at
Harvard. ``But it took a very long time _ 25 or 30 years _ until
families out in the countryside began to accept Christmas trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Another holiday event, Family Fun Days, will take place Dec.
26-31, and feature candle making, music, storytelling, and, if the
weather cooperates, sleigh or wagon rides.
</P>

Alaskan pelican sighted: Outdoor sculptures for two state office
buildings in Florida and Alaska were done by the same sculptor _
eagles for Alaska and pelicans for Florida. But they were delivered

CHOOSING CARS OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This being a time of lists in a dwindling century, it was with
lists in mind that automotive wags gathered this week at the Museum
of Transportation in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Their object: Greatest Cars of the Century.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'd already published my list (and gotten swamped with
reader mail), I was curious about what other auto journalists and
the museum itself would produce.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where the esoteric, the expensive, and the exotic
often get disproportionate attention, it was with delight that I
noted the wag-list started with the two very autos I would have
selected:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Ford Model T _ Its assembly-line manufacture (adapted but
not invented by Henry Ford) changed the way cars were built. And,
it was the car that put the nation on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Jeep _ Wartime, innovative America put on its can-do
face. Today, a cultural brick in our foundation: Where would the
SUV be had the Jeep never been built?
</P>
<P>
   At number three, I would add the VW Beetle, the Model T of its
day in some ways. A cultural icon, it was a shot fired across the
bow of big American iron and gas guzzlers.
</P>
<P>
   After these, of course, lines blur as you consider utility,
beauty, power, performance, and a range of other qualities. Thus,
the assembled panel offered the Baker Electric, the 1955
Thunderbird, the Shelby Mustang, Dusters and Barracudas, Chrysler
300s, the Jaguar XK Series, the Datsun Z, the rotary-engine Mazda,
the Mazda Miata, and then, like a bad dude on the cover of Time as
``Man of the Year,'' the Chevrolet Corvair. Not because it was so
good, but because of the innovations in watchdog safety its
existence brought about.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was out to tour the museum's display, which will be
there through November 2000. (In all there are 30 vehicles, with
about eight to be shown each month on a rotating basis.) It's a
collection of mostly loaned cars and wall placards that broke down
cars of the century into four categories: beauty, performance,
engineering, and impact on society. Among the institution's
choices:
</P>
<P>
   Beauty: 1953 Studebaker, 1961 Lincoln Continental, 1935 Packard
convertible, 1963 Buick Riviera, and 1937 Cord.
</P>
<P>
   Performance: The 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO; the Ford McLaren engine;
the 1963 Corvette.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering: the 1934 Chrysler Air Flow (one I stupidly missed
on my list), the 1916 Packard Twin-Six, the 1960 Oldsmobile
Toranado, and the 1995 GM EVI. I would add the hybrid
gasoline-electric autos due to hit showrooms next month, but some
colleagues argue I'll have to wait for the list I do at the end of
the next century for that.
</P>
<P>
   Impact on Society: The Model T, Jeep, VW Beetle, and 1957
Chevrolet Bel Air.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the trick with lists is that we gaze at them through
different automotive prisms, perspectives, and pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the list just published by duPont Registry, whose
readers and Web site visitors cast ballots. Remember, the magazine
duPont Registry is not known as a showroom for the hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you get as their car of the century: the
1990-present Lamborghini Diablo, built, the magazine informs us,
after Ferruccio Lamborghini, who started out building tractors,
told his pal Enzo Ferrari that he wanted to build the best sports
car. Stick to tractors and let me build sports cars, Ferrari
reportedly replied.
</P>
<P>
   At two, duPont gives us the 1995-98 McLaren F1, and at three
(curious, I think) the 1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, heavy on exotica and raw power (with the 63-67
Chevrolet Corvette tossed in at number six) until the even more
curious choice of the AM General Hummer rolls in at 16. I guess I
can see the 1964-68 Mustang at 20, but the Plymouth Prowler (I've
driven it, and it's neither hot rod nor sports car) at 22 is
bizarre. Not until number 43 do we get the 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air
and at 52, the Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, lists are composed through myriad points of
view, so it was interesting to read, in the same issue, the top 10
lists of a couple of car guys whose names you might recognize:
Andretti and Shelby.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Andretti starts us off with the Diablo, adds a Porsche 933
Turbo, a Ferrari 275 GTB/4, and then includes a 1957 Jaguar, the
1956 Chrysler 300 B, the Corvette C5 and, thankfully, the Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Filling fantasy parking spaces more to my liking was Carroll
Shelby (creator of number eight on the duPont list, the Shelby
Cobra) who went not to his own auto for his first pick, but to the
Model T.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that up with the 1932 Ford V8, the 1949 Cadillac,
1930s Duesenberg SJ, 1927-32 Mercedes Benz SSK, Willys Jeep, Ford
Mustang, Corvette, then his own Cobra, and the 1955 Mercedes-Benz
Gullwing.
</P>
<P>
   I like Shelby's lineup because with just 10 choices, he gives us
a list wonderful in its range, variety, utility, and impact.
</P>
<P>
   It is a list where auto wag meets museum meets enthusiast meets
culture. I love it because it is eclectic.
</P>
<P>
   But what would you expect from an auto writer whose own list
included the 1972 Toyota Landcruiser, the Henry J, the 1965 Dodge
Dart GT with the slant-six engine, and two John Deere tractors?

A THANKSGIVING SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Nov. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gathering of family and friends that connects people whose
lives are lived in different ways and places is a very special
American phenomenon. This ceremony is designed to heighten
awareness of the meaning of the Thanksgiving meal. It is designed
to spark contributions from all those at the table and encourage
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Host or hostess: I look around this table, delighted that we are
sharing this meal with one another. I'm thankful that you arranged
your schedule to make this gathering and that you braved clogged
traffic and packed airports in order to be here. You have been part
of the great American Thanksgiving Pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: Let us take a moment to collect our senses. ``We
come together . . . to remind one another to rest for a moment on
the forming edge of our lives, to resist the headlong tumble into
the next moment until we claim for ourselves awareness and
gratitude, taking the time to look into one another's faces and see
there communion: the reflection of our own eyes. This house of
laughter or silence, memory and hope together, is hallowed by our
presence.'' _ Unitarian minister Kathleen McTigue
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: We are blessed to have a tradition in America that
allows us to share a special meal. Let us note with gratitude how
lucky we are and take a moment to remember our loved ones who are
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: Thankfulness gives a lift to the heart. So we
gather together to acknowledge the miracle that puts food upon our
table and to recognize our debt to those whose labor has made our
feast possible. Let us go around the table and each express thanks
for something we deeply appreciate in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: Since early times, human beings have paused to
wonder at and praise the source of their food. In different times
and places, this Source was envisioned as a multitude of spirits
inhabiting the earth, as the earth itself, as a goddess, or as a
father. The Greeks and Romans gave thanks to Demeter, the goddess
of agriculture. The Anglo-Saxons celebrated the feast of the
Druids. To this day, Jews take part in an eight-day Feast of
Tabernacles called Sukkot. There are many Thanksgiving stories, for
there seems to be a universal human impulse to take joy in the
unmerited, undeserved generosity of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: The Pilgrims landed on the bleak shores of Plymouth
in 1620 and endured a winter of sickness and malnutrition.
Forty-seven of the 103 people aboard the Mayflower died. But the
native peoples already there from the Pemaquid and Wampanoag tribes
helped them survive by sharing corn with them and teaching them to
fish with nets. In the spring, they gave the visitors seed corn and
taught them how to cultivate it.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: When the harvest was plentiful, Governor Bradford
set aside a special time for celebration. The men hunted wild
turkeys, partridges, geese, ducks, and wood pigeons while the women
prepared Indian pudding and hoecakes and other dishes made from
cornmeal. Chief Massasoit, along with 90 Wampanoag, accepted the
Pilgrim's invitation to join them for a three-day feast, bringing
five deer with them.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: This is a verse from the Old Testament, which the
Pilgrims would have known: ``For the Lord your God is bringing you
into a good land, a land of flowing streams, with springs and
underground waters welling up in valleys and hills, a land of wheat
and barley . . . a land where you may eat bread without scarcity,
and where you will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and
from whose hills you may mine copper. You shall eat your fill and
bless the Lord your God for the good land he has given you.'' _
Deuteronomy 8:7-11
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: Two years later, a severe drought brought the
Pilgrims to their knees in prayer. The corn was dying, and rumor
had it that a ship bringing relatives and stores from England had
sunk en route. The colony declared a ``Day of Humiliation'' and the
Pilgrims spent a day in church examining their consciences and
seeking God's forgiveness. Rain fell that night. The Pilgrims
believed that their prayers had been answered and set aside a
second Day of Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: In those two years, however, many shiploads of
English people had created large stockaded settlements and pushed
the native people away from their homes along the shoreline. The
settlers in Jamestown had subjugated the natives, forcing them to
provide food and supplies for them. When the Powhatans?? rose up to
drive the foreigners off the land, they were no match for the
settlers' guns. Most died.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: The Jamestown Massacre and the conflict caused by
settlers in Weymouth hostile to the indigenous people reinforced
the Pilgrims' belief that the natives were dangerous savages, and
so the bond between the two communities was severed. There is still
much to learn from the Native Americans who inhabited this land
before the Pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: ``This we know. The earth does not belong to us, we
belong to the earth. This we know. All things are connected like
the blood that unites one family. All things are connected.
Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons and daughters of the
earth. We did not weave the web of life. We are merely a strand in
it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.'' _ Chief Noah
Sealth
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: President Lincoln issued the Thanksgiving
Proclamation in 1863. After the victory at Gettysburg, he hoped
that a day of Thanksgiving would unify our nation in contemplating
``the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies,'' and heal
the wounds of the nation so that it could be restored to ``the full
enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Next reader: The earth's abundant resources are limited. How
heavily we have made our imprint on the planet. Let us heed the
wisdom of those who preceded us, always thinking ahead seven
generations, for we Americans live in a time of unprecedented
affluence. For the first time in history, plentiful and affordable
foods from all over the world make their way to our tables with
little effort on our part. Let us acknowledge our good fortune by
reciting together this verse, called a gatha, so that we may focus
upon our feast with mindful intent:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   We take these changing forms of light

HOUSE'S QUIET SPEAKER FORGES A REIGN BY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The day he fell into the most powerful job on
Capitol Hill, J. Dennis Hastert confided to a junior Republican
colleague that as House speaker, he planned to govern from the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a TV guy,'' the former Illinois schoolteacher told
Representative J. D. Hayworth of Arizona in January. ``You be a TV
guy, and I'll be developing the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hastert team, it turns out, has turned tradition on its
head. Stymied in part by forces in his inner circle, Hastert
effectively created a speaker by committee. In the session of
Congress that ended Friday, Hastert yielded outsized influence to
his majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, and to a
coterie of lobbyists and advisers such as Bill Paxon, a former New
York congressman who participated regularly in Hastert's and
DeLay's separate strategy sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The development largely muted the highest-ranking Republican on
the national stage, and it compromised his authority as the GOP
clings to a five-vote majority in the House, in the run-up to the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, the House was steered in great measure by
DeLay, the ardently conservative, anti-Clinton whip, and by several
special interests with corporate agendas.
</P>
<P>
   And 10 months after Hastert vowed in his first speech as speaker
to lead the divided House from ``a pool of bitterness'' to a bold
course of legislative achievement, his promise remains largely
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a strong speaker, we've got a designated driver,''
said Representative J. Joseph Moakley, the South Boston Democrat
who has served under six speakers since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans acknowledged Hastert's diminished role, and
expressed hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his goal is to go down as the strongest speaker
in history,'' said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a New York
Republican. ``But hopefully he'll go down as the most effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are defending Hastert as the calming and
conciliatory leader they have needed since he inherited a House in
chaos and a fragile Republican majority in need of a gifted leader.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert unexpectedly emerged from the impeachment ordeal to win
the leadership post after Speaker Newt Gingrich and his designated
successor, former representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana,
were forced out under pressure and scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be a rocket scientist or a big personality, and I
may wish he would say or do things differently sometimes,'' said
Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican Conference. ``But the bottom line is, Denny has been a
very effective leader in a very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, who helped Gingrich lead the Republican revolution in
1993, played down his role in Hastert's and DeLay's inner circles.
Now a Washington power broker earning a reported $750,000 a year,
Paxon said he is doing nothing more than ``trying to retain and
expand the Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon said Hastert has enhanced DeLay's power to help unify the
fractious Republican ranks. ``Because of Denny and Tom, there has
been an almost complete absence of the kind of infighting,
backstabbing, bitterness, and rancor that went on when I was part
of the leadership,'' said Paxon, who left the House in January.
``That's a remarkable achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, Hastert's other accomplishments this year
have been scarce. Among triumphs, Republicans point to a proposed
$792 billion tax cut, which President Clinton vetoed, and to the
enactment of sweeping changes in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   The House also approved a plan to overhaul the nation's managed
care system, but only after 29 Republicans defied Hastert and voted
for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the vote, Hastert huddled in a private
fund-raising breakfast with insurance industry lobbyists, raising
questions about the industry's influence on the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert then almost assured the overhaul plan's death in a joint
conference committee with the Senate, by appointing 13 House
conferees, only one of whom voted for the measure. The legislation
had not been passed when Congress left town last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is that the speaker has given himself a black
eye,'' said Representative Greg Ganske of Iowa, the leading GOP
sponsor of the managed-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, John Feehery, said Hastert has tried mightily to
hold together the divergent GOP rank and file by practicing the
consensus-building that was common in the tenure of Speaker Thomas
P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr., the Cambridge Democrat who retired in 1987
and and died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Feehery said Hastert has been handicapped by his meager
majority. By contrast, O'Neill's Democratic Party enjoyed an
imposing 289-146 advantage in his first year as speaker in 1977.
``Denny's his own man,'' Feehery said, ``but he sure would love to
have Tip's majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big issues that died this year, but that could
figure prominently in the 2000 elections, are: proposals to tighten
gun controls, to raise the minimum wage, and to overhaul the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have said they plan to exploit those issues by
portraying Hastert as a custodian of Gingrich's hard-line, partisan
ideology. Recent polls have shown the public leaning toward
returning a Democratic majority to the House in 2000 after six
years of GOP control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny Hastert is like a used-car salesman,'' said
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, head of the
Democratic effort to take back the House. ``He smiles a lot, but
caveat emptor, because when you open up the hood you see he's just
putting a new face on the same old extremist politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said several moderate Republicans from the Northeast who
felt alienated during Gingrich's reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be called in at the last minute to be cajoled into
supporting the leadership position,'' said Boehlert, a leading GOP
advocate for stricter environmental protections. ``Now, we're not
always there on takeoff, but at least we're there in mid-flight so
we can have our say before landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Republicans said Hastert's inclusive approach has
been undermined by DeLay, who earned his nickname ``The Hammer''
with his hard-line approach to whipping GOP votes.
</P>
<P>
   It was DeLay's whip organization that guaranteed Hastert's
ascension to the speaker's post after Livingston admitted to having
committed adultery, and then abruptly stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, DeLay has not shied from flexing his political
muscle, even to Hastert's detriment. In June, DeLay mobilized his
whip unit to kill gun-control legislation that Hastert backed. And
in the most serious affront to Hastert's authority, DeLay
successfully lobbied Republican lawmakers in April to defeat a
resolution supporting the NATO air war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around here are wondering if Tom DeLay is
really the speaker,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay's chief deputy, Representative Roy D. Blunt of
Missouri, said there is no need to wonder. ``No one has worked
harder to accomplish our agenda this year than Tom DeLay,'' Blunt
said, ``but the last thing he wants is getting misunderstood about
who is running the House. It's the speaker.''

A SPLENDID EXAMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Any doubts that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wants a speedy
resolution of the Microsoft case should have been put to rest when
the Washington judge last Friday unexpectedly named noted Chicago
jurist Richard Posner to act as mediator.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time Jackson, a US district court judge, has
turned to a University of Chicago professor in an effort to speed
the case.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked law professor Lawrence Lessig to serve as special
master, Microsoft mounted a withering challenge to Lessig's
impartiality, citing jokes it had discovered after the company
subpoenaed his e-mail. Lessig, who was in the process of moving to
Harvard from Chicago, eventually was excluded from the case. The
episode was often cited as evidence of Microsoft's bullying
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft won't try that with Judge Posner. For one thing, he's
too senior. A lawyer-economist, chief judge of the US Court of
Appeals in Chicago, he is among nation's most distinguished legal
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Posner is known to be conservative on antitust
matters, every inch a Chicago-school price theorist. Indeed, his
appointment is being interpreted in some circles as a signal from
Jackson to antitrust division lawyers not to let their remedy hopes
become too optimistic. In 1976, for instance, he wrote, ``Economic
analysis suggests . . . that even where oligopolists or monopolists
are charging monopoly prices, dismemberment of the firms may be an
uneconomic remedy. The process of remaking one firm into two or
more firms takes a long time and costs a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more relevant for understanding the role he is about to
play, perhaps, is Posner's most recent book, ``An Affair of State:
The Investigation, Impeachment and trial of President Clinton,''
published this fall by Harvard University Press. It is a document
of uncommon daring: an attempt by a uniquely qualified, highly
principled observer to commit journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Posner works hard to achieve a balanced presentation of the
case. There are two diametrically opposite narratives to choose
between, he writes. ``In one, a reckless, immoral president commits
a series of crimes in order to conceal a tawdry and shameful
affair, crimes compounded by a campaign of public lying and
slanders. A prosecutor could easily draw up a thirty-count
indictment against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the other narrative, the confluence of a stupid law (the
independent counsel law), a marginal lawsuit (the Jones suit)
begotten and nursed by political partisanship, a naive and impudent
judicial decision by the Supreme Court in that suit, and the
irresistable human impulse to conceal one's sexual improprities,
allows a trivial sexual escapade (what Clinton and Lewinsky called
`fooling around' or `messing around') to balloon into a grotesque
and gratuitous consitutional drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that both narratives are correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Posner is too good a jurist not to resolve this ``Clinton
dilemma'' in his own mind. (When someone once asked Seiji Ozawa how
he would choose between a man and a woman competing for the same
position, he said he would prefer the better musician. But supposed
they were equally good? Which one would he choose then? The better
musician, he insisted.) So Posner comes down firmly against Clinton
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   He attaches little significance to the development that began
the affair: the decision by David Sentelle, his counterpart chief
judge in the Washington Appellate Court, to fire special prosecutor
Robert Fiske in favor of Kenneth Starr. He places the blame for
what eventuated on Bill Clinton's shoulders alone: ``By forcing
these (pluralistic) attitudes (towards sex) into articulate
competition, Clinton precipitated the rancorous Kulturkampf'' at
the heart of the impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Make of it what you will. But Posner's book displays a versatile
and demanding intelligence at work on the most important political
story of the decade. His entry into the Microsoft matter even in a
private capacity is a most welcome development.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jackson invited the two sides to choose an
expert to write another summary brief. He then commissioned a third
brief from a disinterested ``friend of the court'' _ none other
than Lawrence Lessig of Harvard. The nation's leading intellects
are now involved in bringing the Microsoft case to a speedy and
well-ventilated conclusion.

<P>
   The next time you have trouble with someone at work, think of
yourself as the hero in a mystery novel: Look past the red
herrings, carefully consider people's motives and, most of all,
take the time to examine the clues you already have.

<P>
   Once you pull out your magnifying glass, most problems are not
as mysterious as they appear. Get into the habit of following these
steps and soon you will be solving workplace mysteries:

points out in her recently released book, ``How To Work With Just
About Anyone,'' you almost always can find one problem or action
that is clearly the most significant obstacle in a working
relationship. If you get rid of it, related problems may vanish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for a motive. The best generic workplace skill is the
ability to see things from other people's perspectives. You have it
much easier than fictional detectives because you already know
whodunit. What you have to figure out is why it is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your employee constantly misses deadlines or turns in
everything at the last minute. You have talked to him about it,
maybe even put it in a performance evaluation, but the problem
continues _ and he is too useful to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it from his perspective. Certainly he doesn't like a
negative evaluation, but obviously there are strong reasons to keep
delaying. What are they?
</P>
<P>
   Do you inadvertently reward deadline-pushers? If someone turns
in a project two weeks early, does she get grunt work heaped upon
her? Because you have that two-week cushion, do her projects get
nitpicked a lot more than his do? If you were the employee, would
you welcome the extra scrutiny or resent it?
</P>
<P>
   Do you find yourself cleaning up the mistakes made by a
subordinate, a colleague or even a boss? Some of that happens in
any job, but if you are doing an excessive amount of it, you are an
enabler. If you are always cleaning up after a colleague's mistakes
and the boss doesn't know about it, your colleague is not facing
any consequences for sloppy work.
</P>
<P>
   You may feel like a victim, but your colleague and boss might
not even know that a crime has been committed.
</P>
<P>
   When companies have layoffs, those who remain can end up playing
a workplace game of chicken. If everybody works like mad so that
the same work gets done with fewer people, management will get its
financial reward from the layoffs without any consequences.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the remaining employees balk at their
increasing workload and threaten to quit, management will realize
that consequences exist. If you're a balking employee, taking such
a stand could force managers to trim the workload or rehire some of
the laid off workers _ or, of course, fire you.
</P>
<P>
   If you understand how your managers think, you can probably
figure out which option the will choose. Otherwise, you will just
be clueless.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't swallow any red herrings.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to say that the boss is a jerk or that management is
biased or that your colleague just doesn't care. Maybe you even
tried talking with that troubled soul, but he just didn't get it,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Resist the urge to just throw up your hands at the stupidity and
unfairness of it all, secure in the knowledge that it is not easy
being as wonderful as you are.
</P>
<P>
   If you are blaming the crime on a psychopath, chances are you
are copping out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do your legwork.
</P>
<P>
   Networking can ensure that you have the full story. If you are
having problems with your boss, maybe a former boss can give you
some insight. Maybe you can go to lunch with colleagues who do get
along with the boss and find out what they are doing that you are
not doing.
</P>
<P>
   Your mystery may even have a twist. Maybe you will learn that
the real villain isn't your boss, but your boss' boss.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that want to operate more efficiently, a simple
survey might help workers and bosses understand each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for what triggered it.
</P>
<P>
   Even psychopaths usually have some event that triggers their
action, and just about everybody has had problems at work because
of problems at home, or vice versa. Think back to when the problem
began, and whether you contributed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Gill and Randy Gibbs, author of ``20/20 Insight: 6 Keys to
Seeing and Changing the Hidden Patterns That Control Our Lives and
Limit Our Effectiveness,'' refer in their books to how two
otherwise talented people can get involved in a ``dance'' that
turns into a downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you are a talented worker who prizes independence, and
your new boss likes to look over your shoulder. You resent it, so
you share even less information. The boss resents that, and starts
looking over your shoulder even more. That makes you resent it even
more ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes you can end it with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   As Gill points out, people often are mistaken when they think
they have tried everything to solve a conflict. For example,
explaining a problem to an employee, yelling at him about the
problem in front of others and giving him a negative review are all
really just different versions of the same solution.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Gill gives an example of how a woman dealt with a
male colleague who constantly criticized everyone's ideas at
meetings. The woman had tried several ways to persuade him to stop,
but they were all variations of the same solution.
</P>
<P>
   So she finally said at the beginning of a meeting that the man
should be the group's official critic, encouraging him to offer
criticism as each item came up. When he was quiet for a few
minutes, she made a point of asking him what was wrong with a
particular idea.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually learned to offer more constructive ideas, and the
other members of the team learned not to be so discouraged by his
negativity.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery had been solved, thanks to her novel approach.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As a veteran of Wang Laboratories, the famously tormented Bay
State computer firm, William Ferry knew corporate turmoil when he
saw it. And he saw plenty back in early 1997 when he took on the
job of rebuilding Banyan Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Westborough, Mass. software company's sales had fallen 20
percent in the year just ended, contributing to a $27 million loss.
Banyan's stock price hovered around $4 a share. And yet Ferry found
a work force that still clung to its proud history as innovators in
networking software, unprepared to admit that their only hope for
survival was radical change. ``When I arrived, probably one of the
first challenges I had to face was that people weren't seeing it
that way,'' said Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years later, Ferry's got his colleagues seeing
things his way. The result is a company that's turned a profit in
six of the last eight quarters, with a stock that's more than
tripled in value. But Banyan is also a company that bears little
resemblance to the firm that once made its fortune in software.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most of Banyan's revenues come from a rapidly growing
business that provides computer services to Fortune 1000 companies.
And the firm expects big things from its Switchboard Inc. Internet
business unit. In June, Banyan gave CBS Corp. a 35 percent stake in
Switchboard, in exchange for $135 million in promotion on CBS's
television and radio networks. And early this month, Banyan filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public
offering of Switchboard stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Ferry has doen a sensational job in rescuing a company
that was probably on the way to financial failure,'' says Irwin
Silverberg, a senior managing director at New York's Burnham
Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1983, Banyan built a global reputation in personal
computer operating systems that solved a problem that had been
neglected by industry leader Microsoft Corp. The early Microsoft
operating system MS-DOS wasn't much use for companies that wanted
to link small computers into corporate networks. Into the breach
stepped Banyan with its VINES network operating system. The company
also developed StreetTalk, a directory system that made it easy to
keep track of the various information resources scattered across a
large computer network. VINES and StreetTalk made Banyan software a
fixture in many Fortune 1000 firms, and government agencies like
the US Marine Corps. Banyan also sought a foothold in the corporate
messaging market with its BeyondMail electronic mail products.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, disaster loomed, as Microsoft finally
began to address the networking market with its Windows NT
operating system. Many would-be VINES and StreetTalk users were
also drawn off to Novell Inc.'s NetWare offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies 10 to 100 times our size had targeted our space,''
said Ferry. But just as his previous employer, Wang Labs, had been
slow to face the menace posed by cheap personal computers, Banyan's
people strove to hang onto a dwindling slice of the network
software market.
</P>
<P>
   Not Ferry. He concluded that Banyan's original market was
destined to be devoured by his larger rivals. It was time to ask a
painful question: ``If our products have a limited life, what else
can we do?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Banyan could do was provide computer service and
support to big corporate customers. Why not start providing that
support for other firms' products as well as their own? Indeed,
Ferry took the idea a step further. He reached out to James
Allchin, the chief architect of VINES who'd moved on to Microsoft
as a senior vice president. ``They clearly had won,'' said Ferry.
``We could help them and they could help us as we transitioned our
business...We have relationships with half of the Fortune 1000.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Banyan went from being a Microsoft victim to a
Microsoft partner. In January, Banyan became a Microsoft enterprise
partner, one of 15 companies that help deploy Microsoft products in
large corporations. Microsoft financed Banyan's program to train
500 workers as certified Microsoft engineers and software
developers. Now these Banyan workers will target their company's
existing base of VINES, StreetTalk and BeyondMail users, helping
them transition to Microsoft products instead. ``We will be
providing them with the tools and services to help them migrate,''
said Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   (Allchin declined to be interviewed for this story. A Microsoft
spokesperson said that the company does not discuss its
relationships with business partners.)
</P>
<P>
   Ferry said that some Banyan workers weren't too thrilled about
climbing into bed with their erstwhile rival. ``It took time for
people to understand why it was a good thing,'' he said. ``Some of
the people who couldn't accept that, left.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Banyan has lost in independence, it's made up in
growth. Revenues in its services business were $30.1 million in the
first three quarters of 1999, up 75 percent from $17.2 million in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard is a much smaller part of the Banyan comeback story,
but it may have the most potential, given the booming market
valuations of Internet properties. Work on Switchboard had begun
before Ferry arrived. A group of Banyan developers recognized the
value of being able to find addresses and phone numbers through the
Internet. And they had a major part of the solution -- StreetTalk,
Banyan's proven software for building directories.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1996, they unveiled Switchboard, a sort of on-line white
pages that contained address and phone number information for
millions of individuals and businesses. ``We believe that was the
first on-line directory,'' said Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Switchboard was popular enough, but it never got the visibility
of other major Web sites like Yahoo. The deal with CBS is aimed at
changing that. CBS avoids a major cash or stock investment; it
simply promotes Switchboard on its TV shows and slaps its logo onto
the site. It costs CBS very little, but it means a much higher
profile for Switchboard, and perhaps a higher share price when the
firm goes public. In addition, CBS' ad sales force will peddle
on-line advertising at the Switchboard site, which should bring in
a few more dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it's a bit of a come-down for a firm that once made
world-class computer operating systems. The new Banyan is now
gambling on the continued growth of dot-com businesses like
Switchboard at a time when internet skepticism is on the increase.
And the company makes most of its money as a courtier at the
service of Microsoft, the foe that vanquished VINES.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a better fate than that of Ferry's previous
employer, Wang, now absorbed by the Dutch firm Getronics. Banyan
survives as an independent company with good prospects for future
growth. ``It has made a comeback,'' said Burnham Securities'
Silverberg. ``Now the question is, how high is up?''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Sometimes, in the quiet and the dark
between bedtime story and goodnight kiss, 8-year-old Justin Gero
tells his mother he wishes both his parents still lived together.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene replayed in home after home in an era of divorce.
But in Justin's case, the yearning is for an intact family headed
by his biological mother, Bernice Gero, and his ``other'' mother,
Marilyn Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   As surely as some heterosexual couples tell their children that
Mommy and Daddy won't be living together anymore, the sad sequel to
the so-called ``gayby boom'' of recent years is that there are
children of gay couples who hear similar words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful if we were raising him together, but the
way our relationship was going we were starting to not like each
other,'' says Gero, 38. ``My heart sinks whenever he asks. It's not
the way it was planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin's lament underscores the emotions attendant to any family
rupture, whatever the adults' sexual orientation. A Supreme
Judicial Court decision in June granting visitation to a lesbian de
facto mother highlights the profound differences. Not only do
families like Justin's experience the anger and heartbreak and
logistical headaches that accompany divorce, they also wrestle with
social stigma and, in many cases, the psychological fallout of
great imbalances in legal power.
</P>
<P>
   If family breakup is a drama played by people at their weakest
and most volatile, then the action here comes laden with
complicating subplots. The SJC ruling, upheld last week when the US
Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, rewrites the script to
elevate a partner who did not bear or adopt the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the similarities with heterosexual families are
fairly straightforward. There's great grief, a fair feeling of
displacement,'' says social worker Suzanne Slater. ``There's also
more ambiguity about how these two separated families are going to
be firmly established and reliable. Everyone involved, especially
the children, experiences more insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   If any ``other'' mother had reason to feel secure after
separating from her partner, it should have been Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the September day in 1995 when she and Gero sat on
the living room sofa to tell Justin that ``Mare'' (a play on her
name and the French word for mother) was moving out, Justin has
visited her regularly. She calls him each night he's not with her.
She and Gero visit his teachers. She knows Gero wants to avoid the
emotional carnage she witnesses in her work as a guardian ad litem
who advises courts on the well-being of the children of
heterosexual divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for almost two years after the separation, Hurley was
frightened she would lose Justin altogether. The reason? Justin was
born before Massachusetts, in 1993, became the second of five
states to permit gay coparent adoptions statewide. Until this
year's SJC ruling on de facto parents, Hurley had no status in
Justin's life other than that bestowed by Gero's good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I was very scared,'' says Hurley, 47, an
administrator in a human services agency. ``She said, `I would
never do that to Justin or to you.' But I had no legal standing. It
brought a few scary moments. Tread lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Gero sold the house they'd shared in Ludlow in
1997 and moved here, where Hurley lives with her mother, and
enrolled Justin in kindergarten that Hurley relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy, but we've worked very hard,'' says Gero, 38.
``Mare will take him to MacDonald's and give him chocolate. He'll
watch TV and play Game Boy. She's a different parent than I am.
It's a challenge to let some of this stuff go. But in my work I see
people who would argue over the color of the sky. It makes me
realize how well we do and how much she does for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The women are strangers, one a county employee in Northampton,
in western Massachusetts, the other a social worker in Newton, near
Boston. What they share are mantles adorned with outdated school
photographs, in Northampton of twin girls, now in second grade,
when they were in kindergarten; in Newton of a boy, now in fifth
grade, when he was in third.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hurley, the women are lesbians estranged from the
biological mothers of children whose births they attended and whom
they'd planned to help raise. The difference is that their
ex-partners wielded their power to deny visitation. While Hurley
helps coach Justin's soccer team, they cling to old pictures of
children they have not seen for 23 months and 15 months
respectively. ``What does that teach a child?'' asks the Newton
woman. ``That conflict results in loss? That conflict means
abandonment?''
</P>
<P>
   Now the SJC gives both women hope, not assurance, that they'll
see the children. They agreed to speak only if their names are not
used.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, barely a week after the SJC ruling, the Northampton
woman became one of the first plaintiffs in what her attorney,
Karen Jackson, calls the ``repair period'' following the SJC
action. She filed a complaint in probate court against her
ex-partner, Suzanne Brow, seeking visitation with the girls she's
not lived with since 1993 and not seen since December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pictures in every room of my house. Not a day passes
that I don't think about them,'' she says. ``Before that case,
there was nothing you could do as a nonbiological parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Her complaint comes five years after she went to court seeking
visitation when Brow was about to move to New Mexico. She didn't
prevail then, but Brow stayed in the area and allowed her to see
the children. Now thei fills court files with as much ``she
said/she said'' as the ``he said/she said'' of divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, says the plaintiff, I am a de facto parent as defined by
the SJC. We shared child-rearing. She named me coguardian. When I
had visitation, I took them to dance class and church and read to
them. I helped them financially. I took them on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   No, counters Brow, she is not a de facto parent. She did not
``perform a share of caretaking functions . . . at least as great''
as mine. She was inconsistent in paying child support. There is no
written agreement. She's also not a suitable parent, a charge Brow
does not elaborate in an interview or in papers in the current
case. But in 1994, she accused her ex-partner of ``angry,
irrational behavior,'' which her former partner denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought these children into the world from my body. It's my
job to make sure they're safe. I'm the only one here for them and
that's what I had to do,'' says Brow, 38, who supports her family
on welfare while she attends community college. ``I know she does
love them. Just because someone loves you doesn't mean they always
make the right choices when it comes to children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How anybody,'' says Brow's former partner, ``can keep someone
away from children they love I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Brow if her former partner abused the children, and she
shakes her head. No. In that answer, says psychologist Patricia
Papernow, lies what had been a major difference between divorce and
the separation of homosexual couples. ``There's more to protect the
disenfranchised parent in a heterosexual couple,'' Papernow says.
``You have to have big-time abuse before you can deny visitation.
Why should it be different in gay couples?''
</P>
<P>
   That is what judges must now decide in some cases in which
plaintiffs may not have seen the children for years. Last week,
says Brow, a court-appointed guardian ad litem advised against
visitation because the girls seem well adjusted and no longer
consider the former partner to be family. Whatever the finding,
Jackson says her client ``is absolutely focused on reuniting with
her children and we're going full speed ahead.''

 PAPER-MONEY TOWN UNHAPPY ABOUT $1 COIN
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   DALTON, Mass. _ Between now and March 1, when a new $1 coin goes
into circulation, the US Mint will be hard at work trying to
convince Americans that they need it. Television advertisements,
Cheerios boxes, and even a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
parade will sing praises of the gold-colored Sacagawea dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But they should not waste their effort on Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't want it in my register,'' said Ruth Trapnell,
60, from the gift shop where she deals in scented candles, novelty
beer steins, and T-shirts that say ``The Buck Starts Here.'' Here,
in the town that produces all of the paper for US currency, people
are only too aware of what most Americans never consider: that
money is itself big business.
</P>
<P>
   On the day when the first Sacagawea coin turns up in a box of
Cheerios, many in Dalton will be less than delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though if this coin is made, you're stealing jobs
from people here,'' said Trapnell. ``You've got to figure this is
what's keeping this town alive, and we're not going to let go of it
without a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its multimillion-dollar launch of the coin, which
honors a Native American woman who assisted the Lewis and Clark
expedition, the mint has maintained that the coin is not intended
to squeeze a single banknote out of circulation. But as other
countries, such as Australia, Canada and Germany, have swapped
their smallest notes for coins, they've all withdrawn the paper
equivalent, and many experts hold that the coin's success depends
on it. The battle between advocates of the coin and defenders of
the banknote has been heating up for a decade, fueled by lobbies on
both sides. Backing the coin are copper mining interests, mass
transit authorities, and coin-operated industries. Defending the
banknote are the printers' union, the ink and paper industry, and
manufacturers of dollar bill validators.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance onto the scene of the papoose-toting Sacagawea
brings the conflict into a new stage. While the coin is not the
death blow that papermakers feared in 1995, when several
congressmen were pushing to eliminate the banknote, neither is the
Sacagawea coin doomed to failure like its predecessor, the Susan B.
Anthony dollar. Unlike the Anthony dollar, the Sacagawea dollar
could never be mistaken for a quarter, because of its gold color
and an edge that is wide and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The US Mint has thrown itself into the task of making sure the
Sacagawea dollar succeeds _ partly through a glossy marketing
campaign, and partly with a plan to inject it into the circulation
at cash registers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   And although coin advocates were disappointed not to win an
outright elimination of the banknote, they also maintain that
history is on their side. As a note's real value falls, governments
often replace it with coins, which last 10 times as long. James
Benfield, a lobbyist with the Coin Coalition in Washington for 12
years, said he's willing to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very much a chess game,'' Benfield said. ``And I
played a lot of chess in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Government Accounting Office last reviewed the choice
between dollar bills and coins, in 1991, it concluded that, for a
dollar coin to work, the dollar bill would have to be eliminated,
said Steve Bobbitt, a spokesman for the American Numismatic
Association. His organization ``recognizes the impossibility of
both coexisting successfully for long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mint director Philip Diehl countered that ``the skeptics are
wrong that the dollar bill and the coin cannot co-circulate, and we
are about to prove them wrong.'' With a comparatively minuscule
first-year circulation of around 120 million coins _ a very small
percentage of the dollar bills in circulation _ the coin poses no
threat to the dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to look back at the failure of the Susan B.
Anthony dollar, which Diehl called ``the Edsel of American
coinage.'' In 1979 and 1980, the mint produced 900 million Susan B.
Anthony dollars, assuming they would become ``coin of the realm,''
said mint spokesman Mike White. Those coins didn't run out until
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the mint's position is that the Anthony dollar failed
because it wasn't promoted properly. The government isn't usually
in the business of selling its services. ``When you think of it,
defense isn't a product,'' said Stan Collender, senior vice
president of the Washington-based public relations firm Fleishman
Hillard, which won the contract to handle the Sacagawea's
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   This assignment was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we realized that the US Mint was looking
at this as a consumer product launch, not unlike when a company
launches a new car,'' said Collender. He added, ``This is a fairly
unique situation in the sense that there is a competing, or let's
say an alternative'' product.
</P>
<P>
   Another mistake the mint made with the Anthony dollar was what
Diehl called the ``chicken-and-egg problem'' _ namely, that people
will not start using a coin unless they receive it as change. So
the mint has tentative agreements with ``two household-name
retailers'' to give customers Sacagawea dollars as change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure worries Lansing Crane, 54, who left his law practice
four years ago to run the 120-year-old family business, Crane &AMP; Co.
Crane, the sixth generation of his family to make paper for
dollars, is tall and craggy; he looks like a man who could stand
behind a currency. Although the company retains a lobbyist on
Capitol Hill, at an annual cost he described as ``under $200,000,''
in times of crisis he prefers to travel to Washington and argue his
own case. There's a lot at stake for Dalton, where US currency
paper makes up a third of Crane &AMP; Co.'s business, and $1 bills
nearly half of that. Crane's last four-year contract with the
government, won in February, was worth $260 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing Crane said the mint's marketing campaign constitutes an
unfair advantage that, in the private sector, might break antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what the government's doing here. It's a classic case
of pushing a product on the public,'' Crane said. ``You sort of
scratch your head and say, why would anyone spend all this money
ramping up a program whose ultimate objective is eliminating the
dollar note?''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, deep in Norman Rockwell country, has already made its
decision. Ask directions to the Crane plant on Main Street and
people will point in all directions _ the town, population 7,000,
has six Crane &AMP; Co. mills. Among the institutions bearing the name
Crane are a school, a nursing home, and a community center complete
with sauna and indoor pool. There are families in Dalton who have
worked at the mill for three generations, lining up creamy rolls of
linen-and-cotton paper. Lately, the larger bills have been
redesigned to include more security features, but the sheets for $1
bills, their main product, have not been updated.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Main Street storefronts, the consensus is that there
is more to the gold-colored coin than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so bizarre. How many multibillions are we
spending just to redo what we did before?'' said Stan Walczyk,
owner of O'Laughlin's Pharmacy on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar bill is so much easier,'' said Charlie Wellspeak, 69.
``You can fold it up if you want. It doesn't make a lot of noise.''

CELEBRITIES CAUGHT UP IN NET PROFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Nov. 25 or thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not about trashing celebrities. It's about celebrity
trash _ as in Gary Coleman's bowling shoes and Drew Barrymore's
baby clothes, the sort of stuff that mere humans usually cart off
to the thrift shop or consign to sleep with the mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   These and other sundries are available for auction on the Web,
part of the latest ``dot com'' craze. Haunted by debts and/or
parole officers, onetime celebrities (or, in some cases, their
mothers) are flocking to the Internet to raise money or to
resurrect flagging careers. Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, fresh
from her stay in a West Coast penitentiary, is selling it on line;
this time around, though, she's peddling sportswear and autographed
photos. Monica Lewinsky has an on-line boutique, and Drew
Barrymore's mother, Jaid Barrymore, is auctioning off her estranged
daughter's clothing and other items at www.gavelnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman, whose claim to fame was his role in the '78-85
sitcom ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' is probably the only former child
star to be the centerpiece of his very own Web-a-thon, a new
concept in self-promotion. The site is the brainchild of UGO
Networks, a New York-based Web company that runs sites geared at
18- to 34-year-old males. UGO Staffers read about Coleman's
financial woes and decided to raise money for the actor on line.
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman site, at http://webathon.ugo.com, is a sort of mock
tribute to the 4-foot-8-inch actor. A timeline details his trials
and tribulations, including his lawsuit against his parents, his
recent arrest for an altercation with a fan, and his declaration of
bankruptcy in August.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who was once worth $18 million, smiles cheerfully on
the site, imploring visitors to ``Save me.'' Folks can either
donate money to help the financially strapped actor or bid on his
leather couch (current bid, $307.50), his bowling ball ($86), and
his ice scraper (a steal at $25.50). The site features ``Gary
Grooves,'' a variation on the Dancing Baby, and offers a contest in
which users can win a $1,000 shopping spree with ``Gary as your
shopping elf.'' There are also ``audition tapes'' and recordings of
Coleman allegedly practicing phone sex in an earlier career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's all scripted,'' a breathless Coleman said, during a
cell-phone conversation as he boarded a plane in New York. ``Don't
take any of that seriously. Jesus, what has happened to people's
funny bones these days?''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that turns Coleman into a virtual pet, users can feed,
punish, or heal the troubled star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the site is absolutely wonderful,'' Coleman said.
``It's going to be nice to make money, but I am also interested in
breaking into the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Robinson, chairman of UGO Networks, insists that Coleman
will receive every single penny raised on the site. ``It's not a
moneymaking venture. It's not a scam,'' Robinson said. ``Gary has
been working in a video store, and this is getting him some
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also garnering publicity for UGO Networks, Robinson admits.
``It's good for everyone,'' he said. ``It's not as if we're doing
this for Donald Trump.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's an idea: If the trend continues, it's only a matter
of time before one or more of the Donald's exes start auctioning
off his stuff on line. Barrymore's mother, after all, doesn't have
any problem selling off her daughter's stuff, including the red
cowboy hat that Drew, then 6, wore in ``E.T.'' The bidding on the
hat hit $49,500 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Why sell this stuff? ``Drew is such a special, amazing person,''
Jaid Barrymore told the Associated Press. ``I decided to put some
of her things up on the Web to allow people to be part of Drew's
life.'' How sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Web users can also be a part of the lives of other former
celebrities who have turned to the Net. In a way, Fleiss and
Lewinsky are selling the same thing _ products made under duress.
At www.heidifleiss.com, the former madam is auctioning mugs she
made in prison to calm her nerves because ``the day-to-day
lifestyle was so stressful and hectic.'' The former intern is
selling hand-knit purses and totes at www.therealmonica.com:
Learning to knit, she says on the site, was a big ``help in getting
through a time of high anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, apparently, didn't take up a craft to relieve
stress. But that hasn't stopped her from starting a Web site to
raise money for her legal defense fund. She's shamelessly
soliciting donations at www.lindatripp.com.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coleman is turning himself into an on-line poster
child. ``It's not demeaning,'' says Robinson. ``He's poking fun of
the media. Look at what he's done. He's got the whole nation
watching now, so who is winning? Who is poking fun of whom?''

GIFT BOOKS THAT GET TO THE HEART OF TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texans and fans of Western history and culture will enjoy the
following handsome volumes filled with great illustrations and
text. One of them might be just the answer to your holiday shopping
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maps of Texas and the Southwest, 1513-1900,'' by James C.
Martin and Robert Sidney Martin (Texas State Historical
Association, $39.95).
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in cartography will be entranced by this new
edition of a 1981 volume. With 16 color and 50 black-and-white
plates representing the most historically significant maps of the
region from 1513 to 1900, the book is both a thing of beauty and an
important contribution to the historical record of Texas and the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally hand-colored, these maps remain testimony to what
was known about the region at the time of their creation. Essays on
the science and history of map making, the printing process, the
American map trade and the significant territorial explorations and
conquests represented by the maps make this a well-balanced volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Plains,'' by Peter Brown (W.W. Norton, $39.99).
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, Houston photojournalist Peter Brown takes
eloquent exception to those Americans who think, according to
Kathleen Norris in her introduction to his survey, that ``the
Plains are an unknown region, except for an occasional (and by now,
stereotypical) glimpse of an abandoned windmill or derelict
homestead that does little to dispel the perception that much of
inner America is a sere and barren wilderness, better left
unseen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown takes the reader on a visual tour through segments of the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Montana, Colorado,
Texas and New Mexico _ in his words, ``from open country to a small
town, through this town, on to a larger one, and then out again
into open space and sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Serialized in the Texas Monthly magazine, this eye-pleasing
volume represents a decade and a half of photographic research for
Brown and will give the reader plenty to ponder about our sometimes
harsh, sometimes beautiful terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Cattle Barons: Their Families, Land and Legacy,'' essays
by Elmer Kelton, photography by Kathleen Jo Ryan (10 Speed Press,
$49.95 hardback).
</P>
<P>
   When actor Tommy Lee Jones writes the foreword of a book, you
can be sure it will be short and sweet. As a rancher himself, Jones
understands ``the problems, pleasures and privileges of range land
stewardship as the millennium approaches,'' and for that reason he
endorses the value of this handsome volume.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Jo Ryan set out to interview a variety of ranchers
during a tough year, 1998, when the smoke from fires in Mexico
affected Texas and the harsh drought was followed by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Essays by Western novelist Elmer Kelton add greatly to the
book's depth, illustrating that in most cases, ranching is a way of
life as well as a business, passed on from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Rancher James McAllen discusses the changing life: ``A lot of
the art has been taken out of what cowboys do. Today I can pick up
a catalog, order what I need, and it will be delivered the next day
by 10 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The large-format volume is perfect for showcasing photos of
ranching families at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in the Heart of Texas: Texas Ranchers in Their Own
Words,'' photographed and produced by Kathleen Jo Ryan (10 Speed
Press, $24.95 paperback).

   The book jacket photo and biography on Kathleen Jo Ryan tell the
reader she lives on an island northwest of Seattle, but she
certainly looks like a real cowgirl and seems to know intimately
the world of ranching and cowboying.
</P>
<P>
   She spent several months traveling around Texas, photographing
and interviewing 13 of the state's largest cattle ranchers. A
companion volume to ``Texas Cattle Barons,'' Ryan's book takes a
serious look at what we lose when ranches fall prey to those
interested in water rights and overdevelopment: ``If ranchers are
displaced, we unravel the heart of the American West _
environmentally, economically and culturally.''

   WASHINGTON _ A week rarely goes by without Senator Connie Mack
telling some group about the disease that cut through his family.
His mother beat breast cancer but died of kidney cancer. Cancer of
the esophagus took his father. Mack, his wife, and his daughter
have all survived different forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Mack has dedicated his political career to his
brother, Michael, whose final month became a long conversation
about the purpose of life. The talks prompted Mack to run for
Congress, where he has recounted his brother's death from cancer at
age 35 countless times in a crusade for more medical research
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a Florida Republican, and many other lawmakers have
increasingly cited personal experiences with disease in pushing for
new health policies. When Congress approved another record budget
increase for medical research last week, the third in a row,
advocates said one major reason was that several key lawmakers had
seen the effect of disease on their own families.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the National Institutes of Health will jump more
than 14 percent this year, far ahead of the estimated 5 percent
raise in total discretionary spending. Following a 14.6 percent NIH
raise last year, the boost will mean millions of additional dollars
for labs in New England hospitals and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Research budgets are only one area where lawmakers cite their
own health histories in crafting policy. Senator Jesse Helms, a
North Carolina Republican, usually opposes any bill that tells
private companies how to conduct business. But he has teamed with
Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy on a bill to require health
insurers to pay for colon cancer screening tests. Helms is a former
prostate cancer patient, and his wife survived colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, broke with
a large segment of the antiabortion movement to back federal
research using stem cells, most often derived from human embryos.
``As the father of a daughter with juvenile diabetes, I know
firsthand the devastating nature of this disease,'' Thurmond said,
adding that stem cells hold hope for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   And when advocates began pushing for a big boost for the NIH,
they had significant help from lawmakers _ even some of the most
budget-conscious Republicans _ who talk freely of what new cures
would mean to their own lives. Many lawmakers support doubling the
1998 NIH budget in five years, and Congress has voted two years
running to stay on track toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the broad support. Some lawmakers
are convinced that investment in medical research helps cut
Medicare and other health costs and boosts the economy by
developing ideas later picked up by private companies. But
lawmakers also act out of emotion as well as reason, and nothing
tugs on the heart like a bout with disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone close to you is fighting for their life, it
forces you to learn a lot about a subject that before you did not
pay attention to,'' said Mack. ``As a result of trying to find the
latest information, you learn of all the different breakthroughs.
And it doesn't take long to figure out that those breakthroughs
came because of the federal investment in research.''
</P>
<P>
   As this year's research budget wound its way through Congress,
several of the lawmakers involved had already made a funding boost
a personal cause.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Arlen Specter, who underwent heart bypass surgery last
year and had a benign brain tumor removed in 1993, is chairman of
the Senate's health-spending subcommittee. He guided that panel to
approve a $2 billion increase for the NIH, far more than President
Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIH is really the crown jewel of the federal government,''
said Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania. ``It may be the only
crown jewel of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers wanted more. Representative John Porter,
Specter's counterpart in the House and a Republican from Illinois,
said it would take $2.3 billion to keep the NIH budget on track to
double in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figure was backed by Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee. Stevens, a Republican from
Alaska, had surgery for prostate cancer in 1991. The boost will
take the annual NIH budget to nearly $18 billion in 2000, up from
$13.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers who push for more medical funding include
Kennedy; Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who lost
a husband to colon cancer; and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, the senior
Democrat on Specter's health-spending subcommittee. One of six
children, Harkin lost a brother recently to thyroid cancer, and
another brother is in the late stages of prostate cancer. Earlier,
both of his sisters died of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those sisters had helped raised him, as Harkin's mother died
when he was young and his father was in poor health. ``My sisters
weren't poverty-stricken, but they were low-income and they didn't
have a lot of money to go for checkups and things like that,''
Harkin said Monday in a phone interview from Cambridge, Mass.,
where he was visiting the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin recalled the funeral of his oldest sister, Mary Ann.
``All of us were there. And I would say a year and a half after
that, Sylvia died of breast cancer . . . . That was incredible,
when Sylvia came down with it. It was so rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack has been one of the most public lawmakers in talking about
disease in his family. At one public hearing, he called for more
gene research in hopes that scientists would create a screening
test for melanoma, the cancer that took his brother Michael. More
recently, Mack called for better pain management, saying his
brother was unnecessarily denied a certain pain medication because
doctors feared he would become addicted to it. Mack said that
notion conflicts with scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say that it has also become easier to support medical
research because the various groups seeking funding are battling
with one another less often.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania
Republican, the diabetes groups ``were feuding with each other,''
with one pushing research, one promoting better treatment for
people with the disease, and one lobbying for more patient
education. Now they are united behind a bigger NIH budget. But
hinting at other rivalries, Weldon said diabetes research deserves
a bigger share of NIH dollars than other diseases because new
treatments will have the biggest affect on overall health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   With health research so well-regarded in Congress, advocates for
other types of research are trying to leverage that support to
boost their own causes. The Science Coalition, a group of 60
universities, recently ran advertisements in a Capitol Hill
newspaper that linked the physical sciences to health. One noted
that MRI technology relies on physics and engineering to help
doctors map the body. Another highlighted the ``pharmacy on a
chip,'' a computer device that helps doctors program the dosages of
dozens of drugs to a patient at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease is nonpartisan, and it affects people personally,''
said Gene Sperling, a senior economic aide to Clinton. ``That has
clearly led to a greater commitment for long-term investment in
research. It seems to have taken hold in a nonideological way.''

ROLL DOWN THE WELCOME MAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Marty Meehan sat through a
fascinating presentation the other day on one of the major and
largely unheralded sources of economic growth in the 1990s (that
would be immigration), and then piped up with an observation of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Here you have a significant contributor to the expansion of the
American labor force and in the case of the Massachusetts
Democrat's region, the only reasons for growth. You also have a
major reason that a very tight labor market has not become an
economy-crippling, absolute shortage of skilled workers, and
throughout the decade the only things government has done have been
mean-spirited measures designed to roll up the welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly after the alleged successors to free market guru
Ronald Reagan took over Congress five years ago, there has been a
punitive immigration statute, several punitive provisions in a
statute reforming welfare, and a successful and divisive initiative
campaign in California to deny basic social services to immigrants
and obliterate the distinction between legal and illegal
noncitizens in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the California mess produced an
antinativist backlash across the country. The momentum behind the
punitive stuff is gone. But in a conversation after absorbing a
fresh round of head-turning data, Meehan agreed that the first
order of governmental immigration business in a fresh decade ought
to be sweeping the statute books clean of all the junk that the
roll-up-the-gangplank crowd has put there.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't gonna happen; too many Pat Buchanan wannabes in both
political parties. But the fact is that a country serious about
maintaining its prosperity past next year ought to be investing in
the legal immigrants (and their kids) who are going to be needed to
sustain this growth.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for supporting a digestible pace of
legal immigration is anything but economic. In a democracy, nothing
invigorates the society like fresh blood. For all the phony
political rhetoric dispensed about subjects like bilingual
education, the more important point is that for those native-born
Americans who bother to listen, immigrants teach us and remind us
of more than we have to teach them; and they give much more than
they get.
</P>
<P>
   Especially recently.
</P>
<P>
   In another landmark report on the phenomenon (the first was four
years ago), the best little policy shop in New England, MassINC,
has pulled together the facts that demonstrate that the labor force
in the region would be smaller by nearly a quarter-million people
had it not been for immigration. In Massachusetts more than 80
percent of the labor force growth this decade is due to foreign
immigration. In the country, the only similarly dependent states
happen to be neighbors _ Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and
New Jersey _ where the out-migration of the native-born to the Sun
Belt continues.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect summing up of the contrarian implication, CEO Larry
Fish of Citizens Financial Group (the vibrant banking organization
that published the study) said that in the Northeast the economy
has been growing because of, not inspite of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Fish also noted the essence of what makes this Third Wave
different from the First (Irish) and the Second (Italian and
German). This time, no country is producing more than 10 percent of
the new residents, but more than half of the immigration is
nonwhite, Fish noted, and it is very young. And here's the
eye-catcher: one of every four kids in Massachusetts under the age
of 18 is foreign-born or a child of immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   There are some encouraging trends in the ongoing flow. Above
all, one in three foreign arrivals in Massachusetts has at least a
bachelor's degree, up from barely one in five 10 years ago, which
is still roughly the rate nationally.
</P>
<P>
   However, the incidence of poverty among immigrants is triple the
rate for native-born families, and as always educational levels and
family structure are the critical variants. For example, more than
10 percent of the kids in families headed by a couple were poor at
the time of the 1990 census, compared with two-thirds of those in
single-parent households. But while the poverty rate was still 30
percent in single-mother families where the mother held at least a
bachelor's degree, it was more than 80 percent where she did not.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to MassINC's work, we know that the kids in immigrant
families are central to the state's economic future, as they are
nationally. However, as Meehan observed, we would not know that by
looking at public policies. Ideally, we should be governed by a
strict standard of parity where legal immigrants and the
native-born are concerned. But we're not.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that absurdity with the MassINC study's conclusion
about the future:
</P>
<P>
   ``Given current and forthcoming demographic developments in our
state including low fertility, limited population growth, net
out-migration of younger native-born workers and the aging of our
population and labor force, foreign immigration will likely
continue to play a key role in determining the future growth rate
of the state's population, the future size of its labor force, and
it s future economic and job growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, here they come.

IT'S NO JOKE: EGG YOLKS ARE A FEAST FOR BACTERIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Almost everything bad in an egg is in the yolk.
</P>
<P>
   The yolk contains all the fat, nearly all the iron and is a fine
environment for growing bacteria, according to the American Egg
Board. So when you are cooking a dish that requires egg yolks, make
sure the food is well cooked.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can eat chiffon pies and mousses and
souffles and all those other dishes that include uncooked egg
whites (meringue). Just keep them refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is possible for salmonella to be found in either the
white or the yolk, according to the American Egg Board, ``egg
whites do not readily support bacterial growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Egg dishes such as cold souffles, mousses and chiffons
containing raw beaten whites require refrigeration. This is an
added safety factor and these dishes might be considered low risk
for healthy individuals,'' advises the board.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you are still squeamish about such things, you can
pasteurize the whites by mixing them with the sugar in the recipe
(using a minimum of two tablespoons sugar per white) and cook over
low heat in a heavy saucepan or in a double boiler, beating until
the whites stand in soft peaks.
</P>
<P>
   So this holiday season, bake that pumpkin chiffon pie or whip up
that chocolate mousse. Then, sit down and enjoy them.

ULTRAFAST CT SCANS SCARE SUBJECTS STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Monday, Nov. 29) 
By Phil Davis 
 &HT;     c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blood in Lyn Garrison's coronary arteries flows around tiny
calcium-rich bumps _ an early sign that disease is slowly choking
her heart.
</P>
<P>
   While not good, the news is a wake-up call, not a death
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   There is still time to stop smoking, to lose weight and to cut
back on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that feeds
the blockages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be changing a lot of my habits, for sure,'' said
Garrison, 54, a Simi Valley resident who works in the radiology
department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``Being in the medical
field, I know I should be eating low-fat foods and not smoking,
and, of course, I do the opposite. But I think this will do it
because you always think, `Not me.'''
</P>
<P>
   This cardiac wake-up call comes courtesy of a controversial
machine called the Electron Beam Computed Tomography scanner, also
known as the ``ultrafast'' CT. The $2 million machine snaps
electronic images of calcium buildup inside the body faster than
other imaging equipment, which makes it useful in scanning the
heart. Calcium deposits are a sign of atherosclerosis, the buildup
of plaque in arteries that can lead to heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is currently at the center of a heated debate: Is
the ability to pick up extremely early traces of heart disease
medically useful, or is the ultrafast CT just an overpriced scare
tactic with no real diagnostic value?
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the scanner is the best way to detect heart
disease in its earliest, most curable stage. It can provide vivid,
if not frightening, proof that a patient had better change his or
her ways before the disease spreads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between having risk factors for a disease
and having a disease,'' said Dr. Daniel Berman, chief of cardiac
imaging at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. ``Tell a smoker that
smoking causes lung cancer and they say, `Yeah, but most smokers
don't get lung cancer.' Show them they have lung cancer in their
chest X-ray, they stop smoking right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happens with coronary disease,'' Berman
continued. ``It goes in one ear and out the other when you tell
people they have high cholesterol and they really should reduce it.
Show them plaque in their coronary arteries and they go on
medication and change their diet. It really does alter
lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the ultrafast CT essentially proves what doctors
already know, that a person of a certain age with specific medical
problems is at increased risk of heart disease. They say the
marketing of ultrafast CTs _ which allows patients to schedule the
scan without a referral from their physician _ encourages
unneccesary, expensive medical testing. They also worry a clean
scan will encourage patients to continue the bad habits that put
them at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Detrano, a cardiologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
and author of a 1996 American Journal of Cardiology study that
questioned the value of the ultrafast CT, said the scan does seem
to frighten some patients enough to ``at least say they're going to
change.'' But he was disappointed with the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found that it predicts heart attacks very well,''
Detrano said. ``We see a lot of people with heart attacks who don't
have calcium.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest problem with the procedure was the cost. He and some
colleagues abandoned a more comprehensive study to measure the
effectiveness of the ultrafast CT in stopping people from smoking
because the procedure cost too much. The researchers determined the
money was better spent counseling smokers or paying for medications
to directly combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai charges $395 for the scan, a cholesterol screening
and consultation with a cardiologist. Anyone can take it, but
Berman said it is most useful for men ages 35-55 and women ages
45-65 who have at least two heart disease risk factors. The risk
factors are: high LDL cholesterol levels, diabetes, high blood
pressure, smoking, obesity or a family history of early heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the patients have abnormalities in their
scan,'' Berman said. ``When they have no abnormality, we're careful
to make sure they don't say, `Oh, I can go out and start smoking
and having cheeseburgers.' We'll also be following that with
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman hopes to end any debate with the most comprehensive study
of the ultrafast CT to date. In the coming months, he and his
colleagues will be screening 10,000 Cedars-Sinai employees for
heart disease risk factors. Those at highest risk of heart trouble
will be broken into two groups: Both groups will be counseled and
treated to ward off heart disease, but one group will also get an
ultrafast CT. Researchers will follow the patients for five years
to see if the scan has any impact on the way they care for their
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Will the patients be scared straight? No one can say for sure.
</P>
<P>
   In other fields, the philosophy hasn't worked well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scaring people is usually counterproductive,'' said Dr. Frank
Grossman, a dentist in Glendale who often uses high-tech images of
teeth to teach patients about gum disease and tooth decay. ``I
think educating them without scaring them is a better approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman believes many of his patients leave the office with
good intentions, but then slip back into old habits.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of heart disease. Despite the fact that
diseases of the heart kill nearly 1 million Americans each year,
most people ignore the well-publicized risks. There is a wealth of
information that high LDL cholesterol, smoking, obesity and a host
of other lifestyle choices have a profound impact on whether a
person will develop heart disease, the nation's No. 1 killer of
both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Heart Association, roughly half of the
14 million Americans who have some form of coronary artery disease
will find out about it only after they have a heart attack or
irreversible damage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a treadmill stress test, another way to detect
blocked arteries, is only effective after the blockage is more than
50 percent, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ultrafast CT can catch heart disease before the
material obstructs any blood flow, giving physicians the ability to
head off future problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about making a diagnosis of something we can't
treat. This is a disease that can be stopped,'' he said. ``It
doesn't really matter if (the plaque) you've already got in there
goes away. If you stop the progression of the disease, there's no
reason you shouldn't be healthy, live to be 100 and have something
else get you.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, no matter what researchers say, the bottom line
comes down to money for both hospitals and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Detrano said the roughly 50 American centers that have an
ultrafast CT are pushing calcium scanning to pay for the machines
that can't do much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy one of these machines for $2 million, you're stuck
with it,'' he said. ``It's not very good for scanning the abdomen,
the head, the knees or the spine, so you're stuck with scanning the
heart or screening for calcium. It's the only way you can make it
pay for itself, and that's why all these people are doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And since most insurers don't cover the ultrafast CT scan,
prospective patients also have to make a bottom-line assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how much money you've got in your pocket,''
Detrano said. ``If you've got a lot of money to be scared with,
then it's fine. But I don't know if it's worth it for most people.
That's the issue here.''

 &HT;    IN VISIT TO KOSOVO, CLINTON PLEADS WITH ETHNIC ALBANIANS FOR
RECONCILIATION
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FERIZAJ, Kosovo _ President Clinton asked ethnic Albanians here
Tuesday to look beyond the bloodshed and terror they suffered last
spring at the hands of Serbs, and put an end to revenge killings
that now threaten the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for fighting is passed,'' said Clinton, who received
a hero's welcome from several thousand Kosovar Albanians jammed
into a gymnasium in this ethnically mixed city in southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never forget the injustice that was done to you. No
one can force you to forgive what was done to you,'' Clinton said.
``But you must try.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a pointed message to adults, Clinton pleaded that the
lessons of ethnic hatred that have been repeated for centuries
across the darkly troubled Balkans not be replayed to a new
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg you who are parents,'' Clinton said, ``do not let the
children's spirits be broken. Do not let their hearts harden ...
Give them the tomorrow they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were roundly applauded by the Albanians. Many
waved American flags as he spoke and frequently interrupted his
remarks to chant in unison, ``Clin-ton, Clin-ton, Clin-ton.'' The
chorus was meant to pay vocal tribute to the man they credit with
delivering them from years of repression and months of murder, rape
and terror by Yugoslav soldiers and Serb paramilitary gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton loves Albania, and he wants what's right and true,''
said Ruzdi Marevei, a 63-year-old retiree who showed up in a
smart-looking olive tweed cap and khaki trenchcoat to hear Clinton
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has saved children, old men, women, everybody,'' said
Marevei. ``All people from Kosovo love him.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, Clinton traveled by helicopter over snow-dusted
fields and gently rolling hills to the sprawling U.S. military camp
named Bondsteel, base of the 6,300 American soldiers participating
in the NATO peacekeeping operation here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked the forces for their role in securing one of his
riskiest foreign policy gambits, the effort to forge peace in the
Balkans. And he joined several hundred troops for an early
Thanksgiving meal, before boarding a lumbering grey C-17 transport
jet and departing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the American president's first visit to Kosovo since a
U.S.-led NATO bombing campaign against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia
and its president, Slobodan Milosevic, ended five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign brought a halt to Serb atrocities targeting
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, but the allied effort to rebuild
the province and build a lasting peace is beset with daunting
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list is the continuing revenge violence some
Albanians have inflicted upon ethnic Serbs here.
</P>
<P>
   Killings, beatings and other forms of intimidation have forced
as many as three out of every four Serbs who call Kosovo home to
flee the province since the NATO strikes ended last June.
</P>
<P>
   An 8th-grader, Ramadan Ilazi, introduced Clinton. ``You promised
that you will bring us to our homes safe. You kept your promise,''
the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's message on Tuesday was that the allies can't knit
Kosovo _ a southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic _ back together again unless old enemies can begin to
reconcile their differences and the pain of their recent pasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the war,'' Clinton said. ``But listen, only you can win
the peace. The time for fighting is passed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of the moment, many Albanians said they would take
Clinton's comments to heart. Even those said, though, with mass
graves still being found, with hundreds, if not thousands, of
Kosovo's Albanians still missing, and their loved ones now fearing
the worst, true reconciliation remains a long ways off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will stop our revenge. We will build a democratic Kosovo.
We have always been for peace,'' said Isuf Hoxha, a 45-year-old
high school physics teacher. ``But we cannot forget the victims of
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton flew into the airport in the provincial capital
of Pristina aboard a giant C-17 military transport jet, as a faint
snow blew in from the grey mountains surrounding the city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the last leg of a 10-day trip to southeastern
Europe, was met by U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied
commander in Europe who led the NATO air war.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-hit by allied bombs and Serb forces alike during the war,
Pristina was also the site of a near clash between Russian and NATO
forces last June.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops based in neighboring Bosnia, as part of the NATO
peacekeeping force there, made a rogue dash to the Pristina airport
in the hours following the end of the bombing. The move caught NATO
off-guard and prompted Clark to issue an order, later overridden,
for U.S. troops to parachute into the airport and secure it before
the Russians could arrive.
</P>
<P>
   There were no such tensions Tuesday when Clinton arrived amid
tight security. He went directly into meetings with Bernard
Kouchner, head of U.N. civilian and humanitarian aid operations in
Kosovo, and U.N. peacekeeping force commander, Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, the first German officer to command forces outside of
his country since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with Kosovar Albanian leaders Ibrahim Rugova
and Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, as
well as Kosovo's highest Serb religious authority, Serb Orthodox
Bishop Artimije.

 &HT;    OUT OF CONTROL? POPULAR WAR WITH CHECHNYA EMPOWERING RUSSIAN
MILITARY
 &HT;    By BEN ARIS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Special to the Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For the past three months, there has been a silent coup
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Without storming parliament or brandishing guns, the Russian
military has quietly taken over the country's national security
policy and now, appears to be waging a war in Chechnya unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by strong public support for its bombing campaign
against the breakaway republic, a prime minister that has seen his
own poll rating soar as a result and a slight resurgence in the
beleaguered Russian economy from rising oil prices, military
leaders are pushing ahead with air strikes that have killed an
estimated 4,000 Chechen civilians and driven 200,000 more from
their homes since August.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Boris Yeltsin faced down U.S. President Bill
Clinton and four dozen other heads of state at a summit last week
when the group tried unsuccessfully to try to broker peace in
Chechnya, agreeing only to permit a fact-finding mission into the
breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should be under any illusions on this score. There will
be no negotiations with bandits and murderers,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the center of the storm is Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, who has managed to win the hardened hearts of both
the Russian public and the armed forces with his tough-guy image.
</P>
<P>
   But having given military leaders plenty of rope in the Chechnya
campaign, the concern now is that Putin may not be able to reign
them in if, and when the Kremlin decides to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin appointed the 47-year-old Putin, a former director of
the FSB (the successor to the KGB), in August. It was just after
Islamic militants from Chechnya had begun making incursions into
neighboring Dagestan. Then came a series of apartment-block
bombings here in September that killed nearly 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who Yeltsin dubbed his heir-apparent in next summer's
presidential elections, has seen his popularity ratings soar from
near zero to 29 percent, according to recent surveys of
presidential preferences by the Fund for Public Opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Russia's most popular political figure since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Putin has accomplished a remarkable
feat. An unknown with no political power base and no rich Russian
businessmen as backers when tapped as prime minister, he turned to
an embattled military still smarting from their humiliating defeat
in a 1994-1996 war against Chechen rebels. A defeat they blame on
meddlesome interference by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both (Putin and the military) want a win,'' says Nikolai
Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. ``If they win, then there is likely to be an
increased militarization of society _ an increased role for the
military and more budget funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military will not accept a second failure in Chechnya,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Putin has already pushed through a $1 billion increase
for military spending in the 2000 budget that is currently moving
through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that the military is becoming difficult
to manage. Earlier this month, Yeltsin's chief of staff Alexander
Voloshin, under increasing international pressure to stop the
slaughter of Chechen civilians, told the military to prepare for
negotiations with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of general staff, Anatoly Kvashnin, responded by
publicly threatening a mutiny if the Kremlin tries to put an end to
the fighting. He was backed up by nearly the entire general staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not serve in such an army,'' General Vladimir
Shamanov, commander of the Russian forces in Chechnya, said in an
interview on Russian television at the time. ``I would tear off my
epaulets and look for a civilian job.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's own liberal politicians have also been trapped, unable
to object.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko Party head Grigory Yavlinsky warned this month that the
growing gap between the civil and military leadership would lead to
``serious political destabilization,'' but quickly backtracked when
reminded that parliamentary elections are less than a month away.
He said his remarks had been taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, all the politicians are hostage to the war and the
military,'' Petrov said. ``They can't stop it or say a word against
the fight as they will lose votes.''

LECCE IS SO PLEASANT, EVEN THIS LION SHOULD SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LECCE, Italy _ This lion has a face like Bert Lahr, the Cowardly
Lion in ``The Wizard of Oz.'' Insecure, melancholy, timid, weary.
Just a big old 'fraidy cat.
</P>
<P>
   His stony countenance appears to whimper, ``How long is this
going on anyway? I want out; I want to go hide.''
</P>
<P>
   No chance. Bert, as I call him, is stuck in this pleasant
southeastern Italian city, Lecce, soaring but not roaring above Via
Umberto I. He's a hold-up guy: one of 12 figures in human and
animal form balancing the frontal balcony of the handsome baroque
church of Santa Croce on their backs. There they are, just below
the ornate rose window and above the main entry.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is obviously a noble, starring occupation, with more than
three centuries of job security, and no end in sight. But they
don't look happy. From the way they peer down at you, Bert and his
companions are straining candidates for hernia. Their 17th-century
creator, sculptor Giuseppe Zimbalo, has given ``What the hell am I
doing here?'' expressions to his cast of weight-lifters: six muscle
men plus Bert, a griffin, an eagle, a horse, a weasel, and the
historic wolf with maternal attachment to Romulus and Remus.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbalo humanized his scenes. Adorning a column on one side of
the front door are buxom ladies; on the other, chesty gentlemen.
Cheesecake and beefcake: so near . . . and yet sharing only longing
glances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alas, dearies . . . you'll never get together, and I'll never
escape,'' a sympathetic Bert may be whispering.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, on a misty inland plain in the neighborhood
of the Salentine Coast, Rotundo d'Bonato had materialized amid his
congregation of about 150 black-faced golden sheep. Slender, deeply
bronzed, and weathered, 73-year-old d'Bonato, a shepherd all his
life, said this somber, lonely, and rumpled countryside agrees with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Bert, the Lecce lion, might feel the same, especially surrounded
by all those racks of lamb on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   D'Bonato pointed to a house in the distance, his home, not far
from the village of Uggano la Chiesa. He said his sons had grown
and moved to cities, none interested in chaperoning the family
sheep. He pretty much stays away from cities himself, but
recommended Lecce, about 50 miles from the bottom of Italy's heel.
He smiled, saying Zimbalo's work on the facade of Santa Croce was
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   With her fluent Spanish, and enough Italian, my friend Aurelio
had a good time conversing with him, and asked if he ever hired
part-time assistants. She likes outdoor work. He shook his head, a
polite no thanks. He didn't think his wife would understand.
</P>
<P>
   So it was off to Lecce, along the jumbly, rocky Salentine Coast,
punctuated with sandy beaches. It is a rugged tan and gray strip of
Puglia, washed aqua by the Adriatic Sea, that furnishes much
building stone, some of it a limestone that is agreeable to work
with and has been favored by sculptors whose work decorates Lecce.
Rock-and-rolling wheelbarrows are seen everywhere, pushed by men
with sledgehammers who have been knocking away portions of
hillsides where pine, olive, and cactus fight for footholds.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient fortifications, testimony to the value of the local
quarries, now deteriorate gracefully. In such seaside towns as
Castro and Marina Guardiola, ingenious (seemingly foolhardy)
contractors and masons have somehow plastered villas against
hostile cliffs. Along the road were small memorials to drivers like
20-year-old Elio Seri in 1968 who didn't take the curves seriously
enough.
</P>
<P>
   A left turn took us away from the sea and soon, in eight miles,
into Lecce, crisp and clean, where the fun-and-flowing (sometimes
overflowing) style of baroque architecture catches your fancy in
numerous splendid churches, palaces, and other public buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will like the view from your room, 102,'' says Cosimo
Rosato, a proper and well-turned-out, yet cordial, manager at the
small, excellent Patria Palace hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the half-view. Terrific nonetheless, around a building,
revealing Zingarello's balcony-bearers of Santa Croce, but only 50
percent of them. Enough of a reminder that the entire platoon is
only a minute-or-so distant.
</P>
<P>
   Looming above the city at 231 feet is the bell tower of the
duomo. ``You can see far, to the Adriatic and Ionian seas, from the
top,'' Rosato says, ``but it's a long climb, and today it's too
cloudy.'' That's good news here, although dismaying to ascent-happy
Aurelio. But the golden snowflaked ceiling of the duomo cheers her.
</P>
<P>
   Not as high up but more meaningful is the town's patron, St.
Oronzo, installed as the bishop of Lecce in 57 by St. Paul. Arms
beckoning a welcome to visitors, he tops a column in Piazza St.
Oronzo, ironically overseeing a small Roman amphitheater from the
first century BC. It was a Roman emperor, Nero, who ordered him put
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Out front of the church of Santa Rosaria is another delightful
Zimbalo facade strewn with angels and horticulture: pretty faces
and flowers. All is sweetness and light, not like his vision of
hard labor and the boy-can't-meet-girl frustration of Santa Croce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you like Lecce, and hope you'll come back,'' says
Rosato at checkout time. ``But you must not leave until you have
had our traditional delicacy, a granita at Caffee Alvino. Not as
old as St. Croce or Zingallo's artistry, but you might say a
baroque treat. You can get a granita many places, but Alvino is the
home.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been since 1910, a restful coffee and pastry joint.
(Isn't that too recent to be a tradition in this country?)
Nevertheless, that's when the Alvino family started concocting
their specialty, heavily iced coffee with a thick cream (something
like a smoothie), to be eaten with a spoon and accompanied by nifty
little cookies. So explains the fourth-generation proprietor, Fabio
Guglielmi, who married into the tasty business.
</P>
<P>
   Yum. Good enough to put a smile on the face of a neighbor, Bert
the forlorn lion.

CARING FOR GIFT PLANTS AND OTHERS IN THE HOME IS A BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Nov. 25 or thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I love receiving plants as holiday gifts, especially ones that
are fragrant. Fortunately I have been given many. Unfortunately, I
have eventually killed most of them.
</P>
<P>
   I tend to anthropomorphize my plants, which means thinking of
them like small green people with human feelings and needs to which
one should attend. So I try very hard to keep my plants alive.
</P>
<P>
   Just today I brought in a sickly gift azalea that had benn
devastated by incorrect watering. I will minister to it and maybe
even get a flower or two. However, if it doesn't come back, out it
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Now I know most of the tricks of the trade about growing indoor
plants. Fluorescent lights to lengthen their days. Every new
fertilizer and hormone gets tested. A thick, 50-year-old house
plant book explains each plant's little idiosyncrasies.
</P>
<P>
   Right now my 20-year-old Meyer lemon trees have delicious ripe
yellow fruit. The delicate fragrance of an equally old sweet olive
tree wafts through the morning air when the sun is out. Keeping
them company are old geraniums and clerodendrons and clivea that
don't die.
</P>
<P>
   So when gift plants die on me, I can't help analyzing why. One
of the main reasons for sure is improper watering. One good mail
order house says to water when the top half-inch of the soil is dry
to the touch. I try.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, I have found commercial potting mixes (which are
mostly peat moss and bark mulch) almost impossible to keep properly
hydrated. That's why the scruffy azalea almost died. My long-lived
plants are in loam.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the flowering plants for sale have been
pushed with fertilizer and grown in 24-hour-lighted greenhouses.
They can't adapt quickly to the low light level in our houses.
</P>
<P>
   How many gift plants have I killed? Well, more than I like to
remember. But more interesting is which have survived and which
have not. Most of the dead ones were listed as ``difficult'' or
``very difficult'' according to the old plant book. They were also
the most beautiful: gardenia, jasmine, azaleas, hibiscus, heath,
hydrangea, roses, cyclamen, orchids, and of course, my topiary
rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: Think of these most beautiful of gift
plants as long-lasting cut flowers, and if they don't survive,
chuck them out, even if you feel bad. But don't feel guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you might ask, so which gift plants have a chance of
living on and perhaps even reblooming? The following are reputed to
be long-lived if you feed them with half-strength liquid
fertilizer, get rid of bugs with soapy water (spray or dip), have
the right light and humidity, and don't overwater or let them get
too dry:
</P>
<P>
   --Clivea is one of the most reliable, with shiny green leaves
and orange flowers in spring, and it grows without sun.
</P>
<P>
   --Christmas cactus lives a long time and will rebloom if given
bright daylight coupled with complete darkness for about 14 hours.
(Put it in a bright window in a room you don't light or use at
night.)
</P>
<P>
   --Flowering maple, also called abutilon, is reputed to be
moderately easy, as is anthurium (from Hawaii). Both may bloom
repeatedly throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   --Lemon, miniature orange, and sweet olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   --Plants with variegated foliage like dracaena and bromeliads
provide colorful accents with their leaves alone. The bromeliads
have exotic flower spikes that last a long time but may be hard get
to bloom again at home.
</P>
<P>
   --English ivy, especially grown as a sophisticated topiary, will
live on and on, as will many less trendy foliage plants like pothos
and philodendron and ficus.
</P>
<P>
   --Scented geraniums, beloved Victorian plants with insignificant
flowers, have textured leaves of various delightful fragrances such
as rose, lemon, and peppermint.
</P>
<P>
   --Even that trusty harbinger of Christmas, poinsettia, can
resprout into a nice bushy foliage plant if it is cut down to a few
inches in spring.

MUCH ADO ABOUT SHAKESPEARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not often that you get a chance to re-create the
intellectual fervor you experienced with your favorite college
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Mine taught Shakespeare. Homer Swander's classes at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, were magical affairs; we
delved deeply into the text and were often hauled to our feet to
act out a scene. He taught us that everything we needed to know
about the world _ ambition, love (especially the impetuous kind),
jealousy, greed _ could be learned from Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   I liked that class so much, I decided to take a summer class
Swander led in 1972 called Theatre in England. We spent nearly
three weeks in England seeing loads of plays, meeting the actors
and directors, and by the end, practically speaking in iambic
pentameter. I so fell in love with theater from that experience
that I became an actress _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   So, when I heard that Swander, now retired from the university,
was still leading those impassioned Theatre in England tours, I
leapt at the chance to go.
</P>
<P>
   In '72, we saw Laurence Olivier in ``Long Day's Journey into
Night'' and Diana Rigg in Tom Stoppard's ``Jumpers.'' From the
inception of Theatre in England 33 years ago, Swander said, the
idea was to see a variety of plays, both new and old, by a
multitude of companies, in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   I had a few misgivings: When I went before, the group was a cozy
30 people, now it would be 100, many of them retired, and many
repeaters. But the theater offerings seemed to compensate.
Swander's monthly memos promised a great season: two productions of
``Antony and Cleopatra'' (one with Alan Bates), two Noel Coward
plays in honor of his centenary, ``Candide,'' ``Volpone,''
Stoppard's ``The Real Thing,'' and several alluring new ones.
</P>
<P>
   I geared myself up for a lot of hard work. If this were going to
be anything like the last tour, it would be more like a three-week
boot camp than vacation. I spent weeks reading most of the 14 plays
we were scheduled to see.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at Heathrow, we began the trip in Stratford,
Shakespeare's birthplace and an area pretty much devoted to him.
Despite being overrun with tourists, it's still a lovely
Elizabethan town. We stayed in the Falcon, a half-beamed inn, parts
of which date back to the early 1600s. Through the leaded-glass
windows in my room, I could see the ruins of the last house
Shakespeare lived in and hear the clop-clop of the horse-drawn
carriages as they passed by. That first week, we saw almost
everything in the Royal Shakespeare Company repertory, including
``Othello,'' ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and ``Volpone.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the size of the group and the nicer accommodations,
much of the trip was the same as my first. Swander still has a
steel-trap mind and strong convictions about how Shakespeare should
be played: He has little use for directors with fancy ``concepts''
or those who tinker with the script.
</P>
<P>
   He wasted no time in giving his slant on Shakespeare: ``A script
is not literature,'' he told us on the bus to Stratford. ``Taught
as if it were literature, it stays on the page. A script is only
the beginning of a work of art _ it doesn't become one until it
comes off the page.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule was taut: We saw plays nearly every night, and
spent afternoons in discussion meetings. Swander team-teaches with
Tony Church, a former actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company and
a walking encyclopedia of British theater history.
</P>
<P>
   During the lively, provocative discussions, we argued over the
director's interpretation of the play and the talents of the
actors. Hands flew up as importunately as in college; and the
disappointment at not getting called upon was as great. Some of the
participants had come 10, even 20 times, and they were a tough lot
who knew how to critique a production.
</P>
<P>
   Swander has been coming to England for so long he's close
friends with many of the actors, several of whom came to our
discussion groups. Richard Cordery, who played a terrific Brabantio
(Desdemona's father) in ``Othello,'' and Corvino in Ben Johnson's
``Volpone,'' talked about the differences between learning Johnson
and Shakespeare. ``Johnson is the lesser (writer),'' he told us.
``He's harder to learn. There is something organic and inspired
about the meter and language in ``Othello.'' Cordery told us he
learned the part of Brabantio by walking through the fields of
Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of this program was hanging out with the actors
after the shows and asking them questions you'd never otherwise get
to ask, such as how they worked out the meaning of a certain line.
Malcolm Storry, who was a wonderful Enobarbus in an otherwise
dismal production of ``Antony and Cleopatra'' (the one even Bates
couldn't save) and played a fabulous ``Volpone,'' stayed in the
hotel bar with some of the students in our group till 2:30 a.m.,
talking about his craft and his move up through the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   Those students were some of the 21 mostly high school and
college kids who participated in the Shakespeare School, a separate
program-for-credit within Theatre in England. So we had an odd
conglomeration of people. It was part college, part Elderhostel.
The Elderhostel types turned out to be theater junkies who had
delightful tales to tell about their own lives. The remainder were
mostly single baby-boomer women, with quite a few teachers among
them. Almost all were from California, and had heard about the trip
through the university or California theater connections, but
Theatre in England is open to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Benedix, a high school drama and English teacher from
Pompano Beach, Fla., had been coming since 1985. ``Just as I need
air to breathe,'' she said in her dramatically ruined smoker's
voice, ``I need Theatre in England to be alive. By the time I get
home I am so filled with incredible energy and creativity that I
can then use in the classroom. I get directing ideas, project
ideas. Not that I can use all of them, but it gets me going.''

THE 2000 INFINITI I30: BIGGER, ROOMIER, SLEEKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Thursday, Nov. 25 and thereafter; l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I slip into the driver's seat of the 2000 Infiniti I30 and have
a sense of what Yogi Berra called ``deja vu all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   And I quickly realize where I am: Toss out the leather seats,
the faux-wood inserts in the doors, the fancy sound system, and I'm
back in the Nissan Maxima GXE, a car I liked very much. So the
question before me, as I test this Maxima-based luxury auto, is a
simple one. Is it $8,000 better than the Maxima?
</P>
<P>
   It is the sort of question that anyone entering this low end of
the luxury market needs to ask because when you're reaching into
the $30,000 and $40,000 range, there is a vast array of cost and
quality and performance, not all meted out in direct proportions.
And some cars in this rarefied air are no better than cars in the
low- to mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   This is the domain of the Maxima, the Toyota Avalon, Audis,
Mercedes, Acuras, Cadillacs, BMWs, Lexus, the Chrysler 300 M, and
others.
</P>
<P>
   When the I30 was introduced for the 1996 model year, Kiplinger's
Personal Finance called it the best new car in the $25,000-35,000
range.
</P>
<P>
   And it is, indeed, a fine car with many amenities standard: fog
lights; 16-inch alloy wheels; power windows, locks, mirrors, and
gas lid; leather seats with power 8-way settings for the driver and
4-way for the passenger; leather steering wheel and transmission
cover; automatic temperature control; 7-speaker Bose sound system;
remote keyless entry; wood-tone interior trim; trunk cargo net, and
cruise control. Usually standard but missing on the model tested
(accounting for the lower as-tested price in the data chart) were a
power glass sunroof and power rear window sunshade.
</P>
<P>
   This is a bigger, roomier I30 than earlier models, and from its
rounded-wedge, two-bulb headlamps back to its similarly shaped tail
lights, it is a sleeker car, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Its leather front seats are broad and firm, with a seemingly
endless supply of ever more thigh support as they are adjusted.
Lateral support is firm and you find yourself packaged in the seat
without feeling cramped. The back seat's two outer positions are
equally comfortable, though the middle spot, as in so many
5-passenger cars these days, is really a hump that no adult would
want to ride on for a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   The view through the windshield is expansive _ almost too much
so, given that the front slopes away so completely it can be hard
to keep track of the front fenders. A slight bulge to those fenders
_ a la German cars _ would not only solve this problem but would
give the car a bit more muscular look.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, the I30 gauges and controls are mostly simple:
basic gauges behind the wheel _ fuel, speed, rpms, temperature.
Mounted vertically between them is the shift indicator for the
automatic transmission. White backlighting at night makes the
gauges easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   At center dash is the clock, its eggshell face marked by Roman
numerals and slashes, looking somewhat wristwatch-like.
</P>
<P>
   Below it, one over the other, are the banks of audio and climate
controls. All are simple to adjust with the exception of the
``mode'' button that controls which vents are spurting air and how
strong the fan is operating. The problem with this _ and it is a
significant one _ is that the only way to tell which mode you are
in (air to the feet, out of the dash, out of both, out of the
defroster; fan on high, medium, or low) is to stare at a tiny
screen low on the dash. If you are doing this while driving, you
are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One nice ergonomic touch is the way the armrests built into the
front doors curve up and out toward the front, making the controls
for windows and locks easy to see and use.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is OK. Door bins are a bit thin, a bin at center dash
(often wasted space) is useful and the center-console bin is
adequately deep. Like the Nissan Maxima, the I30 has a deep trunk
and 60-40 split rear seats expand its capacity for longer loads.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is a 3.0-liter, DOHC, 24-valve V6. It generates 227
horsepower, five more than the Maxima, and doesn't need its first
tuneup for 100,000 miles. I got 23 miles per gallon driving around
town and commuting on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It powers the I30 at 75 miles per hour at 2,300 rpms and hauls
it from 0-60 in just over 8 seconds _ curious to me since the
Maxima did 0-60 about a half-second faster.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is quiet, and remains subtle even when in quick
passing mode. Unfortunately, wind noise from the rear (windows?
door seals?) detracts from an otherwise quiet ride.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be some shift delay in the automatic transmission
at lower speeds, but at higher speeds it moves up quickly and
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   On sharp corners, or moving in and out of commuter traffic, the
I30 does a good job of walking the fine line between performance
car stiff and luxury sedan soft. It holds lines well with little
roll or yaw and you soon feel confident in its handling.
</P>
<P>
   Suspension up front is independent struts, coil springs, and
stabilizer bar; in the back, multi-link beam with stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control, which reads sensors from all four wheels, uses
reduced torque to limit slippage. Disc brakes of more than 11
inches front and rear bring the I30 to straight, smooth, and swift
stops. Front and side air bags are standard.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably advice you will hear from me again and again, but
when you're shopping for a car in the $30,000 neighborhood, do
yourself a favor and shop around _ a lot. Look lower and look
higher and do as I would do, ask yourself what you are getting for
the extra $8,000 _ or what you might be missing for an extra
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nice Touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The center-seat console that serves not only as storage space
but as adjustable armrest.
</P>
<P>
   --The vehicle immobilizer system that shuts the car down if
someone tries to start the car without the special key with its
built-in microchip transponder.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The mirrors. Too small. Give us bigger glass and use
aerodynamics to shroud it.

BIG RED BOATS WILL COVER THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Big Red Boat is traveling to the four corners of America.
The idea is to make family cruising easier, less costly, and more
convenient.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Premier Cruises introduced family cruising on a Big Red
Boat out of Port Canaveral, Fla. Since that time the company has
added a couple more Big Red Boats, then dropped some. By next year,
though, there will be four of these vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Premier has also changed its concept of family cruising. First
it was associated with Disney World, then the company joined up
with Warner Brothers, each time featuring characters from those
companies on their cruises. Now, instead of depending on those
characters, Premier will be placing more emphasis on onboard
activities, and making the cruises more accessible to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the only way to enjoy a cruise ship devoted to family
cruising was to travel to Florida. Premier, however, will be
putting four ships in different areas of the country _ the East
Coast, Florida, along the West Coast, and out of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our `four corners' geographical approach provides Premier a
great strategic advantage over our competitors,'' said Bruce
Nierenberg, Premier's president. ``Most of our targeted families
eliminate the cost and inconvenience of getting to our ports by
air. In many cases families will now simply drive straight to our
ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Boat experience is designed to fit an evolving
definition of the term ``family,'' said Nierenberg. ``As the 21st
century dawns, the concept of family has expanded, and Premier will
reach out to families in every sense of the word. This year alone,
an estimated 93 million adults will take a family trip. But what
constitutes a family? It is parents with kids. But it is also
honeymooners, single parents, extended families, grandparents, and
couples without children.''
</P>
<P>
   To make a Premier cruise more enjoyable, the line is featuring
``Seven Star Service.'' ``As I have said before, the only cabin
that matters on a cruise is your cabin,'' said Nierenberg. ``The
only dining room table that matters is your dining room table.''
</P>
<P>
   The new service is now available on the Big Red Boat I, and will
be available on the other ships by the end of April. The service
includes a lush bathroom, and unlike at fancy hotels, the robe is
yours to keep at no charge; nightly ``pillow treats''; an expanded
toiletry amenities kit similar to ones offered only in suites of
other lines; overnight shoeshines; toys for the children; in the
dining room, tableside cooking; and for guests celebrating an
anniversary or other event, a custom dinner menu.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red Boat fleet will now include the SS Oceanic (Big Red
Boat I), which will sail out of Port Canaveral on three- and
four-day cruises to Nassau, which can be combined with a land stay
at Disney World or Universal Studios; the Edinburgh Castle,
formerly the Eugenio Costa; beginning in May, the Big Red Boat II,
sailing out of New York City on seven-day cruises to Canada;
starting in June, the Big Red Boat III (formerly the SS Island
Breeze), sailing out of Houston on seven-night cruises to Mexico;
Big Red Boat IV (formerly the SS Rembrant and, before that, the
famed Holland America liner Rotterdam) sailing out of Los Angeles
on three- and four-day cruises with optional land packages to area
theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Making the line's new approach to cruising all the more
attractive to families is a vacation package for four priced under
$1,000. The package includes a three-night hotel stay, a rental car
for seven days, three days at Universal Studios Escape theme parks,
admission to Kennedy Space Center, and a four-day Bahamas cruise.
The package begins at $399 per adult and $99 per child. Premier
says a similar package on a competing cruise line would cost as
much as $2,400.

CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING WITH YOUR DOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter is fast approaching and one of the best ways to enjoy it
is out on a trail doing some cross-country skiing, maybe with the
kids or your dog.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Maine Nordic Ski Council has developed a theme this
season of ``Kids and Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   While this may seem a strange combination, Wende Gray, executive
director of the council, points out that it has been shown that the
simple act of petting a dog can lower blood pressure and that daily
exercise strengthens the cardiovascular system. So, the conclusion
is that cross-country skiing with your dog just might add years to
your life and life to your years.
</P>
<P>
   There's really only one way to prove this and that is to get out
on a cross-country trail. Several nordic centers in Maine welcome
skiers with dogs. At Carter's XC Ski Centers in Orford and Bethel,
owner David Carter says, ``We treat dogs just like humans. They
must purchase a trail pass and attach it to their collars.''
Carter's allows pets to stay overnight with guests at their lodge,
cabins, or yurt.
</P>
<P>
   Other centers may charge for a pet overnight. At the Birches
Resort in Rockwood, the cost is $5 extra for dogs to stay in a
cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Some centers earmark a special trail for dogs. The Sunday River
Cross Country Center has a 1-kilometer Farm Loop, a.k.a. ``Poop
Loop.'' Sugarloaf Outdoor Center has a 9-kilometer Narrow Gauge
Trail that runs along the Carrabassett River as its canine trail.
</P>
<P>
   As to the kids, at most Maine centers those under age 6 ski free
and the 7-17 set have a junior rate. A good deal is the All Area
Privilege Pass that supports the Bill Koch Youth Ski League and
allows two adults and an unlimited number of young people 18 and
under to ski half price at member centers.
</P>
<P>
   For a free copy of the Maine Ski Council's cross-country
brochure, which lists all members, the facilities, events, races,
and activities for all ages and the handicapped, as well as a map
showing center locations, call 800-SKI-XCME or visit www.mnsc.com. &QL;

Christmas trees &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem early to think about getting your Christmas
tree, here's an idea for a weekend getaway to Vermont that not only
gets you a tree but should put you in the holiday spirit. The
Vermont Fresh and Natural Christmas Tree weekend package Dec. 3-5
includes a two-night stay at a cozy inn, farmhouse, or
bed-and-breakfast, breakfast for two Saturday and Sunday, taxes,
and a fresh Vermont Christmas tree. Packages range from $123 to
$419 depending on accommodations and amenities offered. Some
packages are available now through Dec. 18. For a complete list of
accommodations and packages, call the Vermont Chamber of Commerce
at 802-223-3443.

Hearst at night &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The famed Hearst Castle in San Simeon in San Luis Obispo County,
California, will be open most Friday and Saturday  &UR; evening &LR; s
through December. Living-history docents will don cocktail gowns,
woolen suits, and other attire from the 1930s to help re-create the
castle's night life of the '30s. The two-hour  &UR; evening &LR;  tours are
$25 for adults and can be booked by calling 800-444-4445. For

<P>
   ``Out of the Mist,'' the first-ever comprehensive presentation
on the art, culture, and heritage of western Canada's
Nuu-chah-nulth nations, features more than 241 artifacts and
images, many of which have never been exhibited before. They are on
view at the Royal British Columbia Museum through April 30. The
artifacts and stories tell the history from 2000-3000 BC of the
Nuu-chah-nulth aboriginal people who lived along the West Coast of
Vancouver Island. The Empress, a Victorian landmark hotel, is
offering an Out of the Mist package including accommodations,
breakfast, and exhibit tickets, beginning at about $105. For

CLEANING THE GROUT ON THE BATHROOM FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Thursday, November 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am fed up with the dirty grout between my ceramic floor
tiles. I have tried everything without success. How can I clean it
and keep it clean?
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY CONFLONE, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. OK, but with these bits of wisdom come a lecture, or possibly
more appropriate, a sermon. In the good old days, floor grout was a
dark- to medium-gray color. It was that color partly because that
was the only color that could be made out of cement and sand, but
mainly because floor makers knew that the color would stand up
quite nicely, and not show the dirt. This was great for hundreds of
years. Then some benighted designer thought, wouldn't it be nice to
have ``designer grout,'' in cute designer colors such as white (!),
avocado, canary, baby blue, and light, light, light beige. As long
as it was light. This went over big with Mrs. floor owner, and Mr.
floor owner meekly went along with it. Guess who got stuck with
washing that light grout, which stains if you look at it?
</P>
<P>
   It never came clean. Then someone else thought of sealing the
grout, which makes it water-resistant, therefore dirt-resistant.
Trouble is, the sealer has to be reapplied every year or two.
</P>
<P>
   OK, to answer your question, try one of these: Tile Guard tile
grout cleaner, tile grout coating, and silicone grout sealer,
800-445-0619.
</P>
<P>
   Tile colorer and sealer: Grout Colorant, sold in tile stores.
</P>
<P>
   TileLab care products (Tile &AMP; Grout Cleaner, sold at Home
Depot). For information, call 800-272-8786.
</P>
<P>
   KRc7: Sold in plumbing supply shops.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the grout clean, hah! You have a row to hoe. Sealing it
with a masonry or tile sealer is your only choice. And that has to
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   One more idea: If you can't wash the grout clean, scrape off the
top layer with a rounded knife, but be careful that you don't
scratch the tile.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to my recommendation: Damn the grout and
full speed ahead. Put in black grout.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am hanging a little plaque in my house. The plaque has
holes in the back that taper from top to bottom, so they are wider
at the bottom. The plaque is hung over screws that stick out of the
wall just a bit. Is there an easy or fast way to make sure the
plaque, when it is hung on the screws, will sit snugly and flat
against the wall?
</P>
<P>
   SHELDON GOLDER, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are no easy or fast ways that I know of. The
tried-and-true ways are trial and error. Drive the screws into the
wall at the proper spots, then hang the plaque on them; if the
plaque is loose, tighten the screws a little. Repeat as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A faster way is to measure the thickness of the plaque from the
back of the hole to the back of the plaque. Say it's 3/8 inch.
Round-headed screws should stick out that much. This will assure a
tight fit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Colbert of Tuftenboro, N.H., may not have to replace her
cracked toilet after all. In a recent column, she noted that the
toilet leaked and had to be replaced. The handyman suggested a
place to find a wall-hung toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the handyman received this message from Ira
Dinkes of Marblehead, Mass. in response to Dorothy Colbert's query.
He suggested using Goop by Eclectic Products Inc. on the crack,
sold in Ace and True Value hardware stores and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Dinkes said, someone cracked the back of his
toilet tank. He couldn't replace the tank (it was lavender!), so
``I emptied the tank, dried it, placed a layer of Goop over the
crack on the inside and on the back (as best I could), waited a
day, and repeated. Five years now, no leaks, even with the
bleaching tablets in the tank. So Dorothy can keep her Vent Away
toilet if she can reach the crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ira, the handyman thanks you, and so, I hope, will Dorothy
Colbert.

(Eds: Correction to second graf: `a few') 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; There have been great ``Christmas Carols'' and deadly
``Christmas Carols,'' high-tech productions at Madison Square
Garden and thrift-shop productions in suburban church basements.
</P>
<P>
   But there been fewmusical versions of Charles Dickens' timeless
holiday parable. Or so Steve Allen briefly considered when he
decided to sit down and write one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me one of the best ideas that I had ever had,''
says Allen, whose tuneful adaptation of Dickens' seasonal classic
will have its world premiere tonight at Theatre West, across from
Universal City. ``I could not believe, however, that I was the
first to ever think of it _ and indeed I was not.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that a bunch of overqualified Brits, including
Albert Finney and Alec Guinness, had beaten Allen to the punch with
the 1970 musical feature film ``Scrooge.'' Released in the
Oscar-winning wake of ``Oliver!'' _ another Dickens novel turned
musical property _ ``Scrooge'' is memorable today mainly for the
image of Finney romping through faux-Victorian streets warbling
``Thank You Very Much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't there room for another try?
</P>
<P>
   There was, and now Allen has written 17 songs for it with titles
such as ``We Are One,'' ``Greed'' and a pull-out-the-hankies number
called ``God Bless Us Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me there had to be a song sung by dear little
Tiny Tim called `God Bless Us Everyone,' because that's the
best-known line,'' says Allen. ``Fortunately, Dickens is easily
accessible. You can take chunks of conversation just as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring as world-class skinflint Ebenezer Scrooge will be
Harold Gould, the five-time Emmy nominated actor (``Rhoda,'' ``The
Golden Girls'') who recently starred in the Pasadena Playhouse
production of ``Visiting Mr. Green.'' Allen will appear onstage at
most performances as Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   A prodigious actor, composer and author of 53 books, and the man
who created and first hosted ``The Tonight Show,'' Allen has led
popular culture more often than he has followed it. At 78 he still
puts in a full seven days of work, either at his Encino home or his
Van Nuys-based Meadowlane Enterprises (named for his wife, actress
Jayne Meadows), where he keeps a handful of hard-working assistants
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing songs comes easily to Allen, so easily that he composed
one of his major hits, ``This Could Be the Start of Something
Big,'' in his sleep (he says the song came to him in a dream).
Officially, he's the world's most prolific songwriter, with more
than 8,000 composing credits, including ``Impossible.'' You can
look it up in the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hide the point?'' he says evenly. ``I can write beautiful
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allen, once called ``the most talented man in America'' by
no less a multifaceted talent than Noel Coward, makes no particular
claims for what he refers to as his ``freakish'' musical aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have understanding of it. I don't even read music.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he take credit for having any special new insights into
``A Christmas Carol's'' enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Dickens scholar,'' he says. ``I'm not a scholar of
any kind. In fact I never even graduated from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly credentials or no, Allen is happy to chat about his
new show in relation to, say, the social theories of Metternich and
Marx or the formation of the modern welfare state. He believes that
``the question of what the rich should do about the poor, in fact,
(is) more with us today in some ways than it was when (Dickens) was
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to do something (to assist the needy),'' he
says. ``That's just common sense. But common sense isn't very
common.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season, if you stop by the rescue-mission shelters
in downtown Los Angeles you may spot Allen and his wife serving a
holiday meal to the homeless, as the couple does every year.
</P>
<P>
   But you're more likely to find him shepherding some of his 12
grandchildren to Theatre West to witness a new musical about a very
lucky old man who somehow finds a way to grow happier with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, of all the things I've done, my favorite
role is Grandpa,'' Allen says. ``I've just noticed when I'm with
the kids, my face smiles more.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What: &LR;  ``A Christmas Carol'' &UR;  &QL; 
Where: &LR;  Theatre West, 3333 Cahuenga Blvd., Studio City. &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    Thanksgivings to remember
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Thanksgivings always seem to make a lasting impression.
Here are three stories I've collected from friends of Thanksgivings
that will never be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been married only four months and I had assumed we
would be spending Thanksgiving with my folks, but the night before,
my husband informed me that we would begin our own traditions and
would be spending the day at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agreed that we needed to start our own traditions, but I was
not prepared for fixing a Thanksgiving dinner, in fact about the
only I could make was macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day Thanksgiving, I cried. There were no restaurants open,
so we ended up eating at a hamburger place. My mother was as upset
about the whole thing as I was. I was the only one not there; I
missed seeing my cousins and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That night, my husband told me he was sorry it had upset me
and that he didn't realize that it was so important. Since then,
weve spent every Thanksgiving at my parent's house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our first Thanksgiving together and our first
Thanksgiving alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was in the service and was stationed in Fort
Sheridan right outside Chicago. It was bitterly cold and snow
covered everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at Blue Cross as a receptionist and there were two
other wives of servicemen there who were also from Texas. Since we
were all homesick, we decided to spend Thanksgiving together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Cross gave all their employees a turkey at Thanksgiving,
so we had three turkeys for six people that year. Needless to say,
we ate turkey for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the early '40s, you just couldn't go out and buy
prepared food. Everything had to be cooked. Our cousin had gotten
into the turkey-raising business and he gave us one for
Thanksgiving. As a young bride, I had never cooked much at all,
much less a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama never let me cook; she wouldn't even let me come in the
kitchen except to set the table. She and her sisters would do all
the cooking and catch up on all the gossip, and they didn't want me
in there because I would tell the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, on our first Thanksgiving, we had a turkey and I
thought you boiled a turkey just like a hen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned you're not supposed to boil turkeys. It stank to
high heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since, I've always bought a smoked turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   May all your Thanksgivings be memorable ones.

FUR PHENOMENON HITS YOUTH MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Not for use before Thursday, Nov. 25) 
By DEANNA BRUSH 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fur is flying ... right out of the stores and into the
closets of little girls.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into any store that sells children's clothing, and you will
find tiny jackets lined with fake leopard skin and pint-sized
dresses with soft, furry collars.
</P>
<P>
   Little girls love wearing soft clothes with a nice feel;
remember that beloved velvet dress? Grandma's silk scarf? Your
favorite sweater?
</P>
<P>
   This fall, fake fur is the favorite. Karen Forster, owner of
Kute As A Button in Glendora, said her furry leopard line _
including jacket, skirt, pants, hat and purse _ is the hottest
seller and the hardest to keep in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Fake fur is warm and fuzzy, and it offers pleasant associations.
It is reminiscent of plush blankets and much-loved teddy bears. At
the same time, a fur garment makes the girls feel grown up,
sophisticated. And that has a lot to do with Mom.
</P>
<P>
   Girls see their mothers get all dressed up to go to work, so
they want to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emulating Mom is just a natural part of growing up for little
girls,'' Forster said. If Mommy finds fur fashionable, so does her
little girl.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion runways have had an influence as well. Fur fever was
hot in last year's design shows, and it has since trickled down
into local clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, children's fashions are becoming a big business.
</P>
<P>
   Even supermodel Kathy Ireland is getting into the world of
girls' clothing. This fall, she has a new line of accessories
called Just for Girls offered at Kmart. It is an array of fashion
necessities for the 14-and-younger crowd, including cozy fleece
hats, furry handbags, belts and sparkling hair accessories. Even
Mom would want to wear this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago, it was pinafores, petticoats and Mary
Janes,'' Forster said. ``Now the trend is to make little girls into
little women.'' While girls' fashions tend to reflect women's
styles, most stores try to keep to designs that are age
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line between what is `trend right' and what is
`mom right,' but we try to translate our fashions down, make them
sweeter,'' said Steve Moylan of Mervyn's California. ``For example,
sweater sets come attached so that no shoulders are exposed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Children's clothes tend to have a touch of whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to have fun when they get dressed,'' Moylan said.
``All the different elements like fur, zippers and a dog on the
front of the shirt do that for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it is cute and fun, little girls will even carry
around a purse with absolutely nothing in it, and that's OK,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fake fur fashions are easy to find at Target, Macy's, Mervyn's
and Kmart, as well as specialty children's stores. They tend to be
reasonably priced: velvet pants start at $11, furry hats and purses
range from $7 to $9. A swell leopard jacket is $44, fur-trimmed
shirts sell for about $20, and a dress and jacket combo is $52.

DEALERS REV UP PAY, TRAINING TO LURE AUTO MECHANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Auto mechanics are in such short supply that even
as dealerships are hiring all the qualified people they can find,
motorists sometimes have to wait a week to get a major engine
repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal would be to have only a wait of a day, but in the
summer rush, it can be a week if not more,'' said Bob Reepmeyer,
service manager at the New Country dealership for Ford, Lincoln,
Mercury, Subaru, Mitsubishi and Mazda vehicles in Saratoga County.
Because of the shortage, good mechanics are earning $60,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the shortfall of mechanics is estimated to be
between 60,000 and 75,000, said Dan Ashley, chairman of the
automotive programs department at Hudson Valley Community College
in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the students at Hudson Valley's three automotive
programs, with 100 students total, typically find jobs. Auto
dealers also are eager to take graduates of the less-advanced high
school training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Independent garages also are having a hard time finding
mechanics, Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   Auto repair workers fall into two categories in this era of
high-tech vehicles. Employees with lower levels of training can
change oil, handle front-end alignments and other scheduled
maintenance tasks, Ashley said. They are not as difficult to find
in the labor market, dealers said, and their pay tops out at around
$10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to find the qualified technicians, as they are now
known, to perform more complex engine diagnostics and repairs,
brake jobs or suspension repairs, said Bill May, service manager at
Saturn of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   These days, such technicians need community college-level
training or comparable on-the-job training in conjunction with the
auto manufacturers. And they will have to keep on training
throughout their careers to keep pace with changing technology,
Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of financial reward and job stability.
Technicians start at $7 to $10 an hour or roughly $20,000 annually,
just as their lesser-trained counterparts do. But the technicians,
Ashley said, ``will be in the $30,000 to $60,000 range in three to
five years.'' And bosses like Reepmeyer do whatever they can to
keep good technicians happy, so that other dealers don't steal the
employees away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, outdated perceptions and prejudices may be keeping new
people from finding out about all these career pluses, the dealer
service managers said. May blames ``the old grease-monkey
mechanic-type image'' many adults grew up with and may still
maintain, despite the advances in the field and career path.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honorable trade, the technology is wonderful,'' agreed
Reepmeyer, adding that the current technology of cars ``exceeds the
first rocket or more.'' The problem will grow more acute for
dealers trying to expand their service departments. New Country,
for instance, has 19 service bays now _ with 20 technicians _ and
plans to add 15 more bays in the coming months, mostly to handle
Ford and Mercury repairs.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he will have to think of something to get the workers.
After employees prove themselves, the dealer trains them for
higher-level work. Manufacturers such as Ford and Chrysler have
developed sophisticated training programs for both dealer work
forces and community colleges to keep a supply of technicians in
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to hire them, train them, and pay for their
training,'' Reepmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high demand, the field is now attracting more
women and older students returning to find a second career, Ashley
said. People trained in auto body repair also are in demand, Ashley
said.

HISTORIC DEERFIELD BECKONS AT HOLIDAY TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Nov. 25.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEERFIELD, Mass. _ The early Puritans of Massachusetts
celebrated only two annual holidays: Thanksgiving in November, when
they prayed and ate, and Fast Day in April, when they prayed and
didn't eat _ which made sense, since by spring they were almost out
of food anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Day did not make it onto the modern calendar, but
Thanksgiving survived, with its spirit of gratitude for food and
family pretty much intact. (Sorry, Fast Day. We really could have
used you, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The Puritans were festivity-phobes who scheduled the
Thanksgiving harvest festival so ridiculously late in the fall only
to take the sting out of having banned Christmas. So it's ironic
that they, of all people, created one of our best holidays. And an
accidental monument to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Over Thanksgiving weekend, modern families feel drawn to museum
villages like Historic Deerfield, Old Sturbridge Village, and
Plimoth Plantation, like homing pigeons heading for their roosts _
or is it roots?
</P>
<P>
   Though closed Thanksgiving Dary, Historic Deerfield will stage
its annual 17th-Century Celebration on Saturday, traditionally its
busiest day of the year. The day will feature handcrafts such as
spinning and boxmaking, demonstrated by the Springfield Society of
the 17th Century; period tavern music by An Honest Calling; and
open-hearth cooking demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   New Flynt Center &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will also be able to see Deerfield's newest attraction,
the Flynt Center of Early New England Life. This 27,000-square-foot
museum, designed by Philadelphia architect (and former Deerfield
intern) Tony Junker, displays many of the 2,200 pieces from
Historic Deerfield's collection of early artifacts that had been
crammed into Deerfield's historic house museums or packed away.
</P>
<P>
   William Brewster and Squanto never lived here, but old Deerfield
is nevertheless an appropriate place to celebrate Thanksgiving _ a
holiday so local, in its reverence for Pilgrims, cranberries, and
late fall root crops, that it used to be called ``Massachusetts
Thanksgiving.'' Its commemorative side dates from the 1820
bicentennial celebration of the Pilgrims' landing, according to
Historic Deerfield executive director Donald R. Friary. But it
started off as a simple state holiday; other states had their own
harvest holidays, usually much earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   So how did we get the rest of the country to celebrate ours?
Abraham Lincoln made it a national holiday to boost morale during
the Civil War, when just about every Union soldier had some ties to
New England.
</P>
<P>
   If the Southern states hadn't been on hiatus from the USA at the
time, Jesse Helms's own legislative forefathers would surely have
bottled up the proposed holiday in committee until Thanksgiving had
been retooled as a September feast of bacon and grits, with
mandated elementary school pageants about Virginia Dare and the
Lost Colony.
</P>
<P>
   So here's another item for the gratitude list: On this day at
least, from sea to shining sea, Massachusetts rules!  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pioneer life &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parochialism aside, old Deerfield has many amazing stories to
tell about the pioneer life here. And they're true stories, because
this is a real Colonial-era village, not a re-creation.
Interspersed among the private homes along the mile-long Main
Street are 14 museum houses owned by the nonprofit Historic
Deerfield Inc., which is admirably dedicated to accurate historic
research and education. You quickly learn that early life here was
pretty tough.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the surviving village itself is so pretty that exteriors for
the 1994 film version of ``Little Women,'' starring Winona Ryder
and Susan Sarandon, were shot here. Historic Deerfield retains the
aura of rural isolation that formed its frontier character. This is
partly due to the 947 acres of surrounding farmland preserved from
becoming housing and malls through the Deerfield Land Trust, formed
in 1990 with the motto ``1000 by 2000.'' That's acres and years.
</P>
<P>
   The land here, along the Connecticut and Deerfield rivers, is
good, so very good that its 18 feet of virgin topsoil must have
called like a siren to poor farmers three centuries ago. They began
to settle here in 1666 _ and gambled their lives to do it.
Deerfield was New England's northwesternmost settlement and one of
Massachusetts' bloodiest outposts. During the French and Indian War
(1754-63), the village was attacked three times. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Mansion families'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some of the survivors grew wealthy from farming _ and also
from provisioning British forts built even deeper in the
wilderness, as France and Britain jockeyed for possession of the
new land. The Flynt Center's first exhibit, ``Pursuing Refinement
in Rural New England: 1750-1850,'' which runs through 2001, curates
the treasures of these so-called ``mansion families,'' including
tea tables, tall clocks, and embroidered waistcoats.
</P>
<P>
   These seem like odd passions for people living without much in
the way of personal hygiene or comfort on the frontier. But the
scramble for status through expensive imported goods began almost
as soon as the first furrow was plowed. Even families who slept on
the floor of a single room would invest in an imported English
teacup to prove that they were still part of the civilized world. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Story of Eunice Allen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More slow to come than prosperity was security. A plain, locally
made chair in the exhibit documents the last Indian attack on
Deerfield with the carved inscription: ``Eunice Allen/Born June 6,
1733/Tomahawked Aug 25, 1746/Died Aug 16, 1818.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the ambush of this 13-year-old girl and her family
and friends, who were out for a day of haying, is the subject of
the sole surviving poem by America's first known African-American
poet. In 1746, the teenage Deerfield slave Lucy Terry wrote, in
part, how: &QL; 
 &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eunice Allen see the Indians coming
</P>
<P>
   And hoped to save herself by running;
</P>
<P>
   And had not her pettycoats stop't her,
</P>
<P>
   The awful creatures had not catch'd her,
</P>
<P>
   Nor tommyhawk'd her on her head,
</P>
<P>
   And left her on the ground for dead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(end poetry style)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Terry eventually married freedman Abijah Prince, won her
own freedom, and raised a large family in Vermont, where she died a
well-known storyteller and much respected citizen at 97. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Deerfield Massacre &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another fascinating artifact on display is a 1703 letter, which
the village purchased at auction at Christie's in June, voicing
fears of an impending attack on Deerfield and requesting aid. The
fears proved founded when, just before dawn on Feb. 29, 1704, 250
French soldiers and Indians slipped over the protective stockade
and killed 49 settlers in their homes. Many of Deerfield's
surviving citizens were marched 300 miles overland in midwinter to
Montreal, then part of New France. Another 24 who couldn't keep up,
primarily young children and women, died or were killed along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to their family's added despair, 29 of the captives, mostly
children, chose not to return home when they were given that option
several years later. ``It was a nice life for little children,''
explains Friary. ``The Indians were more child-centered than the
English tended to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of these children was 7-year-old Eunice
Williams, who became the subject of Yale historian John Demos's
award-winning 1994 history ``The Unredeemed Captive.''
</P>
<P>
   Deerfield's early history is bloodily at odds with the peaceful
popular image of the first Thanksgiving feast at Plymouth, shared
by English settlers and their Native American benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   But when the two groups weren't warring, the Indians helped the
Deerfield pioneers survive by selling them grain, according to
Suzanne Flynt, curator for the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial
Association, which among other things interprets Native American
life in the Connecticut River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1837 a party of 23 Indians from Canada arrived in Deerfield,
says Flynt, not to raid, but to visit their English ancestors'
graves. They were descendants of Eunice Williams and her Mohawk
husband. Nine generations later, Eunice Williams's descendants have
maintained their Deerfield ties as advisers to the association's
Memorial Hall Museum. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Indian crafts museum &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This museum, which is unrelated to Historic Deerfield Inc.,
displays Indian crafts and is open May through October, but by
appointment only Monday through Friday (413-774-4466) during the
winter months.
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday at 4 p.m., Historic Deerfield staff member Carroll
Durant will give a talk about how the holidays have been celebrated
in Deerfield through the centuries, then will lead an
extended-hours lamplight walk through the village to view holiday
decorations. Tickets are limited to the first 50 people who request
them from Hall Tavern that day.

AS THE MEDIA MERGE, THE PUBLIC YAWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Thursday, Nov. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nov. 18 page-one Washington Post story had a familiar ring.
The news was of another media mingling, this time an agreement
between NBC and MSNBC and the Post and Newsweek to share
information and resources.
</P>
<P>
   As has also become routine, the story warned that such corporate
``synergy'' was rife with potential journalistic conflicts. The
Post, for instance, had just in fact partnered with NBC owner
General Electric, a big defense contractor. ``The cultural and
civic consequences of this kind of corporate bonding are not
healthy,'' warned NYU professor Mark Crispin Miller.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of tsk-tsking about media mergers has become the big
journalism issue of the day. Last month, the Washington office of
Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public
Policy convened a seminar on ``the impact of mega-media mergers on
the quality of American journalism.'' The Nov. 29 issue of The
Nation magazine highlights the power of the nine moguls _ from
Disney's Michael Eisner to News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch to
CBS/Viacom's Sumner Redstone _ who increasingly control the flow of
information and entertainment. And the new issue of ``Brill's
Content'' invites readers to play the board game ``Media
Monopoly,'' in which eight mega-corporations vie for control of
``everything along the information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a pungent metaphor for these conglomerates, columnist
Norman Solomon says, ``this elephant, which has been in the middle
of the national media living room, is . . . pooping all over the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   But why hasn't the stench generated more public revulsion? For
if media watchers are united in their fear over what these
monopolies portend, they also agree that the issue of constricting
control of information outlets has simply failed to resonate with
news consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This inside-the-profession criticism doesn't connect in
people's everyday experience,'' says Robert Lichter, president of
the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ``The phenomenon of
consolidation and mergers doesn't cut in any clear way across a
range of issues . . . There's no constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, here's why the Post-NBC deal, the
CBS-Viacom merger, and CNN's linkup with Time Warner generate
little more than a collective yawn from the populace:
</P>
<P>
   Poor reporting. For all the hand-wringing by press critics, the
mainstream media do an incomplete job of covering these stories.
``There usually is almost a celebratory atmosphere around the
actual mergers when they occur,'' says Steve Rendall, senior
analyst for the liberal media watchdog group, Fairness &AMP; Accuracy
in Reporting. (A survey of newspaper headlines about September's
CBS-Viacom deal does reveal the frequent use of upbeat matrimonial
phrases like ``media marriage,'' ``a merger for the ages,'' and
``opposites attract.'')
</P>
<P>
   Critics also complain that these stories are often reported from
the business angle with scant attention to consumer issues. And as
Solomon notes, many major media outlets _ themselves the products
of consolidations _ are in no position to seriously examine the
issue. ``What's Tom Brokaw going to do?'' Take ``a tough look at
the Strategic (NBC/Post) alliance?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the evidence? ``It's one thing to worry about this,''
says Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the Media Research
Center, a conservative watchdog group. ``It's another thing to see
how it works in practice.'' Andy Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center, jokes that if NBC soft-pedaled the fact that a new
GE toaster ``makes you sterile,'' viewers might understand the
downside of corporate synergy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the evidence of that downside is not so much
in the stories you see, but in the stories you won't. (One of the
more notable examples was an ABC News decision to kill a 1998
report about pedophiles working at the Magic Kingdom park owned by
corporate parent Disney.) ``People never notice the stories that
don't get reported,'' says Lichter. ``It's hard to prove a
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham points out that even as fewer companies own more media
properties, people feel bombarded with fragmenting media options.
Where once you had Walter Cronkite and the local paper, he says,
you now have ``three all-day news channels . . . and can read The
Washington Post'' on line. In this environment, media monopoly fear
is a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Media and merger fatigue. When banks and HMOs merge every day,
it's difficult for a benumbed public to get alarmed when the same
thing happens to a newspaper or network. ``The whole notion that
corporations are just going to keep gobbling each up, that's been
normalized,'' says Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Media critic Jon Katz says ``the public has become profoundly
jaded,'' about both news conglomeration and the credibility of the
news. ``There was always a predeliction against the appearance of
impropriety,'' he adds. ``That's really been blown away in the
current America.''
</P>
<P>
   People see ``the connection between the power structure and
media in a general way,'' adds Kohut. And in a recent survey by the
American Society of Newspaper Editors, 78 percent agreed that
``powerful people or organizations'' can influence the news, with
politicians and wealthy people at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if Pew would ever survey the public specifically about
the impact of media conglomerates on the flow of news, Kohut says,
``I would never think to ask that question . . . It's beyond their
powers of observation to see.''

CHASTENED, SHE'S HERE TO HELP WITH `MILLIONAIRE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Thursday, Nov. 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I &UR;  &LR; found your column on the TV show `Millionaire' offensive,''
writes John McKenna of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one. A number of readers took precious time
out of their busy schedules to castigate and revile me for
suggesting that a large part of the appeal of the television
program ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is that it allows viewers
to ``feel intellectually superior to the morons who try and fail to
answer the idiotic questions.''
</P>
<P>
   I apologize. Perhaps ``morons'' was putting it too harshly. If I
had it to do over again, I'd choose another word. Knuckleheads,
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   There I go again. Will I never learn?
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, though, McKenna et al. are right. I was wrong. It was
unfair of me to suggest that anyone (besides myself) would be
perverse enough to watch ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' for the
pleasure of reveling in the losers' stupidity, especially when the
real appeal of the show is so obvious. It's all about greed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's part of another message: ``From your comments I'd think
you were the most intelligent person to walk the face of the earth.
How much money have you won on `Millionaire' or `Jeopardy' or
`Wheel of Fortune' for that matter?''
</P>
<P>
   None, sad to say, which proves how stupid I am. Apparently, the
way to prove you're intelligent these days is to rack up big money
on a quiz show, or big money anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ``Millionaire'' fans are greedy, thank heavens. For
some, it's just good, clean fun. ``Although I did answer some of
the questions that some of the participants had trouble with,''
McKenna modestly admits in his endless e-mail, ``my overwhelming
feeling was not one of smug, intellectual confidence. Rather, I
found myself vocally cheering on the participants (I know they
couldn't hear me).''
</P>
<P>
   If only the contestants could hear McKenna. He has wisdom to
share. ``Remember that intellectual capability is something one is
born with,'' he warns. ``A compassionate character is something one
must attain.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that your final answer, John?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure just what intellectual capability has to do with
knowing what it was that Bo-Peep lost. (Sheep. Do I get the money
now?) But McKenna is right about my lack of compassion for the
contestants. I must try harder to attain a compassionate character,
and as part of my new compassion initiative I have decided to help
readers prepare to compete on the show by formulating a series of
practice questions similar to those posed on ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   First question: What beverage comes from a cow? a) beer b) Tang
c) Perrier d) Yoo Hoo
</P>
<P>
   (Tip: This is a ``trick'' question, so don't blurt out the first
answer that comes to mind.)
</P>
<P>
   Next question: How many teaspoons are in a tablespoon? a) two b)
four c) three d) six
</P>
<P>
   (Whoops. My advisory panel informs me that this question has
actually been asked on ``Millionaire,'' where it stumped a
contestant. Well, it is a toughie.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's try another question: The fictional character Little Miss
Muffet sat on a) a tisket b) a tasket c) a tuffet d) a chaise
longue.
</P>
<P>
   (You may want to call your kids to help with this one.)
</P>
<P>
   Final question: Which network is the game show ``Who Wants to be
a Millionaire'' on? a) NBC b) ABC c) Fox d) XYZ
</P>
<P>
   (Be careful. All the networks will soon have ``Millionaire''
clones.)

ROLL DOWN THE WELCOME MAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Marty Meehan sat through a
fascinating presentation the other day on one of the major and
largely unheralded sources of economic growth in the 1990s (that
would be immigration), and then piped up with an observation of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Here you have a significant contributor to the expansion of the
American labor force and in the case of the Massachusetts
Democrat's region, the only reasons for growth. You also have a
major reason that a very tight labor market has not become an
economy-crippling, absolute shortage of skilled workers, and
throughout the decade the only things government has done have been
mean-spirited measures designed to roll up the welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly after the alleged successors to free market guru
Ronald Reagan took over Congress five years ago, there has been a
punitive immigration statute, several punitive provisions in a
statute reforming welfare, and a successful and divisive initiative
campaign in California to deny basic social services to immigrants
and obliterate the distinction between legal and illegal
noncitizens in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the California mess produced an
antinativist backlash across the country. The momentum behind the
punitive stuff is gone. But in a conversation after absorbing a
fresh round of head-turning data, Meehan agreed that the first
order of governmental immigration business in a fresh decade ought
to be sweeping the statute books clean of all the junk that the
roll-up-the-gangplank crowd has put there.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't gonna happen; too many Pat Buchanan wannabes in both
political parties. But the fact is that a country serious about
maintaining its prosperity past next year ought to be investing in
the legal immigrants (and their kids) who are going to be needed to
sustain this growth.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for supporting a digestible pace of
legal immigration is anything but economic. In a democracy, nothing
invigorates the society like fresh blood. For all the phony
political rhetoric dispensed about subjects like bilingual
education, the more important point is that for those native-born
Americans who bother to listen, immigrants teach us and remind us
of more than we have to teach them; and they give much more than
they get.
</P>
<P>
   Especially recently.
</P>
<P>
   In another landmark report on the phenomenon (the first was four
years ago), the best little policy shop in New England, MassINC,
has pulled together the facts that demonstrate that the labor force
in the region would be smaller by nearly a quarter-million people
had it not been for immigration. In Massachusetts more than 80
percent of the labor force growth this decade is due to foreign
immigration. In the country, the only similarly dependent states
happen to be neighbors _ Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and
New Jersey _ where the out-migration of the native-born to the Sun
Belt continues.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect summing up of the contrarian implication, CEO Larry
Fish of Citizens Financial Group (the vibrant banking organization
that published the study) said that in the Northeast the economy
has been growing because of, not inspite of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Fish also noted the essence of what makes this Third Wave
different from the First (Irish) and the Second (Italian and
German). This time, no country is producing more than 10 percent of
the new residents, but more than half of the immigration is
nonwhite, Fish noted, and it is very young. And here's the
eye-catcher: one of every four kids in Massachusetts under the age
of 18 is foreign-born or a child of immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   There are some encouraging trends in the ongoing flow. Above
all, one in three foreign arrivals in Massachusetts has at least a
bachelor's degree, up from barely one in five 10 years ago, which
is still roughly the rate nationally.
</P>
<P>
   However, the incidence of poverty among immigrants is triple the
rate for native-born families, and as always educational levels and
family structure are the critical variants. For example, more than
10 percent of the kids in families headed by a couple were poor at
the time of the 1990 census, compared with two-thirds of those in
single-parent households. But while the poverty rate was still 30
percent in single-mother families where the mother held at least a
bachelor's degree, it was more than 80 percent where she did not.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to MassINC's work, we know that the kids in immigrant
families are central to the state's economic future, as they are
nationally. However, as Meehan observed, we would not know that by
looking at public policies. Ideally, we should be governed by a
strict standard of parity where legal immigrants and the
native-born are concerned. But we're not.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that absurdity with the MassINC study's conclusion
about the future:
</P>
<P>
   ``Given current and forthcoming demographic developments in our
state including low fertility, limited population growth, net
out-migration of younger native-born workers and the aging of our
population and labor force, foreign immigration will likely
continue to play a key role in determining the future growth rate
of the state's population, the future size of its labor force, and
it s future economic and job growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, here they come.

ISSUES OF HEALTH TURN PERSONAL DURING BUDGET DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week rarely goes by without Senator Connie Mack
telling some group about the disease that cut through his family.
His mother beat breast cancer but died of kidney cancer. Cancer of
the esophagus took his father. Mack, his wife, and his daughter
have all survived different forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Mack has dedicated his political career to his
brother, Michael, whose final month became a long conversation
about the purpose of life. The talks prompted Mack to run for
Congress, where he has recounted his brother's death from cancer at
age 35 countless times in a crusade for more medical research
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a Florida Republican, and many other lawmakers have
increasingly cited personal experiences with disease in pushing for
new health policies. When Congress approved another record budget
increase for medical research last week, the third in a row,
advocates said one major reason was that several key lawmakers had
seen the effect of disease on their own families.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the National Institutes of Health will jump more
than 14 percent this year, far ahead of the estimated 5 percent
raise in total discretionary spending. Following a 14.6 percent NIH
raise last year, the boost will mean millions of additional dollars
for labs in New England hospitals and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Research budgets are only one area where lawmakers cite their
own health histories in crafting policy. Senator Jesse Helms, a
North Carolina Republican, usually opposes any bill that tells
private companies how to conduct business. But he has teamed with
Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy on a bill to require health
insurers to pay for colon cancer screening tests. Helms is a former
prostate cancer patient, and his wife survived colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Republican, broke with
a large segment of the antiabortion movement to back federal
research using stem cells, most often derived from human embryos.
``As the father of a daughter with juvenile diabetes, I know
firsthand the devastating nature of this disease,'' Thurmond said,
adding that stem cells hold hope for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   And when advocates began pushing for a big boost for the NIH,
they had significant help from lawmakers _ even some of the most
budget-conscious Republicans _ who talk freely of what new cures
would mean to their own lives. Many lawmakers support doubling the
1998 NIH budget in five years, and Congress has voted two years
running to stay on track toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the broad support. Some lawmakers
are convinced that investment in medical research helps cut
Medicare and other health costs and boosts the economy by
developing ideas later picked up by private companies. But
lawmakers also act out of emotion as well as reason, and nothing
tugs on the heart like a bout with disease.

   ``When someone close to you is fighting for their life, it
forces you to learn a lot about a subject that before you did not
pay attention to,'' said Mack. ``As a result of trying to find the
latest information, you learn of all the different breakthroughs.
And it doesn't take long to figure out that those breakthroughs
came because of the federal investment in research.''
</P>
<P>
   As this year's research budget wound its way through Congress,
several of the lawmakers involved had already made a funding boost
a personal cause.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Arlen Specter, who underwent heart bypass surgery last
year and had a benign brain tumor removed in 1993, is chairman of
the Senate's health-spending subcommittee. He guided that panel to
approve a $2 billion increase for the NIH, far more than President
Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIH is really the crown jewel of the federal government,''
said Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania. ``It may be the only
crown jewel of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers wanted more. Representative John Porter,
Specter's counterpart in the House and a Republican from Illinois,
said it would take $2.3 billion to keep the NIH budget on track to
double in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figure was backed by Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee. Stevens, a Republican from
Alaska, had surgery for prostate cancer in 1991. The boost will
take the annual NIH budget to nearly $18 billion in 2000, up from
$13.6 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers who push for more medical funding include
Kennedy; Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who lost
a husband to colon cancer; and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, the senior
Democrat on Specter's health-spending subcommittee. One of six
children, Harkin lost a brother recently to thyroid cancer, and
another brother is in the late stages of prostate cancer. Earlier,
both of his sisters died of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Those sisters had helped raised him, as Harkin's mother died
when he was young and his father was in poor health. ``My sisters
weren't poverty-stricken, but they were low-income and they didn't
have a lot of money to go for checkups and things like that,''
Harkin said Monday in a phone interview from Cambridge, Mass.,
where he was visiting the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin recalled the funeral of his oldest sister, Mary Ann.
``All of us were there. And I would say a year and a half after
that, Sylvia died of breast cancer . . . . That was incredible,
when Sylvia came down with it. It was so rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack has been one of the most public lawmakers in talking about
disease in his family. At one public hearing, he called for more
gene research in hopes that scientists would create a screening
test for melanoma, the cancer that took his brother Michael. More
recently, Mack called for better pain management, saying his
brother was unnecessarily denied a certain pain medication because
doctors feared he would become addicted to it. Mack said that
notion conflicts with scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say that it has also become easier to support medical
research because the various groups seeking funding are battling
with one another less often.
</P>
<P>
   For example, said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania
Republican, the diabetes groups ``were feuding with each other,''
with one pushing research, one promoting better treatment for
people with the disease, and one lobbying for more patient
education. Now they are united behind a bigger NIH budget. But
hinting at other rivalries, Weldon said diabetes research deserves
a bigger share of NIH dollars than other diseases because new
treatments will have the biggest affect on overall health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   With health research so well-regarded in Congress, advocates for
other types of research are trying to leverage that support to
boost their own causes. The Science Coalition, a group of 60
universities, recently ran advertisements in a Capitol Hill
newspaper that linked the physical sciences to health. One noted
that MRI technology relies on physics and engineering to help
doctors map the body. Another highlighted the ``pharmacy on a
chip,'' a computer device that helps doctors program the dosages of
dozens of drugs to a patient at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease is nonpartisan, and it affects people personally,''
said Gene Sperling, a senior economic aide to Clinton. ``That has
clearly led to a greater commitment for long-term investment in
research. It seems to have taken hold in a nonideological way.''

 &HT;    MADD GIVES NATION C-PLUS IN WAR AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the heavily traveled Thanksgiving
holiday, Mothers Against Drunk Driving on Tuesday gave the nation a
C-plus grade in the war on drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indifferent government leaders, strained law enforcement
efforts and a dangerous public perception that the fight against
drunk driving has been won'' have compromised attempts to halt
alcohol-related traffic deaths, said MADD national president
Karolyn Nunnallee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. received a ``C'' in 1996, the last time MADD issued
drunk driving report cards. This year's grade indicates a 7 percent
drop on DUI deaths since then, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to MADD, nearly 16,000 people were killed and 900,000
were injured in drunk driving accidents last year. If the decline
in DUI deaths continues at a ``turtle's pace'' the national goal of
11,000 deaths or less will not be reached by 2005, Nunnallee said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rating the States Report Cards graded the states' and
nation's performance in nine areas, including public awareness,
criminal sanctions, victim issues and laws. California earned an
``A'' in all categories. North Carolina, Florida and Utah received
``A-'' grades. Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota received the
lowest grades, all earning a ``D-.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also called for more attention to underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The drug of choice for many young people, alcohol kills more
teenagers than all other illegal drugs combined, said Darryl
Hansen, president and chief executive officer of GuideOne
Insurance, a co-sponsor of MADD's study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of fatal crashes involving teens is much higher than
it is for adults,'' Hansen said.

STEVE ALLEN  WRITES MUSICAL `CHRISTMAS CAROL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Not for use before Wednesday, Nov. 24) 
(Eds: Fact box at bottom)  
(Eds: Second graf reworked) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; There have been great ``Christmas Carols'' and deadly
``Christmas Carols,'' high-tech productions at Madison Square
Garden and thrift-shop productions in suburban church basements.
</P>
<P>
   But there had never been a live musical version of Charles
Dickens' timeless holiday parable _ or so Allen thought when he
decided to sit down and write one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me one of the best ideas that I had ever had,''
says Allen, whose tuneful adaptation of Dickens' seasonal classic
will have its world premiere tonight at Theatre West, across from
Universal City. ``I could not believe, however, that I was the
first to ever think of it _ and indeed I was not.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that a bunch of overqualified Brits, including
Albert Finney and Alec Guinness, had beaten Allen to the punch with
the 1970 musical feature film ``Scrooge.'' Released in the
Oscar-winning wake of ``Oliver!'' _ another Dickens novel turned
musical property _ ``Scrooge'' is memorable today mainly for the
image of Finney romping through faux-Victorian streets warbling
``Thank You Very Much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't there room for another try?
</P>
<P>
   There was, and now Allen has written 17 songs for it with titles
such as ``We Are One,'' ``Greed'' and a pull-out-the-hankies number
called ``God Bless Us Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me there had to be a song sung by dear little
Tiny Tim called `God Bless Us Everyone,' because that's the
best-known line,'' says Allen. ``Fortunately, Dickens is easily
accessible. You can take chunks of conversation just as written.''
</P>
<P>
   Starring as world-class skinflint Ebenezer Scrooge will be
Harold Gould, the five-time Emmy nominated actor (``Rhoda,'' ``The
Golden Girls'') who recently starred in the Pasadena Playhouse
production of ``Visiting Mr. Green.'' Allen will appear onstage at
most performances as Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   A prodigious actor, composer and author of 53 books, and the man
who created and first hosted ``The Tonight Show,'' Allen has led
popular culture more often than he has followed it. At 78 he still
puts in a full seven days of work, either at his Encino home or his
Van Nuys-based Meadowlane Enterprises (named for his wife, actress
Jayne Meadows), where he keeps a handful of hard-working assistants
on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing songs comes easily to Allen, so easily that he composed
one of his major hits, ``This Could Be the Start of Something
Big,'' in his sleep (he says the song came to him in a dream).
Officially, he's the world's most prolific songwriter, with more
than 8,000 composing credits, including ``Impossible.'' You can
look it up in the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why hide the point?'' he says evenly. ``I can write beautiful
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allen, once called ``the most talented man in America'' by
no less a multifaceted talent than Noel Coward, makes no particular
claims for what he refers to as his ``freakish'' musical aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have understanding of it. I don't even read music.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he take credit for having any special new insights into
``A Christmas Carol's'' enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Dickens scholar,'' he says. ``I'm not a scholar of
any kind. In fact I never even graduated from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly credentials or no, Allen is happy to chat about his
new show in relation to, say, the social theories of Metternich and
Marx or the formation of the modern welfare state. He believes that
``the question of what the rich should do about the poor, in fact,
(is) more with us today in some ways than it was when (Dickens) was
writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to do something (to assist the needy),'' he
says. ``That's just common sense. But common sense isn't very
common.''
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season, if you stop by the rescue-mission shelters
in downtown Los Angeles you may spot Allen and his wife serving a
holiday meal to the homeless, as the couple does every year.
</P>
<P>
   But you're more likely to find him shepherding some of his 12
grandchildren to Theatre West to witness a new musical about a very
lucky old man who somehow finds a way to grow happier with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, of all the things I've done, my favorite
role is Grandpa,'' Allen says. ``I've just noticed when I'm with
the kids, my face smiles more.''

THICK AND THIN OF SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My grandmother sometimes began Thanksgiving by serving a soup
thick with mushrooms, meat and barley that was too filling. But a
lighter soup made with mushrooms, one that stimulates the appetite,
is always a good idea. And a soup that can go either light or rich
is the best idea of all.
</P>
<P>
   There are two approaches here, both of which take less than half
an hour, beginning with reconstituting dried mushrooms. In 10
minutes of simmering, dried mushrooms produce a flavorful broth. In
that same time, you can saute some fresh mushrooms. When both are
soft, they can be combined and thinned out with broth, and you have
soup. (Remember to strain the dried mushroom liquid extremely well,
through a sieve lined with cheesecloth, a napkin or a towel, to get
rid of any grit.)
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients you choose determine whether you have a
light-tasting, low-fat, dark soup or a rich, creamy, light-colored
soup that appears more traditional. The low-fat uses olive oil,
tomatoes and parsley. The rich soup is made with shallots, as well
as butter and cream _ but not an outrageous amount of either one.
</P>
<P>
   Other choices involve the mushrooms. For the dried, you can
start with inexpensive dried shiitakes, which are readily available
in Asian markets (where they are also called black mushrooms), or
any other dried varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The best-tasting, though, are porcini (also called cepes), which
have come down about 50 percent in price over the last few years
and can be bought in many stores.
</P>
<P>
   For the fresh mushrooms, an assortment is best: cremini,
shiitake, portobello and oyster. You can simply use ordinary button
mushrooms, but if I were going to use a single type and shop in a
supermarket, I would choose shiitakes, which have much more flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs are optional, but the creamy soup is beautiful if finished
with chervil, and the leaner one is nice garnished with parsley. &QL; 
 &QL;

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're not likely to see the two animated s that hit DVD
and VHS on a future double bill because one of them is definitely
not for kiddies. But these two mismatched films, in their own ways,
are about how kids are a lot more in tune with what's right than
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' (Paramount; $29.99 on
DVD, $103.99 on VHS _ priced for rental), from Trey Parker and Matt
Stone, is as outrageously over-the-top, rub-it-in-your-face
potty-mouthed as the title implies. Unlike the Comedy Central
television show, there are no bleeps here to disguise the language.
It's also a vicious satire targeting _ among others things _ the
motion picture association's rating system, gun proponents and
hypocritical parents who ignore their children and blame everyone
else for their kids' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncut'' begins as the kids _ Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny _
bribe a homeless man to get them into Terrence and Philip's new
R-rated movie, ``Asses of Fire'' (if that offends you, this film
isn't for you), which is filled with vulgarity and profanity. The
kids take what they learn and show off their newly learned
four-letter words for the class, which lands them in trouble.
Looking for someone to blame for corrupting their kids, one of the
parents starts Mothers Against Canada. This escalates into war with
our northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncut'' _ which is filled with musical numbers, including a
nod to ``Les Miserables'' _ takes on such issues as ethnic
stereotyping and the lack of common sense when it comes to dealing
with kids and social issues. (In this case, everyone prefers
violence and bloodshed over bad words). You can't accuse the guys
from ``South Park'' of subtlety. The film is anarchistic in nature
(so were the Marx Brothers); more funny _ albeit sometimes
offensive _ protest than pointed commentary. But it works, even if
the constant stream of profanity is a little tiring (luckily, the
film is only 80 minutes). Considering what passes as humor these
days, ``Uncut'' is a critical success, though not for kids _ unless
you want to do a lot of explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, Kenny gets killed, but it's how he comes back that's
funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' (Warner; $25.98 on DVD, $22.95 on VHS), on
the other hand, is one of those sweet, intelligent films that you
wish your kids would want to see rather than ``Pokeman.'' Based on
a book by the late British poet laureate Ted Hughes, ``Iron Giant''
is the story of a boy, Hogarth, who befriends a robot after it
crash-lands from outer space in Rockwell, Maine, in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Being the height of the Cold War, suspicions run high and a
government agent pursues the robot while the boy tries to conceal
it from his mom. Eventually, as in ``South Park,'' paranoia
overtakes the scene with the army being called in. And as in
``South Park,'' the kids show more common sense than the adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iron Giant'' is a visually beautiful film, and the story keeps
cuteness to a minimum, keying on the characters and the moral. It
also benefits from terrific vocal talent, including Jennifer
Aniston, Harry Connick Jr. and John Mahoney. By the way, the DVD
(Warner; $25.98) features Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and a
half-hour documentary on the making of the film.

CONGRESS GOES HOME, THANK GOODNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress closed its doors for the year, veteran
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., didn't pretend to be approaching the
holidays in a jolly mood. ``The president has won,'' he said
grimly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the very same Bill Clinton who began 1999 in danger of
being convicted in the Senate on House impeachment charges managed
to get most of the legislation he wanted from a surly Congress
still itching to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans professed to see the political glass half full
rather than half empty, and insisted that the GOP-controlled
Congress had achieved many of its own goals. House Speaker Dennis
Hastert marched to a news conference with his troops behind a
tootling bagpiper to dramatize the party's claim to having rescued
Social Security funds in the Scots' legendary tight-fisted way.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing off on vacation, members of Congress left behind a
mountain of unfinished business, a revitalized Democratic
leadership, a pleased president and spreading election-year
tensions. It was not quite a do-nothing Congress, as Democrats
would have us believe, but it came close.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly it was occupied with inconclusive anti-Clinton and
pre-election maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   This partisan stalemate was frustrating to insiders but actually
quite okay. No harm was done. When the president vetoed a massive,
GOP-promoted $792 billion tax cut, the public didn't care, and the
Republicans quietly dropped the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has no pressing business that cannot wait until
voters indicate in the 2000 election how _ or even if _ they would
like the logjam to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans won only a teensy cut of roughly a third of 1
percent, allowing them to claim a symbolic victory but not enough
to jeopardize even those federal programs the party once threatened
to eliminate entirely.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders are trying to make the most of their thin gruel with
television commercials that take credit for stopping the Democrats
from ``stealing'' from Social Security to finance ``wasteful
spending.'' The Democrats counter with a stroll through a graveyard
where failed bills are buried under tombstones marked for
prescription drug benefits, patients' rights, minimum wage and gun
control, all issues high on the Democratic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Because domestic issues dominated the session, the mess that
foreign policy has become was largely ignored by the public. Senate
rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was a major
diplomatic blunder, for instance, amply demonstrating that the
partisan passion to undo Clinton doesn't stop at the water's edge.
The president was furious, but nobody else even blinked. This too
can await an airing in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Congress finally reached a budget deal acceptable to Clinton
because the GOP had no alternative. Congressional Republicans have
a losing hand when it comes to budget confrontations. They took the
blame for the government shutdown a few years ago and dare not
repeat that. And many voters have been skeptical of the GOP since
the impeachment debacle: 46 percent told the Pew Research Center
recently that they disapprove of the job GOP congressional leaders
are doing.
</P>
<P>
   The national mood, as measured by several polls, indicates that
most voters are contented these days and no longer receptive to the
hard-edged anti-government rhetoric that swept former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and GOP conservatives into control of Congress. This
message has not penetrated the thick skulls of the current House
Republican leadership, but it has reached the two most important
GOP presidential candidates, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona
Sen. John McCain, who are presenting themselves as centrists.
</P>
<P>
   This should auger well for the Democrats, who tend to view
government as a friend rather than an enemy. It may be finally
helping Vice President Al Gore, whose slide in the polls is at
least temporarily slowing. A Newsweek poll has Bush leading Gore by
49 percent to 43 percent, a much closer trial heat than in recent
months, and Gore ahead of former Sen. Bill Bradley by nearly 20
percentage points nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But presidential and congressional politics are not identical.
Related, yet not twinned. The president is in the business of
proposing, the lawmakers, of disposing. And we all know that
proposing is easier.

`MANSFIELD PARK' PUMPS UP POLITICS, BUT STAYS TRUE TO AUSTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director/writer Patricia Rozema's daring, gorgeous
interpretation of Jane Austen's ``Mansfield Park'' shuns vapors and
swooning in favor of the author's satirical commentary upon class
and her times.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been a critical backlash, citing lesbianism
and a perverse focus on the slave trade that, in truth, is but a
wisp of subtext in Rozema's film even though it really exists in
Austen's 1814 novel.
</P>
<P>
   What Rozema has done is alter the nature of the book's
insufferable protagonist, Fanny Price, by pulling from Austen's
journals and writings and injecting some conviction, chutzpah and
outspoken rebelliousness into a heroine who has been termed ``a
monster of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanny (Frances O'Connor) is, as a child, called to Mansfield
Park by her aunt, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) to work as a
servant in the huge, ramshackle estate. Fanny and her family have
lived in squalor and abject poverty, and the move will give the
girl an opportunity to better herself in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter) owns Mansfield Park and, over
time, he and his large brood look upon Fanny as one of their own.
They watch her grow into a sturdy young woman who has a keen
imagination, a willful spirit and a secret love for her cousin,
Edmund Bertram (Jonny Lee Miller).
</P>
<P>
   When new neighbors, the seductive brother and sister Henry
(Alessandro Nivola) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz) Crawford, worm their
way into the Bertrams' social circle, alliances shift and Fanny
finds she may lose Edmund's friendship to Mary's wiles. Henry, a
shallow womanizer who sincerely believes he is in love with Fanny,
simultaneously begins to pursue the young woman with
</P>
<P>
   uncharacteristic ardor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Crawfords are not what they appear to be, nor is Sir
Thomas, who hides a terrible secret that has made him an object of
scorn and disdain to his oldest son, Tom (James Purefoy).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' is certainly a more daring, radically darker
and even naughtier version than the 1983 miniseries (which also
featured Miller), yet Rozema's sense of humor, near-theatrical
staging and whimsy and wit work well within the framework of the
story. She brings bite to the least popular of Austen's novels and
allows an underscored romantic yearning to remain in this deeper
work that stays true in spirit to Austen's original.
</P>
<P>
   She's also cast her film beautifully, with O'Connor giving a
heartfelt, knowing and multidimensional performance as Fanny. But
most of all, she has deconstructed the idealistic notion that a
realm as lush and opulent as Mansfield Park is romantic. In this
film, it harbors a crumbling morality and black heart that will
only regain its true beauty when every soul within discovers his or
her proper place in Austen's _ and Rozema's _ scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield Park. Directed and written by Patricia Rozema. Cast:

`END OF DAYS' IS TOKEN BIG-BUDGET FILM FOR APOCALYPTIC ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How is it that we've come within shouting distance of the
millennium _ a date that is, historically speaking, the biggest
anniversary of all our lives, and one absolutely pregnant with
exploitative possibilities _ and we haven't been inundated with
millennial apocalypse movies?
</P>
<P>
   Back in the days of drive-ins, we would have been swimming in
them by now. Think of what Roger Corman and American-International
Pictures in their 1950s heyday would have done with such an
opportunity. Hollywood has really let us down in this department.
</P>
<P>
   But not completely. We do have ``End of Days,'' one authentic,
big-budget-but-cheesy, special-effects-heavy, God-vs.-the devil,
end-of-the-world, millennial exploitation movie starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger, no less. And, if you don't think about it too hard,
it's kind of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Its premise has Satan coming down to Earth three days before the
end of 1999, and taking the form of the most devilish-looking
fellow he can find (Gabriel Byrne, who else?). Because, by some
mumbo-jumbo rules, if he mates with a certain, pre-selected
20-year-old (Robin Tunney) one hour before midnight on Dec. 31, the
world will be his.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for us, an alcoholic, ex-cop security guard (Arnold
Schwarzenegger) gradually stumbles on the plot after a band of
priests dispatched by the Vatican _ which knows all about this
satanic conspiracy and has been preparing for it for a thousand
years _ tries and fails to kill the young woman and she falls under
his protection.
</P>
<P>
   So Arnold's problem is to keep the priests from murdering
Satan's intended _who is basically an innocent and doesn't know
about her dark destiny _ on the one hand, while keeping the randy
devil (and boy, is he randy, engaging in all sorts of
computer-generated kinky sex scenes) from capturing and mating with
her before the ball drops in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Andrew W. Marlowe, the film makes absolutely no
sense, even on its own terms. The apocalyptic rules are as
convoluted and contradictory as they are in ``Dogma'' (a comedy to
which it bares an embarrassing resemblance), and it's never clear
just what the devil can and cannot do, or why he doesn't simply
wipe out the Austrian hunk with a swish of his tail.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the strangest of all Schwarzenegger vehicles in that
he spends the entire movie getting his behind kicked. Satan _ the
real Terminator of this movie _ knocks him around like he's Pee-wee
Herman. In one scene an elderly woman wipes up the room with him. A
mob of cults beat him to hamburger with baseball bats. He even gets
crucified (literally).
</P>
<P>
   In the last act, however _ after our mind clears from all the
dogmatic rules, after we stop laughing from all the unintentionally
funny scenes, and after Arnold decides he's taken enough abuse and
is racing to save the world as the clock ticks down to the final
moment _ the movie does finally kick in to be a credible action
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   End of Days. Directed by Peter Hyams. Written by Andrew W.
Marlowe. Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gabriel Byrne, Robin Tunney,
Kevin Pollak, CCH Pounder. Universal. 120 minutes. Rated R for
violence.

CHEMISTRY IN `FLAWLESS' HAS SOME IMPERFECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Schumacher has had a busy career in the '90s directing
big-budget Hollywood films like ``Batman Forever,'' ``The Client''
and ``Eight Millimeter,'' but he's never received any real critical
respect. In fact, he's widely regarded as a kind of studio hack.
</P>
<P>
   His new film, ``Flawless,'' is an attempt to correct that rude
perception. It's a lower-budget, grittier and riskier film starring
the always prestigious Robert De Niro. And this time, Schumacher
also wrote the screenplay: It's his first auteur film.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's not likely to do the trick for him. There's
a nice moment or two, and the two central performances are OK, but
it's grindingly predictable, and, for all its good intentions and
celebration of diversity, it finally just rings false as a human
drama.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a retired, divorced, politically conservative
security guard (De Niro) who lives a joyless life in a Lower East
Side apartment hotel next door to flaming professional drag queen
(Philip Seymour Hoffman) to whom he frequently hurls insults and
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   One night, while responding to shots fired in the building, he
has a stroke, and is left partially paralyzed with slurred speech.
When he doesn't respond to therapy, his doctor recommends singing
lessons from guess who? Yes, the transvestite next door.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he resists. But, despite the jeering of his macho
pals, he gradually takes the plunge, and finds himself becoming
drawn into the troubled world of his neighbor _ who is being
tormented by his violent boyfriend from one side and a band of
vengeful gangsters from the other.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, De Niro makes us believe this distasteful,
emotionally empty and rather stupid New York loner; and Hoffman
(``Boogie Nights,'' ``Happiness'') is just as credible as his
flamboyant but sweet-spirited musical tutor.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, the chemistry necessary for them to click as a
mismatched team doesn't happen. There are no surprises, no
convincing flashes of revelation, no truly precious moments. The
movie just seems contrived every step of the way..
</P>
<P>
   Flawless. Directed and written by Joel Schumacher. Cast: Robert
De Niro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Miller, Scott Allen Cooper,
Skipp Sudduth, Daphne Rubin-Vega. MGM. 111 minutes. Rated R for sex
and violence.

`TOY STORY 2' MAYBE EVEN BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGNIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film history tells us that when a hit movie becomes a franchise,
its successors invariably become a series of diminishing returns.
With very few exceptions, the rule holds that a number after a
title is a bad sign, and a sequel is never as good as the original.
</P>
<P>
   But with ``Toy Story 2,'' Disney and Pixar have gone all out to
make lightning strike twice, and, happily, it does. It not only
pushes the computer-generated film envelope to the very edge, it's
every bit as charming, funny and exciting as the original. In fact,
I enjoyed it quite a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   The story has the same set of characters in a new adventure. It
begins when Andy's mother holds a yard sale and Andy's favorite toy
_ Woody the cowboy doll (voice of Tom Hanks) _ gets mistakenly
included in the inventory and is shoplifted by a slimy toy dealer
(Wayne Knight).
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Woody is one of the few remaining survivors of a
merchandising campaign for a ``Howdy Doody''-like '50s TV puppet
show. The dealer is selling Woody _ along with co-puppets from the
show, Cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) and Stinky Pete, the Old
Prospector (Kelsey Grammer) _ as a package deal to a Tokyo toy
museum.
</P>
<P>
   So the other toys from Andy's room _ Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen),
Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), Rex
(Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) _ set out on a
perilous mission to track down the missing Woody and rescue him
before he's whisked across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   This involves, among many other dazzling sequences, a journey
across a busy city street that turns into a massive vehicular
pileup, a frantic search through a toy supermarket after hours, and
a James Bondian climax in an airport terminal that has to be one of
the most breathtaking animated sequences ever created by man or
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's not a single moment of this film that's not
wildly imaginative and utterly delightful. The inspired team of
filmmakers seems to have infused a playful inventiveness _ and
old-fashioned good taste _ into every frame so that altogether it
communicates a marvelous sense of awe, adventure and fun.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing advances in computer-generated effects are quite
noticeable. This new-generation of humanoid toys is even more
uncannily lifelike and filled with personality and charm. And while
the human characters still look slightly robotic, Andy's dog is so
real it's unsettling (and perhaps ominous for the future of dog _
and human _ actors).
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Toy Story 2'' is not all showy computer effects
and goofy kid humor. It has a subtle wit that will appeal to
adults, and several of its situations are poignant. Like ``Bambi,''
``Pinocchio,'' ``Lady and Tramp'' and the other great animated
classics of the Disney past, this one has a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Toy Story 2. Directed by John Lasseter. Screenplay by Andrew
Stanton, Rita Hsiao, Doug Chamberlin &AMP; Chris Webb. Voices: Tom
Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Don Rickles.
Disney/Pixar. 85 minutes. Rated G, suitable for all audiences.

 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Crichton may be derided by ``serious''
novelists, ``serious'' scientists and ``serious'' book reviewers
for his popular techno-thrillers, the latest called ``Timeline,'' a
story of quantum technology, time travel and 14th-century France.
</P>
<P>
   But he holds his own with armchair bibliophiles, who share his
love of scholarship, his urge to order anything published by an
academic press and his need for an oversize night table that can
accommodate the tower of books he is always in the midst of
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton, 57, has been churning out best sellers for 30 years,
since he was a dissatisfied medical student at Harvard, then
selling them to movie studios for blockbuster sums. But he is at
heart a perpetual graduate student, although one blessed with a
limousine, a grand house in Bedford Hills, N.Y., a personal
assistant and a marital history that includes four wives.
</P>
<P>
   His protean curiosity was nurtured as an undergraduate at
Harvard, where he graduated summa cum laude in anthropology. Under
the university's tutorial system Crichton would meet monthly with a
professor who would ask, ``What do you want to write about now?''
And the lanky scholar in the making would blurt out
``Neanderthals'' or ``natural selection'' and be sent off with a
reading list.
</P>
<P>
   He literally glows with the memory. ``I was so happy,'' he said
during an interview at the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum of
Art's repository of medieval art and architecture in Washington
Heights. ``I could have continued that all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way he has, with his nose mostly in a book, whether one he
is reading or one he is writing. To fashion 12 novels, each a
vessel of arcane and sometimes prophetic information, Crichton has
mastered genetic engineering, chaos theory, primatology,
international economics, Nordic history, fractal geometry and
airline deregulation, to name a few realms.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Timeline'' (published by Knopf) he had to become
proficient in the science of quantum technology and the history of
medieval Europe. So he read with a vengeance, more than 200 books
in all. It was a daunting list, not everybody's idea of bedtime
reading, including ``Arms, Armies and Fortifications in the Hundred
Years' War,'' ``Geons, Black Holes and Quantum Foam'' and
``Cathedral, Forge and Water Wheel: Technology and Invention in the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   The germ of most Crichton novels is a file folder for a topic
that grows fat with journal articles and soon gives rise to a
mountain of books. When a given interest will morph into a book is
a mystery to Crichton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as farming,'' he said. ``I have these seeds
planted and eventually, after many years usually, there's a crop I
can harvest. The subjective experience is: I start to think more
and more about a particular subject, and I can't let go. Usually
I'm not sure why.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates at the moment, Crichton said, are volcanoes,
hot-air ballooning, comets, the tiny kingdom of Bhutan, remote
Tibetan monasteries, Mongol horse culture, political intrigue in
the Italian Renaissance, the life of Leonardo, the American
Revolution, the behavior of plants, Capt. James Cook, the nation's
capital in the years immediately before World War II, nonlethal
weapons, the history of the acceptance of Freudian thought, and the
nature vs. nurture debate regarding child development.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of those topics, or another, rises to the level of
obsession, Crichton goes searching for a plot, usually by asking
himself questions: ``If somebody did that, what would happen?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Timeline,'' his musing led to a tale of three young
historians who, using quantum technology first proposed by the
physicist Richard Feynman in 1981, travel to medieval Europe and
find it a very different place than they imagined. Crichton knew
very little about the historic period, he said, but wanted his
characters to transport themselves to a chaotic time. Plus, he had
always been fascinated with knights in shining armor and wanted to
know what their lives were really like.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the 14th century because it was, he said, ``a time of
transition between the high and late Middle Ages, when the knights
had lost their military place.'' And it allowed him to set his
story in England and France, which were passingly familiar,
requiring just one 10-day field trip to ruined castles, accompanied
by a historian for hire.
</P>
<P>
   His ignorance, Crichton said, was boundless. ``I don't think I
knew what the Hundred Years' War was,'' he said. ``Henry, was he
king of England or France? What about John? Is King John the same
as King Jean? What are we talking about here? The Black Prince. Why
do they call him black? That one I never figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after he began writing, usually a discrete phase of the
process for Crichton, there would be annoying little facts that he
did not have. Each item of food, each building material had to be
true to the period. ``I'd go to bed each night with the book I
needed to fill in the missing information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific part of ``Timeline,'' dauntingly complex, was
less a research challenge for Crichton than a writing challenge.
``It's hard, really hard,'' he said of quantum technology, ``and
even if you kind of get it, it's hard to describe it. I rewrote
those sections a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The task was to avoid prose that a physicist would say is
correct but no layman would understand or, contrarily, that a
layman would understand but a physicist would laugh at. Instead,
Crichton aimed for the ``level where it would be OK for a high
school physics teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing, in the sense of style, is not Crichton's strong suit,
critics agree, although his driving narrative carries the reader
along. He describes the process as excruciating and filled with
idiosyncratic ritual. He writes seven days a week in a sparsely
furnished room that minimizes distractions. For the duration of
each book he eats the same thing for lunch every day and permits
himself little distraction except exercise and family. As the
writing progresses, he wakes up earlier and earlier each day, until
he is at the computer beginning at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In college and medical school, when he wrote to pay his tuition,
often under pseudonyms, legend has it that Crichton wrote a
prodigious 10,000 words a day. Now there are days when he writes
only four pages. He keeps obsessive track of his daily output
(``The measured variable is the one that improves,'' he said) and
recently ran the data through a computer to see if some books have
been more arduous than others.
</P>
<P>
   The results _ that the pattern is nearly identical from one book
to the next _ surprised him, but not his wife, Anne-Marie, who has
listened to his nightly angst since 1987. ``My subjective
experience is that each day is some fresh hell, as Dorothy Parker
once said,'' said Crichton.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the writing of one book and the researching of the
next overlap and sometimes a screenplay or the direction of one of
his movies interrupts. The television hit ``E.R.,'' which Crichton
created, does not consume his time anymore; the scripts are written
by others, and he merely cashes the residual checks.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow there has also been time for writing an autobiography _
largely about a New Age journey in the mid-1980s when Crichton
cured his writer's block by consulting psychics, bending spoons and
having his aura fluffed _ and for acquiring a modern-art collection
and writing a biography of Jasper Johns.
</P>
<P>
   With his Wunderkind credentials and sales figures that rival
McDonald's, Crichton would be easy to hate, or at least to envy. He
attempts to deflect that by being inconspicuous, no easy task for
someone 6 foot 9. He also adopts an ``I'm just a regular guy''
pose, as if he were baffled by his success and good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   He claims to have no idea why his books and movies are so
popular. He claims that he follows his own interests and does not
seek to be provocative or prophetic in his choice of topics. He
claims it is ``kind of bizarre'' how his life turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness has fallen at Fort Tryon Park, setting for the
Cloisters, and the museum has long since closed and the nearby cafe
has stacked its chairs and drawn its curtains. Crichton's limousine
idles nearby, its seats carefully adjusted to make room for his
NBA-length legs.
</P>
<P>
   He coils himself into the back seat and tells a story of a
recent visit to Yale. Crichton described the students as
respectful. Awed might be a better word. So he tried to loosen them
up with a jolt of modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I haven't given you the impression that I know what I'm
doing,'' he told them. ``I don't have a clue. I'm just stumbling
along like the rest of you.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Playing wordlessly through Lionel Ritchie and
Dire Straits, Iranian electric guitarist Nima Moghimi and his band
test their freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   They are a pop band in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the
right to rock is still fragile and thin. Though their instrumental
covers are tame by western tastes, they are right on the edge for
an edgy fundamentalist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric guitar,'' the stylish 22-year-old Moghimi
explains, ``is not familiar to my government.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the government is coming to understand popular music.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Iranian revolution 20 years ago,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini at times banned nearly all music. The
clerics, or mullahs in charge saw it as an instrument of western
corruption, dangerous for a country dedicated to religion and
fighting a war for existence against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Iran opened up to folk tunes, classical works and
balladeers singing in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the two-year-old government of President Mohammad
Khatami, even electric guitarists enjoy the freedom he has extended
to movie producers, newspaper editors and authors. Khatami's
popularity is especially high with young Iranians, who often
complain they have few outlets for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi's so-far-unnamed band played its first three concerts at
a small movie theater in Tehran last month. The shows, billed as a
``Pop Music Concert'' of ``Old Songs,'' sold out the theater's 400
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the musicians are not allowed to sing western lyrics,
their fans occasionally sing along to the songs they know. Western
pop is banned here. But, within private homes, Iran enforces its
social laws loosely and black-market cassette collections are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is forbidden, so the fans stay in their seats but clap
rhythmically to some tunes.
</P>
<P>
   A few female concertgoers even push through the post-concert
crowd for autographs. They wear the head scarves and overcoats
required by modesty laws, but the scarves show plenty of hair while
blue jeans and high-heels show beneath the hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the Beatles in Hamburg, but something new is
happening _ something beyond the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the government is interested in the arts,'' says
fan Navid Assar, a business student. ``It can be a kind of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big changes,'' says Saghar Amirazimi, reviewing the
show as music writer for one of Tehran's reform-oriented daily
newspapers. ``Before Mr. Khatami, the performance of popular music
was not like now. We had many concerts, but mostly folk music or
the Iranian symphonies.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, strobe lights flash but the seven band members, in
slacks and button-down shirts, mostly keep to their spots.
</P>
<P>
   The lead figure is Ehsan Sabuhi, an-18-year-old saxophonist
whose instrument fills in where lyrics would be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the sometimes-rowdy banter that western rock
stars share with their audiences, these shows have little talk. In
one break, 25-year-old bassist Amir Hossein Mostaed politely thanks
the people who truly make the show possible _ the Iranian
government's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The band had to give the ministry a tape and a live audition
before it won permission for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials are really doing their best, and trying to
improve and better things for people who can make a good
performance,'' says Khosro Mohadeth Khalesi, a music teacher who
formed the band.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that did not make it through the audition was the
band's name. Band members wanted to use a Persian tribal name, but
it was not approved.
</P>
<P>
   About six approved bands play pop music now.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other young musicians who sometimes gather in
private parties to play and sing lyrics at parties _ sessions prone
to raids from modesty police, fines or short detentions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the public bands stick to instrumentals. Khalesi's
selections include George Michael's ``Careless Whisper'' and Abba's
``Money Money.'' They also play their own compositions, mixtures of
western and Persian tones.
</P>
<P>
   The band members get paid just enough to cover expenses and
complain, like young musicians anywhere, that they do not have
enough money for good equipment or instruments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they hope to make a name for their nameless
group and expand their repertoire as Iran expands its freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi says that he still has to hold back some guitar riffs
that are too raucous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears are mine and my fingers are mine,'' he says. ``I
should play the things I like.''

<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Late one recent afternoon, a formation
of French soldiers in full combat gear escorted a few children and
women _ one pushing a baby in a stroller _ across the bridge that
divides this city in northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children were ethnic Albanians attempting to get
to their apartments in the Serb-dominated northern district. Facing
the soldiers and their wards across the bridge were maybe 100
watchful Serb vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   The barbed wire-draped span is the primary link between the Serb
and Albanian sides of town. It also marks the frontier between
Christian and Muslim worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, a French officer crossed the bridge to
give the edgy Serb men his word that his troops would allow no
Albanian men to cross. In exchange for this pledge, he demanded
safe passage for the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, women and children,'' responded one of the vigilantes as
the crowd pressed around the officer. ``But no men. No men!''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb men stared coldly as the women and children crossed and
vanished into the fading evening light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reality of peace in Kosovo: Heavily armed foreign
troops struggle each day to keep people who have shared this land
for centuries from ripping one another to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In south Kosovo, heavily armed American soldiers guard ancient
Serb Orthodox churches. Guard posts have been set up in the front
yards of elderly Serbs who otherwise would be defenseless. They
patrol neighborhoods in Humvees and respond to everything from the
crackle of firecrackers tossed in doorways as pranks to the
thudding blast of a rocket attack on a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers don't always prevail. In a cycle of revenge and
retribution, old men and women are beaten to death; young men are
kidnapped and murdered; churches and houses are plundered and
burned; cornfields are mined with devices meant to blow a man to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In the five months since 45,000 NATO troops rolled into Kosovo,
more than 380 people _ slightly more ethnic Albanians than Serbs _
have been murdered. Nearly 120 have been abducted, and more than
1,100 houses and businesses have been set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   As the international community struggles to bring order to this
troubled province, ethnic hatred remains the one intractable and
potentially mortal issue. It makes the once heralded vision of a
peaceful multi-ethnic Kosovo seem hopelessly idealistic. It also
deeply complicates the reality that Kosovo with its ethnic Albanian
majority remains the legal dominion of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and early summer, the Serb troops under the
leadership of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic herded the
Albanians out of Kosovo at gunpoint in what the world decried with
horror as ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many international observers here, the ethnic
Albanians have returned the favor through the summer and autumn.
Officials estimate that before the 78-day NATO air war that ended
in June, there were 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo. An estimated 70,000
remain, many too old, poor or stubborn to quit their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials expect the remaining Serbs to leave in the spring
when the diversion of surviving the winter gives way to renewed
rounds of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of ethnic violence are less frequent these days, but
this is most often explained by the simple truth that most of the
targets of the violence _ the Serbian and Gypsy minorities _ have
nearly ceased to exist in much of Kosovo. In Urosevac, a city in
the U.S.-patrolled region of southern Kosovo, only 28 remain of the
pre-war Serbian population of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital and largest city, the Serb
population has dwindled from about 20,000 before the war to perhaps
400 now, security officials say. Many of those who remained face
lives consumed by fear and a struggle for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   International aid and diplomatic officials here fear that ethnic
tensions will leave the world's community of humanitarian aid
donors cool to Kosovo as neither side seems worthy of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community did intervene in Kosovo to protect
human rights and not to pave the way for a new wave of ethnic
harassment and violence,'' said Daan Everts, the head of the Kosovo
mission for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``The population of Kosovo and their leaders must understand this
violence jeopardizes the international reputation and the standing
of Kosovo. It is likely to affect donors' sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   The runaway ethnic violence forced officials to downgrade the
status of a Nov. 17 international donors meeting in Brussels from a
celebratory gathering of top echelon national leaders to work
session of lower-level officials. Even so, the representatives of
47 donor countries and the European Commission pledged $1 billion
to finance Kosovo's recovery effort
</P>
<P>
   for one year. Yet, officials at the meeting expressed deep
reservations about the future because of the ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cline, a worker for Adventist Development and Relief
Agency, said the remaining Serbs tend to be the ones who could not
leave. ``These are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable,'' Cline
said. ``They're old, they're paralyzed. In many cases they've been
abandoned by their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Their protection often comes from a young soldier posted outside
their homes. ``Having an American soldier with a machine gun in
your front yard is a real deterrent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers can't stay forever. Unless the climate changes
dramatically, the fate of the remaining Serbs seems bleak at best
when the troops leave. ``In reality, if the KFOR troops weren't
here to protect them, they'd be dead,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities also
complicates relief efforts. Cline said the Albanians she works with
try to pressure her to keep her attention focused on the Albanians.
``They like to remind me why I came to Kosovo _ to help the
Albanian refugees, not the
</P>
<P>
   Serbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups often must tread lightly. For example, C.A.R.E.
International has been criticized for providing food assistance to
Serbs in the Urosevac/Ferajai district because not all needy
Albanians had been served first
</P>
<P>
   But if C.A.R.E. neglected the Serbs, the organization would be
criticized for ignoring a vulnerable minority. ``It's damned if you
do, damned if you don't,'' said Brendan McDonald, C.A.R.E.'s food
distribution manager for the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and villages, many houses were put to the torch
after the KFOR troops arrived. In one Urosevac/Ferajai neighborhood
of Gypsies _ called Romas in Kosovo _ more than 40 houses have been
burned by marauding Albanians. Albanians accuse the Romas of
collaborating with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald expressed a common frustration. ``It's hard when we
from the west tell them they have to stop the killing,'' he said,
while driving a C.A.R.E. vehicle by a Roma enclave ``They only get
angry and say, 'What right do you have to come here and tell us to
stop killing each other?' Don't you know what they did?'''
</P>
<P>
   An ache for revenge fills Rabit Njeti, 30, when he looks across
a pasture in the countryside near his burned out home in southern
Kosovo. A mile or so away stands a Serb village. There, Njeti
believes, lives the man who burned his home and belongings last
April. Njeti's three-story, 10-year-old house was the product of
two generations' labor and represented his family's future in
Kosovo. Now, the 14 members of his family struggle for shelter as
the winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people who do these crimes, we feel we need to take
the revenge,'' he said as he toured the charred interior of his
house. ``This is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say Serbs who didn't harm Albanians have nothing
to fear. But innocence and guilt are determined without benefit of
judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, a 73-year-old Serb woman was murdered in her
home in Mitrovica with an axe. In another case, a Serb farmer
discovered that mines with trip wires had been placed among the
stalks of his corn crop. Also in October, a U.N. staff member was
murdered in Pristina, apparently after he was overheard speaking
Serbo-Croatian in public.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials take little comfort from the role of the members of
the rebel army that went to war against Serbia, the dominant
republic in what remains of Yugoslavia. Former Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders have publicly condemned violence against Serbs and
have provided investigators a list of likely suspects in the crimes
against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a U.N. report also indicates that members of the Kosovo
Protection Corps, the militia residual of the KLA, have been
intimidating and beating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities blame the rebels for planting a landmine
that killed two Serb police a week ago near the boundary between
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In north Mitrovica, the 15,000 to 17,000 Serbs _ nearly twice as
many as before the war _ feel trapped and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   South of the river _ the Albanian side _ the town bustles. The
mood is triumphant. Markets are full of color with fresh meat and
produce. New lumber frames top houses burned in the war. Streets
are jammed with cars, military vehicles and the endless variations
of sport-utility vehicles bearing logos of U.N. agencies and
humanitarian relief groups that have spread across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   North of the river, there is little such activity. The dominant
color is gray. Reconstruction is rare. Basic supplies are short.
Children make a playground of the gnarled steel and stone of a
police station crushed by three NATO bombs in May. People still use
Yugoslavian dinars to trade, unlike the rest of Kosovo, which uses
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   Here people are angry at both NATO and at their government in
Belgrade, for stumbling into a war and then losing it and perhaps
Kosovo as well. They feel deserted and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica,
believes Kosovo ultimately may be ethnically cleansed of Serbs with
the help of what he considers tragically misguided Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, a former factory manager in Pristina, said the KFOR
soldiers believe they are in Kosovo to secure the province for
Albanians not to protect Serbs. Yet, he argues, it is the Serbs now
who are threatened with annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want a multi-ethnic Kosovo, and then they bring
in 800,000 Albanians and kick out 200,000 Serbs,'' he said. ``They
don't have enough courage to explain to the Albanians that they
didn't just come here to protect the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at contrived efforts to bring Serbs and Albanians
together, such as a proposal for mixed police patrols. ``To get six
Serbs and six Albanians in a patrol, you would have to have 15
French soldiers to keep them apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the sense of hopelessness has sparked an intense
desire to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Aleksic wants to escape with her husband and two
children and head for New Zealand, primarily because it is as far
away from Kosovo as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Her family lived in an apartment just south of the Mitrovica
bridge. She says they were forced to abandon the apartment, which
is now occupied by Albanians. They now live in a makeshift
apartment in the school where she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   She is bitter about the way Serbs have been portrayed to the
world, and she despises CNN because she believes the news network
unfairly demonized her people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not terrorists,'' she said over coffee in her
apartment. ``We are not dangerous. We are just family people. We
just want to work and live and have our children. We didn't do
anything to deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Her twin sister, Tanja Jaksic, says she often dreams longing
stories of living in what seems to her to be a black township in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that people there can go to these towns and no
matter what is going on elsewhere, they can feel safe there,'' she
says as she walks down a grim street in her part of the city.
``That's what I dream about, to have peace and to feel safe in my
own village with my own people.

MAKING OVER AN UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the third of eight columns by Patrick O'Connell, the chef
and an owner of the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Va.
They are written with Marian Burros.  
 By PATRICK O'CONNELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a kid, I always loved my mother's pineapple upside-down cake.
But as a chef, I knew it needed a drastic makeover to take it into
the next century. Losing the maraschino cherry was a no-brainer.
Getting rid of the cake's clunkiness was trickier.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered a caramelized Alsatian apple crepe we used to
serve, and tried substituting thinly sliced fresh pineapple. Its
acidity made the dessert more refreshing, and surprisingly, all of
the flavors I remembered from childhood were preserved in something
light and delicate.
</P>
<P>
   The crepe is a six-inch disk with thin slices of pineapple laid
on top in concentric circles and covered with an alluring golden
glaze. The caramelization created in the skillet tastes just like
the gooey brown sugar topping on the American classic.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the dish is that you are unaware of the crepe.
It's like a film holding the pineapple together. People are
sometimes afraid to make crepes because they think they have to be
paper thin. It's not necessary for this dish _ it will be equally
delicious if they are more like pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping them will take a little practice. The trick is to jerk
the pan forward with a quick flipping motion, then catch the crepe
as it lands upside down; people usually don't thrust the pan
forward with enough oomph. If you're worried about watching the
first few fall on the floor, ask the cat to stand by when you
practice, or put a plate over the pan, invert the pancake onto the
plate, then return to the pan, pineapple side down.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem like torture if you made the crepes while your
guests were waiting, but there's really no point. Just lay them on
greased cookie sheets and warm them just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CREPES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the crepe batter:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   For the topping: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large ripe pineapples, peeled, cored and cut lengthwise into
quarters
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter, plus 3 teaspoons for greasing the pan
</P>
<P>
   1 cup toasted, coarsely ground macadamia nuts
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   } cup heavy cream, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   { cup 151-proof rum
</P>
<P>
   10 to 12 miniature scoops vanilla, buttermilk or coconut ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   1. For the batter, combine flour, 6 tablespoons melted butter, 4
tablespoons sugar, eggs and salt in a food processor or blender.
With motor running, add enough milk (about 1 cup) to make a fluid
batter. The batter may be covered and refrigerated up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Line large baking sheet with parchment paper, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Slice pineapple quarters crosswise, [-inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a 7-inch nonstick pan over medium heat, melt \ teaspoon
butter, spreading with a spatula. Remove pan from heat, and allow
to cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   5. With pan off heat, ladle in about 3 tablespoons batter and
roll around pan until bottom is evenly coated. Sprinkle with 1
tablespoon macadamia nuts.
</P>
<P>
   6. Return pan to medium heat. Just as crepe sets, but while it
is still wet on top, remove pan from heat and arrange pineapple
slices in an overlapping circular pattern, completely covering the
surface of the crepe. Use a skewer or a fork to arrange any of the
pineapple slices that fall out of place. Shake crepe slightly to
keep it from sticking to pan.
</P>
<P>
   7. Return pan to heat, sprinkle pineapple with 2 teaspoons sugar
and about { tablespoon cold butter, cut in bits. Use a rubber
spatula to loosen edge of crepe and check underside. When bottom is
golden brown, loosen crepe by running a rubber spatula around edges
and carefully flip crepe over in pan. Continue cooking until sugar
underneath begins to turn a light caramel color. Add 1 tablespoon
cream around edges of crepe, and tilt pan so that cream blends with
sugar and runs under edges of crepe.
</P>
<P>
   8. Spray a flat metal surface like the bottom of a cake pan with
nonstick cooking spray. Place sprayed side over crepe, and invert
skillet to remove crepe. Slide crepe onto prepared baking sheet.
Repeat process, wiping pan clean between crepes, to make 10 to 12.
Sheet of crepes may be covered and refrigerated up to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   9. To serve, reheat crepes in a 350-degree oven until hot, about
4 minutes. Transfer to serving plates. Pour rum into small pitcher
or gravy boat and set aflame. Top crepes with burning rum. Garnish
each plate with a miniature scoop of ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

deeply complicates the reality that Kosovo with its ethnic Albanian
majority remains the legal dominion of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring and early summer, the Serb troops under the
leadership of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic herded the
Albanians out of Kosovo at gunpoint in what the world decried with
horror as ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many international observers here, the ethnic
Albanians have returned the favor through the summer and autumn.
Officials estimate that before the 78-day NATO air war that ended
in June, there were 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo. An estimated 70,000
remain, many too old, poor or stubborn to quit their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials expect the remaining Serbs to leave in the spring
when the diversion of surviving the winter gives way to renewed
rounds of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of ethnic violence are less frequent these days, but
this is most often explained by the simple truth that most of the
targets of the violence _ the Serbian and Gypsy minorities _ have
nearly ceased to exist in much of Kosovo. In Urosevac, a city in
the U.S.-patrolled region of southern Kosovo, only 28 remain of the
pre-war Serbian population of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the provincial capital and largest city, the Serb
population has dwindled from about 20,000 before the war to perhaps
400 now, security officials say. Many of those who remained face
lives consumed by fear and a struggle for basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   International aid and diplomatic officials here fear that ethnic
tensions will leave the world's community of humanitarian aid
donors cool to Kosovo as neither side seems worthy of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community did intervene in Kosovo to protect
human rights and not to pave the way for a new wave of ethnic
harassment and violence,'' said Daan Everts, the head of the Kosovo
mission for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
``The population of Kosovo and their leaders must understand this
violence jeopardizes the international reputation and the standing
of Kosovo. It is likely to affect donors' sympathy and support.''
</P>
<P>
   The runaway ethnic violence forced officials to downgrade the
status of a Nov. 17 international donors meeting in Brussels from a
celebratory gathering of top echelon national leaders to work
session of lower-level officials. Even so, the representatives of
47 donor countries and the European Commission pledged $1 billion
to finance Kosovo's recovery effort
</P>
<P>
   for one year. Yet, officials at the meeting expressed deep
reservations about the future because of the ethnic tensions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The task ahead is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Cline, a worker for Adventist Development and Relief
Agency, said the remaining Serbs tend to be the ones who could not
leave. ``These are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable,'' Cline
said. ``They're old, they're paralyzed. In many cases they've been
abandoned by their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Their protection often comes from a young soldier posted outside
their homes. ``Having an American soldier with a machine gun in
your front yard is a real deterrent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers can't stay forever. Unless the climate changes
dramatically, the fate of the remaining Serbs seems bleak at best
when the troops leave. ``In reality, if the KFOR troops weren't
here to protect them, they'd be dead,'' Cline said.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities also
complicates relief efforts. Cline said the Albanians she works with
try to pressure her to keep her attention focused on the Albanians.
``They like to remind me why I came to Kosovo _ to help the
Albanian refugees, not the
</P>
<P>
   Serbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups often must tread lightly. For example, C.A.R.E.
International has been criticized for providing food assistance to
Serbs in the Urosevac/Ferajai district because not all needy
Albanians had been served first
</P>
<P>
   But if C.A.R.E. neglected the Serbs, the organization would be
criticized for ignoring a vulnerable minority. ``It's damned if you
do, damned if you don't,'' said Brendan McDonald, C.A.R.E.'s food
distribution manager for the area.
</P>
<P>
   In the towns and villages, many houses were put to the torch
after the KFOR troops arrived. In one Urosevac/Ferajai neighborhood
of Gypsies _ called Romas in Kosovo _ more than 40 houses have been
burned by marauding Albanians. Albanians accuse the Romas of
collaborating with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald expressed a common frustration. ``It's hard when we
from the west tell them they have to stop the killing,'' he said,
while driving a C.A.R.E. vehicle by a Roma enclave ``They only get
angry and say, 'What right do you have to come here and tell us to
stop killing each other?' Don't you know what they did?'''
</P>
<P>
   An ache for revenge fills Rabit Njeti, 30, when he looks across
a pasture in the countryside near his burned out home in southern
Kosovo. A mile or so away stands a Serb village. There, Njeti
believes, lives the man who burned his home and belongings last
April. Njeti's three-story, 10-year-old house was the product of
two generations' labor and represented his family's future in
Kosovo. Now, the 14 members of his family struggle for shelter as
the winter approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people who do these crimes, we feel we need to take
the revenge,'' he said as he toured the charred interior of his
house. ``This is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians say Serbs who didn't harm Albanians have nothing
to fear. But innocence and guilt are determined without benefit of
judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, a 73-year-old Serb woman was murdered in her
home in Mitrovica with an axe. In another case, a Serb farmer
discovered that mines with trip wires had been placed among the
stalks of his corn crop. Also in October, a U.N. staff member was
murdered in Pristina, apparently after he was overheard speaking
Serbo-Croatian in public.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Officials take little comfort from the role of the members of
the rebel army that went to war against Serbia, the dominant
republic in what remains of Yugoslavia. Former Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders have publicly condemned violence against Serbs and
have provided investigators a list of likely suspects in the crimes
against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   However, a U.N. report also indicates that members of the Kosovo
Protection Corps, the militia residual of the KLA, have been
intimidating and beating Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities blame the rebels for planting a landmine
that killed two Serb police a week ago near the boundary between
Kosovo and the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In north Mitrovica, the 15,000 to 17,000 Serbs _ nearly twice as
many as before the war _ feel trapped and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   South of the river _ the Albanian side _ the town bustles. The
mood is triumphant. Markets are full of color with fresh meat and
produce. New lumber frames top houses burned in the war. Streets
are jammed with cars, military vehicles and the endless variations
of sport-utility vehicles bearing logos of U.N. agencies and
humanitarian relief groups that have spread across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   North of the river, there is little such activity. The dominant
color is gray. Reconstruction is rare. Basic supplies are short.
Children make a playground of the gnarled steel and stone of a
police station crushed by three NATO bombs in May. People still use
Yugoslavian dinars to trade, unlike the rest of Kosovo, which uses
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   Here people are angry at both NATO and at their government in
Belgrade, for stumbling into a war and then losing it and perhaps
Kosovo as well. They feel deserted and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the leader of the Serb community in Mitrovica,
believes Kosovo ultimately may be ethnically cleansed of Serbs with
the help of what he considers tragically misguided Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic, a former factory manager in Pristina, said the KFOR
soldiers believe they are in Kosovo to secure the province for
Albanians not to protect Serbs. Yet, he argues, it is the Serbs now
who are threatened with annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want a multi-ethnic Kosovo, and then they bring
in 800,000 Albanians and kick out 200,000 Serbs,'' he said. ``They
don't have enough courage to explain to the Albanians that they
didn't just come here to protect the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at contrived efforts to bring Serbs and Albanians
together, such as a proposal for mixed police patrols. ``To get six
Serbs and six Albanians in a patrol, you would have to have 15
French soldiers to keep them apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the sense of hopelessness has sparked an intense
desire to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Aleksic wants to escape with her husband and two
children and head for New Zealand, primarily because it is as far
away from Kosovo as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   Her family lived in an apartment just south of the Mitrovica
bridge. She says they were forced to abandon the apartment, which
is now occupied by Albanians. They now live in a makeshift
apartment in the school where she teaches.
</P>
<P>
   She is bitter about the way Serbs have been portrayed to the
world, and she despises CNN because she believes the news network
unfairly demonized her people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not terrorists,'' she said over coffee in her
apartment. ``We are not dangerous. We are just family people. We
just want to work and live and have our children. We didn't do
anything to deserve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Her twin sister, Tanja Jaksic, says she often dreams longing
stories of living in what seems to her to be a black township in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that people there can go to these towns and no
matter what is going on elsewhere, they can feel safe there,'' she
says as she walks down a grim street in her part of the city.
``That's what I dream about, to have peace and to feel safe in my
own village with my own people.

`RIDE WITH THE DEVIL': FAR FROM GETTYSBURG, A HEARTLAND TORN
APART 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As intensively as Hollywood has strip-mined the Civil War in
search of box-office gold, that anguished era has never looked or
sounded in a movie quite the way it does in Ang Lee's chilly epic,
``Ride With the Devil.'' This visually arresting but dramatically
flat portrait of a group of pro-Southern bushwhackers waging
guerrilla war against Union forces and sympathizers in the fields,
farms and backwoods roads along the Kansas-Missouri border veers
about as far from the high-romantic flourishes of ``Gone With the
Wind'' as a movie can go.
</P>
<P>
   In its attention to period detail, to 19th-century customs and
locutions of speech, ``Ride With the Devil,'' adapted from Daniel
Woodrell's novel ``Woe to Live On,'' feels at times like an
anthropological study. Twice the movie pauses for readings by
Confederates of poignant letters (taken from a confiscated Union
mail bag) written to soldiers on the battlefield by their Northern
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stately plantations and gliding Southern belles,
``Ride With the Devil'' beckons us into a world of austere
farmhouses and primitive frontier towns. It is a place of dust and
mud and untamed woods, where day-to-day life is so spare that a
chicken dinner is considered a luxury reserved for weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the movie's most harrowing scenes take place in a crude
dugout hideaway where a group of bushwhackers burrow in for the
long winter and are tended by a young widow, Sue Lee (the pop star
Jewel), who brings them scraps of bacon and bread. In this muddy
lean-to, one seriously wounded guerrilla has a gangrenous arm
amputated by a fellow bushwhacker without benefit of anesthetic or
even alcohol to blunt the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil'' focuses on two bushwhackers, Jake Roedel
(Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), childhood
friends who have joined a scruffy unit led by Black John (James
Caviezel). Other members of the group include the courtly,
curly-headed George Clyde (Simon Baker); Clyde's loyal former
slave, Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright); and Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan
Rhys Meyers), a surly, hollow-cheeked psychopath for whom the war
is an opportunity to vent a free-floating homicidal rage.
</P>
<P>
   The bushwhackers' battles, waged hundreds of miles from the main
military campaigns, are chaotic, fly-by-night raids often sparked
by tit-for-tat vendettas. In one daring foray they don the enemy's
uniforms to enter a Union encampment. The film's dramatic climax is
a stunning reconstruction of Quantrill's Raid, the massacre of Aug.
21, 1863, in which 450 Confederate guerrillas organized by William
Clarke Quantrill descended on Lawrence, Kan., an abolitionist
stronghold, and slaughtered 150 citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A goal of the attack is the destruction of a school at which,
one Confederate raider bitterly complains, the children are
educated with ``no regard for status, custom and propriety.'' He
goes on to acknowledge that the Yankee passion for mass education
and the democratic values that it expresses are the unstoppable
wave of the future and spell defeat for the Confederacy and
everything it stands for. This speech embodies the core idea of a
film that aspires to be a searching meditation on the birth of the
nation at a critical historical turning point.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's meditative quality and its attention to detail
and the rough-hewn textures of 19th-century life are also what keep
the story at a distance and make ``Ride With the Devil''
dramatically skimpy, even though the movie stirs together themes of
love, sex, death and war.
</P>
<P>
   The characters in ``Ride With the Devil'' seem almost radically
de-romanticized. Jake has potentially heroic qualities; during the
orgy of blood lust that was Quantrill's Raid he keeps his head and
refuses to slaughter innocent civilians. But the laconic screenplay
by James Schamus and Maguire's sensitive, understated performance
portray him as an unformed 19-year-old. When on the night of his
wedding to Sue Lee she asks if he's a virgin, he blurts, ``Well,
I've killed 15 men.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel, whose performance matches Maguire's in low-key
credibility, conveys an orneriness and tough humor (she bluntly
refers to his little finger, partially severed in combat, as his
nubbin') beneath a facade of 19th-century decorum. By treating the
wedding night as no big deal (there are no lingering close-ups of
entwining lips and limbs and no ecstatic morning-after shots), the
movie couldn't be more un-Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Schamus and Lee also collaborated (brilliantly) on ``The Ice
Storm,'' a film that was as coolly observant of the social rites
and mating habits of a group of depressed 1970s Connecticut
suburbanites as ``Ride With the Devil'' is of its bushwhackers.
That film suggested the Taiwanese-born director was evolving into a
kind of cinematic anthropologist examining social microcosms in his
adopted country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil'' feels even more detached, partly because
it is set so far in the past. Even after two viewings, the
secondary characters (including Ulrich's Jack Bull) remain largely
undefined. That's because ``Ride With the Devil'' looks at the
people and events as part of something larger. There's not that
much room for heroism, romance, action-adventure thrills and
melodrama and all those things Hollywood cherishes when you're
contemplating a nation's birth pangs.
</P>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Playing wordlessly through Lionel Ritchie and
Dire Straits, Iranian electric guitarist Nima Moghimi and his band
test their freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   They are a pop band in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the
right to rock is still fragile and thin. Though their instrumental
covers are tame by western tastes, they are right on the edge for
an edgy fundamentalist nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric guitar,'' the stylish 22-year-old Moghimi
explains, ``is not familiar to my government.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the government is coming to understand popular music.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Iranian revolution 20 years ago,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini at times banned nearly all music. The
clerics, or mullahs in charge saw it as an instrument of western
corruption, dangerous for a country dedicated to religion and
fighting a war for existence against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Iran opened up to folk tunes, classical works and
balladeers singing in Farsi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the two-year-old government of President Mohammad
Khatami, even electric guitarists enjoy the freedom he has extended
to movie producers, newspaper editors and authors. Khatami's
popularity is especially high with young Iranians, who often
complain they have few outlets for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi's so-far-unnamed band played its first three concerts at
a small movie theater in Tehran last month. The shows, billed as a
``Pop Music Concert'' of ``Old Songs,'' sold out the theater's 400
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the musicians are not allowed to sing western lyrics,
their fans occasionally sing along to the songs they know. Western
pop is banned here. But, within private homes, Iran enforces its
social laws loosely and black-market cassette collections are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is forbidden, so the fans stay in their seats but clap
rhythmically to some tunes.
</P>
<P>
   A few female concertgoers even push through the post-concert
crowd for autographs. They wear the head scarves and overcoats
required by modesty laws, but the scarves show plenty of hair while
blue jeans and high-heels show beneath the hemlines.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the Beatles in Hamburg, but something new is
happening _ something beyond the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the government is interested in the arts,'' says
fan Navid Assar, a business student. ``It can be a kind of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big changes,'' says Saghar Amirazimi, reviewing the
show as music writer for one of Tehran's reform-oriented daily
newspapers. ``Before Mr. Khatami, the performance of popular music
was not like now. We had many concerts, but mostly folk music or
the Iranian symphonies.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, strobe lights flash but the seven band members, in
slacks and button-down shirts, mostly keep to their spots.
</P>
<P>
   The lead figure is Ehsan Sabuhi, an-18-year-old saxophonist
whose instrument fills in where lyrics would be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the sometimes-rowdy banter that western rock
stars share with their audiences, these shows have little talk. In
one break, 25-year-old bassist Amir Hossein Mostaed politely thanks
the people who truly make the show possible _ the Iranian
government's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
</P>
<P>
   The band had to give the ministry a tape and a live audition
before it won permission for the shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials are really doing their best, and trying to
improve and better things for people who can make a good
performance,'' says Khosro Mohadeth Khalesi, a music teacher who
formed the band.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that did not make it through the audition was the
band's name. Band members wanted to use a Persian tribal name, but
it was not approved.
</P>
<P>
   About six approved bands play pop music now.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other young musicians who sometimes gather in
private parties to play and sing lyrics at parties _ sessions prone
to raids from modesty police, fines or short detentions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the public bands stick to instrumentals. Khalesi's
selections include George Michael's ``Careless Whisper'' and Abba's
``Money Money.'' They also play their own compositions, mixtures of
western and Persian tones.
</P>
<P>
   The band members get paid just enough to cover expenses and
complain, like young musicians anywhere, that they do not have
enough money for good equipment or instruments.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, they hope to make a name for their nameless
group and expand their repertoire as Iran expands its freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Moghimi says that he still has to hold back some guitar riffs
that are too raucous.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ears are mine and my fingers are mine,'' he says. ``I
should play the things I like.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, I made a trip to Vienna to cover a
conference on arms control. I've forgotten the conference, but I do
remember ``The Marriage of Figaro'' one night at the Staatsoper. I
remember, too, how the aroma of chocolate filled the Sacher Hotel
each morning, from all those Sacher tortes baking downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   And I remember my first great Austrian riesling. It was, as I
recall, from Willi Bruendlmayer, a fine winemaker in the Wachau
region, some 40 miles west of Vienna. Neither German nor Alsatian
in style _ it had their richness and depth without their
floweriness _ it was a whole new experience.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there haven't been many opportunities to drink wines
like Bruendlmayer's. For years, Austria was the forgotten nation
when it came to wine, almost nonexistent in the wine shops and
restaurants of America. And when anyone did think of Austrian wine,
it was of the heurigen, the young wine served in the little cafes
in the woods around Vienna where the tourists joined the locals to
eat sausage and quaff pitchers of frothy, forgettable white, most
of it made from a uniquely Austrian grape, the gruener veltliner.
</P>
<P>
   But that's beginning to change, and it's because of a simple
fact: In recent years, there has been a revolution in Austrian
winemaking, and the wines today are far better than they used to
be. ``For uninhibited enthusiasm and experimentation,'' Hugh
Johnson wrote recently, ``her producers today rate somewhere
between Australia and New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal innovation, aside from technical advances in the
vineyards and cellars, has been a dedication to the riesling grape.
My Bruendlmayer riesling in 1983 was, I realize now, something of a
rarity. Today there are dozens of fine rieslings coming from
Austria, wines to match the best of Alsace and Germany. And,
startlingly enough, there is a new effort to produce good red
wines.
</P>
<P>
   The rieslings and others are turning up in wine shops and in
restaurants as diverse as Union Pacific, Judson Grill and
Picholine, which has several by the glass. Danube, David Bouley's
new Austrian restaurant in TriBeCa, has a list off 135 Austrian
wines, divided into 19 regions.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as if Austria were new to wine: vineyards were planted
along the Danube thousands of years ago. And the Austrians are wine
drinkers. They are only 21st in the world in terms of the amount of
land they have in vineyards, but they are 11th in the world in per
capita consumption (about 8 and a half gallons a year compared with
less than 2 gallons in this country).
</P>
<P>
   Just about all Austrian wine is produced in the eastern part of
the country, with many of the best vineyards literally in the
outskirts of Vienna. The best regions are the Burgenland, which
starts a few miles southeast of the capital and extends along the
Hungarian border, straddling the Neusiedler See, a shallow lake;
the Wachau, along the Danube to the west, which has been called the
Rheingau of Austria; the Kamptal and Kremstal areas, near the
Wachau; and the region known as the Weinvertiel to the north and
west of Vienna, abutting the Czech and Slovakian borders.
</P>
<P>
   The principal Austrian white wine grapes are the gruener
veltliner, the welschriesling and the Mueller-Thurgau and, of
course, the riesling, which accounts for only a fraction of total
production.
</P>
<P>
   The gruener veltliner, aside from its association with the
Vienna heuringen, turns out to be source of some excellent white
wines that, to my taste, have a resemblance to good, dry chenin
blanc. Welschriesling, which is not a really a riesling at all, and
Mueller-Thurgau are used mostly for cheaper, commercial wines.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay, something of a newcomer, is growing in popularity,
although the few I've sampled are burdened, like so many California
chardonnays, with too much oak.
</P>
<P>
   The principal red grapes are blauburgunder (the German name for
pinot noir); blaufraenkisch (thought to be from the gamay family _
some of it is grown in Washington state where its known as
lemberger), and zweigelt _ although there are small plantings of
cabernet sauvignon and nebbiolo in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrians, many of them, had always been as casual about
making wine as they were about drinking it. Historically, thousands
of gallons of cheap wine had been imported from Eastern Europe and
fobbed off as domestic in Austria. Similarly, Austrian wines were
often shipped off in bulk to be sold in Germany as domestic wine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Austria was rocked by a wine scandal. A number of major
producers were found to have doctored thin white wine with
diethylene glycol to give it body. So severe was the world's
reaction that the Austrian government revised all its wine control
laws, and producers began to take their work more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good thing, in the long run,'' said Bertold Solomon
of the Austrian Wine Marketing Service, in an interview from
Vienna. ``With the big producers and their cheap wines out of the
picture, the small fine wine makers saw their opportunity. It was a
chance to go for quality and they took it _ very successfully, we
think.''
</P>
<P>
   They did what all serious winemakers do, given the chance. They
concentrated on noble grapes, particularly riesling. They cut
yields to add intensity to their grapes and many of them began
fermenting and aging their wines in expensive new wood.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian food and wine are enjoying a modest vogue in this
country, led by Austrian chefs like Wolfgang Puck at Spago in
California, and Mario Lohinger, the chef de cuisine at Danube in
New York. Wine stewards like Danube's Alexander Adlgasser and
Eduard Breg at the Tavern on the Green are Austrians dedicated to
promoting the wines of their native land.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to pinpoint the beginning of America's new
interest in Austrian wine and food. A restaurant called Vienna 79
enjoyed considerable success in New York for a few years before it
closed, in 1986. No serious Austrian restaurant followed it until
Danube. Bouley, who once worked at Vienna 79, is leading the
resurgence in New York, but his is just one of many restaurants
offering respectable selections of Austrian wines: They include
Jean Georges, Windows on the World, Grand Central Oyster Bar and
Montrachet. On the West Coast, the Water Grill in Los Angeles and
MC2 in San Francisco also feature Austrian wines.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To learn how the new Austrian wines worked with food, I asked
Adlgasser to pair a half-dozen of them with Bouley's and Lohinger's
food. For the whites, he chose a 1997 gruener veltliner, a
Durnsteiner Kellerberg from the Wachau; a 1997 riesling ``alte
reben'' (``old vines'') from the Schloss Gobelsburg, in the
Kamptal, and a 1995 chardonnay from a Viennese producer, Weininger.
</P>
<P>
   The gruener veltliner started out with a lively, fresh, spicy
taste; the riesling seemed closed in and the chardonnay attractive
but too oaky. Within half an hour, the riesling began to come into
its own, and by the end of the meal, it was easily the best of all
the wines, red and white. Neither as flowery as an Alsatian
riesling nor as sweet as a German version, but it was a rich,
subtle wine distinguished by its remarkable restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two reds, both 1996's and both from the Neusiedler See
area, I preferred the blaufraenkisch from the Weingut Romerhof over
a blauburgunder Junger Berg from a producer called Umathum.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was a dessert wine, a 1997 beerenauslese riesling
from Alois Kracher, a producer from the Burgenland on the
Neusiedler See with a reputation for making great late-harvest
sweet wines. While no match for the best German beerenausleses,
this was a wine of considerable power, with plenty of acid to
balanced its natural sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Conclusion: Austria is a treasure trove of fascinating
undiscovered wines, some as good as any in the world, all of them
intriguingly different.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Austria's more innovative winemakers is Willi Opitz at
Illmitz, on the Neusiedler See. Rather than just advertising his
wines, he has produced a CD called ``The Sound of Wine,'' a
recording of noises his wines make while fermenting. And, with no
apologies to Robert Mondavi, he calls one of his favorite wines,
yes, Opitz 1.

 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some common questions about Thanksgiving dinner and a
few last-minute tricks to get the cook through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the best potatoes to mash?
</P>
<P>
   A. Potatoes with a starchy, dry texture, like the typical Idaho
baking potato or yellow-fleshed Yukon Gold, will mash up with a
fluffier texture than waxy varieties like red bliss or new
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   To make them especially light, drain the boiled potatoes and
return them to the pot. (If they don't fit in one layer, do it in
batches or use a large pan.) Heat the potatoes, shaking the pan,
until they give off steam and dry out slightly. Then add milk,
butter and seasonings and mash away.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the easiest way to make gravy?
</P>
<P>
   A. A deeply flavored, velvety gravy can be made without a roux
or even additional fat.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: First, transfer the cooked turkey and any vegetables
to a serving platter, leaving the savory juices in the roasting
pan. Set the pan on the stove top over a medium flame (or two for a
large roasting pan), and add a liquid. (It can be broth, wine or
sherry, but water will do.)
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the pan by stirring and scraping the bottom to
incorporate the caramelized browned bits into the simmering liquid.
Let the mixture simmer a few minutes to reduce. This will become
the base for the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Next, for every cup of liquid you've added to the roasting pan,
mix 1 tablespoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons cold water until
smooth. Whisk this mixture (called a slurry) into the hot gravy
base. Bring the gravy to a simmer, stirring often, and gently cook
it until it thickens (about a minute or two).
</P>
<P>
   If at this point the gravy seems too thin, stir in more
cornstarch slurry and return the mixture to a simmer. Keep in mind
that cornstarch can thin if heated too high or stirred too
vigorously. Before serving, simply pass the gravy through a
strainer. If you prefer a richer sauce, stir in a few tablespoons
of butter at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How far in advance can you whip cream?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can avoid that last dash to the kitchen. Whipped cream
can be prepared as long as 24 hours in advance if you add
cornstarch as a stabilizer. The cornstarch will prevent the liquid
from separating from the cream and won't affect its consistency.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cake Bible'' (Morrow, 1988OK), Rose Levy Beranbaum
gives this recipe: In a small saucepan, mix 2 tablespoons
confectioners' sugar with 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Stir in \ cup
heavy cream. Bring to a boil, stirring, then simmer until
thickened. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then add {
teaspoon vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bowl, beat } cup heavy cream until you can just
see the beater marks. Add the cornstarch mixture in a steady
stream, beating constantly. Beat just until stiff peaks form. Store
the whipped cream in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   If you do have to whip cream just before you serve dessert, it
will thicken faster if about 20 minutes in advance you pour the
cream into a metal mixing bowl and place it, along with the beaters
or whisk, in the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you roast a turkey so that the skin is brown and crisp
but the meat isn't dry?
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, roasting at a moderate temperature (325 degrees)
ensures juicy meat. Some people like to turn the bird over halfway
through the cooking to redistribute the juices, but this can be
challenging with a 20-pound turkey. Covering the bird with a double
layer of a cheesecloth soaked in butter or oil helps keep it moist,
as does basting every half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   To get a crisp, richly browned skin, remove the cheesecloth
about 45 minutes before the turkey is done. Don't baste in the last
half-hour. After removing the bird from the oven, cover it loosely
with foil and let it rest for 20 minutes to allow the juices to
reabsorb before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What bread is best for stuffing, and how do I keep it from
drying out?
</P>
<P>
   A. You want a firm-textured or crumbly day-old loaf. Any type of
bread will do, depending on the flavor you want. But it needs to
dry out a little, because fresh or soft bread will turn to mush in
a stuffing. If your loaf feels soft, cut it into half-inch cubes
and dry them in a 250-degree oven for at least 20 minutes, until
they feel firm but not hard. (You don't want croutons.) If you have
an artisanal bread with an especially thick crust, trim it to avoid
hard, chewy bits in your stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffing cooked inside a turkey is usually a lot moister than
stuffing baked outside the bird. The stuffing inside the turkey
absorbs some of the fowl's fat as it renders. If you plan to bake
your stuffing separately, make sure that the recipe uses a good
amount of fat, one to two tablespoons for each cup of stuffing.
Covering the stuffing for all or part of the baking time will also
help keep it moist.
</P>

`FLAWLESS': DRAG QUEEN RESCUES A DISABLED COP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Schumacher's garish, message-laden comedy, ``Flawless,'' is
so awful it just might put an end to Hollywood's hypocritical
infatuation with men in drag as symbols of its own supposedly
liberated sexual attitudes. If so, that would be an unintended
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Set on Manhattan's Lower East Side and fluffed out with foolish
subplots involving stolen drug money and a drag queen beauty
contest, the movie is essentially a comic duet for two gifted
actors putting the best possible faces on roles that are little
more than one-dimensional mouthpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro is Walt Koontz, a retired New York policeman who
falls into a depression after he is disabled by a stroke suffered
while trying to foil a robbery in an upstairs neighbor's apartment.
Philip Seymour Hoffman is Rusty, his drag- queen neighbor who ends
up giving Walt speech therapy in the form of singing lessons. Those
lessons turn out to be much more than vocal exercises (one
assignment is to learn to sing the tongue-twisting Shirley Ellis
hit, ``The Name Game'').
</P>
<P>
   They are lessons in courage and compassion proffered by an
oppressed but indomitable spirit who knows the meaning of suffering
and rejection. By the end of the movie, the once rabidly homophobic
policeman has clearly melted under Rusty's campy tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless'' means well, heaven knows. But its caricatures of
the transvestized and the transgendered (Rusty, who is saving money
to have a sex-change operation fits both definitions) reinforces
every negative stereotype ascribed to gay men in drag. Rusty is
hysterical, masochistic, voracious, self-loathing and ragingly
``on'' every minute of her waking day. Her noisy posse of friends
look and act like shallow, preening gargoyles revving up for a
never-ending Halloween drag ball. They are about as real as
Broadway's ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for sharp one-liners, the screenplay recycles cliches,
then tries to palm them off as fresh. ``There's no romance without
finance,'' Rusty remarks, when explaining her relationship with a
macho married man who abuses her but expects her to pay his
gambling debts. When Rusty gets angry at Walt, she hits him with
that now-standard refrain, ``I'm more man than you'll ever be and
more woman than you'll ever get.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Walt learns some lessons about romance and finance
from two women he knows from the local tango palace. The one he has
admired as a lady turns out to be a mercenary who dumps him when he
is disabled and strapped for cash, while the one he has dismissed
as a whore turns out to have a heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro brings a deep, brooding quiet to his role that makes
Walt more than a stick-figure bigot. The actor makes you feel the
humiliation and terror of a proudly independent man who suddenly
must relearn how to speak while facing the possibility of having no
sexual future. Hoffman brings an angry heat to a stunt role that is
even flashier than his turns in ``Boogie Nights'' and
``Happiness.'' Unlike De Niro, he makes you aware every second that
he is giving a carefully shaped, larger-than-life performance. It's
probably the only way an actor could have approached a role that
feels like a hollow construction crammed with the filmmaker's
unexamined emotional baggage.

`PELIKAN': A DUTIFUL SON'S ERRAND IN THE BIG EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pelican, according to legend cited in an epigraph to David
Lozell Martin's new novel, ``Pelikan,'' is a rebellious bird; its
young are killed by their annoyed fathers and brought back to life
by the blood of their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   That is not exactly what happens in Martin's entertaining but
clownish story, which takes place within the eccentric, vagabond
demi-monde of New Orleans. But in addition to murder and theft,
Martin's novel tells a story of generational conflict and
resolution involving a character named Pelikan and his nephew
visiting from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The nephew is Charlie, a man of 33 who deals in memorabilia and
seeks a kind of bourgeois normalcy after an anarchistic youth. As
the story begins, he is visiting his dying father (who abandoned
Charlie, his mother and his three older sisters when he was a
child) in a hospice in Virginia. The conversation between father
and son sets the comically caustic mood that Martin sustains
throughout, the father revealing himself, as Charlie says, to be
good looking, high spirited and felonious. ``I got a deathbed
assignment for you,'' he tells his son. It's to go to New Orleans
and make sure that Charlie's uncle, whose full name is James Joseph
Pelikan, comes to the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie, who is our narrator for most of the intrigue,
reluctantly obeys, but as soon as he arrives in New Orleans,
violent and comically mysterious events begin to pile up. Martin's
story, and his manner of telling it, resemble those of Elmore
Leonard in their farcical attitude toward the criminal lowlife. At
the center of this story is Pelikan, a fast talker, a pimp, an
extortionist, a scam artist: in other words, an engaging and
likable guy.
</P>
<P>
   As Martin follows the adventures of Charlie and Pelikan, which
take place among a collection of prostitutes, swindlers, gunmen and
some French, Bulgarian and Filipino nuns, he provides a good deal
of raucous and profane entertainment. But Martin seems unable to
resist the temptation to allow a kind of ramshackle madcap excess
to take over here and there, and that considerably detracts from
the fun.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Charlie does when he arrives in New Orleans is
witness the murder of a local good-for-nothing known as Three
Jacks, the deed committed by a beautiful naked woman who has
arrived at the home of her victim to apply depilatory wax to his
hirsute stomach. The murderer has a fishhook in her lower lip,
tattoos on her private parts and other features that will play a
minor role as the plot unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than report the crime to the police, Charlie leaves the
scene and gets drunk. It turns out that he is familiar with the
doings of the New Orleans underworld because he lived in the city
as a teenager and at that time was introduced to pleasurable vices
by the profligate Pelikan. He knows the bars and the police and
that somehow his uncle is connected with the killing, but when he
seeks him out to learn the truth, his uncle, though happy to see
him, is unresponsive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distant from reality, as if I could see it from here
but was unable to participate,'' Charlie says. In idiot-savant
fashion Pelikan talks more about good foot care than of a scam
taking place even as he slips his nephew a Mickey. The scam has to
do with a criminal doctor named Gallier and a trove of Nazi war
booty that Gallier has inherited. The trove, which includes a
priceless religious relic belonging to a convent in France, is tied
up in litigation and both Gallier and Pelikan want to get their
hands on it. Sustained mayhem ensues as various characters make
their appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a corrupt policeman named Renfrone, a former
literature professor of Charlie's who has become a lawyer in New
Orleans and a dealer in false pubic hair named Harmony. There is
Sad Bob, a clown who is always in tears; a specialist in oral sex
managed by Pelikan; and some nuns from the French convent who seem
more like professional wrestlers than sisters of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie is a strong blend of vulnerability and brashness who
steers through the story with witty and reckless energy, and since
he is our guide to the overall goings-on, it is hard not to be
interested in them. But the characters' extreme eccentricities
paradoxically make them seem strangely alike, cartoonishly familiar
in their very bizarreness. They are also devoid of real wickedness,
and that robs the story of any sense of danger that might have
effectively mingled with the farce.
</P>
<P>
   ```Loser, failure, dimwit, sot, stooge.' Sad Bob continued to
list synonyms as he openly wept, greasepaint smearing, the huge red
nose slipping as his own nose ran with the wet effects of sustained
blubbering,'' Martin writes. ``The Filipino nuns covered their
little mouths with tiny paw hands to stop themselves from
yawning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part the reader does not yawn through ``Pelikan,''
which has some brilliant riffs as well as some not-so-brilliant
ones. Martin's talents in the saucy lowlife-comedy genre are
abundant. The problem is that this book veers into a kind of
theater of the ridiculous that has been used too often recently to
surprise the reader or even to seem very funny.

A `GADGET GUY' COMES HOME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL YANKOWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm basically trained as a techie. I left MIT as an electrical
engineer and the Sloane School with a systems background. Coming to
Reebok was going from electronics and high-tech digital convergence
to footwear and apparel. But I've always been a gadget guy, and
I've managed to find technology in any business I've been in.
</P>
<P>
   I saw an industry that hadn't changed the way it measured feet
or the way it had manufactured shoes for roughly 100 years. There
was a strong technology platform at this company; we could use
laser devices, holograms and the Internet to measure, fit, design
and custom manufacture personalized products in the future. There
was an opportunity for change as drastic as going from analog to
digital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major impetuses behind the move was to come back
home, because my home was in Boston. I was commuting back and forth
to New Jersey and for seven years I only saw my wife on weekends. I
said it was time to start bringing my home life and business life
together geographically.
</P>
<P>
   I kept thinking about large, consumer-oriented businesses in
Boston. I called in off the street to talk to Reebok's chairman and
chief executive, Paul Fireman. Reebok, among others, had offered me
a job 11 years before as head of sales and marketing. Paul wasn't
in, but his secretary said, ``OK I'll take your resume.''
</P>
<P>
   What I found out later was that the secretary called her
girlfriend who worked at the local Sony sales office and asked if
she had heard of me. She said yes, he's a good guy, and the
secretary said OK, I'll forward his resume to Human Resources. If
it hadn't been for that one salesperson in the local office, I
would have wound up in the wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice I ever got was from John Sculley, who was
president of Pepsi when I did the marketing there. John would tell
me that he was an idea guy, that he would have 10 great ideas a
week: One would be absolute genius, one would be absolute garbage,
and the other eight would be somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, he said, it wasn't easy to tell which were
which.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I always ask for thoughtful, intelligent opinions on
my ideas. It's probably true that everything I think isn't great,
so I have people make sure I don't go with the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Yankowski, now chief executive of Reebok International,
made a cold call at the shoe company last year when he was the
50-year-old chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc.

`THE OXFORD COMPANION TO FOOD': 6 POUNDS, WITH LIGHT TOUCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the nearly 20 years Alan Davidson took to compile the Oxford
Companion to Food (Oxford University Press, $60), anticipation ran
high. He had written encyclopedic works on topics like fish and
fruit and edited a scholarly series of pamphlets called Petits
Propos Culinaires, but this was to be a collective work, with
contributions from some of the best minds in the academic world of
food.
</P>
<P>
   The book, an outgrowth of the annual Oxford Symposium on Food
and Cookery, lives up to the highest expectations. It is a masterly
work with a variety of voices, from the straightforward, almost
dry, to the quirky and the witty. It will anchor my other research
materials, nudging aside ``Larousse Gastronomique'' and Waverley
Root's ``Food,'' as well as more specialized volumes like ``Food of
the Western World'' by Theodora FitzGibbon.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to be awed by 892 pages dense with extremely
thorough and well-written entries, enhanced by cross-references and
indexes and larded with anecdotes and strong opinions. Davidson and
his contributors discourse on thousands of foods, culinary customs,
cooking techniques, food science, personalities and trivia.
</P>
<P>
   But this six-pound book is more than a reference work. It
invites browsing. Page through, and you learn that posh-te is a
fruit from Mexico and Guatemala, that susumber is a tiny bitter
eggplant sometimes called pea eggplant and that the Futurist
movement tried to destabilize Italy's cuisine in the 1930s by
banning spaghetti, along with knives and forks.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how puma tastes, this is the place to look.
(Quoting Charles Darwin: ``Remarkably like veal.'') More than three
pages cover Asian noodles, historically and country by country. A
section on culinary mythology debunks common fallacies, including
the one that credits Marco Polo with introducing pasta from China
to the Western world. (The book traces that story to an article in
an American magazine called Macaroni Journal in 1929 that said a
sailor with the explorer had seen a Chinese woman making pasta, and
that the sailor's name was Spaghetti.)
</P>
<P>
   The entry on nouvelle cuisine offers one of the more intelligent
explanations of that food trend, which actually had its roots in
18th-century France but caught hold in the 1970s thanks to a
manifesto by Henri Gault, who was disgusted with the state of
French cooking of that era.
</P>
<P>
   Chapters are arranged alphabetically, with 2,650 headwords _
``oxalic acid'' is followed by ``oxtail'' and ``oyster.'' But there
is no langoustine between ``land crabs'' and ``Laos.''
</P>
<P>
   An index lists nearly 1,500 additional terms, each with the
appropriate headword, usually a synonym, steering the reader to the
text. Useful black-and-white line drawings accompany some entries,
but there are no recipes.
</P>
<P>
   With a volume like this it's tempting to nitpick. Cipolline, the
small, flattened onion sold in many markets in New York, is not
listed. I found tuile and mille-feuilles and croissants (in a
fascinating entry setting its history straight: the first reference
was not in the 17th century but in an 1853 French book). But there
is no reference to the cake known as financier. Angel food cake is
listed, but not other American baked goods like chess pie and
anadama bread.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising is the omission of Chilean sea bass, either by
that name or the more accurate Patagonian toothfish _ this in a
book up-to-date enough to describe the craze for cheap balsamic
vinegar, irradiation and, briefly, the debate over bovine
spongiform encephalitis, or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson heads off the quibblers in part by explaining in his
introduction that he tried to avoid focusing too heavily on Europe.
He also writes that ``all the other books I have written, even my
novel, have turned out to contain errors and to be flawed by
omissions'' and that he expected the same this time. He has added a
feature to his Internet site, http://members.tripod.com/rdeh, for
comments and corrections. (Gefilte fish, it notes, is made from
raw, not cooked fish).
</P>
<P>
   Many entries quote other writers, both historical, like Vincent
La Chapelle in the 18th century, and contemporary, like Harold
McGee and John Mariani. Others are signed with initials of
contributors, who are listed in the front.
</P>
<P>
   There is a brief entry for beer but none for Beaujolais. That's
because a newly revised companion to this companion, the Oxford
Companion to Wine, edited by Jancis Robinson, was published
simultaneously. It's about the same size and even more filled with
minutia, but costs $5 more because it has color pictures. Neither
book addresses grain-based spirits like Scotch and bourbon. Will
that require another six-pound companion?
</P>
<P>
   Entry example:
</P>
<P>
   THE OXFORD COMPANION TO FOOD runs from aardvark to zucchini,
with diversions like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``COCKAIGNE (or Cockayne), LAND OF, an imaginary land of
idleness and plenty (especially of food and drink) whose name is
derived from a Middle Low German word meaning small cake. The
rivers in Cockaigne are of wine, the pavements of pastry and the
houses of cake, and visitors from the real world are bemused to
find roast geese and fowls wandering around requesting that they be
eaten, while buttered larks fall from the sky: etc. etc. These and
other gastronomic features of the imaginary land vary from culture
to culture.
</P>
<P>
   Thus in Italy there are mountains of Parmesan, while in Ireland,
according to `the Vision of MacConglinne' (thought to date back to
the end of the 12th century) there are such strange visions as `A
loch of pottage fat Under a cream of oozy lard,' and `A forest tall
of real leeks, Of onions and of carrots,' besides `Hedges of
butter.' However, despite the numerous variations, the core idea is
remarkably consistent in early European literature. A painting by
Bruegel of this fantasy land has provided its best-known image in
art. This hangs in Munich.''

THE CHESTNUT COMES OUT OF ITS SHELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipes and optional sidebar at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chestnuts are challenging. Unlike walnuts, pecans and
hazelnuts, these big, meaty nuts have to be wrestled into
submission. Each one has to be scored with a sharp paring knife,
roasted until the skin loosens and then painstakingly peeled. It's
no wonder they look most appealing on a street vendor's cart, warm
and ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   But chestnuts have virtues lacking in even their far more
expensive cousins, like macadamias. Chestnuts not only are low in
fat and high in complex carbohydrates, but also have a unique
flavor and fascinating texture. They come in several forms, from
whole to ground (as flour), and they can be used in just about
every course of a meal _ literally from soup to nuts.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, when chestnuts are readily available, they
turn up on many menus, and not just in stuffing. At Jean Georges,
Jean-Georges Vongerichten has a soup floating with ravioli filled
with chestnut puree. Ari Nieminen at Firebird makes a creamy soup
with chestnuts and truffles. Michel Nischan at Heartbeat stuffs
sliced nuts under the skin of seared baby chicken. Mario Batali at
Babbo adds chestnut flour to gnocchi and tagliatelle and makes a
chestnut flour crepe called necci, filled with wild mushroom
ragout. Luc Dendievel of Bayard's has a chestnut soup with apples,
leeks and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs have kitchen staffs to prep their chestnuts, or they buy
high-quality nuts already peeled. But even a home cook can manage a
pound or two. Each chestnut has to be scored in an X-shape with a
sharp knife. Most recipes specify scoring on the flat side, but the
rounded side may be easier. The nuts then have to be cooked to
loosen the peel and to make it easier to peel off the thin skin.
They can be roasted at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, until the peels
curl back. Then the peels and skins have to be removed immediately
before they cool.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jenkins of I Coppi, who recently had an all-chestnut menu,
solves the problem by boiling scored nuts for about 20 minutes and
removing a few at a time to peel, keeping the rest in the water.
The down side is that the nuts get slightly soggy, but they are
fine for purees. Roasted chestnuts have better texture, especially
used whole as in stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Tucking hot nuts in a damp towel for a few minutes also loosens
peels and skins.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnuts can also be microwaved before being peeled, with a
texture somewhere between that of boiled and roasted. Working in
batches of five nuts, you can score the first batch and microwave
them on high for 2 to 3 minutes, until the skins loosen. Peel one
batch while the second is cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut puree, sold plain and sweetened, can be used for smooth
soups, vegetable purees, baked goods and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   A more traditional chestnut product is chestnut flour, ground
from dried nuts. For centuries in southern Europe, chestnut flour
was used to extend more expensive wheat flour or alone in baking.
Tradition has it that Roman soldiers carried flat chestnut flour
cakes to sustain them during long marches. An update of that cake,
called castagnaccio, is served at Babbo, where the pastry chef,
Gina DePalma, lightens the recipe with eggs and baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   Though chestnut flour is less perishable than the nuts, it has a
shelf life of just a year and is best stored in a cool place. Many
specialty markets carry it. At Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th
Street), it is $7.49 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest and best chestnut preparation may be at Babbo,
where a basket of roasted chestnuts is next to the hostess stand.
But Marcus Samuelsson of Aquavit, who pairs chestnuts with lobster,
foie gras and truffles, has another perspective. ``Chestnuts are
very luxurious,'' he said, ``Part of the luxury is to have someone
else prepare them for you.''

</P>
<P>
   Trick of the Trade: No More Peeling
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to chestnuts, chefs have it easy. For years, they
have used excellent, flash-frozen peeled chestnuts, while home
cooks have had to score and shell their way through mounds of them.
Now, Urbani in Long Island City, Queens (800-281-2330), is selling
the flash-frozen nuts by mail order: a 2.2-pound bag is $16.50 plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The nuts, from Spain, are superior to the peeled kind sold in
jars: firmer textured, sweet, perfectly peeled and whole. Store
them in the freezer, thaw them for about 20 minutes and then use
them in any recipe. If you want the smokier flavor of roasted
chestnuts, bake the frozen nuts at 400 degrees for 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What started as a trickle of mail-order food sources on the
Internet last year has turned into a torrent, making it difficult
to sort out the delicious from the dreary.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, instead of just thumbing through catalogs and
magazines and taking suggestions from friends, colleagues and
perfect strangers, I have also prowled the Web to seek out the best
food gifts for the holidays. With few exceptions, I did not find
much that is newer or better than I would have by my old methods,
but my searching and test-shopping could save you time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 24 mail-order sources listed below have their own
Web sites, but not all of them are interactive. Some simply provide
a little information and direct the shopper to order by e-mail,
phone or fax.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique food business is still largely small-time, and some
of the one-person operations have only recently stuck a foot into
the chancy waters of the cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do, they are not always better than good old
catalogs. Some sites take so long to navigate that you could drive
to the store and be back with your purchases before you've found
what you want online. Often the quality of the photos is poor.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering online, be careful when giving credit-card
information. You know you are in a secure area when the URL box in
your browser reads ``https'' instead of ``http.''
</P>
<P>
   And be sure to get a confirmation on your order, either on the
Web site itself or by e-mail. In some of my dealings, companies
said they never received the order. And I never received the food.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites are all still too primitive to deal with custom
orders. If they offer a gift basket with five items and you want
five different items, you will still have to phone the company or
e-mail it to see if something special can be created just for you.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sites, like ChefShop.com, which has unusual and
excellent food, do not even have a place where the buyer can
provide special instructions for delivery, like ``leave at front
door without signature.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is not easy to find what you want. Grace's
Marketplace is located at fultonstreet.com, and to find Grace's you
have to click on three different places. What's more, a panettone
ordered directly from Grace's is much less expensive than the same
panettone ordered on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At one Web site, I kept checking a quicker _ and more expensive
_ form of delivery, but to no avail. I finally had to call the
company, making double work.
</P>
<P>
   If you want something delivered by a certain date, always phone.
If a Web site has no warehouse, the order goes to a middleman,
adding time to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In shopping, I found that no single system worked all the time
or was as fast as the phone. Until there is someone at the other
end who can instantly answer questions, the Internet will never be
better. On the other hand, if you like to order at 3 a.m., the Web
is the perfect medium.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my choices of food gifts for the holidays. Unless
otherwise noted, orders can be placed on the Web site, and shipping
is extra. The last date orders are accepted for Christmas delivery
is included.
</P>
<P>
   The oatmeal cookies from the BELLOWS HOUSE BAKERY are so buttery
and packed with plump raisins they could pass for homemade.
Two-plus pounds, $30.90, including shipping.

ON THE FAST TRACK, THOSE IN CHARGE MUST CHANGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BRENT BOWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're dialing the phone when your controller sticks his head in
the door and asks if you have a minute. Do you hang up and ask him
what the problem is?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you're Christopher J. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I stopped dialing every time somebody came into my office,
I'd never talk to my clients,'' said Williams, 41, the founder and
chief executive of the Williams Capital Group, a boutique
investment bank on Fifth Avenue with a view from its trading room
of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Instead, he puts the manager through a
three-stage screening test:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, he continues dialing, saying, ``I gotta talk to this
client.'' If his visitor leaves, he guesses that the problem was
probably not all that important. Time saved: One or two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ If, however, the manager hunkers down, intent on getting his
boss' ear, Williams asks, ``Is this urgent?'' before punching the
last button. If the answer is no, Williams dismisses him with a
vague promise to talk later and puts the call through. Time saved:
One or two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the answer is yes, Williams reluctantly puts down the
phone. By then, his subordinate realizes he had better make it
quick. Time saved: One or two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not important enough for you to force it on me, I'll
put it off,'' said Williams, a 6-foot-4-inch former trader at
Lehman Brothers. That way, when his managers finally do corral him,
``Things get boiled down.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Five years ago, shortly after
Williams created his firm, a spinoff of a division that he formed
at Jefferies &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles investment bank, it consisted of
him and four buddies who sat around in a cramped office, talking,
cracking jokes and doing trades.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Williams Capital went through a period of rapid
growth. Today, the company has 40 employees, including 25
salespeople and traders, and plans to add several more soon. It
opened a London office in April. So far this year, it has served as
a co-manager on 29 underwritings totaling $33 billion, including
deals with the Ford Motor Co. and Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.. That is up from
eight transactions totaling $4 billion in 1998. Revenue this year
is expected to increase thirtyfold, from less than $1 million in
1994. The firm plans to join the New York Stock Exchange in
December.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams' days in the office became more hectic and his time
on the road increased from negligible to two or three days a week,
he said he realized that his old, laid-back management style no
longer worked. So he did what untold numbers of managers at
fast-growth start-ups have always done: He shifted management
gears.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced his open-door policy with a more aloof stance. He
began writing memos. He hired a receptionist, two administrative
assistants and a systems administrator. Before long, everybody
seemed to be going to and from meetings. The firm's office, which
has grown to 5,000 square feet from 500, holds two conference rooms
decorated with Haitian oil paintings.
</P>
<P>
   To enhance performance, Williams set up a profit-sharing plan
this year and recently inaugurated peer reviews. Though he will
take them with a grain of salt, he said, ``I need to do this to get
information about my employees.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no use fighting the bureaucratization process. ``Issues
arose,'' Williams said with a sigh. ``Conflict resolution. Resource
allocation. Administrative and operating protocols.''
</P>
<P>
   It all happened gradually. If there was a turning point, perhaps
it was a shouting match between a trader and a sales assistant that
drove home the need for more formal dispute-resolution procedures.
Or perhaps it was a valued trader's departure that made him realize
he was losing the easy familiarity he once enjoyed with his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Usher, chief operating officer at the Williams Capital
Group and one of the original partners, says he has thought a lot
about the shift in management style that fast-growth companies must
engineer. At Williams, he says, the big change took place at about
the time the staff grew to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, it was management on an ad hoc basis,'' Usher
said. ``Information just flowed naturally. Then we reached a point
where we had to put a structure in place to delegate authority.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's administrative staff has grown disproportionately, he
said; instead of 2 administrators for 20 employees, it is now 5 or
6 for 40 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School at
the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, said adjusting to
growth is one of the toughest tasks managers at any company can
face. ``Four is qualitatively different from 40, and 40 is
qualitatively different from 400,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a start-up, a boss can communicate his values and goals
verbally, Useem said, but as more people are hired, ``symbols''
like job titles, mission statements, the size and location of
offices and the boss' dress habits take on more importance. ``The
culture takes on a life of its own,'' he said. ``You need a lot of
people who know your business model and strategy, and know what to
do when you're not around.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher, 35, a graduate of the Harvard Business School, says he is
contemplating demanding a refund of his tuition costs because
``they never told me about the daily grind of being an
entrepreneur,'' including going to meetings where he has to make
bold decisions about run-of-the-mill matters.
</P>
<P>
   He has also had to find his way on the management front. An
inveterate list maker, he belatedly discovered the importance of
tackling at least a couple of tough tasks on his roster each day
instead of just rolling them over and plowing through the easy ones
instead.
</P>
<P>
   What about his boss' stratagem of holding his managers at bay
with a telephone? ``I have my own phone trick,'' he said. ``I don't
pick it up. I just listen to the voice mail messages.''

SLEEPING WITH THE COMPETITION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Mass.)   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I realized I would never marry my college boyfriend the day that
he was chosen for a summer internship at The Washington Post and I
wasn't. He did nothing so boorish as gloat; in fact, he barely
dared to celebrate. But I ended things anyway. Perhaps I'm
revealing more about my ego than is wise in a national publication,
but I knew even then that I was too competitive to go through life
with someone who did the same work as I.
</P>
<P>
   A look at any workplace shows that the economy might cease to
function if everyone felt this way. ``Where else do you meet
people?'' asked Fran Rodgers, chief executive of WFD, a consulting
company in Boston that specializes in personnel issues. (Not
coincidentally, her husband is second-in-command at WFD.) People
spend more of their time at work, she says, and women are doing
jobs once done mostly by men. The result? Corporate courtship.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Rodgers' clients found that 30 percent of employees
who went through its training program married somebody else in the
program. Add to that the spate of entrepreneurial start-ups begun
by couples, and you have a good chunk of the population sharing
work while sharing life _ navigating the territory that I ran away
from all those years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to them and they start with the advantages. ``We're both
creating the marriage, and we're both creating the business,'' says
Jeff Multz, who met his wife, Susan, when she was a client of his
computer consulting company, Emerging Market Technologies, in
Atlanta. She is now the company's president, and he, as vice
president for sales and marketing, reports to her.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of partnership is a common refrain. ``We speak the
same language,'' said Linda Safran, a medieval art historian who
heads the department of Greek and Latin at the Catholic University
of America in Washington. Her husband, Adam Cohen, is also a
medieval art historian, and last year he took over her courses for
three months when she was ordered to bed during a complicated
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these work-love mergers can take some negotiating. When
Susan Multz joined her husband's company, she remembers that every
week ``I was grabbing my keys and quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because, her husband answers drily, ``I was the president
and she wasn't.'' Instead of calling a marriage counselor, they
brought in a management consultant who suggested that Susan take on
the day-to-day operations of the company _ and the title of
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohen-Safran partnership is under a strain that would
challenge even the savviest consultant. There are only half a dozen
slots for medieval art professors in the Washington area, and all
are filled, one by Safran. As a result, Cohen can't find a job.
Moving isn't an option; how many universities would have two
openings for their esoteric specialty? So Dr. Cohen stays home,
writes manuscripts, cares for 1-year-old Josiah and wonders if he
should abandon his field.
</P>
<P>
   He says he does not resent his wife as she leaves each day to do
the work he is also trained to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry all the time,'' he said, forcing a laugh, ``but
never at Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I could be as selfless as all that. I'd be more
like a dear friend of mine, a screenwriter out in California, whose
husband just landed his dream job as a staff writer for a hit TV
show. Unfortunately, it is also her dream job, and she is not
taking it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm happy for him,'' she said morosely. ``But then I
have to go back to my little office to write my pathetic little
scripts.'' She finds herself reminding people, loudly and often
that at age 35 she is much, much younger than her 40-year-old
husband. In other words, he had a head start.
</P>
<P>
   My own 40-year-old husband and I have a different sort of
buffering distance between us. Bruce is a physician who also runs a
genetic research lab, and he writes in a language I can only
pretend to understand. Yes, sometimes I miss the easy shorthand of
couples who do the same things, but I'm pleased to trade that for
the complete absence of competition. I am freed to be the best
writer in the house, just as he is the best doctor.
</P>
<P>
   That he will never scoop me on a story is hardly the reason that
I married this remarkable man. But it sure is a relief to know that
he won't.

WHEN TO HOLD, WHEN TO FOLD (AKA RETIRE)  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md.)   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven days a week, for 9 or 10 hours each day, Merritt W.
Huntington is on the job, negotiating deals and supervising a small
staff. But he is no striving young investment banker or
20-something consultant on the make. He is a 73-year-old orchid
grower.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he keep at it? ``It's a passion, I guess,'' said
Huntington, owner of Kensington Orchids in Kensington, Md., one of
the biggest orchid producers in the mid-Atlantic states. But
something else prompts him to shake off his periodic reveries about
living a life of ease: the belief that hard work will prolong his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw too many people my age who lived another six months or
two years and then they were gone,'' he said. So he is staying put,
helped by his wife, Helen, 71, the company's bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, you hear the stories: People who keep working
live longer. Sociologists who study the phenomenon say it is a
little more complicated than that. To some extent, they say, old
people who are healthy keep working because they enjoy working.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they add, it is beyond dispute that active use of both
one's mental and physical capacities promotes longevity. Inactivity
can be hazardous to health. You're more likely to use your mind and
your muscle in an office or a factory than in a hammock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job conditions offering a challenge and the opportunity to do
self-directed, substantively complex work increase intellectual
flexibility,'' a study at the National Institute of Mental Health
concluded. The effect, in fact, is ``significantly greater'' for
older workers than younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   It helps if people like what they are doing. Take Jean Sharp,
who will turn 80 on Sunday and who sews seams in hosiery and
leotards at Alsace Textile in Reading, Pa. She sees her work as a
vital social connection as well as a source of money to pay off her
mortgage, which has three years to go. She said she could not
imagine what it would be like to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like family,'' said Mrs. Sharp, a widow whose son died at
the age of 48. ``We girls get along good. I think that's what keeps
me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharp is especially pleased that she is allowed to set her
own hours, which average about 30 a week. ``When I get there, I get
there,'' she said, ``and when I feel like leaving, I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such control over working conditions enhances job satisfaction
and thus promotes health, social scientists say. It is probably for
that reason, they add, tat a study of British civil servants in
the early 1990s found that those in higher-status positions with
more control over their daily routines were healthier than those in
low-status jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher you are, the better your health and the longer you
live, even controlling for initial health-risk factors,'' said Dr.
Richard M. Suzman, an associate director of the National Institute
on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Russell S. Bickel, 88, puts in more than 40 hours a week as a
stockbroker for Prudential Securities in Wyomissing, Pa. Work for
him these days is a comfortable routine in a business he has been
part of since he dropped out of high school in 1928 and that gives
structure to his life.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought on occasion about retirement but decided he would
be doing much the same thing at home _ ``fooling around with
investments'' _ and that as long as he felt good and had enough
customers, most of them with long-term horizons, he would just stay
on.
</P>
<P>
   But he says old people should either love their jobs or leave
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine myself in certain types of monotonous or
repetitious jobs that I would be itching to get out of,'' he said.
``I'd have my hand on the doorknob.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the vast majority of Americans retire as soon as
they can. The proportion of American men still working at 65
plummeted to 30.5 percent in 1985 from 71.7 percent in 1950, though
it has since edged up to 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are still toiling away recognize that at some
point they will probably have to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my bride that if she sees me slipping my marbles to
not let me come to the office anymore,'' Bickel said. ``I don't
want to be the judge of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is the cause and effect question: Do people stay
healthy because they keep working, or do they keep working because
they are staying healthy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real problems of causation here,'' said Joseph F.
Quinn, a dean and economics professor at Boston College with long
experience in the field. ``It's really important not to generalize
about what's good or not good for your health.''
</P>
<P>
   Conclusive proof that work benefits health is very hard to find,
because it is mostly people who are already in good health who
choose to keep on working.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical analysis has not solved the riddle, either.
Specialists note, for example, that women who have never been in
the labor force outlive men by the same margin as those who have
worked for decades.
</P>
<P>
   If older workers need a role model, it might well be Mary W.
Walker, 85, a trust department administrator at First Union Bank in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker was forced to retire at the age of 70, before
Congress passed a law restricting such involuntary departures. So
she signed up with Manpower Inc., a ``temporary'' employment
agency, and has remained at the bank but on the Manpower Inc.
payroll without changing jobs ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In spring and summer, she loves to cap her day by walking seven
miles from the First Union office in downtown Philadelphia to her
home in the suburbs. Because of an injury in a fall, she may have
to forgo those strolls next year, but she will keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love office work,'' Ms. Walker said. ``My doctor told me,
`Keep on working.'''

`TUMBLEWEEDS': ON THE ROAD WITH MOM THE SEXPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the British actress Janet McTeer's astoundingly vital
portrayal of a sexy free-spirited Southern gal in Gavin O'Connor's
film ``Tumbleweeds,'' you have the thrilling awareness of an actor
melting so deeply into a role that what is on the screen is not a
performance at all but a kind of spontaneous alchemy. Ms. McTeer's
character, Mary Jo Walker, belongs to a breed of vibrant, earthy
woman that movies love to portray but have hardly ever got exactly
right.
</P>
<P>
   Sashaying around in dresses that are a little too revealing,
flashing invitingly saucy smiles at every man who crosses her path,
Mary Jo is a not-so-young walking firecracker whose provocative
facade conceals a restless insecurity. In the rare moments when she
pauses to reflect on her peripatetic life, her face freezes into a
hawklike mask and her blue eyes widen with a look that borders on
panic.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's opening scene, Mary Jo is furiously breaking up
with the latest in a string of violently possessive boyfriends
while her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Kimberly J. Brown), cowers
behind a door listening to the crash of furniture. Moments later,
mother and daughter are on the road, westward bound. But an
impulsive phone call to an old high-school flame of Mary Jo's in
Missouri inspires an impromptu detour. One glance at this dreamboat
gone badly to seed on his dingy farm, however, dashes Mary Jo's
latest fantasy. She doesn't even get out of the car to say hello
but wheels around and flees in a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Later we learn that Mary Jo left home at 17, has been married
four times and has lived all over the South. When her car breaks
down in the middle of the desert and a hulking trucker, Jack Ranson
(Gavin O'Connor), comes to her aid, she turns seductive and
fluttery while Ava grimaces, aware that her mother's disastrous
romantic history may be about to repeat itself. Eventually mother
and daughter settle in Starlight Beach, Calif., a quiet seaside
town near San Diego. There who should Mary Jo run into in a bar but
the beer-bellied Marlboro man who rescued her on the highway. It
isn't long before they are living together and Mary Jo has taken a
boring job clerking for a security company where her milquetoasty
boss makes creepy passes at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds,'' adapted from Angela Shelton's childhood memoir
(Ms. Shelton wrote the screenplay with the director, who also plays
Jack), is a modestly produced slice of Americana. But its central
performances are so extraordinarily nuanced and the screenplay so
perfectly attuned to the twang and beat of everyday speech that in
places the movie feels like a documentary. The only disconcerting
element is its vagueness about time. Although presumably set in the
present, the mood feels more like a composite of the 1970s and
'80s, and this lack of specificity seems unnecessarily coy.
</P>
<P>
   Not terribly much happens. Ava goes to school and lands the part
of Romeo in a production of Shakespeare and experiences the first
twinges of puppy love with a cheeky classmate.
</P>
<P>
   As Mary Jo and Jack settle in together in Jack's house, the
honeymoon phase of their relationship quickly evaporates. Jack, who
expresses himself in clipped, blunt bursts, is short-tempered,
conservative and bossy, and Mary Jo begins chafing under his
dominance. She becomes friends with a sensitive widower (Jay O.
Sanders) in her office whom the movie wisely refuses to present as
a conveniently placed Prince Charming.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the movie is the mother-daughter relationship that
Ms. McTeer and Ms. Brown (in the child performance of the year)
portray as a passionate, primal bond suffused with love, even in
moments of conflict. Especially in scenes where the two horse
around delightedly like frisky kids lost in their own world, the
film captures a degree of parent-child attachment that is almost
never shown in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' opens only weeks after another likable
mother-and-daughter-on-the-road film, ``Anywhere but Here,'' in
which Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman portray a flighty but
indomitably upbeat mom and her resentful teenager. ``Tumbleweeds''
may lack the glossy production values of ``Anywhere but Here,'' but
it gets more deeply under the skins of its characters. There are
many moments when what is on the screen stops looking like acting
and becomes life itself, and you're watching real people change and
grow before your eyes.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a simple almond cake, leavened by egg whites, moistened
with browned butter and baked into a small mold. But such
simplicity is deceiving: the classic French pastry called the
financier is exquisitely refined. It is springy, sweet and nutty
with an exterior that's as crisp as an eggshell.
</P>
<P>
   In France, financiers have been a staple of fine pastry shops
for more than 100 years. But in America, they have only recently
begun making their way into restaurants. And for the home cook
they're something of a mystery: not even bibles of French baking
include recipes for financiers.
</P>
<P>
   You may have eaten one without knowing it. Pastry chefs all over
New York serve them, often without saying so on the menu. But it is
impossible not to notice how different the financier is from any
other cake.
</P>
<P>
   At Vong, Serge Decrauzat places a small round financier beneath
a ginger poached pear. It serves as a kind of pedestal: the soft
almond cake soaks up some of the ginger syrup and keeps the pear
from mixing with a tart pomegranate sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tonic, cranberries are dropped into the batter, and the
finished financier is served warm between a tangy creme fraiche
sorbet and a tart huckleberry chutney. At La Fourchette, a
boat-shape ginger lemon financier is showered with powdered sugar,
with creme fraiche ice cream and blueberries spooned on the side.
</P>
<P>
   The financier (pronounced fee-nahn-see-AY) often shows up on
petit four plates, baked in tiny round, fluted or rectangular
molds. The ones at Monkey Bar in Manhattan are superb. Using a
traditional almond base, Jean Francois Bonnet, the pastry chef,
drops pistachios in some, pecans or strawberries in others. His
unusual cocoa bean financier, dark as a coconut and speckled with
chopped cocoa beans, is a masterly creation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Leach, the pastry chef at Park Avenue Cafe, makes
financiers studded with pistachios and cradling poached prunes;
they are like a pistachio tart on a caky tart shell.
</P>
<P>
   In France, what you find is less experimental. The shape may be
round in some places, rectangular in others, but the base is rarely
anything but almond. It has been that way for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Lacam, in ``Memorial Historique de la Patisserie,''
published in 1890, wrote that the financier was created by a baker
named Lasne, whose bakery on the Rue St.-Denis was near the Bourse,
the financial center of Paris. Presumably, the rich little cake was
named for the rich financiers who frequented his bakery. The cake
was baked in rectangular molds, the shape of gold bars.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Malgieri, the director of the baking program at Peter
Kump's New York Cooking School, said a similar cake made with nuts,
egg whites and brown butter existed even before that. It was made,
he said, by nuns of the Order of the Visitation and was called a
visitandine. It is likely that the baker Lasne simply altered the
shape and the name of the cake to flatter his clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the recipe has withstood time, even without the
support of cookbook authors and culinary preservationists. There is
no mention of the financier in ``Le Cordon Bleu at Home'' or
``LaVarenne Pratique,'' two of the leading encyclopedic French
cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it in Rose Levy Beranbaum's comprehensive ``Cake Bible,''
nor in Lindsey Shere's ``Chez Panisse Desserts,'' which is known
for including French desserts that are largely underappreciated in
America. The financier earns just a vague definition in some
editions of ``Larousse Gastronomique.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it has earned the adoration of those who have tried it.
Even in innovation-mad New York, two of the best examples are
traditional and, fittingly, come from shops.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Payard, the chef at Payard Patisserie, makes financiers
in a handful of shapes, but the best are round, plain ones the size
of large Reese's peanut butter cups. He uses almond flour, or
blanched almonds ground as finely as flour, so his financiers have
a crisp crust and an interior that's as soft as a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other, from Marco Polo Cafe and Caterers, is much different.
It is made with ground nuts, baked smaller _ the size of a walnut _
and brushed lightly with a mixture of lemon juice and powdered
sugar. It is coarse, nutty and cleverly tangy.
</P>
<P>
   As obscure as the financier has been, there is little mystery
about how to make it. All you need is a whisk, a bowl, a pan and a
mere stroke of finesse.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps make or break the cake. The first, browning the
butter, is what defines its flavor and adds depth to the almonds.
You need to heat the butter over medium low heat until it begins to
brown and smell nutty. It is best to do this slowly and to keep a
careful eye on it. Once butter begins to brown, it turns quickly
and burns easily. Remove it the moment it attains the color of a
chestnut. Undercooking it is equally damaging, for it will lack the
necessary aroma.
</P>
<P>
   The second trick is to mix the batter as little as possible. It
should be stirred until just blended. If you stir too much, the
gluten in the flour will get overworked and the cake will be tough.
</P>
<P>
   The batter then has to rest before baking. A few hours in the
refrigerator, and the flavors will harmonize and the batter will
firm up, making it easier to pipe into molds.
</P>
<P>
   The one decision you need to make regards texture. If you use
almond flour, the cake will be finer but denser. If you grind your
almonds, it will be coarser and rustic. I prefer grinding. American
butter and flour are not the same as in France. And in the finished
cake, the differences translate even more tangibly. Somehow the
roughness of home-ground almonds and flecks of almond skin give the
cakes a kind of soulful intensity that you find in Parisian
pastries.
</P>
<P>
   Financiers do impose just one inconvenience: they must be baked
on the day they're eaten. In fact, their texture deteriorates in a
few hours. Once they're in the oven and the fragrance begins
filling your house, this is hardly a problem.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: WHEN THE WHISTLE-BLOWER HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone is having trouble choosing between a lawyer and a
journalist on the basis of professional dependability, ``The
Insider'' should resolve the matter. The movie, about a real-life
tobacco company whistle-blower in the coils of Corporate America,
leaves little choice but to hire the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether on the side of big tobacco or of a fatally heavy smoker,
a lawyer for any cause, high or low, will fight fiercely for the
client. The journalist with a cause may find himself at odds with
his boss and drown in angst, taking the ``client,'' in this
instance an informant, along with him.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the audience this celebration of a resolute
television journalist, Lowell Bergman, once of ``60 Minutes,'' now
of ``Frontline'' (and an occasional contributor to The New York
Times), will come as a revelation. The only names that fans of
television magazine programs are likely to recognize are those of
the on-screen personalities, those high-salaried, heavily promoted
showpieces. ``The Insider'' lets us in on the news that by the time
the star _ call him Mike Wallace _ appears, some anonymous
producer, has done the hard reporting that eases the way for the
famous colleague. Since the television newsmagazine is at least as
much show business as it is journalism, the camera serves the star.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie version, which has been contested by some of the
real-life principals, it is Bergman's dedication to his source,
Jeffrey S. Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a repentant tobacco
industry scientist, that starts the trouble. In Al Pacino's sweaty
portrayal, Bergman is a journalistic pit bull; once his jaws are
locked onto his story, there's no prying them apart. Only in this
case the prospect of an expose of Brown &AMP; Williamson's fiddling
with nicotine levels unnerves the executives at CBS, who fear a
multimillion-dollar suit that may upset efforts to sell the
network. They veto Wigand's appearance on ``60 Minutes.'' That,
more or less, really happened.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Michael Mann's movie its distinctiveness is its
account of the play of power at CBS News. The hero, Bergman-Pacino,
finds himself up against the corporate interests, which, he is
belatedly outraged to discover, collide with the journalistic
mission of ``60 Minutes.'' (That this 1960s radical should be
surprised at the exercise of capitalist muscle is surprising.)
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall), who has won a high reputation
for putting together and sustaining what is generally acclaimed as
the best newsmagazine on television, sides with his corporate
bosses against his employee; and Mike Wallace (Christopher
Plummer), the program's most famous figure, does not leap to his
colleague's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't dig very deeply into the considerations that
moved Hewitt-Hall to betray one of his veteran producers, but it
does call into question the value of Hewitt's success when it comes
to high-stakes decisions. He is so successful, so established, that
his program's large audience must have assumed that Hewitt, of all
CBS News big shots, would be in a position to take on his network's
owners and their lawyers; after all, he has been a great source of
revenue as well as of reputation for the network over many years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the event, he seems to have accommodated himself early.
Occupying a critical position between the business side of his
company and the journalistic side, Hewitt accepts the network's
plausible arguments about the high legal cost of violating Brown &AMP;
Williamson's confidentiality agreement with the hapless Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   Identification with one's employer is not an unusual choice in
Corporate America, and not necessarily a dishonorable one, but it's
not one that moviegoers or journalists can cheer, especially at a
time when the news department's lot under the new CBS management,
with its eye on advertising and ``shareholder value'' and assuredly
not on news, cannot be an entirely happy one.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Wallace-Plummer, another heavyweight, and the
personification of ``60 Minutes.'' Wallace's admirers had reason to
expect that this relentless truth seeker would of a certainty have
been allied with a fellow journalist in a brave cause. But no, in
the movie he ducks, and Bergman-Pacino is left on his own, just as
Wigand-Crowe is left alone and in limbo, feeling that he has been
manipulated into putting his career at risk by a well-meaning and
persuasive journalist who just couldn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Wallace character, too, feels that his allegiance to
the company where he has worked for decades, to their mutual
benefit and to the nation's benefit, is stronger than any loyalty
he might have owed to just one more ``60 Minutes'' report. Or
perhaps he believed too thoroughly in his own tough-guy image.
``Don't worry,'' his screen persona assures Bergman-Pacino, ``we
call the shots around here.'' But that is just bragging.
</P>
<P>
   In Plummer's sly impersonation of Wallace, amour propre seems to
have triumphed. Bursting with his own esteem and in defense of his
own treasured position, which is tied so closely to that of ``60
Minutes,'' he seems to be taking a lofty above-the-battle stance.
Whatever the explanation, he fails to live up to the crusading
journalist image in the Bergman-CBS confrontation, or play much of
any part until late in the proceedings, when he says with hollow
satisfaction, ``It all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``The Insider'' is unfair to Wallace and Hewitt; at the
very least, it's a sort of slander to have Hewitt-Hall say that
corporation executives ``talked to Mike and I.'' Treating Bergman
as the hero of the occasion and Wigand as the victim left no doubt
that the script would be tilted decisively in their favor and
against the Hewitt-Wallace combination.
</P>
<P>
   There must be unpublicized cases in Hewitt and Wallace showed
courage in standing up to corporate interests. Yet in this case the
journalist in them did succumb in a field where, the movie
suggests, bad practices are already common. When Bergman-Pacino
says of his way of getting exclusive stories, ``I don't buy
people,'' we can take it as a crack at the bidding war of the
network morning shows for ratings-grabbing celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   So if your choice is to place your trust in the hands of a
lawyer for hire or a journalist with ideals, beware. ``The
Insider'' conveys a cautionary message at a time when network-news
reputations are already at a low point, with diminished foreign
coverage, few serious documentaries, more lightweight filler,
gussied-up graphics and the invidious influence of cable. The
anchors and the hosts have reputations and incomes to spare, but
when it comes to power over their products, as the real Bergman
should have known, one has to look off the screen.

`TOY STORY 2': ANIMATED SEQUEL FINDS NEW LEVEL OF IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' can be enjoyed _ enormously _ without wondering
exactly why the Pixar animation looks even better than it did the
first time. Among the many talents of the director, John Lasseter,
and his huge crew of computer-animation pioneers is a gift for
making their work look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Only after leaving the theater is there reason to realize just
how much imagination has gone into making this film so enveloping.
While its surface is as smooth and witty as that of ``Toy Story''
itself, the sequel and its characters (in the words of an associate
technical director) are ``probably twice as complicated under the
hood.''
</P>
<P>
   This cutting-edge animation franchise still has the power to
enchant children while keeping adults entertained. And it has not
wasted its technical innovations on junk-food storytelling.
Lasseter's avowed fondness for Frank Capra's films can be seen in
the nostalgic world summoned here, and in the fundamental goodness
of the toy characters themselves. Without undue sentimentality,
this film lets its playthings pull together in ways that would be
sweet and funny in any format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' begins with a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody and manages to stay on that same level throughout. With
voices delightfully supplied by an even larger cast of familiar
actors than the first film had, it sends up video-game heroics
before returning Buzz Lightyear, toy astronaut (with the voice of
Tim Allen), to the haven known as Andy's room.
</P>
<P>
   Andy is the child whom the toys worship (perhaps a shade more
slavishly than they should), and Andy's going to camp is enough to
set a toy crisis in motion. This may be a world in which a yard
sale is a big event, but the film invests plenty of feeling in its
assorted metaphorical happenings.
</P>
<P>
   When Woody the cowboy (with the voice of Tom Hanks) accidentally
falls into the clutches of a wicked toy collector (played by Wayne
Knight, and cleverly rendered right down to the hairs on his arms),
the film's value system makes itself known. It turns out that Woody
was once a toy celebrity, famous enough to have knocked Sputnik off
the cover of a 1957 issue of Life magazine. He got his face on a
lunch box in those days, and now he has become an icon of sorts.
Flattered by fame, and welcomed by a group of equally collectible
friends (with the voices of Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammer), he may
be in danger of forsaking his old gang for the chance to be
lionized. The film manages to make being put into storage, or being
displayed in a toy museum in Japan, into workable metaphors for
failure and success.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the filmmakers have spun a lively, tuneful adventure
(with a score by Randy Newman, and Sarah MacLachlan and Robert
Goulet to enliven the soundtrack) out of this setup. But what they
have also done is to add layers of new facial and body movements
for the characters, along with much subtler lighting effects (50
separate light sources in once scene, according to the
cinematographer, Sharon Calahan).
</P>
<P>
   Motion is so fine-tuned that the film can stage high adventure
in traffic, on baggage-moving machinery at an airport or anywhere
else that comes to mind. Like the Japanese landmark ``Princess
Mononoke,'' this kind of animation catapults past reality to create
whole new realms of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back on the toy shelf, appealingly human emotions are
put in play. Buzz discovers that he is only one of many Buzzes, and
must come to terms with existential questions about being
mass-produced, one of the crowd. Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) now
has a wife (Estelle Harris), who offers to pack ``your Angry Eyes,
just in case'' when her mate goes off to rescue Woody.
</P>
<P>
   The toys have their own enemies (including a hilarious take on
Darth Vader), their own nightmares (being relegated to the
broken-toy heap) and their own triumphs (just getting across a busy
street) that take on epic proportions here. And this film continues
the work of its predecessor, making sure that computer-generated
animation will never be the same.

 `NORMAN ROCKWELL: PAINTING AMERICA': LOOKING BEYOND Mr. (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a scene in Steven Spielberg's 1987 movie ``Empire of the
Sun'' in which a British mother and father gaze down serenely at
their handsome young son, peaceful, safe and secure in bed. It
could almost be a Norman Rockwell painting. And that was no
accident, says Spielberg in ``Norman Rockwell: Painting America,''
a 90-minute ``American Masters'' documentary that has its premiere
on PBS on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, who recreated that ``Freedom From Fear'' scene to
contrast with the boy's terrifying wartime experiences later in the
film, is one of many famous people who are willing to speak up and
be counted as fans of Rockwell, who died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Art historians, art critics and even the artist Jamie Wyeth have
positive things to say about those decades (beginning in 1916) of
Saturday Evening Post covers with pigtailed girls, freckle-faced
soldiers and white, rosy-cheeked families beaming at holiday meals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A.M. Stern, the architect who designed the Norman
Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has seen even the most
brittle cynics melt in the presence of all that wholesomeness when
they visit the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when all those black-suited, black-dressed, chic people
mock Rockwell,'' says Stern, ``then you take them aside and you
walk them through, it's interesting. They get it. They drop the
Armani shield, and they look, and they rediscover that this is part
of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the time has come to take Norman Rockwell seriously.
Earlier this month a national tour of his work began at the High
Museum in Atlanta, destined for the Guggenheim in New York in 2001.
``American Masters'' has done a nice job of packaging the artist,
even if the film is more interesting in terms of his personal life
than instructive in assessing his work.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell may have had a country-boy heartland image, but he was
a New Yorker, born in 1894 on Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan around
Columbia University. His parents lived in boarding houses most of
the time, and he used to amuse himself by hanging out on the roof
and watching gang fights. Eventually his family moved to Long
Island. But as an adult he didn't choose rural life until his 40s,
when he moved to a small town in Vermont. Finally he bought a home
in Stockbridge, where he died at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he had a life that would never have made it into a
scene of Rockwellian Americana. Rockwell's son Peter says the
artist and his first wife had a very 1920s marriage in that both
had affairs with others regularly. He divorced, remarried and moved
the whole family (they had three sons) to Paris. The second wife
was an alcoholic and was institutionalized for mental illness more
than once. After she died of a heart attack in 1959, he married a
third time. Rockwell's own addiction was to work. He painted seven
days a week and was often known to get up from one of those festive
holiday tables and sneak off to his studio to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting parts of ``Norman Rockwell:
Painting America'' are its subject's television appearances. Seeing
him interviewed by Edward R. Murrow on ``Person to Person'' seems
right, but it's a little jarring to see him on, of all things, Joey
Bishop's night talk show in 1968. And doing commercials for Zenith
television sets and Purina cat food.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the documentary concludes that even if Rockwell did
not live in the pure, pastoral, innocent America that he painted,
he at least yearned for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believed a myth,'' says the writer Richard Reeves, ``if
he engendered a myth in the populace, I think to a large extent,
for most of his life, he believed it more than we did.''

MITSUKO UCHIDA: STARTING WITH A BANG, AND A POINT

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pianist Mitsuko Uchida purposely played the works
by Chopin, Webern and Mozart that formed the first half of her
recital at Carnegie Hall on Monday night in the opposite order from
what convention would have dictated. The ordering was musically
fascinating and just one indicator of the intelligence this fine
pianist has always brought to her work.
</P>
<P>
   Looking splendidly informal in cream white pants and shimmering
gold top, Ms. Uchida began with Chopin's tempestuous Piano Sonata
No. 2 in B flat minor, a work many pianists would choose to
conclude a recital. Her elegant, pristine pianism would not seem to
be ideally suited to such rhapsodically Romantic music. And the
piano writing in the first two movements, with its torrent of thick
sonorities and repetitive chords, pushed aspects of Ms. Uchida's
technique to their limits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she tore through the music with relentless brio.
Sometimes this energy verged on the aggressive, even in the forte
passages of the funeral march movement. Yet her keen ear for
harmonic subtleties and inner voices made her interpretation always
compelling. And the final Presto was astonishing. Most pianists
play it with a hushed, impressionistic whoosh, like ``winds of
night sweeping over the churchyard graves,'' in the famous phrase
of Anton Rubinstein. Ms. Uchida brought Bach-like clarity of
execution to the music, which made its strangeness even more
striking.
</P>
<P>
   This led, with surprising effectiveness, to the Webern
Variations (Op. 27). Ms. Uchida seemed to be making a point in her
performance: that this music was as much about color, dramatic
gesture and intricacy of texture as the Chopin, and certainly no
more shocking. Indeed, the middle variation was remarkable for its
playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The first half concluded with Mozart's Adagio in B minor,
generally thought of as a little oddity of a masterpiece from the
composer's maturity. The way Ms. Uchida played it, at a daringly
slow tempo and with all the structural repeats observed, it emerged
as a gripping, harmonically experimental and substantive work of
nearly 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Uchida, who has won acclaim for her performances of
Schubert, devoted the second half of her recital to the composer's
Sonata in D, called Grande Sonate in the score, though grand may
not be the most apt word. It is certainly grand in dimension,
especially the first movement, which is like some apotheosis of the
march, bracing and heroic. But the work is filled with impish
humor, wistful lyricism and sprightly folk tunes, qualities Ms.
Uchida beautifully captured. At times, in allowing herself to be
spontaneous, Ms. Uchida rushed her tempos, and her sound turned a
bit clanky in some repeated chord passages. But the keen
intelligence and high spirits of this performance were
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The overflow audience, which spilled into two rows of stage
seats, demanded encores, and Ms. Uchida complied: the Allemande
from Bach's French Suite in G and Chopin's Prelude in C sharp minor
(Op. 45). Even these seemed to have been selected to make a point:
the evening began and ended with late Chopin. Whatever the case,
they were exquisitely played.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler weather will begin to approach the East as a cold
front pushes through the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. Ahead of this
front Wednesday, showers will develop from northern New England to
the southern Appalachians. Increasing moist winds from the south
and southwest will be forced to rise up and over the mountains,
leading to low clouds in many locations. Patches of dense morning
fog will develop in the muggy air along the Northeast Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, moist breezes off of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
of Mexico will bring isolated showers and thunderstorms to the
Piedmont of South Carolina and Georgia. These winds from the south
and southwest will bring yet another warm and humid day to the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Snow showers will develop Wednesday across the northern Great
Lakes where cold air crosses over the relatively warm waters of the
lakes. Meanwhile, winds from the east will ascend the high terrain
of southwest Texas and eastern New Mexico, bringing clouds and
isolated showers. At the higher elevations of New Mexico, the rain
will be mixed with snow showers. To the north, sunshine will be
abundant over most of the central Plains. Readings there will be
warmer than they were Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of windswept rain are likely in the Pacific Northwest as
a strong cold front nears the coast. Most of the rain will be west
of the Cascades, although a few showers will survive the trek over
the mountains into interior sections of Washington and Oregon.
There will also be some snow showers in the higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Season of the Sun
</P>
<P>
   Amid a November warm wave in the East, there was a sign that the
season of the sun has ended. Although a patchwork of clouds and sun
covered the region, temperatures in the cloudy areas averaged only
a few degrees cooler than nearby spots that had ample sunshine. The
northern United States has entered the season when sunlight has a
smaller role in determining the daily temperature. In the middle of
winter, strong fronts can overwhelm the normal diurnal temperature
cycle. Indeed, there will be several times when the highest
temperatures will occur in the middle of the night.

`TRISTAN UND ISOLDE': A NEW `TRISTAN' TO RIVAL MEMORIES

 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Tristan und Isolde'' has been a passive presence in
the big opera houses of the world, like an imposing building left
vacant for lack of prime tenants. For years we have had the
orchestras, the conductors, the directors and the means to bring
Wagner's immense, hypnotic and deeply disturbing opera to life.
What we have not had is people to sing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tristan'' perseveres in opera houses smaller and more
hospitable to voices of lesser means, but the Flagstads, Nilssons
and Melchiors capable of dominating the title roles have gone, and
they have left us empty-handed. The requirements are staggering:
eloquence, beauty, sheer bigness and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners in the thrall of ``Tristan'' have survived on memories
real or imagined and a few recordings. Given the unreasonable
demands, a Wagner performance will always be the art of the
possible, but Monday night's event at the Metropolitan Opera, a new
production, may be as close as we shall ever come to getting it
right. Here were singing and orchestra playing of exceptional
beauty and power together with staging marked by simplicity,
dignity and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Opera has found its new Tristan and Isolde, and I wonder if we
have ever had better ones. Jane Eaglen during the last few years
has showed herself a brave and well-armed soldier in the Wagnerian
wars, but on Monday she was more. Beautiful sound and unflagging
power were means not ends, for this was singing subtle in its
variety of deliveries, scrupulously musical and firmly in touch
with the heart and soul of the role.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Heppner's splendid tenor is sorely pushed at but never seems
to push back. The voice rides easily through this big hall at quiet
levels and soars above Wagner's orchestra at climactic moments. Act
III's long soliloquy was painful eloquence at work. Heppner is
deeply touched by Tristan's music and touches us in return. At the
end of Isolde's ``Liebestod,'' listeners sat stunned. ``Tristan''
has a way of stunning us all. It is the apotheosis of desire, music
with an insatiable appetite. Unresolved harmonies move from one
partial resolution to the next unresolved harmony and so on into
the night. One gesture devours another. The opera is so vast in its
implication that it can be experienced simultaneously as a triumph
of spirituality and a five-hour orgasm in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tristan'' can look like almost anything we want it to. Dieter
Dorn's production sets period dress inside solid geometry.
Triangular planes converge at a point at the back of Juergen Rose's
set and spread upward and outward to the audience. Everything is
pushed forward, minimizing the cavernous dimensions of the Met's
stage. People and monoliths rise out of and descend back into the
steeply raked floorboards. The geometric planes are color-coded
according to mood by the lighting director, Max Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid use is made of singers in silhouette. Ms. Eaglen and
Heppner are a hefty pair of love makers, and the dignity with which
Dorn handles their profiles is admirable. There is an air of
stillness to this production: no unneeded movements, nothing to
clutter the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The other principals are excellent: Katarina Dalayman
warm-sounding and passionate as Brangane, Rene Pape a fiercely
effective King Marke, and Richard Paul Fink a touching Kurwenal.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ``Tristan'' is its orchestra, and James Levine
worked in slow, patient accumulations of force. The sound was
wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   The love potion that does our principals in belongs to
mythology, but the everyday idea of self-destruction born of
passion is in every sip.
</P>
<P>
   Here from Cosima Wagner's diaries are the Wagners at home: He:
``Love up to the point of complete union is suffering, yearning.''
She: ``And complete union'' is ``achieved only in death.'' A cheery
couple they were. Thomas Mann would not have existed without this
opera whose love-death theme invests itself in a lifetime of his
writing.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Tristan und Isolde,'' after a long wait, has been returned
to us, and we may be able to keep it for a while. It will depend on
the longevity and health of these singers, and both sound smart
enough to live long vocal lives. We need them because Wagner's
music is irresistible. Indeed, if the appreciation of Haydn is a
shared civility, Wagner's appeal bypasses civilized thought
altogether and goes direct to the most unsettling of primal urges.
We put up with prolixity and cryptoliterary hot air because
something has reached deep into our insides.
</P>
<P>
   There is no other music like it, and I have never heard a better
performance. I think everyone in Monday's audience had some inkling
of the occasion.
</P>

TV NOTES: ABC'S PHENOMENAL `MILLIONAIRE'; ROONEY VISITS NBC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olympic-Caliber Performance
</P>
<P>
   For the last three weeks, ABC's game show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' has so dominated television that competitors have
taken to writing off this month as an aberration, something unlike
anything they have ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   But they're wrong. ``Millionaire'' is very much like a
phenomenon they have been before: the Olympics. As recently as last
February, a television sweep rating month was anomalously skewed by
the performance of one two-week-long event, the Winter games from
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the ratings results are remarkably similar: CBS got
about a 16.3 rating for its 17 nights of prime-time coverage of the
games. So far, ABC is averaging a 14.6 rating for the 16 nights of
``Millionaire.'' (A ratings point this season represents just over
a million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is one major difference. CBS paid $375 million
for the rights to the Olympics. ABC has shelled out about $12
million for ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that certifies ``Millionaire'' as probably the biggest
television bargain in recent network history _ if not history,
period _ a one-on-one financial comparison of the two events is a
little unfair. For its extra $363 million, CBS also got weekend,
late night and morning Olympics coverage, as well as an association
with the Olympics that it could turn into cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison is certainly apt in terms of what it has
meant to the sweep-month competition. NBC, for example, always
discounts Olympic years when it counts up the sweep-month
competitions it has won in recent years. It may be tempted to do
the same with this sweep month, which ABC is virtually certain to
win, even among those 18-to-49-year-old viewers that NBC uses as
its only benchmark of success.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has ``Millionaire'' pushed ABC's ratings to the
stratosphere (the network is up more than 30 percent this November
from last November), but almost all the shows that have gone up
against ``Millionaire'' have had their ratings artificially
depressed by its success. In the past week, hits like ``Frasier,''
``Touched by an Angel'' and ``King of Queens'' were all buried in
the ``Millionaire'' avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous network executives have complained about the inanity of
sweep months in recent years, saying that specials and programming
stunts like big mini-series were being thrown into these special
ratings periods, resulting in often bizarre rating spikes that
would never carry over to the rest of the television season.
</P>
<P>
   Because the whole point of the sweep ratings is to determine
advertising prices at local stations for the next quarter, filling
one sweep with a program that disrupts the normal ratings would
seem to render the whole process unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   In general, sweep months dominated by Olympics do get downgraded
in terms of their significance. Presumably the competing networks
will try to do the same thing with ABC's month of ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that ABC is surely not going to wait four
years to bring back ``Millionaire.'' The network's executives will
be thrashing out their plans for the show's future over the next
week, with a likely decision on Tuesday. The show needs to get a
production schedule in place. Regis Philbin, the host, needs to
work out his own busy schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, concerned that other networks will throw on game shows to
dilute the phenomenon of ``Millionaire,'' is now leaning toward
bringing the show back on a regular basis starting in January,
probably at least twice and more likely three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that much ``Millionaire,'' ABC will not be able to
replicate the total ratings it has produced over the past two-plus
weeks, when ``Millionaire'' was on every single night. Nor has it
yet been proved that ``Millionaire'' will give a boost to the
ratings for other ABC shows.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more clear than this past Sunday, when a huge
audience of 28.2 million watched ``Millionaire'' until 9 p.m. At
that hour, however, a mass exodus took place. ABC's 9 p.m. show,
``Snoops,'' drew only 11.4 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 million viewers who abandoned ``Millionaire'' are more
than most television shows ever attract. About 12 million dispersed
to other shows; the rest seem to have just been interested in
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's another similarity between ``Millionaire'' and the
Nagano Olympics. Nothing much else on CBS benefited from the
Olympics' coattails.
</P>
<P>
   A Visitor From CBS
</P>
<P>
   This week, Andy Rooney moves to ``Dateline NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's not exactly true. He isn't moving permanently, he'll
just be on the NBC magazine show for one night.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime commentator for CBS's ``60 Minutes'' will be
profiled on the Friday edition of ``Dateline,'' mainly because he
has a new book coming out, ``Sincerely, Andy Rooney,'' a collection
of letters from viewers and his responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard he was a smart, young talent,'' said Neal Shapiro,
the executive producer of ``Dateline,'' who may have been joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was totally my idea,'' Shapiro said. ``He had a book
out, he's incredibly well known and we thought he'd do a great
interview with John Hockenberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney said Wednesday that he indeed enjoyed talking with
Hockenberry about topics that ranged far from his book. The
interview includes his analysis of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
_ ``a great fascist mayor'' _ and Hillary Clinton _ ``a
carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said the only restriction on the interview was that NBC
not use it on its Sunday night edition, which runs opposite
Rooney's ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney said he told Don Hewitt, the ``60 Minutes'' executive
producer, and ``he couldn't have cared less.''
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that he had not seen much of ``Dateline NBC.''
``I think they did a great job on this, though,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   His one regret about appearing on Friday, however is that ``it's
too much Andy Rooney over Thanksgiving.'' Rooney is also the guest
on Larry King's CNN show Thursday night.

buy shares in the spider, you are buying an interest in all those
companies at once. In that respect, it's pretty much like an index
fund. The name may be laughable, something only a marketer could
dream up. But spiders are attracting serious money. (Ezell, Atlanta

   RUN-MARATHON _ ATLANTA _ Offering no prize money, the Atlanta
Marathon and Half Marathon have always been billed as a fun holiday
event for Atlantans. So it came as a shock to the Atlanta Track
Club when 58 runners from 19 countries entered this year's race.
That's a wider international field than the Peachtree Road Race and
for any Atlanta Marathon, even in the years leading up to the
Olympics. The foreign entries reflect Atlanta's growing
international flavor and technology _ this was the first year the
track club accepted online registrations, and most of the foreign
runners sent in their entries that way. They've helped boost the
race field by 10 percent this year. (Hiskey, Atlanta

   MISCELLANEOUS
</P>
<P>
   FBO-FOOTBALL-DAD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was immediately
apparent, even to this football idiot, that his team, the Falcons,
weren't going to just lose every game this year. They were going to
get creamed. They were few and small. The other teams were bigger,
faster, more skilled. It's not too tough to watch your kid lose _
we had seen that many times. But it's unbearable to watch a son
who's thrown his heart into it, who's spent hours practicing every
day after school, who's wanted nothing in his life more than to win
this game, destroyed, helpless, hanging his head, without hope.
This is a dad's story about his son's love for football. (Neal,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER-BRANDON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Brandon Taylor's down
to morphine and a miracle. Doctors say his future is almost all
used up. Bone cancer. The doctors have sent the 19-year-old home to
a small white house in Riviera Beach, Fla. No cutting-edge cure, no
long-shot surgery is scheduled. But convincing Brandon, his mom,
Linda, and a couple of guys with the Miami Fusion soccer team that
there's no hope is another matter altogether. (Lomartire, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-CONCUSSIONS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The sensations were
familiar to Bubba Wilson. Light-headed and dizzy, the Benjamin
School linebacker staggered to his coach after a jarring collision
during practice and passed out. Wilson had sustained his fourth
concussion as a high school player, but this time a blood vessel
had burst in his brain and Wilson almost died that day during a
three-hour operation. That was during Wilson's junior year in May
1995. He never played football again. ``A lot of people say I'm a
walking miracle,'' said Wilson, now a junior majoring in sports
management at Florida State University and an undergraduate
assistant for coach Bobby Bowden. Wilson's experience is an extreme
example of the dangers of concussions, but today head injuries on
the high school level are being carefully studied. (Dorsey &AMP;

 &HT;    GORE IS MENDING FENCES WITH WOMEN, A KEY TO HIS ELECTION HOPES
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is busy these days trying to
mend fences with perhaps the most powerful constituency in the
Democratic Party _ women.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing his party's nomination is a matter of simple
arithmetic: He can't win unless a majority of Democratic women vote
for him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa earlier this week, Gore sought to reassure Democratic
women concerned over his recent missteps on legislation involving
poverty and reproductive freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed that his ``passions'' are rooted in the party's core
commitments to fight poverty, improve health care and education,
and protect abortion rights. ``I feel it in my bones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, however, abortion rights activists were warning
Gore of political repercussions over a White House budget deal with
the Republican-led Congress that cuts funding for international
family planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a campaign issue no matter what,'' said Gloria
Feldt (cq.), president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. ``If
(Gore) doesn't speak up, his silence will be eloquent and be
noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   And just a week before that, feminist groups were accusing the
vice president of insulting them by backing ``pro-fatherhood''
anti-poverty measures in Congress that they said ignored interests
of battered women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do everything we can to stop it,'' National
Organization for Women (NOW) President Patricia Ireland said in a
statement that specifically cited Gore's support for the GOP
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the recent disclosure that he has been getting
campaign advice for $15,000 a month from feminist author Naomi Wolf
prompted some criticism from rival feminists. Lecturer Camille
Paglia called Wolf a ``Seventeen magazine-level'' feminist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's problems are not so great that Democratic women activists
are organizing in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first stops in the
2000 presidential contest, to derail his campaign for their party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, say longtime Gore associates like Marla Romash, is
his ``sterling'' record on issues of importance to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always agree about everything,'' said Romash, who
was deputy chair of Gore's presidential campaign until it moved to
Nashville this fall. ``But there is no one running for president
with a stronger commitment or record on women's issues than Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning of Gore's campaign, he has promoted a
grab-bag of women-friendly policy initiatives: equal pay for equal
work, expanding federal family leave policies, easing rush-hour
traffic jams and suburban sprawl, expanding gun controls, creating
after school programs, developing programs for pre-school age
children, and cracking down on online stalking.
</P>
<P>
   And in nearly every one of his campaign speeches, he pays homage
to his mother, who worked as a waitress in Nashville and who, in
1936, became one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his campaign manager is a woman, Donna Brazile
(cq.), as is his top domestic policy adviser, Elaine Karmack.
</P>
<P>
   Some abortion rights activists appear willing to forgive the
vice president in the flap caused by President Clinton's budget
deal with the GOP leadership of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what the administration has done, we are
confident in Gore's support for a woman's right to choose and
consider him to be a fully pro-choice candidate,'' said Kate
Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League (NARAL).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the stumbles by Gore and the White House have
given Bill Bradley, his sole opponent for the Democratic
presidential nomination, an opportunity that may not have existed a
month ago _ to cut into Gore's commanding lead with women who plan
to vote in the Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely a coincidence, then, that after months of
highlighting his professional basketball career, Bradley is talking
about what he did for women as a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women don't know some of the things I've done in
Congress, and some of the things I want to do,'' Bradley said last
weekend during a campaign swing through Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it by chance that Bradley's first TV advertisement,
which began airing last week, features a woman talking about his
1996 law guaranteeing mothers at least 48 hours in the hospital
after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Behind each candidate's maneuvering is a stark political reality
_ a candidate in the Democratic presidential primaries cannot win
the party's nomination without winning a majority of women voters.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, Gore has a double digit lead over Bradley among
women who intend to vote in Democratic primaries. In the Dartmouth
College-Associated Press New Hampshire Poll in early November, for
example, Gore led Bradley among women, 53-38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the Dartmouth-AP poll has detected a gender
gap in the Democratic primary, according to Linda Fowler, who
supervises the poll. Such a gap has been apparent in general
elections since 1980, with a majority of women tending to favor the
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley had a 54-35 percent lead over Gore among men in
the Dartmouth-AP poll this month, women constitute a majority of
Democrats in nearly every state. The sample in the Dartmouth-AP
poll reflects that imbalance. Of the 367 likely Democratic voters
polled, 212 were women and 155 were men.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a strategy that targets men instead of women is not a
winning strategy, at least in the Democratic primaries,'' said
Fowler, who also is director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center
for Public Policy and Civic Leadership at Dartmouth.

</P>
<P>
   RUN-MARATHON _ ATLANTA _ Offering no prize money, the Atlanta
Marathon and Half Marathon have always been billed as a fun holiday
event for Atlantans. So it came as a shock to the Atlanta Track
Club when 58 runners from 19 countries entered this year's race.
That's a wider international field than the Peachtree Road Race and
for any Atlanta Marathon, even in the years leading up to the
Olympics. The foreign entries reflect Atlanta's growing
international flavor and technology _ this was the first year the
track club accepted online registrations, and most of the foreign
runners sent in their entries that way. They've helped boost the
race field by 10 percent this year. (Hiskey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 18.

   MISCELLANEOUS
</P>
<P>
   FBO-FOOTBALL-DAD _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was immediately
apparent, even to this football idiot, that his team, the Falcons,
weren't going to just lose every game this year. They were going to
get creamed. They were few and small. The other teams were bigger,
faster, more skilled. It's not too tough to watch your kid lose _
we had seen that many times. But it's unbearable to watch a son
who's thrown his heart into it, who's spent hours practicing every
day after school, who's wanted nothing in his life more than to win
this game, destroyed, helpless, hanging his head, without hope.
This is a dad's story about his son's love for football. (Neal,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER-BRANDON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Brandon Taylor's down
to morphine and a miracle. Doctors say his future is almost all
used up. Bone cancer. The doctors have sent the 19-year-old home to
a small white house in Riviera Beach, Fla. No cutting-edge cure, no
long-shot surgery is scheduled. But convincing Brandon, his mom,
Linda, and a couple of guys with the Miami Fusion soccer team that
there's no hope is another matter altogether. (Lomartire, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.

   SPORTS-CONCUSSIONS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The sensations were
familiar to Bubba Wilson. Light-headed and dizzy, the Benjamin
School linebacker staggered to his coach after a jarring collision
during practice and passed out. Wilson had sustained his fourth
concussion as a high school player, but this time a blood vessel
had burst in his brain and Wilson almost died that day during a
three-hour operation. That was during Wilson's junior year in May
1995. He never played football again. ``A lot of people say I'm a
walking miracle,'' said Wilson, now a junior majoring in sports
management at Florida State University and an undergraduate
assistant for coach Bobby Bowden. Wilson's experience is an extreme
example of the dangers of concussions, but today head injuries on
the high school level are being carefully studied. (Dorsey &AMP;

EXCAVATING THE REFRIGERATOR FOR USOS _ UNIDENTIFIED SHRIVELED
OBJECTS  
 (DW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STARSHINE ROSHELL   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ You know they're in there, but you're
afraid to look.
</P>
<P>
   Black bananas. Wilted lettuce. Curdled milk. Fuzzy casserole.
That jar of hoisin sauce you bought to make spring rolls three
years ago, but haven't used since.
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning the refrigerator is quite possibly the yuckiest
household chore there is. Worse than taking out the trash, clearing
the rain gutters, scrubbing the toilet or even picking up after the
dog.
</P>
<P>
   But there comes a time when you've just got to don those rubber
gloves, hold your nose, open the door and dig in, and right before
Thanksgiving is the perfect time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Besides needing a place to store all that Turkey Day grub,
you'll want to stockpile serving dishes and Tupperware, many of
which may be missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be asking yourself, `What happened to that little
yellow bowl?' And it's probably in the back of your fridge with
some hairy corn in it,'' said Carolyn Verweyst, ``doctor of
refrigeratorology'' for Whirlpool Home Appliances
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, your mother's probably coming to visit and she's going
to look in your fridge and be aghast, saying `Didn't I train this
child better?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But what persnickety relatives don't understand is that a
refrigerator isn't just the place where we store our next meal.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers stash batteries and film in butter bins. Others
keep nail polish and cigars on the shelves. Gardeners like to
``winterize'' bulbs and seeds in the crisper. Procrastinators store
sprinkled clothes they plan to iron some day. Some people store
important papers in zip-lock bags, hoping the documents would
survive a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Sherwin, director of food service for Santa Barbara City
College, knows athletes who keep tennis balls in there. ``They
think the colder the ball, the more lively it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But true gourmets don't abuse their kitchen appliances by
overstuffing them with outdated and inedible objects, said Sherwin,
who also heads the college's prestigious Hotel, Restaurant and
Culinary Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good chef will always be very well organized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin's students are taught how to properly wrap and date food
for storage, and to prevent food-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the 72-hour rule in food service,'' he said. ``After
72 hours, leftovers should be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since many microorganisms that grow on food are invisible,
tasteless and odorless, you can't rely on your senses to sniff out
the stuff that's past its prime.
</P>
<P>
   When done regularly, cleaning out the fridge should only take a
couple of minutes, said Verweyst, who offers tips to consumers on
Whirlpool's refrigerator hotline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salad dressings and condiments are not meant to stay in there
for 10 or 12 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to dates, she advises, especially on perishable
goods like fresh eggs, which should be kept covered in their
original cartons to prevent moisture from escaping the shells.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years at Whirlpool, Verweyst has learned great tips for
eliminating odors, such as spreading baking soda, fresh coffee
grinds or activated charcoal in a baking pan and setting it on a
refrigerator shelf. If that doesn't work, she said, try this
dealer's trade secret: Empty and unplug the fridge and fill it with
balled-up sheets of newspaper and a bowl of water for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most drastic cleaning and deodorizing methods aren't
enough to spiff up some fridges. Verweyst had a girlfriend who once
confessed that her husband, a hunter, kept a bear's head and skin
in their freezer until he could save up the money to have it
stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Shirley, I'm not eating at your house anymore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Verweyst, who can be reached by e-mail at
doctor(AT)whirlpool.com, suggests that people follow these steps to
a spiffy fridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unplug the appliance before doing major cleanings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove all USOs, or unidentified shriveled objects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash veggies in cold water and trim bruised spots before
putting them in the crisper. Leave fruits unwashed in their
plastic, perforated bags.
</P>
<P>
   _ Meat drawers are engineered to be the coldest part of the
refrigerator. Use them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Throw out anything with an expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wipe bottles and jars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Store freezer items in airtight, moisture-proof packaging.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scrub the refrigerator walls with warm water and a mild
detergent, rinse and dry. Then wash them with a mixture of two
tablespoons baking soda and a quart of warm water, rinse and dry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash the rubber gasket around the door with warm water and a
mild detergent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove the base grill and vacuum the coils to remove pet hair
and dust that make the refrigerator work harder to keep cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Insert a pan full of baking soda, coffee grounds or activated
charcoal (from a pet store) to remove odors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Update your model. Refrigerators from 1972 cost about $143 in
electricity annually, while a 1993 model costs about $54.

SYNDICATE SET TO RERUN `PEANUTS' IF NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ As Charles Schulz begins chemotherapy to
combat colon cancer discovered last week during emergency surgery,
his cartoon and product-licensing syndicate says it will begin
distributing reruns of ``Peanuts'' strips if he is unable to draw
new ones by the start of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really hope that he feels well and continues'' drawing the
strip, said Diane Isolin, a spokeswoman for United Media in New
York. She said that if Schulz cannot produce more ``Peanuts''
cartoons by the time the five-week inventory is used up, the
syndicate will begin republishing strips from the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   United Media is the umbrella organization to United Feature
Syndicate, which distributes ``Peanuts'' to 2,600 newspapers in 75
countries, and to United Media Licensing, which licenses the huge
assortment of toys, stationery and other merchandise that feature
likenesses of Charlie Brown, Snoopy and the rest of the ``Peanuts''
gang.
</P>
<P>
   Isolin said syndicate employees are signing a 4-foot-tall card
decorated with members of the ``Peanuts'' gang. ``We are thinking
of him and his family, and our prayers are with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cards and calls continue to stream into Schulz's office and
studio near his Snoopy's Redwood Empire Ice Arena in Santa Rosa,
which is about 50 miles north of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even been able to open them all today,'' said Edna
Poehner, one of Schulz's secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, 76, a native Minnesotan who has been Sonoma County's
most renowned resident since he settled in the county in 1958, went
to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital by ambulance last Tuesday. He was
working at the studio when he told employees he didn't feel well
and had pain in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors performed emergency surgery to clear a blockage of the
abdominal aorta that carries blood from the heart to the lower
body. During the surgery, they discovered cancer in the colon.

`END OF DAYS': SATAN IS PLANNING MILLENNIAL MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``End of Days,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger assumes the cruciform
position in a church as he modestly tackles the role of Jericho
Cane, someone who could keep mankind free of Satan for the next
thousand years. ``This is as pro-religious a movie as you can
make,'' the film's director, Peter Hyams, recently told Variety.
``This is about the biggest action star of the past 20 years
putting the gun down and saying the only thing that works is
faith.'' What that statement overlooks is that it takes two
ridiculous blood-soaked hours for Schwarzenegger to part company
with his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Like a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic action
films, ``End of Days'' presents Jericho as a near-suicidal
(``Lethal Weapon'') ex-cop. Its idea of a subtle character flourish
is giving him a ballerina music box, which makes him think sadly of
his wife and daughter. They were killed because he was too busy to
be home much, but by-the-numbers Hollywood screenwriting has ways
to assuage such guilt. Jericho will be given a second chance: he
can try to save Christine York (Robin Tunney) from becoming the
mother of Satan's child (``Rosemary's Baby'').
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Byrne, who has a much snappier role, plays Satan with an
evil grin and a slick corporate edge (``Devil's Advocate'').
Actually, Byrne merely plays an investment banker who happens to be
overtaken by Satan in the men's room of a restaurant. The essence
of evil, which looks like throbbing plexiglass with attitude
(``Predator''), enters the banker's body with a great show of
demonic possession (``The Exorcist''). Once a nice guy, the banker
returns to the dining room, walks over to a woman in a low-cut
dress and simply grabs her breast. Then he kisses her, and she
enjoys it. The episode may not say much about Satanism. But it does
indicate something about the guys who made this movie.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Satan must mate with Christine before New
Year's Eve 1999, and that a battle royal is being waged over
Christine's future. In one of the film's earliest and kookiest
scenes, the infant Christine was whisked from the maternity ward to
the morgue and suckled with snake's blood while Satanists prayed in
Latin. Since then she has been carefully watched by a stepmother.
The stepmother at least has a chance to slug Schwarzenegger when
the action gets going.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days,'' which is as incoherent about its mysticism as
it is about anything else, interrupts stretches of doomsday
exposition with the inevitable chases and shootouts and beatings
that are its raison d'etre. One character tears out his own tongue,
keeps it in a jar, and eventually winds ified on the ceiling
of a hospital room. These are the kinds of hints that persuade
Jericho of the urgency of his mission.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Pollak as his wisecracking sidekick, Schwarzenegger
eventually cuts through the religious forces on either side of him
and begins to deliver a mean-spirited quip or two. (``I'm not
afraid to die,'' says his enemy. ``Good,'' says the star, ``because
I'm not afraid to kill you.'') Looking trim and rested in his first
film since ``Batman and Robin,'' he moves confidently from crisis
to crisis, but can't get past much of the sheer absurdity here. It
is no longer possible to believe in special-effects shots that show
him hanging one-handed from a very tall building, for instance. As
for the film's millennial pretensions, they don't amount to much
more than billboards reading ``NY2K Where Will You Be?'' A possible
answer, to cite one of numerous better movies around: anywhere but
here.

 &HT;    Presbyterian tapped for House Chaplain
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The former pastor of North Avenue Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta has been named chaplain of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Parker Wright was selected by a search
committee and named this week by House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to serving the members and their families with
a caring, sensitive heart and to help them bear the loneliness of
leadership,'' said Wright in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was senior pastor of North Avenue Presbyterian Church
from 1976 to 1984. It was a critical time for the church following
the tenure of the Rev. Vernon S. Broyles, the much revered pastor
who led the church for nearly three decades, said Rev. Neil Ponder,
former associate executive director of the Christian Council in
Atlanta. ``But he (Wright) was known as an extremely kind and
caring pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   During Wright's tenure at North Avenue, he strengthened the
church's missions overseas as well as in the inner city of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful shepherd of the flock who cared deeply for
the people of the congregation,'' said Rev. Scott Weimer, the
church's current senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Keeble, a longtime parishioner, said Wright built and
sustained long-lasting friendships during his time in Atlanta.
Wright, a father of five, was particularly good with children.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 2, Keeble's granddaughter, Katie, started bringing
Wright a piece of candy each Sunday as a token of her affection.
</P>
<P>
   That friendship lasted even when Wright moved to Washington to
work for the non-profit International Foundation, which developed
the National Prayer Breakfast. The spiritual breakfast seeks to
cross international, party and religious boundaries through prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Wright came to Atlanta to marry Katie, now
23, and her fiance, Mark. As a token of their 21-year-old
friendship, Katie slipped Wright a piece of gum at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``His long suit is his interpersonal gift for being able to
relate to people,'' Keeble said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright will replace James Ford, a Lutheran who became House
chaplain in 1979 after 18 years as the chaplain at the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point. Before ministering in Atlanta,
Wright was a minister in Pennsylvania and has served as pastor to
churches in Maryland and Washington.

   Testing. Please ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

<P>
   WAR-ZONE-FILM (New York) _ Tim Roth sits at a table in a sleek
SoHo hotel looking oddly battle-ready. ``I'm prepared for
anything,'' he says after a sip of bottled water. Actually, he's an
actor preparing for the opening, on Dec. 10, of his directorial
debut, ``The War Zone.'' And he has reason to be wary. Based on the
British writer Alexander Stuart's novel about a family destroyed by
incest, the film is an unflinching adaptation of a disturbing story
that has already provoked sharply divided reactions. By David Bahr.

<P>
   FIENNES-FILMS (New York) _ Ralph Fiennes, a very private actor,
who turns 37 this month, has earned a reputation for being somewhat
insular and aloof since his astonishing debut in 1983 as the brutal
Nazi concentration camp director in Steven Spielberg's
``Schindler's List,'' for which he was nominated for best
supporting actor. His new movie, ``The End of the Affair,'' which
opens on Friday, takes place in crowded cafes that it is impossible
not to be reminded of Maurice Bendrix, the brooding, disaffected
1940s intellectual he plays in the film. ``The End of The Affair''
is based on the Graham Greene novel of the same name and was
arguably the author's most autobiographical work, drawing on his
illicit love affair with a married American named Catherine
Walston. By Jennet Conant.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN-FILMS (New York) _ At last year's New York Film
Festival, the director Aleksei Guerman, a bear of a man with a
disarming wit and a typically Russian sense of irony, introduced
his latest work, ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' to the press. It was the
first time in his 40-year career, he said, that he had completed a
film that had not been immediately shelved by the authorities. His
previous work, ``My Friend Ivan Lapshin,'' spent four years in
limbo before its release in 1985, when it became a celebrated film
of the perestroika era. ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' which on Friday
opens FilmFest, a series of recent films from Russia and the former
Soviet republics at the Museum of Modern Art, is set in 1953,
during the last days of Stalin's reign of terror. By Nancy Ramsey.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ALVIN-AILEY-DANCE (Undated) _ It's hard to believe that Judith
Jamison is already celebrating her 10th anniversary as artistic
director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Next month, she
will receive a Kennedy Center Honor for her contribution to
20th-century dance. As arguably the most popular modern-dance
company in the world prepares for its monthlong season, Wednesday
(the 10th anniversary of Ailey's death) through Jan. 2 at City
Center in Manhattan, Ailey's mission to keep modern dance alive
through an eclectic repertory by a variety of choreographers has
been largely accomplished. By Robert Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOHN-ADAMS-MUSIC (Undated) _ John Adams, 52, an innovator in
Minimalist style music, has a 10-CD retrospective on the Nonsuch
record label, ``The John Adams Earbox,'' which invites even
listeners who know his work to hear it afresh in a career-wide
context. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE-PERLE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Generations of music students
have gained admission to 20th-century music theory through the
imposing but welcoming portal of George Perle's book ``Serial
Composition and Atonality.'' But a lot of its readers may not have
known that Perle is himself a fine composer, or that paradoxically,
his creative work stands distinctly aside from many of the
practices detailed in his book. Opportunities to hear his music
arrive in anticipation of his 85th birthday, next May. On Tuesday
evening at Cooper Union in New York City, the Da Capo Chamber
Players will present a concert of songs as well as chamber works.

<P>
   VEGAS-OPERA (Undated) _ What news on the Rialto? Since spring
they've finished construction on the bridge and filled the Grand
Canal, a few blocks down a new Paris has its Opera, Eiffel Tower,
and Hotel de Ville, and ``O'' has spoiled me for the ``Ring.''
Greetings from Las Vegas, self-styled Entertainment Capital of the
World, where I have lately landed to contemplate new frontiers for
opera _ opera, for the purposes of this discussion, standing for
something greater than itself. Somewhat to the surprise of
observers unattuned to the cyclical rhythms of cultural history, an
art form that within the lifetime of composers now near their prime
was being written off as a moribund anachronism is now experiencing
something very like a renaissance. By Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   YOUTHS-BACH-RECITALS (New York) _ With a fascinating concert
season well underway in New York, as one institution after another
tries intently if belatedly to come to terms with music of the 20th
century, it is easy for the moment to forget dreary, predictable
seasons of a year or two ago. It is also easy to assume that all is
well under the surface. But two recent Bach recitals suggest
otherwise, showing devastating anomalies in the way young
performers are fed into the system, or are not. By James R.
Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KEITH-JARRETT-ALBUM (Undated) _ Keith Jarrett's new solo album,
``The Melody at Night, With You,'' begs a listener to think about
the relationship between music and mortality. Jarrett, the Proust
of jazz, had chronic fatigue syndrome recently; for a while the
Internet was bubbling with rumors of his imminent demise that
gained credence after he canceled several concerts. The album is
dedicated to his wife, Rose Anne, and if one reads the song titles
_ ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ``Somebody to Watch Over
Me,'' ``Don't Ever Leave Me'' _ it can be surmised that she has
been an integral part of making Jarrett healthy again. By Peter
Watrous.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CARDBOARD-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Shigeru Ban, an architect who
lives in Tokyo, in the last five years has responded to the news of
earthquakes and other disasters as if to a call of conscience.
After the Kobe quake in 1994, Ban designed units of cardboard and
plastic housing for the thousands who had been driven from their
homes. The following year, he established the Volunteer Architects
Network, a nongovernmental agency of the United Nations. This year,
under the aegis of that agency, he has coordinated the production
and shipment of cardboard housing units for refugees in Turkey. By
Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   FACES-CENTURY-PHOTOGS (London) _ Photography in this century has
brought contemporary history, national and international, as close
as coffee spoons while at the same time keeping it at the safe
distance of reduced and isolated representations. ``Faces of the
Century: A Sainsbury's Photographic Exhibition,'' currently at the
National Portrait Gallery in London (through Jan. 30), points this
up quite cleverly. (Sainsbury's is a private arts sponsorship
program set up by grocery chain money in 1981 to deliver, as the
accompanying catalogue explains, ``high quality, imaginative and
dynamic arts sponsorships involving as many people as possible in
the communities where we trade.'') In restricting the century to
faces, and British faces at that _ you had best look elsewhere for
anyone important, like Stalin and Mao. By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN-BODY-PHOTOGS (Lisbon, Portugal) _ In strictly Darwinian
terms, the evolution of the human body may be slow, yet in this
century perception of the body has changed beyond recognition.
Photography is a major reason for this. More democratic, accessible
and unforgiving than painting or drawing, it has shaped how we look
at each other _ and ourselves. It has also redefined our notion of
the body in everything from entertainment, sports and fashion to
wars, famine and medicine. This, at least, is the premise behind
``The Century of the Body: Photoworks 1900 to 1999,'' an ambitious
photographic exhibition that runs through Dec. 19 at a cultural
center in Lisbon. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   JULIE-TAYMOR-ART (Columbus, Ohio) _ Can dramas that have been
stripped of their actors and actions, stripped of everything but
their props, costumes and sets, still be dramatic? The exhibition
``Playing with Fire,'' a survey of the artifacts of Julie Taymor's
25-year career as a director and designer of operas, musicals,
movies and plays, is a perfect test case. The exhibition is being
held at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. It will
be at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York in March. By Sarah
Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-AMERICAN-HOLLOW (Undated) _ Rory Kennedy's glowing face and
great smile stand out in the family photograph. Next to her is the
matriarch, who has 13 children and grandchildren galore. Most live
near her and all return regularly en masse for holidays and other
family gatherings. There are the young men, some of whom have had
problems with drinking, drugs or romance. The mentally retarded
sister is not there; she lives elsewhere. Not long ago, one of the
sons was arrested and jailed. The whole family united to support
him but couldn't come up with the $2,500 bail. That's right, it's
the Bowling family of Mudlick Hollow, Ky., the subjects of Ms.
Kennedy's HBO documentary ``American Hollow,'' which has its
television premiere Monday night. If many things about the Bowlings
seem similar to the huge Irish-American clan that Ms. Kennedy comes
from _ and she acknowledges that she found it easy to identify with
them, despite the obvious differences _ that just makes her point
about the value of documentary filmmaking. By Anita Gates.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKWORM-RADIO (Santa Monica, Calif.) _ In the world of serious
poetry and fiction, where text and technique are more important
than conventional book tour prattle or even plot, ``Bookworm'' is
considered something of a national resource, a sanctuary from
lightweight pop fiction and/or the canonization of well-known
authors. Although run on a shoestring and distributed free to a
shaky network of 50 or so public radio stations, the program has
run for 10 years and attracted heavyweights like Tom Wolfe, Scott
Turow, E.L. Doctorow, John Irving, Norman Mailer, Richard Ford,
Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, Paul Theroux, Joyce Carol Oates, Salman
Rushdie, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, Ann Beattie and Nicholson Baker. The
creator, producer and host, Michael Silverblatt, a tall, roundfaced
man in his 40s, welcomed them all in a tiny basement recording
studio at KCRW, a local public radio station. By Andy Meisler.

 &HT;    Ten great holiday ideas from a popular Atlanta show house
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 25.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By now, you're either up to your elbows in turkey
stuffing and too busy to think about Christmas. Or you're comatose
after the big meal and staring at the old bird's dried-out carcass,
bracing yourself for the Season of Stress.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas decorations go up earlier every year, which, whether
you deck the halls today or not until Dec. 24, can be a good thing,
as Martha Stewart says, for inspiring new and practical ideas. Many
can be found under one roof, at the Alliance Children's Theatre
Guild's Christmas House, open through Dec. 5 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen floral, interior and landscape designers have cast
their spell on the Richardson-Franklin House, a French country
manor-inspired home built in 1934 on the large estate of the late
Hugh Richardson Sr. The 25th annual event has become such a popular
offering that, after expanding from five to nine days last year,
it's been extended to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule required owner Bonnie Northen to move her family
out of the house for a month. Though the owners' furnishings stay,
designers are allowed to move some of them around to make room for
their holiday decorations and the crowds that follow. ``But Bonnie
has a great sense of adventure,'' said Kathy Bernhardt, chairwoman
of the event, which last year raised about $40,000 for the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Northen had worked on other fund-raisers, ``so I knew all the
ins and outs,'' she said. ``I just grabbed the kids, the dog, my
toothbrush and left,'' and those designing elves took over.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they've squeezed a tree into every room of the white
stucco and stone house, with its turreted tower, and dolled it up
with enough greenery _ including some in the shower _ to create an
enchanted forest.
</P>
<P>
   And like all decorator show houses, this one wasn't without its
last-minute glitches, as Kevin Norris can attest. ``The decorations
I ordered didn't arrive on time, so last night I literally started
pulling stuff out of my attic,'' the designer said on the eve of
the Nov. 13 opening.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a deadline pushes the fanciest plans out the window
and allows inventiveness to shine with some of the simplest ideas
that make you ask, ``Why didn't I think of that?''
</P>
<P>
   Now's your chance to take advantage of those smart ideas. After
all, it's just Thanksgiving, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO GET INSPIRED

</P>
<P>
   TIPS
</P>
<P>
   1. Give a tree texture with ribbons of different colors and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Linda Thomas' living room tree, decorated by Perry
Walston of Pretty, features six different ribbons and balls with
both shiny gold and matte finishes, repeated on the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   2. Highlight your home's architecture by using decorations of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   On the living room chandelier, Thomas enhanced the home's
country French style by incorporating wheat sheaves and bay sugar
pine cones. She repeated those elements, along with ribbons and
other trimmings, on the tree and mantel to coordinate the look.
</P>
<P>
   3. Emphasize the outdoors by bringing garden elements inside.
</P>
<P>
   Designer John Jeffrey decorated the master bedroom's balcony
with old urns and obelisks, then trimmed them with beaded balls,
garland and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   4. Use personal collections to make rooms less intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Kenneth Garcia (below) trims a hallway bust with holly.
While in the living room, Thomas' display of sterling silver sugar
shakers makes that area even more inviting. Mix the old with the
new, ``your grandmother's antiques with the cheap stuff,'' designer
John Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't forget outdoor living spaces for trees.
</P>
<P>
   On the sun porch, designer Robert Neely made a tree the
centerpiece of an open, airy room perfect for alfresco dining. He
trimmed it in warm earth colors of rich golds and faded greens so
that the tree doesn't appear stark against the autumn landscape.
</P>
<P>
   6. Enhance the theme of the tree with accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sun porch tree, Robert Neely placed old garden urns
and yellow fruit from a nearby quince tree to complement the
outdoorsy look.
</P>
<P>
   7. Avoid harming your trim with holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Designer David Lantz of Flowers from Holland wasn't allowed to
drive nails into the dining room mantel, so he attached his heavy
garland with cord roped through the holes of barbell weights,
tucked along the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   8. Personalize trees if you don't have heirloom ornaments or old
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   On a breakfast room tree, designer Tommy Bealls hung framed
photos of children.
</P>
<P>
   9. Mix and match china patterns to create interesting place
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Smith, a visual merchandiser for Tiffany, set the dining
room table with combinations of green- and red-banded plates and
chargers on top of gold-painted place mats made of woven birch
branches.
</P>
<P>
   10. Consider other greenery besides the usual suspects of holly,
cedar
</P>
<P>
   and magnolia.
</P>
<P>
   For the dining room mantel, designer David Lantz created
garlands from moss, feathers and eucalyptus for a natural woodlands
look.

   TIPS
</P>
<P>
   1. Give a tree texture with ribbons of different colors and
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Linda Thomas' living room tree, decorated by Perry
Walston of Pretty, features six different ribbons and balls with
both shiny gold and matte finishes, repeated on the mantel.
</P>
<P>
   2. Highlight your home's architecture by using decorations of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   On the living room chandelier, Thomas enhanced the home's
country French style by incorporating wheat sheaves and bay sugar
pine cones. She repeated those elements, along with ribbons and
other trimmings, on the tree and mantel to coordinate the look.
</P>
<P>
   3. Emphasize the outdoors by bringing garden elements inside.
</P>
<P>
   Designer John Jeffrey decorated the master bedroom's balcony
with old urns and obelisks, then trimmed them with beaded balls,
garland and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   4. Use personal collections to make rooms less intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Kenneth Garcia (below) trims a hallway bust with holly.
While in the living room, Thomas' display of sterling silver sugar
shakers makes that area even more inviting. Mix the old with the
new, ``your grandmother's antiques with the cheap stuff,'' designer
John Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't forget outdoor living spaces for trees.
</P>
<P>
   On the sun porch, designer Robert Neely made a tree the
centerpiece of an open, airy room perfect for alfresco dining. He
trimmed it in warm earth colors of rich golds and faded greens so
that the tree doesn't appear stark against the autumn landscape.
</P>
<P>
   6. Enhance the theme of the tree with accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sun porch tree, Robert Neely placed old garden urns
and yellow fruit from a nearby quince tree to complement the
outdoorsy look.
</P>
<P>
   7. Avoid harming your trim with holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Designer David Lantz of Flowers from Holland wasn't allowed to
drive nails into the dining room mantel, so he attached his heavy
garland with cord roped through the holes of barbell weights,
tucked along the ledge.
</P>
<P>
   8. Personalize trees if you don't have heirloom ornaments or old
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   On a breakfast room tree, designer Tommy Bealls hung framed
photos of children.
</P>
<P>
   9. Mix and match china patterns to create interesting place
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Smith, a visual merchandiser for Tiffany, set the dining
room table with combinations of green- and red-banded plates and
chargers on top of gold-painted place mats made of woven birch
branches.
</P>
<P>
   10. Consider other greenery besides the usual suspects of holly,
cedar
</P>
<P>
   and magnolia.
</P>
<P>
   For the dining room mantel, designer David Lantz created
garlands from moss, feathers and eucalyptus for a natural woodlands
look.

 &HT;    `Felicia' a journey into darkness
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think Norman Bates had mother issues? Meet Joseph Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), the protagonist of Atom Egoyan's unsettling new film,
``Felicia's Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilditch could be construed as Britain's answer to Norman: While
Norman was as flighty as the birds he stuffed, Hilditch is as
sturdy as an English Bulldog and as comforting as a tea cosy. No
wonder one of his favorite pastimes is cooking. He especially
enjoys watching tapes of an old '50s cooking show in which the chef
is a flamboyantly oo-la-la French woman named Gala (Arsinee
Khanjian, the director's wife). She is also, we later learn,
Hilditch's late mother about whom he is, to say the least,
conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Hilditch is a meticulous, lonely, mother-obsessed
eccentric. Nothing wrong with that. Nor is there anything overtly
wrong with the courtly, protective interest he takes in girls on
their own. So when Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), an unwed pregnant
Irish teen turns up in his hometown looking for the boy who seduced
and abandoned her, Hilditch naturally takes an interest. He even
tries to help her find the lawnmower factory where the lad
allegedly works. As he explains, ``Lost girls. All on their own
journey. In their time of need, they counted on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where they went wrong. For Hilditch is the kindest,
politest serial killer you'll never want to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Based on William Trevor's 1994 novel, ``Felicia's Journey'' is
less interested in its serial-killer scenario than in being a dual
character study. On the one hand, there's Felicia, burdened with
memories of a creepy emerald-drenched Ireland, a dying great-granny
and a disapproving father who insists her no-good beau has joined
the British Army. Everything about her is simultaneously forlorn
and fresh, yet she exudes life. She's the puppy put in a bag and
thrown off a bridge who somehow manages to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Hilditch, burdened by videotaped memories of a
mommy-grotesque, cooped up in his cramped, curio-filled mansion, a
musty cloud of death seeking human contact as best he can. The
elaborate spider-and-fly stratagems he uses to snare Felicia are
eerily fascinating. He even goes so far as to invent a dying wife
at the nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey'' isn't likely to strike as universal a
chord as Egoyan's breakthrough picture, ``The Sweet Hereafter.''
Like most of his work, it's elliptical, intellectual and distant.
We worry about Felicia yet, perversely, we worry just as much about
Hilditch. Some of this is because of Egoyan who hasn't lost his
taste for life's weirder corners. But most of the credit must go to
the amazing Hoskins who hasn't been this good since ``The Long Good
Friday'' and ``Mona Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   He gives the role a twisted delicacy worthy of Peter Lorre in
``M.'' When he takes Felicia under his burly wing, you almost
expect him to whistle a few bars of ``In the Hall of the Mountain
King.'' But this disturbing, autumnal movie has its own
appropropriate theme song: ``You Are My Special Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bob Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan. Rated PG-13 for
language, sexual situations and implied violence. 1 hour, 54
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Bob Hoskins will creep you out in this quietly
unsettling little film.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: Hoskins could be a long shot for best actor.

 &HT;    Turkeys surviving better in wild than on your table
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Nov. 25.
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy Thanksgiving. This is the day when the turkey is the most
celebrated bird in America. The turkey you munch today most
probably was raised by commercial growers in turkey houses strictly
controlled for temperature, humidity, water and food supply. But in
the wild, the wild turkey is one of Georgia's greatest examples of
a successful wildlife comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the bird's numbers had plummeted so low that they
were in danger of becoming extinct in the state. By 1973, when a
state restoration project was getting under way, there were about
17,000 of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the state Wildlife Resources Division, wild
turkeys can be found in every county in Georgia. Statewide, there
are more than 400,000 of the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys were abundant all over North America at the time of
the European settlement, but commercial hunting and extensive
development of natural areas for agriculture, industry and housing
decimated turkey populations. The Georgia restoration project
concentrated on strict enforcement of turkey-hunting laws, more
scientifically sound hunting seasons, and enhancing the turkeys'
habitat, such as deciduous woodlands and wooded bottomlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy habitat is the most important aspect of turkey
populations,'' says WRD biologist Reggie Thackston. Turkeys were
trapped in various parts of the state and relocated to establish
new breeding populations. More than 4,000 of them were relocated to
over 400 areas. Private landowners, hunting organizations and
conservation groups worked with the state to help the bird make its
remarkable comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys roost in trees and feed on the ground on insects,
berries, seeds and nuts. Turkey reproduction rates vary from year
to year, depending on the availability of acorns and other wild
food, weather and other environmental conditions. Wet and cool
conditions in the late spring and early summer of 1997 resulted in
poor reproduction rates for wild turkeys in Georgia. But their
reproduction rates were high in 1998 and this year.
</P>
<P>
   Long may the turkey gobble!

   Removing wallpaper doesn't have to be an overwhelming task. With
the right supplies and a little preparation, the job can be
completed in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The keys, says Dee Harris, who works in the design center at the
Home Depot on Sidney Marcus Boulevard, are softening the adhesive
backing and using a good paper scraper.
</P>
<P>
   Harris also recommends DIF wallpaper remover, especially for
large surfaces. But there are many other brands that will do a good
job.
</P>
<P>
   If the remover is concentrated and needs to be diluted, use hot
water rather than cold, because it helps soften the adhesive
faster.

 &HT;    De Niro, Hoffman mired in a cliche-ridden script
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Flawless'' might be a guilty pleasure _ if they'd made it 30
years ago. You could slip it into the VCR and giggle at its dated,
consciousness-raising plot and its by-the-numbers tale of a
homophobic security guard who learns to respect the brassy/soulful
drag queen next door.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the flick from writer-director Joel Schumacher is
a new release. Its weary cliches and flat comic bits are apparently
supposed to be fresh and insightful. That's like saying Schumacher,
who neutered Gotham in ``Batman Forever,'' then gave us the
loathsome ``Eight Millimeter,'' is a cutting-edge filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Robert De Niro plays Walt, a former security guard medaled for
in-service heroism. He has ongoing shouting matches with
cross-dressing neighbor Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who
rehearses cabaret numbers with three shrill pals.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty lives in a time-capsule apartment that's like a sequined
grotto of gowns, wigs and Marilyn Monroe memorabilia. If that's not
sad enough, he's got an abusive boyfriend, and he's saving up for
the operation that will make him ``a real woman.'' In other words,
the tired old noble-queen stereotype. Rusty is such a big soft
bundle of limp-wristed nobility, you just want to smack him. Or
her. And surely that's not what Hall or Schumacher intended.
</P>
<P>
   In classic (or creaky) odd-couple fashion, Walt suffers a
stroke, losing much of his ability to speak. He grudgingly takes
singing lessons from Rusty as vocal therapy. They bicker, they
bond, etc. Hoffman and De Niro are both dynamite actors, but
they're playing against their natural gift for combustible
characters. Many of the scenes play like a duel of speech
impediments: Rusty's fluttery whispers vs. Walt's garbled mumbles.
Sometimes you can't understand a word.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flawless''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Rated R for
language and strong violence. 1 hour, 51 minutes
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    NBC goes for glut factor in lineup Thanksgiving night
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a wretched Thanksgiving for TV characters, from
Felicity getting caught kissing her old boyfriend (by her new
boyfriend's mom) to ``Everybody Loves Raymond's'' in-law outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   But since Thursday is a day for stuffing ourselves, NBC offers
several more helpings of the same topic. The network has
re-jiggered its regular Thursday night into even more of a
Murderer's Row, popping in new episodes of ``Just Shoot Me'' and
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' while resting ``Jesse'' and ``Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rundown:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Friends'' 8 p.m. (5670) _ Monica's parents (Elliott Gould
and Christina Pickles) come to dinner, but she hasn't told them
she's living with Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Best bit: Everyone's reaction to eating Rachel's repulsive
dessert. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Just Shoot Me'' 8:30 p.m. (1477) _ In the only NBC show
without a Thanksgiving setting, Maya and Elliott are finally
getting together, but their first date is ruined by the return of
Cindy (``SNL's'' Cheri Oteri), Maya's dumb-as-a-stump, hyperactive
ex-secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Best bit: Cindy's icky description of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Frasier'' 9 p.m. (63632) _ Ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth)
makes her annual appearance, dropping off their son Frederick, then
staying for Thanksgiving. But Freddy is scheming to reconcile
Lilith and Frasier.
</P>
<P>
   Best bit: On ``Cheers,'' she was just another nut in the bar,
but on ``Frasier'' she's become Lilith Vader, the source of all
evil. Says Niles: ``If you kiss her too fast, you get an ice cream
headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Will &AMP; Grace'' 9:30 p.m. (87361) _ This sophomore sitcom is
really kicking it up. W&AMP;G invite their flamboyant buddy Jack's mom
(guest star Veronica Cartwright) for turkey dinner, but she doesn't
know Jack is gay. Hell-o? If Jack were any more flaming, you
couldn't put him out with a firetruck. Nevertheless, it's time for
Jack to come out to mom.
</P>
<P>
   Best bit: Karen gets drunk and, if possible, even more
narcissistic. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``ER'' 10 p.m. (91903) _ It seems like Carol Hathaway
(Julianna Margulies) has been pregnant for years, but tonight she
finally has her twins. First, though, she goes into labor on the
subway, staggers around for a while, collapses in a blizzard, has
several scares and a bloody C-section (``brought to you in living
color!'' as NBC's peacock promos used to say). No way NBC's going
to kill a baby on Thanksgiving on its most popular show, but this
episode is brutally stressful and gory, and best watched only if
your dinner is completely digested. Viewer tune-in is likely to be
enormous, but a lighter touch (or more attention to subplots) might
have made this show easier to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Best bit: When it's finally over.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Panache is a tricky substance to pin down. So is ``Panache,''
the wispy romantic comedy that opened last week at the Playhouse
Balcony Theatre in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Panache'' is two or possibly three different plays
that never really hang together.
</P>
<P>
   Through its first 15 minutes or so, it's a smartly observed
odd-couple setup about a condescending socialite who discovers an
unlikely soulmate in a (gasp!) fry cook. You know the format:
Free-spirited man liberates pampered, ``uptight'' woman, who in
return finds the sensitive soul lurking behind her paramour's
rough-hewn exterior.
</P>
<P>
   Not the most original premise, perhaps. But local playwright
Gordon has a light, pleasant touch with conversational rhythms,
which pulls his audience along until the play's structural
deficiencies begin to seriously detract from the mildly witty
repartee.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that disheveled chef Harry Baldwin (Eric Pierpoint) has
purchased a vanity license plate, ``PANACHE,'' that WASP-y matron
Kathleen Trafalgar (Lisa Pelikan) covets as a gift for her
workaholic husband. Kathleen, who's tougher than she looks,
resolves to use her feminine charms, and her checkbook, to make
Harry fork over the goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panache'' then jack-knifes into a prolonged flashback sequence
that begins promisingly but devolves into an unpersuasive attempt
to provide Harry with a psychological backstory. While the
playwright engineers a couple of unexpected twists, they fail to
add much emotional insight or comic layering to the story's central
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions among the play's five scenes are often casually
handled, leaving the actors to roll toward a conclusion that
finally seems more imposed than earned. A subplot involving Harry's
card-playing buddy Jumbo (well performed by Wesley Thompson) feels
particularly beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   Both principals acquit themselves well. Pierpoint, of Fox TV's
``Alien Nation,'' deploys a sly, offhand charm that does wonders
for a worn-out scenario. Pelikan at first overdoes her character's
snooty alacrity, but relaxes into the role as the play moves
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Director David Cox, part of a producing partnership that hopes
to bring more theater to this small, amiable venue, keeps Gordon's
dialogue flowing smoothly and maintains a high level of on-stage
energy. James Benjamin Cooper and Jillian McWhirter, who could be a
Kim Basinger body double, are fine in secondary roles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What: &LR;  ``Panache.''

GARCIA TO HEAD FBI'S CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas native Ruben Garcia, who fought terrorism and
white-collar crime in San Antonio in the mid-1990s, will lead the
FBI's Criminal Investigative Division beginning Dec. 1, agency
director Louis Freeh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who now oversees recruitment and hiring of FBI special
agents, will have the title of assistant director and supervise the
bureau's crime investigators. He will succeed Thomas Pickard, who
becomes the FBI's deputy director, its No. 2 official, Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben Garcia has distinguished himself as an investigator,
supervisor and leader, demonstrating the necessary qualities to
serve in one of the key posts in the FBI,'' Freeh said. ``His
leadership, professionalism and experience will be valuable assets
as the FBI approaches the new millennium''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a Brownfield native, served as assistant and then as
special agent in charge of FBI's San Antonio field office from June
1994 until June 1998. He was responsible for combating domestic
terrorism, national-security threats, civil-rights violations and
white-collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   During his 21 years with the FBI, Garcia has also worked in the
agency's San Diego and Miami field offices, where he primarily
investigated drug crimes. In addition, he served at FBI
headquarters from 1991 to 1994 as a supervisor in the Organized
Crime/Drug Section and the Violent Crimes and Major Offenders
Section in the Criminal Investigative Division.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 48, has a bachelor's degree in business administration
from Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

 &HT;    Many IT workers feel underpaid
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Charles E. Harmon joined his current employer he
was told he'd be able to do technical writing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's making $35,000 as a production coordinator working
on document design and layout. There's very little technical
writing involved.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he says, ``I feel underpaid for what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. Next Wednesday, the 25-year-old starts a
new job with a software firm making more than $40,000, and best of
all, the job gets him back into technical writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. Excellent. I'm very happy,'' Harmon said of his
forthcoming new job.
</P>
<P>
   In the year and a half since graduating from Kennesaw State
University, Harmon said he's often felt caught in the middle of a
tug-of-war among recruiters desperate for information technology
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the recruiters have dollar signs in their eyes,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   While the dollars and perks are reportedly flowing heavily in
this worker-starved economy, some techies are left wondering: Is
that all there is?
</P>
<P>
   Pay dissatisfaction in the high-tech field is pretty high.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven out of 10 IT professionals consider themselves
underpaid, according to a new pay survey by an Atlanta-based IT
employment Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that dissatisfaction, the report found that starting pay
is pretty healthy. And Georgians with 15 years or more experience
make more money than their U.S. counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that IT professionals with less than one year
of experience had average starting salaries of $44,000 a year;
Georgians with the same experience in other fields earned about
$38,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, IT vets in Georgia earned, on average, about $75,000,
compared to $66,000 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The annual survey, the second by ComputerJobs.com, polled 21,000
IT professionals nationwide on a variety of factors to pinpoint the
hottest jobs and pay satisfaction. The survey looked at pay based
on age, gender, experience, region, satisfaction and education.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's survey, 73 percent of those surveyed said they
felt underpaid. That number improved slightly this year: 65 percent
of those surveyed considered themselves underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Pay dissatisfaction was particularly acute among people who made
less than $44,000 a year. Seventy-five percent of those people
considered themselves underpaid, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
   IT professionals with college degrees outearned their trade
school peers by $7,000, which is an about-face from last year's
survey. Those with graduate degrees earned the most. Men continue
to earn more than women. Not surprisingly, people with highly
specialized skills and certification had high salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole IT arena is a very hot area to be in right now.
E-commerce and Y2K and networking are big skills areas right now,''
said Amy Berk, a spokeswoman for ComputerJobs.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vice presidents and directors are the highest paid IT
professionals at $94,000 a year, followed by chief executives,
presidents and chairmen at $86,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baby boomers, those between the ages of 35 and 54, earn
between $54,000 and $64,000, making them the largest wage earners
in the IT field.
</P>
<P>
   _ The five hottest skills are e-commerce, enterprise resource
planning, project management, networking and Windows development
</P>
<P>
   _ Highly specialized people had the highest salary. A person
with a MCSD was at the top of the pay heap with an average pay of
$63,000.
</P>
<P>
   ComputerJobs.com was founded by husband and wife Nancy and Mike
Gilfillan. The couple worked for various high-tech firms before
starting the online service in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   As for Harmon? The biggest lesson he's learned since graduating
from Kennesaw State University in 1998 with an English degree:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a raise in pay you either have to go to another
job at another company or ... be indispensable (where you are).''

 &HT;    Author predicts Internet bubble will one day burst
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The investment bankers and Wall Street analysts now
pumping Internet stocks to stratospheric heights will someday find
themselves hauled before a Senate investigating committee, forced
to explain why they misled investors about the promise of dot.com
stocks, says author Michael Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day (the Internet boom) is going to come a cropper,''
Lewis predicts. ``I'm not saying it's all one big bubble; there are
parts of it that are very real and substantial. But there are other
parts of this boom that are just air.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis chronicled the excesses of Wall Street in the '80s with
``Liar's Poker,'' one of the best-selling business books of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Atlanta last week to tout his latest book, ``The New
New Thing,'' now No. 5 on the New York Times best-seller list for
nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he tells the story of Silicon Valley's impact on the
American economy through the life of entrepreneur/engineer Jim
Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a poor boy from Plainview, Texas, has created three
billion-dollar high-tech firms _ Silicon Graphics, Netscape and
Healtheon _ and is now in the process of building a fourth, a
Web-based financial-services provider for the affluent called
myCFO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Clark as an epic American character,'' says Lewis. ``I
also wanted to write about someone who personified the Valley.
Clark was a type. Silicon Valley is littered with people who do
what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the buying frenzy for dot.com stocks began with the
initial public offering of Netscape in 1995. As Lewis tells the
story, Clark had a personal motive for pushing an IPO so early in
Netscape's history, when the company was barely a few months old
and had yet to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clark was lusting for a specially made yacht, the
largest in the world. Built in the Netherlands, it would be
completely computerized, so that Clark could sit in San Francisco
and sail the boat across the Atlantic from his desk. To make that
dream real, though, Clark needed the kind of cash that only an IPO
could generate.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape stock offering turned out to be a wild success.
Netscape shares, initially priced at $12, rose to $140 within three
months, and with that the Internet stock boom was on. ``People
started drinking my Kool-Aid,'' as Clark told Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of dollars in Wall Street fees generated by
Netscape and subsequent high-tech IPOs have created a system that
Lewis calls ``inherently corrupt.'' When dot.com companies go
looking for a Wall Street firm to handle their IPO, they select
those firms willing to give their stock ``good buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis recalls a meeting between Clark and Wall Street bankers to
discuss his idea for Healtheon, a company that would use the
Internet to handle the immense paperwork created among patients,
doctors and insurance companies. When one banker suggested that IBM
had started a similar service and might be a competitor, Clark
pounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got nothing on us,'' he said. ``As soon as we hire a
PR person, we're going to flatten them.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind Healtheon appealed to Clark in part because
he considered it safe from competition from Microsoft, which had
already begun to try muscling Netscape out of the Web-browser
business. But that changed when Microsoft invested in Atlanta-based
WebMD, at the time a consumer-oriented Web site offering medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark saw WebMD as just a fly-by-night operation with good PR
going for it,'' Lewis said. ``He didn't see it as any competition
at all. But that changed when Microsoft invested in it. That's when
he sent up the white flag and agreed to merge.'' Last summer,
Healtheon merged with WebMD, and Microsoft now has a seat on
Healtheon/WebMD's board.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The New New Thing,'' Lewis also documents the maiden voyage
of Clark's computerized yacht, Hyperion, across the Atlantic Ocean.
The software was still full of bugs, the technology was untested,
and the old-salt crew members deeply distrustful of this
new-fangled approach. But they set sail anyway, with both Lewis and
Clark aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled voyage was in some ways a metaphor for the world
economy, which is setting sail into a dangerous new era and betting
its future on high technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're all on board that boat!'' Lewis says. ``There was a
great conflict going on, between the old way and the new way, the
sailors vs. the geeks. That's what we all face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet revolution is already creating serious economic,
social and cultural dislocations, Lewis says. But unlike the
turmoil of the '80s, which displaced steelworkers and other factory
workers, this crisis will hit the middle and upper-middle classes
the hardest. For the moment, the impact of that change has been
disguised by all the profits being generated on Wall Street, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But when that bubble bursts, the fallout may become the hottest
political issue of the decade to come.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ President Clinton has pored over maps and
satellite images of Kosovo. He has received countless briefings
about it from aides. But Tuesday he set foot for the first time on
this tiny patch of Europe where the air war has ended but the
thorny problems of ethnic hatred and violence remain.
</P>
<P>
   At a sports arena here in southeastern Kosovo, Clinton addressed
several hundred Kosovo Albanians who were waving tiny American
flags and chanting out his name in an excited frenzy. Almost every
word he uttered won thunderous applause, even before the Albanian
translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic wanted to keep control of Kosovo by getting rid
of you, and we said no,'' Clinton said, referring to the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, whose troops violently uprooted many
thousands of Kosovo Albanians from their villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he has lost his grip on Kosovo and you have returned. No
more days hiding in cellars. No more nights freezing in mountains
and forests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's main message _ that the Albanians should try to
put all the atrocities behind them and forgive the Serbs _ brought
a stony silence from many of these most enthusiastic Clinton
backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot forget the injustice that was done to you,''
Clinton said. ``No one can force you to forgive what was done to
you. But you must try.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finished his point. The translator finished, too. For a
moment, all the excitement seemed to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was no surprise from this audience of Kosovo
Albanians. As Clinton arrived by helicopter, burned-out homes were
visible from above. ``Terrible ethnic cleansing'' is what the
president said had been done to them _ leaving emotions raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to hate now,'' said Arian Hoti, 31, who spent
the war hiding in abandoned houses. He stood and cheered Clinton
but said he could never befriend a Serb. ``It was a very bad
time,'' he explained. ``There were many atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his speech that he knew how much they had
suffered before the NATO air strikes, which ended in June and
helped them recover their homes. But he urged the parents in the
room to help build a better Kosovo by steering their children clear
of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for fighting has passed,'' Clinton said. ``Kosovo is
for you to shape now. The international community will stand by
you. But you must take the lead. What will you think about? Will
you be focused on hatred and past wrongs and getting even?''
</P>
<P>
   At the airport in Pristina, the provincial capital, Clinton met
in private briefings with the U.N. special representative, Bernard
Kouchner, as well as a variety of other officials with the United
Nations, the American military and the Serbian and Albanian
populations of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The picture he received was one of improvement but enormous
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Killings went down from a high of 114 weekly when the Albanians
first returned to about 32 a week two weeks ago. Last week, the
number dropped to one a day.
</P>
<P>
   Insulating the damaged homes is about 70 percent complete, U.N.
officials told Clinton. But the Balkan winter has already begun,
with chilly temperatures and a dusting of snow on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is denying that there's work to be done,'' said
Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who traveled with the
president. ``Everybody has a tendency to think problems can be
solved overnight. The problems faced here are terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit here was a major logistical undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a nine-day trip to Turkey, Greece, Italy and Bulgaria
aboard his regular Air Force One jet, the president switched to a
military cargo plane for the flight into Pristina. Then, he took a
helicopter south to Urosevac. He made a final stop at Camp
Bondsteel, the huge American military base that has grown out of a
former hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You brought enough gravel to lay a two-lane road all across
the state of Missouri,'' he told the enthusiastic soldiers
stationed here. ``In less than five months, you built 160 sea huts,
a chapel, a gym, a hospital, mess halls, a PX, a barber shop and an
aviation area.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited soldiers in their wooden barracks, shared a
pre-Thanksgiving lunch with them and joined his daughter, Chelsea,
in offering scores of morale-boosting handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the Balkans, sir,'' said one excited American in
camouflage, who like the rest had an automatic rifle slung across
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the soldiers that in addition to their peacekeeping
duties they could be a model to the people in Kosovo to show how
different ethnic groups coexist peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   During his quick visit to Urosevac, the affection the people
felt for Clinton was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan Illazi, who spent time during the war in a refugee camp
in Macedonia, introduced the president with the simple but powerful
words of a 14-year-old: ``You promised that you would bring us to
our homes safe. You kept your promise. We will never forget that
you brought us home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedat Burniku, a journalist at one of Pristina's three daily
newspapers, said he thought the people here would listen to
Clinton's words even though they would find it difficult to
immediately embrace his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``For ordinary people here, it may be too early for them to
forgive,'' Burniku said. ``But they believe President Clinton is
the reason they are back home.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton says frequently in speeches that hatred between those of
different religions or ethnic groups is the worst problem facing
the world at the close of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in Africa with a young man who lost his arm to
someone of a different ethnic group, who cut it off with a machete
simply because of his family heritage,'' Clinton told the people
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in Israel with schoolchildren staring at the
pictures of their classmates who were blown up in buses simply
because they were Jewish. I have been in Ireland, with a beautiful
16-year-old girl playing and singing to me, but her eyesight was
gone because she was blown up in a bomb just because of the
religious differences in Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his finger pointing out into the crowd, said, ``We owe
the children in Kosovo a better future than that.''

affirmative action, and the University has also been able to
attract students from impoverished rural and inner-city schools

 &HT;    Nearly worst-to-first: Georgia upends last year's ranking in
tech use category
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia took a giant leap forward to the number one
ranking on the Center for Digital Government's list which rates
states' use of technology. Georgia scaled the heights of
recognition because of its Web site for state business, the number
of agencies online and because the Web sites work, officials from
the center said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We examined 48 states that cooperated with our very rigorous
surveys, and Georgia came out best because of the way you could do
official transactions,'' said Rhonda Wilson, coordinator of the
state digital survey.
</P>
<P>
   The center examines how states use electronic communication for
various purposes, such as how they facilitated business with
suppliers, allowed citizens to transact state business online, and
promoted electronic commerce among businesses.
</P>
<P>
   On a given day in Georgia, you could sit at your computer and
sign a contract to provide cafeteria service at a state office
building, submit your daughter's application for admission to
Georgia Tech in the afternoon, and then help your brother renew his
physicians license in the evening. It is online access to state
operations that has put Georgia ahead of others, digital
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top five states were Alaska, Washington, Kansas
and Maryland. Southeast rivals Florida and Virginia ranked ranked
10th and 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranked 48th last year mostly because the state was not
diligent in cooperating with the complex surveys conducted by the
digital center, according to officials for the Seattle
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The good showing by Georgia was hailed by state officials,
educators and policymakers who have been working hard to improve
the image of Georgia as a technology center and a place for
high-tech companies to locate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really gratified,'' said Jim Flowers, technology
adviser to Georgia's Governor Roy Barnes. ``Many states make
announcements of technology innovations, and talk about plans to do
this and that, but we have tried hard to produce results. It is
gratifying to see this recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the specific accomplishments cited by the digital center
was the state's nationally recognized approval of electronic
signatures as a means to make contracts legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation, updated and improved this year, has been
regarded as a model for other states, and now incorporated in
pending federal legislation to authorize electronic signatures,''
Flowers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, without the force of electronic
signatures you defeat much of the purpose in setting up
business-to-business commerce on the Internet,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for Georgia's progress in a practical way
goes to Tom Bostic, director of GeorgiaNet, the system that
comprises the server computers for most state agencies and acts as
a resource for other agencies as they come online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago we devised generic systems for such
conveniences as the use of credit cards,'' said Bostic, ``and we
have been able to change banners and make other simple changes to
adapt that system to various agencies that want to take advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials say surrounding states frequently contact them
as they study ways to approach electronic commerce and most are
surprised that Georgia has already done it.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week Georgia State University issued a report on
behalf of the economic development arm of the Georgia Regents, and
in it compared the state to others around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, written under the auspices of the Intellectual
Capital Partnership Program by computer specialist Ephraim McLean,
Georgia was praised but urged to push even harder to become a
``benchmark'' for e-commerce excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, Georgia is recognized for its work in allowing
electronic transactions between vendors and suppliers doing
business with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is one of the most progressive states in this area,''
the report said. ``For certain conditions, the state accepts
telephone or telegraph bids as well as bids on the Internet.
Georgia also allows vendors to register online.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostic of GeorgiaNet said the state is especially proud of its
system that permits developers and others to get Georgia
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data online.
</P>
<P>
   Such information about rivers, streams, roads and other
geography and infrastructure are needed to draw up plans for new
development.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a process that could have taken months in the past can be
shorted dramatically, spurring economic progress around the state,
Bostic said.
</P>
<P>
   The McLean report said, however, much more can be done. It needs
to think through tax policy to establish some uniformity to a
system that allows counties to tax at different rates, a source of
confusion in electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, the state needs to consider tax incentives
that can encourage private business to help spread fiber optic
communications in rural areas making underdeveloped counties
suitable for new electronic industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the area of telemedicine, where treatments or medical
services are performed remotely, the state faces the challenge of
helping develop new reimbursement plans suitable for Federal
funding agencies and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, runner-up to Georgia in the e-commerce derby, drew
praise for its use of electronic debit cards for welfare recipients
and others on government support plans. Texas and Kentucky also
excelled in those services.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Center for Digital Government say several
additional areas of state activity are now being studied to gauge
the extent of digital processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to seeing how Georgia does in other areas such
as social services, and law enforcement and the courts,'' said
Rhonda Wilson of the Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``One element that helps us move fast and in a coordinated way
is the partnership between the executive and the legislature, where
task forces stand ready to consider needs and implementing
legislation,'' said Flowers, the governor's technology adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can count on that teamwork to keep us moving,'' he said.

CLINTON TAKES MESSAGE OF RECONCILIATION TO KOSOVAR ALBANIANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FERIZAJ, Yugoslavia _ To chants of ``U.S.A., U.S.A,'' Kosovar
Albanians offered President Clinton a hero's welcome Tuesday but
grew quiet when he urged them to forgive their Serb assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The long-suffering Kosovars, gathered in a chilly school
gymnasium, made clear that as U.S. and United Nations officials
tally the progress of rebuilding efforts, one key item remains
unchanged _ the human heart.
</P>
<P>
   The United States launched a Western-backed bombing attack last
spring to stop ``ethnic cleansing'' in the region, initiated by
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic's Serb troops, and to
return 1 million displaced Kosovars to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who stopped here on the last day of a southeast
European tour, was interrupted time after time by applause. Then he
said,``You can never forget the injustice that was done to you. No
one can force you to forgive what was done to you. But you must
try.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of parents, children and local leaders fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   He pressed on: ``We won the war. But, listen: only you can win
the peace.'' Finally, he elicited more applause.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tour of Turkey, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Kosovo
served up reminder after reminder of the centuries-long hatreds and
bitterness that make the region a troubled zone for the West.
</P>
<P>
   During visits, he repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey to set
aside centuries of conflict and reconcile. He urged Bulgaria to
move closer to its Western neighbors and in Italy, he discussed
ethnic divisions with several world leaders during an academic
panel on governing in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, the West's crisis manager, passed a U.S.-backed resolution
to bring regional disputes under its purview if they show potential
to spread beyond a nation's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue tackled: Russia and its independence-minded
Muslim majority in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking later to 300 U.S. troops, mostly from the 1st
Infantry's The Big Red One, called ethnic hatreds the biggest
problem facing the world today.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to be afraid of people who don't look like them,
and don't worship God the way they do, and come from a different
place. And when you're afraid of somebody, it's just a short step
to disliking them. If you dislike them, it's a short step to hating
them. If you hate them it's a short step to dehumanizing them. And
once you do that, you don't feel bad about killing them,'' Clinton
told the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st Infantry soldiers, their M-16 rifles slung over their
backs, are among 6,000 Americans stationed in Kosovo in an effort
to keep the peace between ethnic Albanians and Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took his message of reconciliation to Kosovo on a
bitterly cold day, flying in a C-17 Air Force cargo plane from
Sofia, Bulgaria, where he made a state visit, to Pristina. Attack
helicopters flew overhead to provide protection, and multinational
KFOR troops and police ringed the airport.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, Kosovo's capital, Clinton met with United Nation's
officials leading the Kosovo reconstruction project and met with
the Serbs' religious leader.
</P>
<P>
   ```We want to believe that the current tragedy in Kosovo is not
what the people of the United States had in mind when they
supported your intervention to protect the ethnic Albanians,''
Orthodox Christian Bishop Artemije said in an open letter to
Clinton carried by Belgrade's Fonet news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Kosovar Serbs have fled amid reprisal murders
during the end of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombing
campaign. The United States believes half the Serbs who lived in
Kosovo have left.
</P>
<P>
   As the sky began spitting snow, Clinton flew in an unmarked
olive green helicopter to Ferizaj where he addressed Kosovar
Albanians and on to Camp Bondsteel, the main U.S. compound in
southeast Kosovo, where he had an early Thanksgiving Dinner with
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Ferizaj, people arrived before dawn for one of the few
hundred seats in the gymnasium, viewing Clinton as a liberator from
their tormentors. Before the end of the conflict, Serb forces,
military and irregular, torched thousands of homes and conducted a
campaign of murder and rape as thousands of Kosovar Albanians fled
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never can live with the Serbs,'' said one woman, clutching a
U.S. flag. Her home had been burned by the Serbs. ``Serbian people
like to kill the people in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, a mother of three, said her children still are
traumatized by the Serb assaults. ``My children not feel well
because they are afraid very much of Serbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for fighting has passed,'' Clinton said, appealing to
parents to stop teaching their children to hate. ``Kosovo is for
you to know now. The international community will stand with you.
But you must take the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security
adviser, said he believed there was ``receptivity to a message of
tolerance from the president, and non-vengeance that the president
was giving at that school. Don't forget, most Kosovars want to get
on with their lives, and they've seen what happens from this
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton made the same speech ``in stark terms'' to
the leaders of the Kovovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As he did with the Turks and the Greeks and the Bulgarians,
Clinton recounted scientific evidence that all people share 99.9
percent of the same genetic make up. And, all the conflict is about
the remaining .1 percent difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, joined by daughter Chelsea, later had an early
Thanksgiving lunch with U.S. troops who have turned a rolling hay
field into 1,000 acres of gravel roads, wooden barracks and tented
warehouses to support Task Force Falcon. They were swarmed by
troops wanting photographs and autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked the troops not only for the job they have done
but for the good multiethnic example they set.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war was caused by a man's determination to drive a whole
people out of a country because of their ethnic and religious
background. It's the opposite of everything we believe in,
everything we live by, and everything the United States military
stands for,'' Clinton told soldiers after dinner.

 &HT;    CANDIDATE DEBATES, ESPECIALLY IN PRIMARIES, CAN ALTER CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics
categories
 &HT;    Advance for release Sunday, Nov. 28
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a quote borrowed from an old movie _ ``I paid
for this microphone, Mr. Green!'' _ Ronald Reagan stole the stage
from his Republican opponents at a 1980 New Hampshire debate. The
tide began flowing against front-runner George Bush and didn't stop
until it had swept Reagan into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for his first confrontation with his GOP
presidential opponents in Dec. 2 in New Hampshire, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush must face the fact that, as his father learned
nearly two decades ago, debates have the power to dramatically
shift a campaign's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly matters that Reagan's remark was lifted from ``State
of the Union,'' a 1948 Frank Capra movie starring Spencer Tracy as
a presidential candidate with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the name of the man to whom Reagan addressed himself was
``Breen,'' not ``Green.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's remark ``made everything that followed irrelevant,''
George Bush said in the vice presidential memoir he wrote to
promote his own successful campaign for president eight years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of debates, or more specifically, televised
debates, in modern presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because TV is a medium that focuses on the here, the now, the
snappy, it can make or break somebody in a presidential debate,''
said Leonard Steinhorn, an American University professor who was a
media adviser to Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And especially for a candidate like George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have not seen a lot of Governor Bush, so this could be
a fairly important debate for him,'' said Diana Carlin, a
University of Kansas professor and the chief adviser to the
Commission on Presidential Debates. ``Where you have softer support
or more volatility _ and that's usually in the primaries _ debates
can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan-Bush encounter in 1980 is often cited as such an
example .
</P>
<P>
   Debate moderator John Breen had ordered a sound technician to
``turn Mr. Reagan's microphone off'' as four uninvited GOP
candidates tried to join the debate. Reagan's forceful reminder
that he had underwritten the debate was the biggest news to come
out of the event, not the issues he and Bush debated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the 1984 Democratic primaries, Mondale's advisers
came up with a humorous phrase to mock opponent Gary Hart's claims
to have ``new ideas'' for the country. ``Where's the beef?''
Mondale responded, using the tag line from a popular Wendy's
hamburger commercial of the day. Aides later confided that Mondale
had never seen the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Media advisers to presidential candidates strive for such
made-for-TV moments, if not in the primaries then certainly in
general elections in which there are sizeable numbers of undecided
voters:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``There you go again'' _ Reagan's repeated rejoinder to Jimmy
Carter's attacks in their 1980 debate.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you remember when you said, 'There you go again?''' _
Mondale's retort to Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I will not hold my opponent's comparative youth and
inexperience against him'' _ Reagan's response to a question about
his age during his 1984 debate with the much younger Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Such slogans and snippets are part of presidential debate lore.
</P>
<P>
   But ``lost in post-debate coverage (are) the philosophies,
policies and proposals of the debaters, their important
similarities and differences, their alternative visions of the
country's future,'' according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of
the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, rather than come up with a memorable line, media
consultant Frank Greer pounded home a different debate point to
Bill Clinton: ``Go to the audience.'' And in the second debate with
then-President George Bush and independent Ross Perot, Clinton did
just that, rising from his stool and walking toward his questioner
in the audience with questions of his own about her economic
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very effective and had major impact on voters,''
Carlin said. Her focus groups interpreted Clinton's movement as an
attempt to ``really understand the question and that, by moving
closer, he was willing to subject himself to more scrutiny,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it hardly mattered that Clinton had his media advisers
calculate exactly how close he could move toward the audience
without moving beyond the range of the network TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's advisers had seen Donahue and Oprah _ they knew what
worked,'' said Steinhorn.
</P>
<P>
   But what worked for Clinton does not necessarily work for
others, including Clinton's own vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his joint town meeting with Bill Bradley in New Hampshire
last month, Gore also roamed the stage and engaged those in the
audience who asked questions with queries of his own. To some, it
appeared contrived, rehearsed, unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV likes people who appear comfortable and Al Gore does not
appear comfortable,'' said Steinhorn. ``George W. Bush appears
comfortable. A great governor? No. Somebody who is a national
leader? No. Somebody who has a great depth of intellect? No.
Somebody who has a vision of the future? Not really. But he's great
on TV. Whether that's bad or good is less relevant that the fact
that it is.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a quote borrowed from an old movie _ ``I paid
for this microphone, Mr. Green!'' _ Ronald Reagan stole the stage
from his Republican opponents at a 1980 New Hampshire debate. The
tide began flowing against front-runner George Bush and didn't stop
until it had swept Reagan into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for his first confrontation with his GOP
presidential opponents in Dec. 2 in New Hampshire, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush must face the fact that, as his father learned
nearly two decades ago, debates have the power to dramatically
shift a campaign's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly matters that Reagan's remark was lifted from ``State
of the Union,'' a 1948 Frank Capra movie starring Spencer Tracy as
a presidential candidate with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the name of the man to whom Reagan addressed himself was
``Breen,'' not ``Green.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's remark ``made everything that followed irrelevant,''
George Bush said in the vice presidential memoir he wrote to
promote his own successful campaign for president eight years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of debates, or more specifically, televised
debates, in modern presidential contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because TV is a medium that focuses on the here, the now, the
snappy, it can make or break somebody in a presidential debate,''
said Leonard Steinhorn, an American University professor who was a
media adviser to Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And especially for a candidate like George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have not seen a lot of Governor Bush, so this could be
a fairly important debate for him,'' said Diana Carlin, a
University of Kansas professor and the chief adviser to the
Commission on Presidential Debates. ``Where you have softer support
or more volatility _ and that's usually in the primaries _ debates
can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan-Bush encounter in 1980 is often cited as such an
example .
</P>
<P>
   Debate moderator John Breen had ordered a sound technician to
``turn Mr. Reagan's microphone off'' as four uninvited GOP
candidates tried to join the debate. Reagan's forceful reminder
that he had underwritten the debate was the biggest news to come
out of the event, not the issues he and Bush debated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the 1984 Democratic primaries, Mondale's advisers
came up with a humorous phrase to mock opponent Gary Hart's claims
to have ``new ideas'' for the country. ``Where's the beef?''
Mondale responded, using the tag line from a popular Wendy's
hamburger commercial of the day. Aides later confided that Mondale
had never seen the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Media advisers to presidential candidates strive for such
made-for-TV moments, if not in the primaries then certainly in
general elections in which there are sizeable numbers of undecided
voters:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``There you go again'' _ Reagan's repeated rejoinder to Jimmy
Carter's attacks in their 1980 debate.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Do you remember when you said, 'There you go again?''' _
Mondale's retort to Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I will not hold my opponent's comparative youth and
inexperience against him'' _ Reagan's response to a question about
his age during his 1984 debate with the much younger Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   Such slogans and snippets are part of presidential debate lore.
</P>
<P>
   But ``lost in post-debate coverage (are) the philosophies,
policies and proposals of the debaters, their important
similarities and differences, their alternative visions of the
country's future,'' according to Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of
the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, rather than come up with a memorable line, media
consultant Frank Greer pounded home a different debate point to
Bill Clinton: ``Go to the audience.'' And in the second debate with
then-President George Bush and independent Ross Perot, Clinton did
just that, rising from his stool and walking toward his questioner
in the audience with questions of his own about her economic
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very effective and had major impact on voters,''
Carlin said. Her focus groups interpreted Clinton's movement as an
attempt to ``really understand the question and that, by moving
closer, he was willing to subject himself to more scrutiny,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it hardly mattered that Clinton had his media advisers
calculate exactly how close he could move toward the audience
without moving beyond the range of the network TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's advisers had seen Donahue and Oprah _ they knew what
worked,'' said Steinhorn.
</P>
<P>
   But what worked for Clinton does not necessarily work for
others, including Clinton's own vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his joint town meeting with Bill Bradley in New Hampshire
last month, Gore also roamed the stage and engaged those in the
audience who asked questions with queries of his own. To some, it
appeared contrived, rehearsed, unnatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV likes people who appear comfortable and Al Gore does not
appear comfortable,'' said Steinhorn. ``George W. Bush appears
comfortable. A great governor? No. Somebody who is a national
leader? No. Somebody who has a great depth of intellect? No.
Somebody who has a vision of the future? Not really. But he's great
on TV. Whether that's bad or good is less relevant that the fact
that it is.''

STAR-STUDDED CAST FILLS BIG SCREEN FOR END OF TIME

<P>
   The end of the world _ coming soon to a multiplex near you.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, movies are showing a decided interest in
eschatology, the branch of theology that deals with death and final
judgment, and chiliasm, the belief in millennial upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the signs and portents are around us. In ``The Omega
Code,'' inspired by Michael Drosnan's best seller ``The Bible
Code,'' good and evil researchers grapple with the discoveries that
hidden prophecies are embedded in the lettering of the Torah, the
first five books of the Christian Old Testament. Take the fifth
letter in each sentence, for instance, and you can come up with
prophecies of nuclear Armageddon in 2000 or so, a meteorite hitting
Earth in 2006, etc.
</P>
<P>
   (Critics have pointed out that you can find similar hair-raising
prophecies in the text of Moby Dick or even Dave Barry's columns;
if you look long enough in any text of sufficient length, you'll
find what you want to find. But never mind.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Stigmata,'' an investigator from the Vatican (played by
Gabriel Byrne) must cope with statues weeping blood and an ordinary
American woman (Patricia Arquette) who has had the wounds of Christ
appear spontaneously on her body. The results of all this aren't
good news for the world, or at least for the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all, brethren and sisters. Opening Wednesday is
End of Days, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a burnt-out ex-cop,
must prevent Satan (Gabriel Byrne again) from mating with a virgin,
thus launching the End Times.
</P>
<P>
   Prophesied for Feb. 4 _ assuming, of course, we still have
theaters after New Year's Day 2000 _ is ``Lost Souls'' in which
Winona Ryder plays an exorcist trying to prevent the Antichrist
from occupying the body of an innocent young man (Ben Chaplin).
</P>
<P>
   Roman Polanski, who had Mia Farrow give birth to the Antichrist
in ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968), is weighing in early next year with
``The Ninth Gate,'' in which two demonic books (one thinks of H.P.
Lovecraft's Necronomicon) threaten to unleash the Final Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``WW3.com,'' a little-publicized feature whose plot
(World War III? Computers?) may be too horrid to be imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Even comedies are turning apocalyptic. In ``Dogma,'' the latest
irreverent feature from writer-director Kevin Smith (``Clerks,''
``Chasing Amy''), the last living descendant of Jesus Christ must
be enlisted to foil the antics of two fallen angels (Matt Damon and
Ben Affleck), whose efforts to sneak back into Heaven may bring on
The End.
</P>
<P>
   Disney subsidiary Miramax dropped the project (later picked up
by Lion's Gate) when it turned out that ``Dogma'' contained enough
heresy to offend anybody; it seems that Jesus' relative (Linda
Fiorentino of ``Men in Black'') works in an abortion clinic and
(isn't it ironic?) God is portrayed by singer Alanis Morrisette.
</P>
<P>
   Depictions of the Last Days aren't exactly new on the big
screen. Damien, that not-so-adorable little boy with the three 6s
imbedded in his scalp, went through four supernatural adventures,
starting with ``The Omen'' (1975) and ending with ``Omen 4: The
Awakening'' (1991), which followed Damien's godless daughter,
Delia.
</P>
<P>
   Demi Moore, as an expectant mother, figured out that seemingly
random disasters added up to the fulfillment of biblical prophecy
in ``The Seventh Sign'' (1988) _ portents that spelled trouble for
her unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Lucifer, played by Al Pacino, fathered a son as part of a plot
to seize control of Earth in ``The Devil's Advocate'' (1997). This
time, however _ reflecting, perhaps, the growing bureaucratization
of our society _ Old Scratch and his boy (Keanu Reeves) both turn
out to be lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However, the close of the second millennium since the birth of
Christ seems to have sparked a religious frenzy, similar to the one
that supposedly greeted the end of the first millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Don Habibi, an associate professor of philosophy and religion
who co-teaches film courses at the University of North Carolina at
Wilmington, sees something of a ``copycat mentality'' at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial filmmaking industry is a business. Studios
compete with each other, and I guess they could see this coming,''
he said. ``I suppose they're trying to cash in on the public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Public interest has been whetted, further, by the evangelical
Protestant revival of recent years, and by the Doomsday writings of
several of its most popular prophets and preachers.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Lindsey has proclaimed The End in a long string of books,
including ``The Late, Great Planet Earth.'' Author John Hogue has
linked the New Testament book of Revelation and the predictions of
Nostradamus in ``The Woman in Red'' and other books. Tim LaHaye and
his co-authors have dramatized the Last Days, according to at least
one Christian interpretation, in the ``Left Behind'' series novels,
noted Harry Tuchmayer, associate director of the New Hanover
County, N.C., Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has filmed the end of the world many times before.
Most of the time, however, the planet was done in by natural forces
or human folly, rather than divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fail Safe'' (1964), ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964) and ``The
Bedford Incident'' (1965) depicted nuclear wars sparked, or nearly
sparked, by stray accidents in an atmosphere of Cold War tension,
noted Leslie Hallowell in his Filmgoers' Companion.
</P>
<P>
   Plague nearly wiped out the survivors of a second world war in
the movie version of H.G. Wells' ``Things to Come'' (1936).
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Beach'' (1959), with Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Fred
Astaire, was perhaps the best-known depiction of a doomed,
post-nuclear world.
</P>
<P>
   All of the world's plants die off, apparently as a result of
human blunders, in ``No Blade of Grass'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   In Terry Gilliam's black comedy ``12 Monkeys'' (1995), based on
a French film ``La Jetee,'' a maniac releases a genetically
manipulated virus, killing off 99 percent of humanity and leaving
the rest stuck in hellish underground bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of collision with another planet or asteroid was
treated as early as the 1830s in Edgar Allan Poe's story ``The
Conversation of Eiros and Charmion.'' George Pal's ``When Worlds
Collide'' (1951), based on the Philip Wylie best seller, destroyed
the world, but gave people time to escape, via rocket ship, to a
nearby, hospitable planet.
</P>
<P>
   The End was narrowly avoided twice in the summer of 1998, thanks
to the heroic astronauts depicted in ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the latest spate of millennium movies prove to be prophecy
or puffery?
</P>
<P>
   As Yuri Rubinsky and Ian Wiseman point out in their History of
the End of the World, all predictions so far have proved wrong, or
at least premature. Christians skeptical of millennial schedules
quote Acts I, verse 7, in which Jesus tells his disciples: ``It is
not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Lord hath
put in his own power.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Habibi noted, the notion of the millennium is peculiar
to Christianity. It may be the close of the 20th century for
Christians, but it' the middle of the 15th century for devout
Muslims and the 58th century on the Jewish calendar.

   ATLANTA _ Web-retailer Amazon.com said that last Tuesday it
attracted more customers than on its best sales day of the 1998
Christmas shopping season, which came in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   The average gift order at has also increased _ to about $34
compared with about $29 during November and December of last year _
Amazon.com's marketing vice president Jaleh Bisharat said in a
conference call with reporters Tuesday. Amazon did not disclose
specific total sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top online retailer also released the results of an
online shopping poll conducted with Harris Interactive Polling.
According to Harris Interactive, online shopping is expectied to
generate $8 billion in revenues for online merchants this holiday
season, more than double last year's total online spending of $2.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive project director Julia Resnick the survey
showed that online users in 1999 are three times as likely to make
a purchase online this year than they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said 72 million Internet users will be using the
Internet to shop, browse, look for information of make a purchase
</P>
<P>
   Of those planning to buy, 19 percent said they have never made
an online purchase before.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant findings was that the number of
women shopping online has nearly tripled in the past year.
``Internet shopping is becoming the mainstream _ we're seeing
soccer moms and grannies get online,'' Bisharat said. She added
that the huge numbers of women making first-time purchases online
would impact how Web retailers design sites. ``They have to make
things more familiar and comfortable and offer services like gift
wrapping and customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harris Interactive data brought good news for Amazon.com.
Forty-six percent of users said they planned to make a purchase
from Amazon.com during the 1999 holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites Web shoppers said they were likely to purchase gifts
from included Barnes &AMP; Noble, Yahoo!, eToys, eBay and CDnow.
</P>
<P>
   The survey randomly selected 2, 628 people from its interactive
panel of 4.2 million Internet users between Nov. 2 and Nov. 5.

MANNESMANN MOVES TO THWART HOSTILE BID FROM VODAFONE AIRTOUCH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Hong Kong)   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Mannesmann stepped up its defense against
Vodafone AirTouch Tuesday, accelerating a plan to spin off its
older industrial holdings and securing the support of its biggest
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Neither move is enough in itself to thwart Vodafone's $127.7
billion hostile bid for the German company, but investors appeared
to be increasingly skeptical about Vodafone's chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's stock, which had soared to 207 euros just before
Vodafone announced its bid, slipped for the third consecutive
session Tuesday, closing at 181.5 euros, or $186.95, down 3.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Vodafone's shares have declined steadily as well,
from about 282 pence, or about $4.57, on Friday to 270 pence
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts said they believed that the widening gap between
Mannesmann's share price and Vodafone's offer is a clear expression
of investor doubt that the deal will actually occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see only a small probability that Vodafone will be
successful,'' said Herman Reith, an analyst at BHF Bank in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Even investors who are prepared to accept the Vodafone offer are
far from confident. ``I would rate its chances of success at about
51 percent,'' said Florian Langner, an analyst at B. Metzler &AMP;
Sohn, a private bank in Frankfurt that plans to sell its shares to
Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone still has plenty of time to woo investors. Its offer
will probably remain open until some time in January.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, bluntly reiterated his
refusal to sweeten his bid. ``It is a fair price for both sides and
definitely our final offer,'' said Gent in an interview published
today in the German newspaper Die Welt.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's biggest lift Tuesday came from a pledge of support
by Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong company that had agreed to sell
Mannesmann its controlling stake in the British mobile telephone
company, Orange PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Once that deal is approved by European regulators, Hutchison
Whampoa will hold 10.1 percent of Mannesmann's stock and be its
biggest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison's support could help Mannesmann's chief executive,
Klaus Esser, muster the shareholder votes needed to block a hostile
takeover. Under German law, a takeover cannot take place without
the support of investors holding at least 25 percent of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Hutchison's managing director, Canning
Fok, said he supported Mannesmann's decision to reject Vodafone's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of Orange and Mannesmann is, in my opinion,
very powerful and offers the best opportunity for Hutchison's
shareholders,'' Fok said.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, which had been widely expected, Mannesmann said
it would spin off its automotive and engineering businesses six
months earlier than originally planned. The move will allow
Mannesmann to raise extra cash, through an initial public offering
in the spin-off company. It will also mark the final step in its
own metamorphosis from old-line industrial manufacturer to a pure
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle, which will crown either Mannesmann or Vodafone
as Europe's dominant mobile communications company, is far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   Gent's goal is simply to win more than 50 percent of
Mannesmann's shares, enough to let him replace the top management.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the astronomical size of his bid, many analysts are
convinced Vodafone has solid strategic arguments on its side. They
argue that the two companies would create an extraordinary
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion and politics could play an important role. German
political leaders and labor unions continued to denounce Vodafone's
hostile bid as a destructive move against one of Germany's most
successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not acceptable that a slower company takes the faster
one out of competition,'' said Wolfgang Clement, premier of North
Rhine Westphalia, at a rally Tuesday by Mannesmann workers in
Dusseldorf who carried signs reading ``Never Vodafone'' and
``Sharks can overeat too.''
</P>
<P>
   Though German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has also weighed in
against Vodafone's bid, his government does not yet seem ready to
intervene _ a move that could make life difficult for German
companies trying to buy up foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts said they doubted that the German government would
block Vodafone. But the political outcry could strike a responsive
chord with individual German investors, who own about 30 percent of
Mannesmann shares.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a hostile takeover runs counter to Germany's vaunted
tradition of ``consensus'' between business and labor. Given that
tradition, as well as the extraordinary success of Mannesmann stock
in the last few years, many investors are likely to be responsive
to attacks on Vodafone and its strategy.

TABLES ARE WAITING ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A high-stakes movement is taking shape in the New
York restaurant world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six weeks, three instant online reservation services
have opened for business. About 20 others are in various stages of
gestation, and many observers, including Tim Zagat, are watching
the battle with great interest, because whoever wins in New York is
well positioned to dominate national online restaurant
reservations, a business that some industry analysts estimate to be
worth as much as $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Making reservations online potentially has many advantages for
the diner, like an end to the frustration of either being put on
permanent hold or confronted with an endless busy signal, and the
ability to make a reservation at any time, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the services promise, all a client will have to do
is log onto the site, select a restaurant and a time, and reserve
with a few clicks of the mouse. Reservations are free, but often
the restaurant pays a fee to be on the site.
</P>
<P>
   But ``eventually'' hasn't quite arrived. Last weekend, I
attempted to make reservations using the three instant-reservation
sites that are up and running and cover New York: Foodline.com,
OpenTable.com and Restaurantrow.com. Only a handful of restaurants
have signed on so far, and there are glitches in each of the three
systems. Sometimes it was quicker _ and more reliable _ to pick up
the telephone and call a restaurant directly. Although in one case,
I was able to secure a reservation that I could not by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The instant-reservation sites are the next step in the evolving
business of reserving online. Since 1997, sites like
Savvydiner.com, a national restaurant reservation site, have simply
acted as middlemen between the diner and the restaurant _ you
request a reservation on the Web site, and they make the call. A
confirmation could take an hour or more. Over the last few months,
a number of restaurants, including Tavern on the Green and the
Russian Tea Room, both owned by Warner LeRoy, have started taking
reservations over the Internet on their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But the new sites are different: they want to work the way
Moviefone.com does, with a large selection of establishments and
immediate confirmation. Reservation requests are sent
electronically to an electronic ``book'' at the restaurant; if
there is an opening, the customer gets an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large selection'' is key. For any service to succeed, it will
need a vast number of restaurants in its New York database alone.
The city has 20,000 restaurants, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat, the restaurant guide publisher, is eyeing the
reservations business with more than casual interest. He believes
that both diners and restaurants will want to deal with only one
Web site, which makes the online business a ``natural monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many may wade into the fray, but only one will emerge,'' said
Zagat, who is exploring links with these sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, Foodline had only 24 ``coming soon'' restaurants
and four available on its Web site. OpenTable had 16 ``coming
soon,'' one ``back soon'' and one available. Restaurantrow had
seven available. Others in development include RSVIP.com,
Dinel23.com, Reservemytable.com and Reserveatable.com.
</P>
<P>
   The potential is clearly there. In August, 480 guests booked
online for Tavern on the Green, said Karen Bailey, a spokeswoman.
By October, the number had grown to 1,114.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, restaurants are not flocking to sign up. One reason
is the cost. OpenTable charges each restaurant it serves between
$500 to $1,000 for installation and customization of the computer
hardware, plus $100 to $200 a month for the Internet connection
(depending on the size of the venue), plus $1 a reservation.
Foodline charges $200 for its Internet connection, plus $1 a head.
Restaurantrow does not charge restaurants, but it has limited
access to tables and intends to build other business partnerships
with the data it acquires through the service.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Zagat met with the representatives of 100 or so New
York restaurants to talk about the opportunities and pitfalls of
online reservations. He warned that some systems that offered
services free in the beginning might not be free in two or three
years. Most of all, he said, any system should protect customer
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites could use a restaurant's database of addresses,
phone numbers, dining frequency and other proprietary information.
Derickson Lawrence, the group president of Restaurantrow, based in
Rye, N.Y., acknowledged that ownership of this information might be
a bone of contention in the future. He said the information might
be shared in the future with, say, a theater near a restaurant that
is trying to draw in moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, many restaurant owners are waiting to
see which company and which system will win out.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Baker, an owner of Chez Josephine in midtown
Manhattan, said he would not accept online reservations, because
``it takes away from the personal touch.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coraine, the director of operations for the Union Square
Hospitality Group, which runs four restaurants in Manhattan _
Tabla, Eleven Madison Park, Gramercy Tavern and the Union Square
Cafe _ said: ``What we sell is hospitality and graciousness. There
is no substitute for a kind, human voice on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hanson, the president of B.R. Guest Inc., which owns
seven restaurants, including Blue Water Grill, Ocean Grill and Park
Avalon, said that so far, none of the services appear to be the
front runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these companies are about the same ability,'' he said.
``None has developed a system that works for the restaurateur. I
need an automatic wait list, so that I can call a person
immediately if I should get a cancellation. I need something that
will drive people into my seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, when I logged onto OpenTable, based in San
Francisco, I found one New York restaurant available: Lola in
Chelsea. The seven at Restaurantrow, based in Seattle, were the
Four Seasons, Jean Georges, La Cote Basque, Moomba, La Grenouille,
the ``21'' Club and Trata.
</P>
<P>
   I used Foodline, a New York City company with four restaurants
on its site: Calle Ocho, the Globe, Onieal's Grand Street and Rain.
I picked Rain, the one on Third Avenue, which was described as an
affordable Pan-Asian restaurant with quiet wood booths. I was
intrigued to read that I would be surrounded by people in ``casual
chic.'' But mainly I chose it because it was the only mid-price
restaurant on the Upper East Side where I could get a table online.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. After registering _ with my name, address,
phone and credit card numbers, information required on all the
sites _ I requested a table for two at 5:30 that night. But the
server kept giving me earlier times, like 4 p.m., and later times,
like 6 and 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   I found it hard to believe that there were no 5:30 tables open,
and so I kept trying, off and on, for an hour. Finally, I picked up
the phone and called the restaurant. A woman with a cheery voice
answered and immediately put me on hold. When she returned a minute
later, she took my reservation request _ 5:30 p.m. Saturday _ and
it was done. Elapsed time: 2 minutes 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lightfoot, the president and chief executive of Foodline,
attributed the glitch to newness, since the restaurant had been
online for only a week. He said Foodline, which just sold a
percentage of its business to Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch for $5
million, hopes to have 600 New York restaurants online within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I gave OpenTable a try. The site is very spare compared
with Foodline's, which is buzzing with information: links to a wine
column, a recipe column, local food events, a spirits column. Here,
I just clicked and a map of the United States appeared with eight
cities highlighted on it. I clicked on New York and there was one
restaurant listed: Lola. Still, I proceeded by clicking to find out
about its hours, location, executive chef, and a description (``an
elegantly casual restaurant featuring American cuisine''). If you
like what you see, you click ``reserve now,'' and type in the day,
time and number of people in your party. If your time is available,
you click to make your reservation. If it is not, the times nearest
the one you requested are given. I clicked on my time: that evening
at 7:30. The reservation was confirmed through e-mail. I then made
a phone reservation, which took the same amount of time, about two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I tried to scale the Himalayas of the restaurant world
by making a reservation at an exclusive place. Restaurantrow was my
sherpa. I clicked on its home page and clicked ``Top Table,'' the
instant reservation link, and then clicked on Moomba. My first
three times were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Foodline and OpenTable, which can conceivably book all
seats in a restaurant, Restaurantrow is allotted a certain number
of tables at the restaurants it handles, usually four or five a
week, said Lawrence, the company's group president. As a result,
you might call a restaurant and be told there are no available
tables, then go online and secure a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   But even online, Moomba lived up to its reputation. It was fully
booked. I clicked on ``time'' and found a line of other restaurants
in the system with available tables: Jean Georges for two, four and
six at 5:30, 6 and 10:30 p.m. With information on the screen, I
called the restaurant at 3, asked if a table for two was open at
5:30 and was told it was booked. I went back online and made a
reservation for two at 5:30 p.m. One of the allocated tables was
still available.
</P>
<P>
   Once you reserve through Restaurantrow, you are subject to a $25
penalty if you do not give at least 24 hours' notice that you are
not showing up. When I was making reservations, there was no way to
cancel online, but they have since added a feature that allows you
to cancel by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Both OpenTable and Foodline have buttons on their sites for
cancellations, and e-mail confirmations are given. OpenTable asks
customers to cancel at least 30 minutes in advance on the day of
the reservation. The Foodline cancellation policy says a $20
penalty will be imposed for not showing up or not canceling, but it
does not say when you must notify them to avoid the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Tavern on the Green and the Russian Tea Room also charge a
$25-a-person no-show fee, but only for patrons who reserve online,
not by phone.

RV TRAVELERS CAN SLEEP AT THE MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON HALL   
 Herald-Journal, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUNTA GORDA, Fla. _ Two self-proclaimed ``old curmudgeons'' here
have created a concept they think will change the way America's
retired RVers travel.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lukasik and Orren Hall's message: Don't just shop at the
mall, sleep at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The two men _ Lukasik is 70, Hall is 75 _ are running the RV
Overnighters Association, a for-profit operation that hooks up its
members, recreational vehicle owners, with malls, hotels and
casinos that invite those same travelers to spend the night in a
parking lot for $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is married two fashions,'' said Hall, the
company's spokesman. ``The fashion of traveling, and the fashion of
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the RV Overnighters Association works:
</P>
<P>
   For $29.95 a year, RV owners can join up and get a copy of a
handbook listing the group's participating malls, hotels and a
smattering of other locations. About 40 malls and 56 hotels and
casinos in 34 states now participate.
</P>
<P>
   RVers call the group's toll-free number while traveling, and
make a reservation to stay at one of the spots for $5, $3 of which
goes to the hosting mall. The association faxes the mall or hotel
management the reservation, and when the RV owners arrive, they
check in with management and are welcomed with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   After spending one night, the RV owners leave. No multi-night
stays are allowed, and there are no hook-ups. Only owners with
self-contained units are allowed to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to compete with the campgrounds,'' Hall said.
``In fact, we're inviting the campgrounds to join with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most campgrounds charge $15 to $50 a night to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's times when we just want to pull off and get some
sleep,'' said Judy Radle, an association member from Westfield,
Mass. ``That's where the Overnighters Association has come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Radle and her husband, Clem, have been RV travelers since 1980,
logging many hours on the road and in campgrounds. They used the
service on a recent trip to Kansas, stopping in a mall in
Warrenton, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called and made the reservation, and about an hour later we
were there,'' she said. ``We checked in, and they were so nice to
us. They gave us discounts to do some shopping at the shopping
center, which we did for a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukasik and Hall have traveled to conventions all over the
country for a year and a half, urging malls to participate in the
program. They plan to be in all 48 continental states by the end of
the year, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   They began taking members in October. Hall wouldn't give out
specific numbers, but said they are approaching 1,000 members and
have a goal of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Considering there are about 9 million RV owners in the United
States, the market is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this idea that we want to make this our national
last hurrah,'' Hall said, joking about his and Lukasik's ages.
``Here's two seniors, helping other seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   The two got the hotels on board by joining with the Association
of Senior Gamblers. Now, by joining one association members get the
benefits of both, and RV Overnighters has added such addresses as
the Trump Tower in Atlantic City, N.J., to its list of
participating sites.
</P>
<P>
   There are places RV travelers can park for free, primarily
interstate rest areas and truck stops. But Radle doesn't like
either of those options, mainly because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Parking in a mall lot that is patrolled by mall security or
local police, makes them feel safe, Radle said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukasik and Hall said RV Overnighters Association, on the Web at
www.rv-overnighters.com, is set up to make money, but that hasn't
happened yet. They hope that as more memberships come, they'll be
able to recoup the money they've sunk into the venture.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that depends on adding sites and expanding into
different areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxiously awaiting them getting more malls and places to
park, close to the highway,'' Radle said. ``If they can do that,
they'll be one rip-roaring success, I'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>

is a member of The New York Times Regional Newspaper Group. This

<P>
   What started as a trickle of mail-order food sources on the
Internet last year has turned into a torrent, making it difficult
to sort out the delicious from the dreary.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, instead of just thumbing through catalogs and
magazines and taking suggestions from friends, colleagues and
perfect strangers, I have also prowled the Web to seek out the best
food gifts for the holidays. With few exceptions, I did not find
much that is newer or better than I would have by my old methods,
but my searching and test-shopping could save you time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 24 mail-order sources listed below have their own
Web sites, but not all of them are interactive. Some simply provide
a little information and direct the shopper to order by e-mail,
phone or fax.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique food business is still largely small-time, and some
of the one-person operations have only recently stuck a foot into
the chancy waters of the cyberworld.
</P>
<P>
   And when they do, they are not always better than good old
catalogs. Some sites take so long to navigate that you could drive
to the store and be back with your purchases before you've found
what you want online. Often the quality of the photos is poor.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering online, be careful when giving credit-card
information. You know you are in a secure area when the URL box in
your browser reads ``https'' instead of ``http.''
</P>
<P>
   And be sure to get a confirmation on your order, either on the
Web site itself or by e-mail. In some of my dealings, companies
said they never received the order. And I never received the food.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites are all still too primitive to deal with custom
orders. If they offer a gift basket with five items and you want
five different items, you will still have to phone the company or
e-mail it to see if something special can be created just for you.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sites, like ChefShop.com, which has unusual and
excellent food, do not even have a place where the buyer can
provide special instructions for delivery, like ``leave at front
door without signature.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is not easy to find what you want. Grace's
Marketplace is located at fultonstreet.com, and to find Grace's you
have to click on three different places. What's more, a panettone
ordered directly from Grace's is much less expensive than the same
panettone ordered on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At one Web site, I kept checking a quicker _ and more expensive
_ form of delivery, but to no avail. I finally had to call the
company, making double work.
</P>
<P>
   If you want something delivered by a certain date, always phone.
If a Web site has no warehouse, the order goes to a middleman,
adding time to delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In shopping, I found that no single system worked all the time
or was as fast as the phone. Until there is someone at the other
end who can instantly answer questions, the Internet will never be
better. On the other hand, if you like to order at 3 a.m., the Web
is the perfect medium.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my choices of food gifts for the holidays. Unless
otherwise noted, orders can be placed on the Web site, and shipping
is extra. The last date orders are accepted for Christmas delivery
is included.
</P>
<P>
   The oatmeal cookies from the BELLOWS HOUSE BAKERY are so buttery
and packed with plump raisins they could pass for homemade.
Two-plus pounds, $30.90, including shipping.

 By CARL YANKOWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm basically trained as a techie. I left MIT as an electrical
engineer and the Sloane School with a systems background. Coming to
Reebok was going from electronics and high-tech digital convergence
to footwear and apparel. But I've always been a gadget guy, and
I've managed to find technology in any business I've been in.
</P>
<P>
   I saw an industry that hadn't changed the way it measured feet
or the way it had manufactured shoes for roughly 100 years. There
was a strong technology platform at this company; we could use
laser devices, holograms and the Internet to measure, fit, design
and custom manufacture personalized products in the future. There
was an opportunity for change as drastic as going from analog to
digital.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major impetuses behind the move was to come back
home, because my home was in Boston. I was commuting back and forth
to New Jersey and for seven years I only saw my wife on weekends. I
said it was time to start bringing my home life and business life
together geographically.
</P>
<P>
   I kept thinking about large, consumer-oriented businesses in
Boston. I called in off the street to talk to Reebok's chairman and
chief executive, Paul Fireman. Reebok, among others, had offered me
a job 11 years before as head of sales and marketing. Paul wasn't
in, but his secretary said, ``OK I'll take your resume.''
</P>
<P>
   What I found out later was that the secretary called her
girlfriend who worked at the local Sony sales office and asked if
she had heard of me. She said yes, he's a good guy, and the
secretary said OK, I'll forward his resume to Human Resources. If
it hadn't been for that one salesperson in the local office, I
would have wound up in the wastebasket.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice I ever got was from John Sculley, who was
president of Pepsi when I did the marketing there. John would tell
me that he was an idea guy, that he would have 10 great ideas a
week: One would be absolute genius, one would be absolute garbage,
and the other eight would be somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, he said, it wasn't easy to tell which were
which.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I always ask for thoughtful, intelligent opinions on
my ideas. It's probably true that everything I think isn't great,
so I have people make sure I don't go with the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Yankowski, now chief executive of Reebok International,
made a cold call at the shoe company last year when he was the
50-year-old chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven days a week, for 9 or 10 hours each day, Merritt W.
Huntington is on the job, negotiating deals and supervising a small
staff. But he is no striving young investment banker or
20-something consultant on the make. He is a 73-year-old orchid
grower.
</P>
<P>
   Why does he keep at it? ``It's a passion, I guess,'' said
Huntington, owner of Kensington Orchids in Kensington, Md., one of
the biggest orchid producers in the mid-Atlantic states. But
something else prompts him to shake off his periodic reveries about
living a life of ease: the belief that hard work will prolong his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is not for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw too many people my age who lived another six months or
two years and then they were gone,'' he said. So he is staying put,
helped by his wife, Helen, 71, the company's bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, you hear the stories: People who keep working
live longer. Sociologists who study the phenomenon say it is a
little more complicated than that. To some extent, they say, old
people who are healthy keep working because they enjoy working.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they add, it is beyond dispute that active use of both
one's mental and physical capacities promotes longevity. Inactivity
can be hazardous to health. You're more likely to use your mind and
your muscle in an office or a factory than in a hammock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job conditions offering a challenge and the opportunity to do
self-directed, substantively complex work increase intellectual
flexibility,'' a study at the National Institute of Mental Health
concluded. The effect, in fact, is ``significantly greater'' for
older workers than younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   It helps if people like what they are doing. Take Jean Sharp,
who will turn 80 on Sunday and who sews seams in hosiery and
leotards at Alsace Textile in Reading, Pa. She sees her work as a
vital social connection as well as a source of money to pay off her
mortgage, which has three years to go. She said she could not
imagine what it would be like to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like family,'' said Mrs. Sharp, a widow whose son died at
the age of 48. ``We girls get along good. I think that's what keeps
me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sharp is especially pleased that she is allowed to set her
own hours, which average about 30 a week. ``When I get there, I get
there,'' she said, ``and when I feel like leaving, I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Such control over working conditions enhances job satisfaction
and thus promotes health, social scientists say. It is probably for
that reason, they add, that a study of British civil servants in
the early 1990s found that those in higher-status positions with
more control over their daily routines were healthier than those in
low-status jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher you are, the better your health and the longer you
live, even controlling for initial health-risk factors,'' said Dr.
Richard M. Suzman, an associate director of the National Institute
on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Russell S. Bickel, 88, puts in more than 40 hours a week as a
stockbroker for Prudential Securities in Wyomissing, Pa. Work for
him these days is a comfortable routine in a business he has been
part of since he dropped out of high school in 1928 and that gives
structure to his life.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought on occasion about retirement but decided he would
be doing much the same thing at home _ ``fooling around with
investments'' _ and that as long as he felt good and had enough
customers, most of them with long-term horizons, he would just stay
on.
</P>
<P>
   But he says old people should either love their jobs or leave
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can imagine myself in certain types of monotonous or
repetitious jobs that I would be itching to get out of,'' he said.
``I'd have my hand on the doorknob.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the vast majority of Americans retire as soon as
they can. The proportion of American men still working at 65
plummeted to 30.5 percent in 1985 from 71.7 percent in 1950, though
it has since edged up to 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are still toiling away recognize that at some
point they will probably have to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told my bride that if she sees me slipping my marbles to
not let me come to the office anymore,'' Bickel said. ``I don't
want to be the judge of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is the cause and effect question: Do people stay
healthy because they keep working, or do they keep working because
they are staying healthy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real problems of causation here,'' said Joseph F.
Quinn, a dean and economics professor at Boston College with long
experience in the field. ``It's really important not to generalize
about what's good or not good for your health.''
</P>
<P>
   Conclusive proof that work benefits health is very hard to find,
because it is mostly people who are already in good health who
choose to keep on working.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical analysis has not solved the riddle, either.
Specialists note, for example, that women who have never been in
the labor force outlive men by the same margin as those who have
worked for decades.
</P>
<P>
   If older workers need a role model, it might well be Mary W.
Walker, 85, a trust department administrator at First Union Bank in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walker was forced to retire at the age of 70, before
Congress passed a law restricting such involuntary departures. So
she signed up with Manpower Inc., a ``temporary'' employment
agency, and has remained at the bank but on the Manpower Inc.
payroll without changing jobs ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In spring and summer, she loves to cap her day by walking seven
miles from the First Union office in downtown Philadelphia to her
home in the suburbs. Because of an injury in a fall, she may have
to forgo those strolls next year, but she will keep the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love office work,'' Ms. Walker said. ``My doctor told me,
`Keep on working.'''

THOUGH STILL THRONELESS, BULGARIA'S EX-KING HAS REGAINED SOME
PRESTIGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIDIN, Bulgaria _ The former king of Bulgaria had prepared his
speech and put his passport into his pocket. He was anxious not to
give offense _ and so it was all the more painful to Simeon II that
on a recent visit to the land of his birth he was more than five
hours late.
</P>
<P>
   The riverboat Danube Star had been delayed by locks and shallows
and downstream in Vidin, thousands of people _ folk dancers,
musicians, local dignitaries and ordinary people _ were waiting at
the docks in the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so embarrassed, I'm mortified,'' said the former king,
pacing pacing the deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be saying, `Look at that Simeon, he can't even be
on time.' They'll be insulting me and my ancestors, even though my
ancestors have nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Simeon Borisov Saxe-Coburgotski, as his new passport from the
Republic of Bulgaria identifies him, was proclaimed king in 1943 at
age 6 on the death of his father. Three years later, the Communists
took power and chased out the Saxe-Coburg dynasty. From that time,
Simeon II lived in exile, eventually settling in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, he was little more than a historical
footnote, sometimes maligned, largely forgotten. But since
Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov was ousted in 1989, Simeon has
once again become part of his nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria of three years ago, when he first returned and half
a million people appeared on the streets of Sofia, has subsided.
Some of his friends believe that he should have seized the moment
and presented himself as the ideal person to guide Bulgaria's
difficult transition toward democracy. But Simeon used that
occasion to call for national unity and the moment passed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with economic and political reforms coming slowly and
painfully to this country of almost 9 million people, the question
of restoring the monarchy is very low on the agenda. These days,
Bulgarians seem to prefer Simeon as a virtual king.
</P>
<P>
   He has returned five times and, wherever he goes, people
surround him, lobby him, wish him well and load him with gifts and
bundles of petitions, asking him to intervene or redress an
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   This time was no different. As the riverboat finally docked in
Vidin, it was nightfall and television lights caught him as he came
ashore, accompanied by Bartholomew, the patriarch of the Eastern
Orthodox Church. People gave him flowers and pressed notes in his
hands. They offered more blessings to him than to the Patriarch. A
flock of journalists who had traveled three hours from the capital
wanted the former king's views on a stream of domestic and foreign
questions. Simeon replied at length and kept apologizing for being
late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is looking for his niche in the market,'' said Albena
Arnaudova, the editor of Zdrave, a women's magazine. ''He's still
exotic to many of us, but a very nice man, very thoughtful. Being
an aristocrat hasn't ruined him.''
</P>
<P>
   The exiled king, now 62, has an unwaveringly courteous and
self-effacing manner. ``I don't take all this interest
personally,'' he said after the visit to Vidin. ``But I'm glad I'm
so well-received. I suppose it means people don't see me as a
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems motivated more by a sense of duty than by ambition for
power, although he has not given up hope of restoring the monarchy.
But that would require a referendum and Simeon believes the timing
would not be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot expect my fellow countrymen to go into the
metaphysics of what type of head of state they should have, when
they don't know how to get to the end of the month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, how does he see his role? ``It's like being a moderator or a
father confessor,'' he said in a conversation in his cabin. ``It's
almost a job, a lifetime thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say that even in Madrid, where he serves on corporate
boards and lives with his Spanish wife and their five children,
supplicants visit him constantly to discuss personal or political
issues. Among them are royalists whom he has dissuaded from forming
a monarchist party.
</P>
<P>
   ``A monarchist party is nonsense,'' he said, speaking English,
one of his half-dozen languages. ``I try to explain that a monarchy
is a symbol, not a political party.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, some politicians and intellectuals have pressed
Simeon to offer himself as a candidate for the next presidential
election, in 2002. In Bulgaria, a parliamentary democracy, the
presidency is largely ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that would be a first,'' he said with a grin,
savoring the contradictory image of a king running for office. He
added, his impish grin deepening, ``I told one group, your plan has
some sense because after four years you can get rid of me and you
won't get stuck with my sons or grandsons, in case one is a
nincompoop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some anti-royalists concede that Simeon functions as a
useful advocate for Bulgaria because he encourages foreign
investors, lobbies for Bulgarian membership in the European Union
and has friends in high places _ like King Juan Carlos of Spain,
Queen Elizabeth and various European leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the state has returned his family's private estates and
homes, Simeon says he intends to donate most of the forest and park
land to the nation, but wants to ensure their protection. Parts
were planted by his grandfather, who was a botanist and
ornithologist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The former king sees himself as an environmentalist, a cause he
recommends to young Bulgarians because ''it provides them with
ideals and links them to the rest of the world.'' On this riverboat
journey, he was taking part in a symposium dealing with pollution,
war damage and other abuse of the Danube, organized by the Eastern
Orthodox patriarchate.
</P>
<P>
   It was well past 3 a.m. when the Danube Star reached Lom,
another Bulgarian city downstream, where municipal elections had
just been held. A sympathizer of Simeon had won. As soon as word
spread that Simeon had docked, the new mayor and his party of
celebrators arrived at the ship. The former king was in his cabin,
exhausted from a long day. But no one would leave until Simeon
dressed and went ashore again.

GERMAN BISHOPS AGREE TO END PRACTICE THAT AIDED ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany's Roman Catholic bishops on Tuesday bowed to
Pope John Paul II's demands that they stop issuing certificates
that open the way for women to have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Under German law, a woman may have a legal abortion during the
first 12 weeks of pregnancy provided she can present proof that she
has first attended a counseling center, many of which are run by
the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   German bishops have maintained that the centers provide an
important service that often leads women to reconsider planned
abortions, but they announced Tuesday that the issuing of
certificates would be ended ``in the course of the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, made by a majority vote at a two-day meeting of
representatives of the German Bishops Conference in the southern
city of Wuerzburg, came after the pope indicated his patience was
running out. A total of 27 bishops took part in the Wuerzburg
meeting; three voted against accepting the pope's will.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to a group of German bishops at the Vatican on
Saturday, the pope said: ``I hope that this significant activity of
the church in your country will soon be put back in order
definitively according to my directive. In the defense of life, it
is essential that bishops of the entire church speak unanimously
and with one voice.''
</P>
<P>
   German bishops defended their position in a letter to the
Vatican last month that expressed ``persistent misgivings'' over
the demands from the pope. But Archbishop Johannes Dyba of the
central German city of Fulda said Tuesday, ``This is a right step
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier reluctance of the bishops reflected the often
independent positions of German Catholics, some of whom are unhappy
about the pope's strong opposition to birth control and insistence
on the celibacy of priests.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that with the unusually strong terms of the pope's
admonition Saturday, most German bishops felt they had no choice
but to accept his teaching. Of the 1,690 counseling centers in the
country, 270 are run by the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Bocklet of Bonn said the bishops were ``bitterly
disappointed'' that they had been unable to persuade the pope to
change his mind during their weekend visit to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a year to consider how the church can continue to
advise without handing out certificates,'' Bocklet said. ``It is
possible that the counseling could be placed in the hands of lay
Catholic organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter this week to the German Bishops Conference, the pope
said that he hoped the counseling centers could be used ``for the
good of life.'' It therefore appears that the church may retain a
counseling role with pregnant women, but on the condition that
certificates approving abortions not be handed out.

LYCOS BEEFS UP GAME, TRIVIA CONTENT WITH ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. said it will buy an on-line game company for $207
million in stock, a tidy return on the $15 million that has been
invested to date in Gamesville.com.
</P>
<P>
   Using the slogan ``Wasting your time since 1996,'' Gamesville
runs card games and trivia contests on the World Wide Web, on
topics such as football and rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Such offerings might seem lightweight, but they have enabled the
3-year-old Watertown, Mass. company to register 2.2 million users.
Now Lycos says Gamesville's services will help it boost visitor
totals in its ongoing competition with rivals like Yahoo Inc. and
America Online Inc. to consolidate users as a market for
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos chief executive Bob Davis said the personal data
Gamesville collects could also help Lycos tailor ads to users of
its other services, such as Wired News.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``adds depth to our marketing efforts,'' said Davis,
who noted the ``exceptional quality of registration information''
that Gamesville has recorded. For example, to sign up on
Gamesville, players are asked to report their education and marital
status and occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The dissemination of such material has drawn criticism from
privacy advocates, but it hasn't stopped other Internet companies
such as CMGI Inc. from acquiring technologies that offer ever-more
specific ways of tracking the surfing habits of individual users.
CMGI, of Andover, Mass., is also one of Lycos' largest owners.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of Lycos' latest agreement call for it to issue stock
worth $207 million, based on the value of shares on a date to be
determined. Shares in Lycos, of Waltham, Mass., rose 2 1/4 to close
at 58 1/4 Tuesday, suggesting the company would exchange about 3.6
million shares in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Gains will chiefly benefit lle's top officers, including
Steve Kane, who will stay on as general manager of gaming at Lycos,
and backers including Highland Capital Partners of Boston, Softbank
Capital Partners in Newton, Mass., and Flatiron Partners of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Kane declined to discuss how much of the company is
held by each Gamesville owner.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos will also assume responsibility for stock options worth up
to $25 million in its purchase of Gamesville, which has about 70
employees and annual revenue of about $25 million. Davis said
Gamesville is profitable but would not amplify on that.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition when completed will bring to 900 the number of
people employed by Lycos, which also has offices in California.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will mark the fourth major acquisition in 1999 for
Lycos, which began the year by completing its acquisition of
California-based Wired Ventures. In August it agreed to pay $39
million in stock for Internet Music Distribution Inc., a maker of
music software, and a month later Lycos said it planned to buy the
Quote.com financial information service for about $79 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   According to the MediaMetrix ranking service, Lycos most
recently was in fourth place with about 27.6 million users in
September, behind Yahoo but ahead of the Excite At Home group and
Amazon.com. Lycos also ranked fourth among sites used mainly for
searching the Internet.

SPORTS COLUMN: TIME FOR FASSEL TO GO FOR IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was early in the second quarter Sunday and Giants
safety Percy Ellsworth was returning an intercepted pass. His
teammate, the 305-pound tackle Keith Hamilton, peeled back, lining
up the Washington Redskins' Mike Sellers for a block delivered with
such force Sellers was soon airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing the Redskins by 7-0 in an already emotional game
between old rivals, the Giants' bench leapt to its feet, roused by
the turnover and especially the Hamilton hit.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of corporeal collision, controlled aggression in
a pivotal moment, that can turn a football game. As the Giants'
defense left the field, the sideline was alive with this energy,
animation just waiting to suffuse the beleaguered Giants offense.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in the center of the Giants sideline, with his
players literally bouncing off each other all around him, Giants
coach Jim Fassel stood alone, detached and unmoved, head down
examining his ever-present and voluminous chart of plays, a
laminated sheaf bigger than the newspaper you hold in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   The moment called out for a big strike, a go-for-the-jugular
pass downfield against a defense scrambling back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel, his eyes on his chart, not the scene around him,
plucked from the list before him a play as go-for-broke as a warmed
cup of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber ran off tackle for four yards. Two short pass
attempts followed, both incomplete, and the Giants had gained four
yards in three plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants settled for a field goal in a game they eventually
lost, 23-13.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that has been wrong with the Giants this season was
symbolized in this sequence. The tide of the game was shifting but
Fassel did not see it, his feel for the game lost in his chart. In
a situation that begged for daring, Fassel chose the comfort of his
play-it-safe schemes.
</P>
<P>
   System over spunk.
</P>
<P>
   It need not be a permanent flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Fassel handed the starting quarterback's job to the
hyperactive, strong-armed and fearless 26-year-old Kerry Collins,
whose approach to his job Collins once summed up this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times I stand back there and say: `I'm just throwing
this thing down the field right now.' Here, you catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking, while guaranteeing the ride will
occasionally be rocky, can also rescue the Giants' offense.
</P>
<P>
   But can Fassel change his spots? Will he cut loose his new
cannon? Can he see opportunity on the other side of his play chart?
</P>
<P>
   Because if he doesn't, these Giants won't make this year's
playoffs. Which means, conceivably, that this is Fassel's last
chance to prove he isn't the conservative offensive mind that three
consecutive low-scoring seasons have made him out to be.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Fassel has said he has held in the reins
because it's his best chance to win. He said this two weeks ago
when his team had a 5-3 record, even as it was suggested that this
close-to-the-vest formula for winning wouldn't work against the
National Football League's better offensive teams.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't. Now the 5-5 Giants are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one solution. And it's not on Fassel's chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's in his heart and it's on the field before him.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are not the most talented team in the NFL, but they
are good enough to qualify for, and even win a game, during next
month's diluted playoff party.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Giants, especially the offensive players, know
this. Alternatively beaten down or kept in a shell, the Giants
offense plays with a complete lack of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, a coach respected and liked by most of his players, has
six weeks to lead his offense out of its shell and to imbue the
huddle with self-assurance. He can do this by example.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative play-calling communicates a lack of trust to an
offense, but an unleashed attack led by Collins _ the most skilled
quarterback the Giants have had since Phil Simms _ would do just
the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   For Fassel, however, it will take the courage to scrap the
conventions of his style and coach intuitively. It will mean
handing his billboard of a play chart to someone else so that he
can see the game unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Giants don't need someone in charge, they need
someone to charge.
</P>
<P>
   The season is not lost. Jim Fassel has to find it in him to go
for it.

   TRAVEL-HOLIDAY (Los Angeles) -- Get ready for heavy traffic on

Millions more will travel in cars and buses. Amtrak is scheduling
more trains and making them longer for what normally is the busiest

   SHOP-HOLIDAY (Los Angeles) -- The consensus among retail
watchers in Southern California is that this will indeed by a happy
holiday season, for retailers at least. Industry experts say that
the combination of a strong local economy plus optimism about the

A FILMMAKER NOW KNOWN FOR TWO FAMILIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ky., Miss., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy's glowing face and great smile stand out in the
family photograph. Next to her is the matriarch, who has 13
children and grandchildren galore. Most live near her and all
return regularly en masse for holidays and other family gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   There are the young men, some of whom have had problems with
drinking, drugs or romance. The mentally retarded sister is not
there; she lives elsewhere. Not long ago, one of the sons was
arrested and jailed. The whole family united to support him but
couldn't come up with the $2,500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, it's the Bowling family of Mudlick Holow, Ky.,
the subject of Ms. Kennedy's documentary ``American Hollow,'' which
has its television premiere Monday night on HBO. If many things
about the Bowlings seem similar to the storied Irish-American clan
that Ms. Kennedy comes from _ and she acknowledges that she found
it easy to identify with them, despite the obvious differences _
that just reinforces her point about the value of documentary
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to access a culture that otherwise feels different
and feels `other,''' she says. ``Then you identify and you think,
`Wow,' I've been through those _ everybody I know has gone through
those _ exact same emotions, the exact same things. They're just
like you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bowlings go to church, do an Easter egg hunt for the
children, have a big family picnic on Labor Day and sometimes argue
at the dinner table. Edgar is on Prozac. Samantha's
soon-to-be-ex-husband abuses her.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Iree, 68, the great-grandmother, snaps beans
on a sofa on her front porch and kills chickens by hand. Her
husband, Bass, speaks with such a strong Southern accent that the
filmmakers have seen fit to subtitle some of his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowlings receive government assistance, but some make extra
money by collecting bloodroot and ginseng in the woods. One of
them, Neil, doesn't have much use for people who are too lazy to do
work like this. ``Now if you're too sorry to get out of the
house,'' he says, ``you ain't going to have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The family's joys and trials and their take on life have brought
a good deal of attention to Ms. Kennedy, although it's fair to say
that the Kennedy name is at least as much an attraction as the film
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Hollow,'' which is her first feature-length film, was
shown at the Sundance Film Festival last January, won top awards at
film festivals in Chicago and Los Angeles and had a two-week
theatrical release to make it eligible for Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
   All her life Ms. Kennedy has been known as the one who was born
after her father, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was killed (she'll be 31
next month). Since July she has been known as the one whose wedding
John F. Kennedy Jr. was on his way to when he, his wife and his
wife's sister died in the crash of his private plane. It is
understandable that Ms. Kennedy would now like to be known, maybe
more than ever, as the one who became a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   She arrives for lunch at one of HBO's private dining rooms
overlooking Bryant Park in Manhattan, wearing a plum-colored
sweater, a long black skirt (from Banana Republic) and a black
leather jacket. She chooses her words carefully, like a seasoned
professional, but her laugh is still slightly girlish.
</P>
<P>
   It's startling how much she looks like her father. Those are
Bobby Kennedy's eyes looking at you over a club sandwich and
sparkling water. Maybe this particular Kennedy can make a
difference; maybe she can accomplish as much making movies with a
social conscience as she would running for office like so many of
her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She won't go as far as to say that filmmakers might be more
powerful than politicians, but a recent experience must have made
her consider that possibility. She had made a 15-minute film about
AIDS in Africa and, after a Capitol Hill screening, she says, Sen.r
Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, turned to her and
whispered, ``I just want you to know that I put an extra $25
million in the budget for AIDS in Africa, and it's because of your
film.'' Telling the story, she laughs with obvious pride. ``It
feels like a good day's work, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Making movies wasn't a childhood dream as she grew up with her
mother, Ethel Kennedy, and a houseful of older siblings in McLean,
Va., and she never went to film school. At Brown University she
majored in women's studies. When she became aware that women were
being discriminated against in addiction treatment programs and
often being put in jail, she undertook a project to combat that.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if you could draw attention to this issue from the
women's perspective and let them tell their own stories that you
might sort of raise awareness and have some sort of impact,'' she
recalls. ``So I made a film, which was about that subject. And I
really enjoyed the process.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation she moved to New York, but she has also lived
briefly in Los Angeles and in Washington, where she met Mark
Bailey, then a graduate student at Georgetown University, through
mutual friends. Two weeks after her cousin John's death (something
she declines to discuss, politely, with ``I would rather not, I'm
sorry'') and the cancellation of her huge family wedding, she and
Bailey were married at a family friend's estate in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of October they moved, with their dog,
Clementine, to a new place in the West Village, a neighborhood they
love. Bailey, a writer, was the story editor on ``American Hollow''
and has written a book of the same title, an oral history of the
Bowling family.
</P>
<P>
   Newlywed or not, Ms. Kennedy spends long hours at her office on
the edge of SoHo and in various editing rooms. She has also been
traveling to Mississippi a lot lately, working on her next
documentary, which is about mental illness and how three
generations of one family have dealt with it.
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, still in touch with the Bowlings. After all,
she and her film crew lived with them during most of the making of
``American Hollow,'' a fact that has raised some eyebrows among
people who wonder how a pampered rich girl reacted to the modest
accommodations. Ms. Kennedy is tactful about it, mentioning the
beautiful quilts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a practical decision, she says. The nearest hotel was
more than an hour from Mudlick Hollow, which is almost a four-hour
drive from Lexington. It was important to film the children, who
often got up at 5:30 or 6 a.m. And besides, like any decent
Southern family, the Bowlings insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Being around early in the day paid off in several instances. One
was a particularly painful scene involving Clint, Iree's
18-year-old grandson, who telephones his fiancee, Shirley, on the
morning of their wedding, only to be told that she has changed her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The camera follows Clint as he hangs up the phone, goes outside
and, with fully understandable rage, tries to beat the wall of an
outbuilding senseless. In the best and worst documentary tradition,
the scene is fascinating and embarrassingly intrusive. But maybe
being a Kennedy and growing up with cameras constantly following
you, especially in times of sorrow, gives a filmmaker a different
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's probably some sensitivity to what that
means,'' says Ms. Kennedy. ``But, you know, I think that with
documentaries it's really important for the people that you're
filming to be open to it and to want to participate in the
process.'' Even if it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Kennedy's influences was Barbara Kopple, who made the
Oscar-winning documentary ``Harlan County U.S.A.,'' about Kentucky
mine workers. But her decision to go into filmmaking had many
facets. Anyone choosing a career should consider ``the impact it
has in terms of things that you believe in and how much you like
doing it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And how much does she enjoy making films? ``I love it,'' she
says, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Nevins, the senior vice president who runs HBO's
documentary division, says Ms. Kennedy has good reason to be proud
of her work. ``She has a capacity for being an innocent listener,
and it allows her films to have almost a childlike innocence,''
says Ms. Nevins, who watched ``American Hollow'' take shape,
screening early footage in her office. ``It had something
different, a serenity, and I didn't think it was particularly about
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that famous name and heritage, ultimately that
disappears, Ms. Nevins says. ``When she works with you 16 hours, at
11 o'clock at night, without air-conditioning, Rory's not a Kennedy
anymore,'' she says, clearly remembering a specific instance.
``When she gets rings under her eyes, she looks like any
30-year-old with rings under her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The political power of documentaries aside, says Ms. Nevins, the
narrative is what counts. ``She's a good storyteller,'' she says of
Ms. Kennedy. ``One day maybe she'll tell her own story.''

NEEDLE SHARING IN RUSSIA BLAMED FOR SHARP INCREASE IN HIV
INFECTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Needle sharing among intravenous drug users has set off
an explosive increase in HIV infections, with the number of new
cases reported in Moscow so far this year more than four times
greater than in all of 1998, the World Health Organization said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency's principal AIDS expert in Russia, Arkadiusz
Majszyk, said the sharp increase was quite likely to continue for
at least two or three more years, spreading to sexual partners
before it levels off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real epidemic picking up,'' Majszyk said in an
interview Tuesday. ``A critical mass of injecting drug users is
coming to the picture, and because of this, one or two cases of
HIV'' _ the virus that causes AIDS _ ``coming from outside the
region is enough to start a very quick wave'' of infections.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of Russians officially registered as
HIV-positive _ 23,509 _ remains low, Majszyk said, and only 445
deaths from AIDS have been reported nationwide. But the Russian
government estimates the actual number of HIV cases at five times
the reported number. Majszyk added, while, as a rule of thumb,
Western specialists generally use a factor of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the true number, he said, the steep rise in the rate of
infection is alarming _ and sometimes astounding _ all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the WHO report states, 12,425 new cases of HIV
infection have been recorded in Russia _ an increase of 358 percent
over the total for all of 1998, and more than the total number of
cases reported in all preceding years.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow region recorded more than 4,000 new cases so far this
year. In Irkutsk, a city of some 670,000 buried deep in southern
Siberia, the number of reported cases leapt from 68 as of last
January to 2,191 today.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of the reported infections occur among men, the
report states. The greatest rate of infection is among people
between the ages of 18 and 25. Improved reporting methods may
account for a small portion of the increase in known cases, Majszyk
said. But the evidence points overwhelmingly to an epidemic borne
by drug addicts, who he said comprise about 90 percent of the new
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the true number of drug users in Russia, a nation
of 146 million people, but experts place the total at about 2.5
million, with 2 million of them needle users. HIV can be spread
among drug users not just by sharing needles, but by methods used
widely in the former Soviet Union to prepare drugs for injection,
which can contaminate the drug solution.
</P>
<P>
   The WHO report states that the rise is equally alarming in
Ukraine and parts of eastern Europe, where drug use and
prostitution have promoted the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Majszyk said he bases his projections of a widening epidemic in
part on the experience in Kaliningrad, a tiny, disconnected outpost
of the Russian Federation located on a Baltic Sea peninsula north
of Germany. Poverty-stricken and isolated, Kaliningrad suffers a
serious drug-abuse problem, which early on encouraged the spread of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   It is being increasingly transmitted by prostitutes, or
``commercial sex workers'' in UN parlance. Half the region's
prostitutes are HIV positive, Majszyk said, including 9 in 10 of
those work who work on the streets. ``The second group and second
wave, which will come very soon here, is heterosexual
transmission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will go for the next two or three years because the main
measures which should be taken are connected with prevention,'' he
added. ``And prevention, to work, needs time.''
</P>
<P>
   Majszyk said the Russian government is awakening to the scope of
the HIV problem and that officials are preparing an intensive
effort, involving seven government ministries and 12 populous
regions, to raise public awareness of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Health and a press
officer in the ministry division that deals with AIDS declined to
comment Tuesday on the report, which they said they had not seen.
</P>
<P>
   An accurate accounting of the nation's HIV problem, they said,
must await a government news conference next week.

   By RUTHE STEINQC double c 
 
c. 1999, San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO --
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; M adonna, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Barbra Streisand, Frank
Sinatra and even Bob Dylan and Fabian have tried it _ with varying
success. Now it is Jewel's turn to test whether the magic that has
catapulted her to fame in the music world translates to the silver
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to disappear into a character so audiences forget
they are watching a popular singer. Sinatra pulled this off some of
the time; Madonna has yet to. In ``Ride With the Devil,'' Jewel is
surprisingly effective at turning herself into a Civil War widow,
who is part Scarlett O'Hara, part Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Jewel is believable on-  &LR; screen may be the period
costumes, which are a far cry from the low cut T-shirts, jean
jackets and leather trousers her fans are used to seeing her in.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel, 25, studied acting in boarding school and had an inkling
she'd be able to finesse a movie role. Still, it was no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely like a challenge, but picking such a hard
dramatic role for my first movie was like jumping into the deep end
of the pool,'' she says, sipping tea late in the morning. ``It was
horrifying. Oh f_ I was worried. It took years off my life. At the
same time, I loved the perversity of knowing there is a lot at
stake and if you pull it off, it's good, and if you don't, you're
screwed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her speaking voice has the same lilting, honey tone heard on her
best-selling albums, ``Pieces of You'' and ``Spirit,'' and on her
new release, ``Joy: A Holiday Collection.'' With her oval face and
straight long blond hair, she resembles Helen Hunt if Hunt ate
three square meals a day. Jewel has that rare ability, especially
for a celebrity, of being right there, thoughtfully answering each
question with no apparent desire to be somewhere else. Or maybe she
start ital  &LR; really end ital &UR;  &LR; is a helluva actress.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing herself to do something outside her field would have
been a lot easier if her CDs weren't all over record stores, she
says. ``That kind of courage pre-fame is real easy, because if you
fall on your a_ss &LR; , who cares? But fame is an odd creature. It has
a life of its own and an influence on you, which is a force to be
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're famous and you fail, it's in front of the whole
world. The world does not value growth over perfection. People are
very unforgiving and that causes self-censorship. It makes you go,
`Ooh, I got to be safe and stick with what I know.' I knew I might
look bad, and knowing that, I went ahead and did it because
otherwise you die creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel had been looking to make a movie,; &LR;  but the timing had to
be right so it wouldn't interfere with her recording or touring
schedule. Just as a window of opportunity opened, her agents were
approached by Avy Kaufman, casting director on  &LR; for ``Ride With the
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way over 40, so I didn't know who Jewel was,'' says Ang
Lee, the film's director, who is best known for ``Sense and
Sensibility.'' Kaufman sent him Jewel's music videos as well as a
tape of her playing Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz'' as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Jewel, Lee made it clear she would have to take
acting lessons for three months before any casting decision was
made. ``I was very frank with her. She was so devoted to the
possibility of acting in this movie, she agreed to the lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   This proved to be more stressful than she thought.  &LR; ``I was
touring and taking acting lessons in between,'' Jewel recalls. ``I
had some days where I went, `I'm going to be all right' and other
days where it was like `Uh, I can't get out of bed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee suggested she take up tai chi as a way to relax and get into
the role. ``He could see I wasn't real grounded at that time of my
life. All of a sudden, I was famous and I had a stalker during that
time and I was working with this brilliant director, who really
intimidated me. The tai chi was just to get me back settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that going on, Lee's instincts told him Jewel was
up to the role. ``Her part doesn't require her to carry the movie,
so I didn't think it was such a big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a risk with a payoff if her legion of fans, most of
them young women, rush to see her in ``Ride with the Devil.'' The
film stars Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich, who are not hot enough
yet to get people into theaters on the strength of their names.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the film's screenwriter, James Schamus cq &LR; , points
out: ``Being a star in one area is no guarantee of ticket sales in
another.'' He admires Jewel for her willingness to ``completely
erase her rock star personality on the set. She worked like a
maniac on this movie. You don't see people work like that too
often.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few weeks on the set, ``Jewel was pretty raw,''
Ulrich says. ``She didn't know what was going on when it came to
technique. She didn't even know what a mark was,'' he adds,
referring to where actors are supposed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   But she caught on quickly. Ulrich thinks it helped that she
seems in some ways like her character, Sue Lee, a shy Southern
woman who comes into her own when she has to fend for herself
during the grueling war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil War widows became quite notorious by 1862-63,'' Schamus
explains. ``Because they were sexually aware, they realized that in
order to survive and get through the battle, they really had to go
out there and attract husbands. There was a kind of sexuality and
assertiveness these women had going after their next guy. They
began to address men in public and introduce themselves _ all
things that were quite shocking at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel nails her character's sexuality, and there were other ways
in which she could relate to Sue Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on the land. I was raised to be feminine, but not
in the kind of contrived way where you are playing a game of
seducing men,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have never lost a husband; I have never slept with a man
who ended up dying right afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   She also never wore a corset before she had to squeeze into one
for her role. Like all self-respecting 19th century women, Sue Lee
wouldn't have gone out without one. ``That was a hard part about
the movie for me. The corset was so tight, I couldn't breathe when
I bent over. I wanted to die,'' Jewel recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else about making a movie appealed to her, however,
and she would like to do it again, although writing and singing
songs takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music allows you to talk directly to people. No other art
medium does that. I can actually tell people what I think. I can
get in front of kids and say, `Don't lose hope' or `Gee, I feel
like s_'''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, she would like to be in a contemporary film. But she
isn't rushing into anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice things about the position I'm in is that I
don't have to be an actress,'' Jewel continues. ``I don't need the
money, so I don't have to take parts I don't want. It's a purely
creative endeavor. That's a luxury most actors don't have. I can
wait and be real picky.''

COMMERCIAL YANKED AFTER COMPLAINTS BY MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Upset Canadian men have slapped down a car
advertisement, claiming it's too violent for them to handle.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian television ad for the DaimlerChrysler Neon was yanked
from the airwaves and re-edited after viewers _ almost all men _
complained they were upset by sight of a woman slapping a man.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, broadcast across Canada, showed an attractive
young couple strolling down a street. The man turns to admire a
parked Chrysler Neon. But his partner thinks he's leering at
another woman passing by, and gives him a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   The carmaker insisted it was not trying to promote violence
against men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was meant to amuse people, but didn't pan out that way,''
said Othmar Stein, vice president for public affairs at
DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc, based in Windsor, Ontario. ``There was
no intention of offending anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too much for some Canadian males.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just turn this thing around,'' Dan Stevelman of the
Alberta-based Men's Educational Support Association, a support
group for Canadian males, told the Globe and Mail newspaper.
``Would the guy be right in slugging her? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in a month that Canadians turned their
irritation on something that in another time might have seen
innocuous or humorous. Last month, a government-run experimental
farm banned ``human female names'' _ like Bessie or Donna _ for
cows, on the grounds that women might be upset.
</P>
<P>
   On the car front, the Neon commercial created by Montreal ad
agency Publicis BCP Inc. started airing on Canadian channels in
mid-October. And complaints from offended males started trickling
in.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was hardly an outpouring of public anger, it was
enough to persuade the automaker to re-edit the ad. On the new
version airing this week, the girlfriend simply scowls at her

ARTISTRY AND SOCIAL COMPASSION IN COUNTERPOINT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another opening, another show: surely there are more humane ways
than this to think about earthquakes. But unless you have the
misfortune to be struck by one, a seismologic event usually arrives
packaged as prime-time entertainment, with unctuous news anchors or
made-for-TV actors reciting their lines over numbing boom-de-boom
soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru Ban, an architect who lives in Tokyo, has not allowed
himself the safe distance enjoyed by our remote controllers. In the
last five years, he has responded to the news of earthquakes and
other disasters as if to a call of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kobe quake in 1994, Ban designed units of cardboard
and plastic housing for the thousands who had been driven from
their homes. The following year, he established the Volunteer
Architects Network, a nongovernmental agency of the United Nations.
This year, under the aegis of that agency, he has coordinated the
production and shipment of cardboard housing units for refugees in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that Ban is also a brilliant designer of private
houses, apartment houses, public buildings and museum exhibitions.
In these, he has displayed a striking talent for innovative form,
structure and spatial organization. This diverse body of work plays
havoc with our Western inclination to plug architects into mutually
exclusive categories: the artistically gifted or the socially
committed.
</P>
<P>
   In Ban's case, they stem from the same outlook. He himself
distinguishes between the refugee housing and his other work, but
the difference is one of application, not of the principles behind
it. In this work, we are invited to see the social dimension within
the aesthetic, the artist inside the humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the principles guiding Ban's architecture is economy
of means. In his houses, this has resulted in the reduction of the
dwelling to simple lines and planes and the volumes of space
contained within them. The effect is a minimalist aesthetic. It can
be appreciated as a look, a style, a fashion. For Ban, however,
architecture is only incidentally concerned with effects. It is
mostly a matter of causes.
</P>
<P>
   Ban, who is 42, is a true cosmopolite. Born in Tokyo in 1957, he
studied architecture at the California Institute of the Arts and
then Cooper Union in New York, from which he graduated in 1984. In
those years, the attention of many Cooper Union students was
focused on a group of architects known as the New York Five: Peter
Eisenman, Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Michael
Graves. The five were also called the Whites, because their forms
were typically rendered as colorless geometric abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Japan, Ban began his professional practice with a
series of Case Study houses that gave so-called White architecture
a Japanese twist. These spare exercises are dominated by the
Cartesian grid, a form that had assumed nearly sacred status among
the Five as a link with Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier.
</P>
<P>
   In Ban's projects, the grid form also became a bond with
Japanese tradition: the architecture of the shoji screen, the
tatami mat and the flexible division of space.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, Ban is best known for the Curtain Wall House, a
1995 project with billowing drapery that was featured earlier this
year in the ``(Un)private House'' show at the Museum of Modern Art.
But his most radical example of East-West fusion is the Wall-less
House, a project completed two years ago in the rural town of
Karuizawa.
</P>
<P>
   The design is a play on the Wall House, an unbuilt project by
John Hejduk, in which pockets of dwelling space are suspended from
an upright concrete slab. In Ban's house, which occupies a hillside
site, the slab is rotated into a horizontal position to create a
floor. The slab curves upward at one end, where it meets the
sloping ground. A thinner slab is cantilevered from the upturned
edge to form the roof, which is additionally supported by two
slender columns at the far end.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the hillside, which serves as an earth berm, there
are no exterior walls, no fixed partitions between floor and roof.
Screens can be moved into place to conceal or reveal bathroom,
bedroom and kitchen. The largest permanent fixture is a kitchen
counter cantilevered from the upturn in the floor slab. The curve
of the counter's underside echoes that of the upturn and of the
ground to which the house is moored.
</P>
<P>
   In this almost unrelieved horizontal composition, the eye is
magnetically drawn most powerfully to the bathroom sink, crowned
with a round mirror, that sits on the outward perimeter of the
floor slab. A pair of fixtures typically clamped against a wall,
the arrangement underscores the absence of perpendicular planes. It
also reads as a comic play on the view that practical
considerations like plumbing are what distinguish architecture from
sculpture. Here, we get the bathroom sink without the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ban's work with cardboard _ or what he calls paper _
architecture began with installations he designed in the mid-1980s
for shows on the work of Emilio Ambasz and Alvar Aalto. Later, he
began to work with paper structurally, using cardboard tubes.
Employing steel cables to compress the tubes, Ban continued the
experiments in tensile structure developed by Buckminster Fuller,
Frei Otto and Robert Le Ricolais.
</P>
<P>
   (New Yorkers will get to see an example of this technique next
summer, when the Museum of Modern Art will enclose part of its
sculpture garden beneath Ban's open, lattice-like roof.)
</P>
<P>
   Ban's first venture into refugee housing came in response to the
1994 civil strife in Rwanda. Deforestation had depleted the timber
needed for building shelters. Working with the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, Ban designed simple tents of blue
plastic sheets, using cardboard tubes to support them. Fifty units
were eventually shipped abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The shelters Ban designed for refugees of the Kobe earthquake
were more ambitious. These were miniature one-room houses made of
cardboard, with operable door and windows. Plastic beer can crates,
filled with sacks of sand, provided foundations for the simple,
pitched-roof pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   Ban also designed a community church made from cardboard tube
columns, arranged in an elliptical shape. The Kobe housing became
the model for the shelters that Ban's United Nations group has
deployed in Turkey this year.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between Ban's humanitarian work and his Case
Study houses is more easily seen if one compares the relief housing
to minimalist art. Ban's use of humble materials, his elemental
Monopoly-house shape and his repetition of the basic module echo
themes developed in the work of Donald Judd, Carl Andre and Dan
Flavin. The cracked earth, meanwhile assumes the cosmic dimension
of landscape in 15th century Japanese ink painting.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitanism today signifies much more than urban
sophistication. It also denotes awareness that the globe is rapidly
urbanizing in some highly unsophisticated ways. This is true even
in relatively modern countries like Turkey. Those jerry-built,
orange masonry housing blocks, many occupied by squatters, are
familiar to anyone who has taken a taxi from Istanbul's airport
into town.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitanism also means knowing that land is part of the
earth, that the earth is finite and has plans of its own, that the
undeveloped land that developers like to call greentop is linked to
something larger, and therefore so is architecture. As such, there
is a sacred aspect to the relationship between even secular
buildings and the space they occupy.
</P>
<P>
   Ban's description of his relief work as paper architecture is
ironic. In the West, the term refers to unbuilt projects designed
by architects like Hejduk, who hold themselves in such artistic
high regard that they seldom deign to build.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Frampton, the architectural historian, once observed
that, in the 1970s, architecture became divided between those who
sought to practice architecture as a form of fine art and those who
approached it as direct social action. Hailing from a country where
paper has long been a common building material, Ban has embraced
the cause of healing the quake in his profession.

NO CHECK MADE ON PILOTS' MENTAL STATE, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The behavior of airline pilots is closely scrutinized by their
cockpit mates, and pilots undergo frequent physical exams. But they
undergo no rigorous mental health probing that might detect
psychological trouble, say aviation specialists.
</P>
<P>
   US airline captains must pass twice-yearly physicals _ often
seeing the same doctor time after time _ and are asked about any
mental problems or changes in work or personal circumstances. If
they don't seem overtly troubled, say the examining physicians, the
matter ends there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask about sleep disturbances, interpersonal relations,
sexual function, and so on,'' said Dr. Stuart Mushlin, a Brigham
and Women's Hospital doctor who administers pilot physicals in
Boston. ``Beyond that, I don't do anything sophisticated: there are
no personality inventories, no Rorschach tests.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the demanding environment in which pilots work creates
many other checks on behavior, say aviation specialists. Pilots
face ``their toughest critics'' _ their coworkers _ while in the
cockpit, said John Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very narrow bands of what constitutes acceptable
behavior, and something (beyond those limits) is going to be noted
with great concern by the other person, who really wants to get
home safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the mysterious EgyptAir crash off
Nantucket Island on Oct. 31, killing all 217 aboard, has centered
on Gameel El-Batouty, a reserve pilot who evidently was flying the
plane when it went into a steep dive that experts say must have
been intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Mazor and others in the aviation community say there is no
certain way to detect mental instability if a pilot disguises it
and lies on examinations. But they point out that, while suicide by
airplane has killed a number of private pilots in the United
States, the only known or strongly suspected passenger-carrying
airliner suicide crashes have involved foreign air carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there's anything else you could add'' to pilot
certification requirements ``that would produce an increment in
safety,'' Mazor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system is superb,'' said Dr. Gary Kearney, a
urological surgeon at Brigham and Women's who gives pilot
physicals. He said that he relies on clinical judgment to assess
mental health, and said that because pilots often see the same
doctor repeatedly for their exams, he can tell if there has been a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression is one of the easiest (problems) to pick up,'' said
Kearney. ``People who are depressed make you feel depressed, and
you can pick that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazor agreed that some pilots fit a stereotypical image of
maintaining control and downplaying risks or worries. And, he
added, ``remember that this is a college-educated, very smart,
experienced individual who is very good at producing the desired
outcome'' _ like the right answer to a psychological quiz.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the very traits you want in a pilot when your life is
in his or her hands _ unflappable confidence, a need to be in
control _ may lead some fliers to downplay or not even admit
problems they would view as weaknesses, say some specialists.
</P>
<P>
   One former flight attendant and former wife of an airline pilot
said she observed a ``code of silence'' among some fliers regarding
colleagues' behavior. Ana L. Laguzzi of Brooklyn, who said she flew
with PanAm for 14 years, said that many pilots ``wouldn't say
anything negative'' about another pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Laguzzi said her husband once flew for a month with an older
pilot, nearing retirement and mourning the death of his wife, who
drank heavily and performed erratically. ``But they wouldn't have
dreamed of reporting him,'' she said, even though ``he was putting
everybody at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have said that El-Batouty exhibited no signs
of depression to his colleagues and family.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Jacobs, a Harvard psychiatrist who heads the
National Depression Screening Day program that uses telephone
questionnaires and simple checklists to spot undiagnosed
depression, said that if the EgyptAir pilot was bent on suicide,
others should have noticed something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs of suicide (if that's what it was) were there for
his colleagues to see, but they might not have recognized them''
for what they were, said Jacobs, who has conducted ``psychological
autopsies'' in major accidents. ``If one looks deep enough and long
enough, you find something,'' he said.

INTEREST RATE JITTERS DEPRESS TREASURIES A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reacting to investor fears that the economy will
continue to race and that the Federal Reserve will be forced to
respond by raising short-term interest rates again, bond prices
fell slightly Tuesday, leaving yields at their highest level in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury slipped 1/32, to 99 4/32. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was
unchanged at 6.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government sold $15 billion of new two-year
notes Tuesday, and the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen,
making dollar-denominated investments like government securities
less attractive to some foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rupert, an economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's MMM, a market
research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said that ``as
expected, the auction results didn't offer much inspiration for
Treasuries. There is not a lot to look forward to tomorrow, but at
least it's a shortened session.'' The bond market will close at 2
p.m. Wednesday in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have an investment community fixated on equities,'' said
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the
fixed-income department at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp. in Boca
Raton, Fla. ``Other investors, however, are mandated to buy
fixed-income products. Trading is thin, with not a whole lot of
conviction either way.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year notes were awarded at 5.946 percent as expected,
with the bid to cover ratio of 2.46 to 1 a little below October's
ratio but better than average, Ms. Rupert noted. ``Today's two-year
note was not auctioned in the most favorable environments and
produced rather lackluster results.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the doso meant that imports were more
expensive, and that will likely put upward pressure on consumer
prices. Inflation fears are also being fueled by higher oil prices,
and that is a negative for bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Prices were briefly buoyed in the morning by a government report
that showed an unexpected drop in orders for durable goods in
October. But some analysts see the drop as evidence that companies
are merely postponing purchases until the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is nervous,'' said Donald Fine, chief market
analyst for Chase Asset Management. ``Indeed, another round of Fed
tightening during the first quarter of next year has already been
priced into the Treasury market, judging from the spread between
the two-year note and the federal funds rate, and this will likely
remain a fixture of the yield curve until evidence suggesting the
economy is slowing to a noninflationary pace begins to
accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ``economy is in a full-tilt boogie,'' Pugliese
said, the Fed will need time to reassess its options and nothing is
expected to happen until the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in durable good orders Tuesday was due to an outsized
15.3 percent fall off in new orders for electronic equipment, which
was attributed in part to an earthquake in Taiwan that closed
plants that make computer chips. Many market participants think
that some of this decline was also related to concerns about the
Year 2000 computer problem, which would imply that orders would
most likely be replenished in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any event,'' Fine said, ``new orders for durable goods at
the current time are considerably stronger than at the same point
last year, which bodes well for future production and implies that
rising interest rates have not yet suppressed demand in this
interest-sensitive sector of the economy.''

   Thanksgiving's such a nice, traditional holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``boring''?
</P>
<P>
   We decided to put children in charge of the Thanksgiving meal to
see how they'd shake things up. What would they choose to replace
all those ``just try a bite'' dishes we grown-ups dream up?
</P>
<P>
   We asked kids to tell us what they'd serve if they were making
up the menu this year. And tell us they did. In droves. We got
hundreds of essays and drawings, with all sorts of clever ideas and
creative misspellings.
</P>
<P>
   Here we present Thanksgiving, their way _ a baker's dozen of the
best of the essays we received, along with our top 10 list of what
kids want. We wish we had more space to share all the great kids'
ideas with you, but here's another idea we highly recommend: Ask
your own kids what they'd like. Listen to what they say. And add
something that's theirs alone to the feast this year.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   If I got to be in charge of Thanksgiving food, I'd pick a turkey
with a pot pie inside. Those are my favorite dinners and I can
never have both! I'd also choose strawberries instead of mashed
potatoes. As for the pie, I'd choose pumpkin, my favorite. That's
not all for dessert. I'd want a gigantic Strawberry and Chocolate
Sunday. I think that would be delicious!

and it's yummy too. Something else that I would serve is corn on
the cob because I think it goes good with turkey. I'd also serve
butter bread because it goes good with every meal and butter bread
especially goes good with a Thanksgiving dinner. If I was the one
to serve a Thanksgiving dinner, the food would be something that I
think everyone would like and things that go good together like
green beans, corn, turkey, mashed potatos, salad and maybe some
carrots.

stuffing. I would have one of my mom's secret recipes that she only
told me. It is called delectible delicious greenbean casaroll. My
mom makes this casaroll special. She puts baked squash in it. I
would put hot, steaming rolls on the table. Don't forget mashed
potatoes, or my most favorite of the bunch, pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   While all these things are cooking, I would decorate the table.
I'd put a beautiful cloth over the table with fake leafs. I'd put a
cornucopia filled with juicy fruit. I'd let the homeless and
forgotten decorate their very own table mats. Now I would set the
table. The food is now ready. I'd put it on the table, say our
prayers and then dig in. That's what I would do if I was in charge
of a Thanksgiving feast. I would share it with other people.

   I would want turkey, cake, candy, koolaid, milk, appls, bananas,
onions, ice and ice cream, pop cycles, hamburgers, french fries,
cherries, carrots, pineapples, applesauce, bread, cereal, chicken,
eggs, salad, vegetables and fruit. That's enough.

   If I were in charge of the Thanksgiving menu, I would make
pumpkin pie as ghis as a skyscraper. Also I would serve a lot of
chocolate fudge sundes and some moose pudding. Also I would serve
big fat juicy hamburgers. And some nice banana sundes. So much good
milk duds. And I would serce a nice juicy turkey. And some good
chunky cookies I would serve that. Also I would serve some apple
pie. And I would serve some sunny side up eggs. And also I would
serve some chicken. Also taco bell will be served to the people who
don't like the other things.

E-MAIL AN IMPERFECT FORM OF COMMUNICATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q -- I sent an e-mail to a colleague across the country, and the
next thing I knew, my boss was lecturing me about sending such an
unfriendly note. I don't think it was unfriendly, but it was direct
and businesslike. When I reread it to my boss, he seemed to
understand. Is there a way to prevent this kind of problem from
recurring? P.S.
</P>
<P>
   A -- E-mail is not a perfect form of communication, but, for
that matter, neither is a boss who lectures you.
</P>
<P>
   For communication to be truly effective, it is important for the
sender to do more than send a message. Although the message is an
obviously important part of the communication process, it is also
important for the sender to have some sensitivity to the way in
which a message is received. In face-to-face communications, it is
generally easy to see and hear the receiver's reaction, although
your manager demonstrated that this is not always the case.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail, a letter instantly arrives and its meaning, tone and
intent are greatly influenced by the mind set, mood and
expectations of the receiver. Any phrase can be easily
misinterpreted. For example, think about the different ways that
the following e-mail sentence can be read: ``This needs to be done
by Friday.'' Granted, the use of capitals can signify emphasis in
e-mail, but is that a friendly emphasis or is it yelling?
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is a terrific means of communication, but if people have
questions about the message, intonation or intent, they need to be
advised to either meet with the sender (who often is down the
hall), or at the very least pick up the phone. As for your
lecturing manager, he needs to pick up a few management classes.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I have not been with this company very long, but it is one
of the most unorganized businesses I have ever seen. In places
where systems and procedures are needed, there are none, and many
of the existing systems are long obsolete. My manager tells me that
this looseness is by design, adding that chaos can build creativity
and agility, and that companies that are too structured are left
behind. Am I off base in thinking that this makes no sense? C.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A -- When a business is chaotic, that does not imply creativity,
nimbleness or broad thinking; rather, putting all the
rationalizations aside, the implication is that the business is a
mess.
</P>
<P>
   It makes more sense to view businesses as being arrayed on a
continuum, with the hyper-organized on one end, and the chaotic on
the other. At one extreme, the businesses are so filled with
layers, levels and policies that people can hardly breathe without
looking in a manual. And, at the other extreme, the businesses are
so void of organization that people are basically wandering around.
</P>
<P>
   In today's dynamic marketplace, it makes sense for businesses to
have a flat structure, streamlined policies, employee empowerment,
cross training and a clear focus on its mission and objectives.
That may sound chaotic when compared to an overly organized
company, but it is not chaos at all.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager is correct in asserting that overly structured
companies are left behind, but he or she needs to realize chaotic
companies sit hand in hand with them.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- As part of my job as a supervisor, I am supposed to
discipline employees for breaking the rules and committing other
infractions at work. I do not like confrontations, and this aspect
of the job has me worried. What are the ways to discipline
employees without having a confrontation? S.A.
</P>
<P>
   A -- It is not difficult to conduct disciplinary sessions with
employees, provided that you have disciplined yourself to do so in
a well-prepared, productive, open, fair and constructive fashion.
If you go into a session expecting a confrontation, that is
precisely what you will find.
</P>
<P>
   When an employee needs to be disciplined, it is important to
provide the feedback as close to the questionable behavior as
possible. Keep in mind that you will fare better if you envision
yourself as a coach, rather than a disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Base the discussion on the individual's specific behavior and
clearly express the ways in which it was unacceptable, along with
the consequences if such behavior persists. At the same time, be
sure to listen to the employee's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Let the employee suggest some methods to improve his or her
behavior in the future, and you can then provide more guidance as
to the specifics. Be sure to document the session and ask for the
employee's signature. Wrap up the discussion with positive
expectations, and give the employee positive feedback, when these
expectations are met.

SINGLES BRAVE THE FROZEN DINNER TUNDRA IN SEARCH OF TRAY BON MEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON AND PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a day alone with a frozen TV turkey dinner
loomed for the singles among us. And we suspected we weren't alone.
So we did what any sensible single person suffering from intense
social anxiety would do: threw a party.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy the accountants here at the office, we are calling
our efforts a ``reader service.'' We rounded up a swarm of fellow
potential orphans, popped the corks of several wine bottles and got
down to the serious business of taste-testing turkey TV dinners.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't like the test kitchen of ``Gourmet.'' Because of the
unruly nature of our guests, we didn't bother to follow the
directions on the packages _ we just nuked them as fast as we
could. We did not bother to cleanse our palates between entries.
Our note taker had dubious journalistic credentials and grew
increasingly disoriented in direct proportion to the number of wine
bottles opened. More than once, we realized it was really gross
that we were all eating from the same plate.
</P>
<P>
   We did find a couple of dinners that could serve as a passable
substitute for the family turkey feast. But after enduring eight of
these meals, we also made our own Thanksgiving plans. If the nice
girl at the office with the sensible shoes doesn't extend another
invite this year, we're gonna order a pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The group awarded each dinner a ``wattle'' rating on a
scale of 0 to 5, with 5 points as ``superb'' and 0 as ``inedible.''

&HT;        TEXAS LEADS NATION IN PERCENTAGE OF DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.23 - Texas had a larger percentage of
alcohol-related car accidents than any other state in the nation
except Washington, D.C. last year, according to a report released
Tuesday by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Out of 3,577 car crashes in Texas last year, 1,792 were alcohol
related, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For the methods the state uses to combat drunk driving - such as
law enforcement and legislation aimed at youths -- the report gave
Texas an overall grade of ``C'', under the national grade of
``C+''.
</P>
<P>
   The report found Texas to be lacking in programs and laws
targeting underage drinking, and gave the state a grade of ``D'' in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   A national organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or MADD,
aims to prevent drunk driving through education, as well as through
stricter sentencing for offenders and offering services to victims.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley is among the ``worst'' areas in the state in numbers
of drinking and driving accidents, according Sandy Ernst, the
coordinator the Valley's MADD chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The MADD-Rio Grande Valley Chapter opened earlier this month,
and is about to get its own toll-free number, Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ernst, whose 28-year-old sister was killed last year by
a drunk driver, had not yet seen the latest report, she said the
border is particularly prone to alcohol-related accidents among
underage drinkers because of the proximity to Mexico, where
drinking laws are lax.
</P>
<P>
   The report gave Governor George W. Bush and the state political
leadership high marks, an ``A-'', for signing into law anti-drunk
driving measures such as the one lowering the measurement of
intoxication to .08 in blood-alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   The report also made note of two successful efforts in Texas: a
Houston-based mentoring program focusing on high-risk Hispanic
youth and an Arlington city law that notifies liquor stores that
have sold alcohol to someone arrested for driving drunk.

routinely delaying scheduled aircraft maintenance, according to
federal officials. Federal Aviation Administration in early
November halted America West from using temporary extensions to put
off heavy maintenance, forcing the airline to immediately park some
of its planes. The move came after an August warning about abusing

&HT;        VALLEY REPS. FLARE OVER MEXICO CAR DEPOSIT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov.23 - With just over a week before Mexico begins
forcing motorists to deposit $400 to $800 to drive south of the
border, Valley lawmakers and residents are protesting a plan they
say would be ``devastating'' for both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Democrats, who head the House Border Caucus, last week
wrote a letter to President Clinton asking him to get involved to
prevent the deposit, which they called a ``threat to U.S.-Mexico
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Coastal Bend residents who drive to Mexico to visit
relatives are also upset, and said they refuse to pay such a
deposit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government will implement the deposit plan -- meant
to combat illegal imports of used cars to Mexico -- on Dec.1. The
amount of the deposit depends on the year of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little disturbed, because they are going to go ahead
with it,'' said Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi. ``This is
going to be devastating for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz and Rep. Henry Bonilla, D-San Antonio, asked the
administration to pressure the Mexican government to withdraw the
proposal that lawmakers say would discourage trade, investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply concerned that Mexico may be erecting such a
barrier which will divide our nations and hinder commerce,'' the
lawmakers stated in the Nov. 18 letter.
</P>
<P>
   The president, currently traveling in Europe, has so far not
taken a stance, and a United States Trade Representative
spokeswoman said the letter had not been received yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Rio Grande Valley partnership, a regional
chamber of commerce in Wesleco, the deposits would cost the Mexican
economy $2 billion in lost income from tourists and relatives from
the Valley alone.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico argues the bonds are needed to curb sales of
U.S.-registered cars on Mexico's black market. The deposit is meant
to deter people from driving their cars in to Mexico, selling them,
and flying back to the U.S., depriving the government of receipt of
duties they normally receive from used car sales.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Martinez, a Corpus Christi resident with family in
Mexico, has collected 362 signatures from legal residents and
American citizens from the Coastal Bend who oppose the deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the money to put a deposit and we don't trust
they are going to give us back the whole or part of that,'' said
Martinez, who owns a shoe repair business. ``We are not going to
pay it. I heard of only one family from Chicago who is willing to
pay, but out of a thousand families, nobody is going to pay that
amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said her group, La Familia, is boycotting Mexican-made
products such as Corona beer and Productos Alen cleaning products
in protest of the deposit. In the last month, La Familia has
written to congressmen Ortiz and Bonilla and on Wednesday will send
letters to HEB and Wal-Mart stores informing them of the boycott,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez, who hails from Monterrey, normally tries to
buy Mexican products, the deposit forced her to break that habit.
``Now they (the Mexican government) are not thinking (about) our
family economy,'' she said. ``We have power too.''

   Ortiz said he was aware of demonstrations and boycotts in his
district. ``I would much rather see this problem solved in another
way but people have a right to do what they want to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government postponed implementing the policy last
month, and modified the rules in response to protests from
Mexican-Americans. One change was to allow motorists to pay with
credit cards instead of cash, a provision that the lawmakers
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Ciro Rodriguez, D-San Antonio, in his own letter to
the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. last week, suggested forming a
bilateral commission that would meet for six months to come up with
an alternative to the car bond policy.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hopes the commission of police, local representatives
and trade and treasury officials from both nations will meet as
early as Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rodriguez spokesman Diego De la Garza, the Mexican
officials have responded ``favorably'' to the idea of forming a
commission, but complained that six months was too short a time to
negotiate. ``They want to discuss it more,'' De la Garza said.
``For us that's very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla spokeswoman Chris Hawes was less optimistic of the
administration or Congress changing Mexico's course. ``Quite
frankly, it's a serious problem, but it's not the job of the United
States to figure it out for them,'' Hawes said.

FOR SERIOUS WRITERS AND THEIR READERS, AN OASIS ON THE AIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.M.)   (af)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ When Ana Castillo, an award-winning
Mexican-American writer, appeared on a weekly public radio show
called ``Bookworm,'' the host did something strange. He had read
her entire body of work and he asked intelligent questions.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes, Ms. Castillo held forth on matters like the
parallels and dissimilarities between her novels and her poetry,
the proper use of irony in romantic and passionate passages and the
influence of both the telenovela and 16th-century Spanish
literature on her work. Only a close critical listening would have
revealed the bottom-line reason for her visit: to plug her new
novel, ``Peel My Love Like an Onion.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. In the world of serious poetry and fiction, where
text and technique are more important than conventional book tour
prattle or even plot, ``Bookworm'' is considered something of a
national resource, a sanctuary from lightweight pop fiction and/or
the celebritization of well-known authors.
</P>
<P>
   Although run on a shoestring and distributed free to a shaky
network of 50 or so public radio stations, the program has run for
10 years and attracted heavyweights like Tom Wolfe, Scott Turow,
E.L. Doctorow, John Irving, Norman Mailer, Richard Ford, Joan
Didion, Toni Morrison, Paul Theroux, Joyce Carol Oates, Salman
Rushdie, Amy Tan, Gore Vidal, Ann Beattie and Nicholson Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The creator, producer and host, Michael Silverblatt, a tall,
round-faced man in his 40s with a slightly nasal, somewhat
monotonous but oddly compelling voice, welcomed them all in a tiny
basement recording studio at KCRW, a Santa Monica public radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the show is to help my listeners look through
writers' eyes,'' Silverblatt says in his small Hollywood apartment
(lined from floor to ceiling with books by the thousands).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to show them, whether they're reading or not, how writers
re-enchant the world,'' he says passionately. ``How they surround
us with the miraculous. That's what books do to me and what I want
my show to do, to remind people how odd and special writers' minds
and imaginations are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might include the listeners' having read or planning to
read the book, but the ideal is to have them simply look at the
world in a different way. And saying: `They're talking about
nothing I've ever heard of, nothing I have a background in, but the
sound is fascinating.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a reverential and unfiltered approach to literature doesn't
seem to have a wide audience in even supposedly sophisticated
markets (in fact, ``Bookworm'' was recently dropped by its only New
York City outlet, WNYE in Brooklyn), but the unalloyed enthusiasm
shown for it by both the publishing and writing worlds compensates.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Seroy, vice president for publicity at Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, says: ``Michael's show is of the highest importance to us.
He's the best interview in America. There are other good
interviewers around, but he gets a deeper engagement and a more
genuine response than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer and artist Art Spiegelman, who has been on the show
several times, says: ``His show is an oasis. When you're on a book
tour it's like, `Thank God I've arrived in a place for a real
conversation about something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Silverblatt, who spends an average of six hours each day
reading, maintains that his main interest is in ``creating
something of a mad tea party rather than conveying information.''
He believes in ``derouting the expected track of an interview,
because the subject of the `subject of the book' has usually been
calcified around certain inevitable answers that are so regularly
presented that the talk no longer sounds like human talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, when Tom Wolfe arrived here early this year to
discuss his novel ``A Man in Full,'' Silverblatt quickly steered
him away from talking about the horrors of working in a
refrigerated warehouse (where one of the book's protagonists was
originally employed) to the writer's allegiance and debt to the
19th-century French writers Flaubert and Zola, a subject upon which
Wolfe was only too glad to expound.
</P>
<P>
   When Salman Rushdie was interviewed in July about ``The Ground
Beneath Her Feet,'' the topic of the recently lifted death threat
on the author was barely touched upon, while the parallels between
his story and the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and ``the problem
of writing about love with a narrator who has trouble believing in
love,'' were discussed at great length.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   James Galvin, a Colorado-born poet and teacher at the Iowa
Writer's Workshop, recently had his first novel, ``Fencing the
Sky'' _ about a deadly conflict between longtime Western cattlemen
and arriviste hobby ranchers _ published by Henry Holt. When Galvin
was interviewed for ``Bookworm'' in October, Silverblatt bored in
on the author's feelings about Melville and ``Moby-Dick'' and the
uneasy relationship between fictionalized reality and the nature of
truth.
</P>
<P>
   After the interview, a spent-looking Galvin climbed a stairway
to ground level, sat down on a bench and told a visitor that
Silverblatt's interview had seemed more intelligent and focused
than any he'd experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people capable of that kind of insight are writing
criticism or teaching in universities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Silverblatt's career path has taken several more
unlikely twists and turns than are readily apparent. Born in
Brooklyn, and guided toward a deep love of books and literature by
his parents, a dedicated fourth-grade teacher and congenitally poor
eyesight, which limited his other activities (``I liked reading
because when a book was in front of my face, it completely occupied
the field of vision,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I couldn't see''), Silverblatt went to
college at the State University of New York in Buffalo, where he
was taught by and exposed to eminent writers and critic-scholars
like Dwight MacDonald, Leslie Fiedler, John Barth and Robert
Creeley.
</P>
<P>
   In graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, however,
Silverblatt quickly became disillusioned with academic life. ``I
sensed a love of theory and scholarship, but not the kind of crazy,
irrational love for the material that I felt,'' he says. He dropped
out and moved to New York, where he found the publishing world too
insular and too peopled with young trust-fund-subsidized editors
for his taste.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 he moved to Los Angeles to try screenwriting. He got
some scripts optioned but supported himself mainly by working in
bookstores, as a publicist (one of his clients was Sherwood
Schwartz, creator of ``Gilligan's Island'' and ``The Brady Bunch'')
and as a development executive for a movie production company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, at a small dinner party for a client, he was overheard
discussing the work of the Russian writer Osip Mandelstam by the
general manager of KCRW, Ruth Seymour. Ms. Seymour invited him to
start the local show that became ``Bookworm.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next five and a half years he did the show as a ``public
service'' (his words), subsidizing it totally with his earnings. In
1994 he began receiving a continuing grant from the Lannan
Foundation, a Santa Fe-based family arts fund, which allowed him to
hire a two-person staff and quit his other jobs to work on the show
full time.
</P>
<P>
   These days, faced with as many as 50 new books a week _ he
attributes his ability to devote so much time to reading to the
fact that, not having a driver's license, he travels mostly by bus
and in the back seats of friends' cars _ he is able to accommodate
only one in 40 of the authors who ask to be on ``Bookworm.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice is sometimes recognized in public, particularly in
upscale bookstores, and on one glorious day recently he was
approached by a regular listener: Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the equation, both major public radio
networks, deciding that the show's focus is too narrow, have
continually declined to subsidize or distribute ``Bookworm.'' But
no matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, the day this show started was the day my real life
started,'' says Silverblatt. ``I'll keep on doing it as long as I
can.''

PERSEVERANCE IS A VALUABLE TEXAS AGGIE TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember the fire. The searing flames were intense. Even from
a half-block away, it felt like an oven set on broil. The flames
soared to the peak of the towering stack of logs before leaping
into the darkness and exploding like fireworks. It was an awesome
sight.
</P>
<P>
   That sight was worth the trip from Waco down lonely Highway 6 to
the educational oasis affectionately known as Aggieland in College
Station, Texas. One of my dearest friends from high school had
invited me to come spend the weekend at Texas A&AMP;M and participate
in all the festivities surrounding their big football rivalry with
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried to persuade my buddy, Denise, to come to Baylor with
me, but she planned to major in engineering and Texas A&AMP;M was the
only place for her. It was our freshman year of college and we were
still making the adjustments to our semi-independent lives. I was
looking forward to being with a familiar face even if it was in an
unfamiliar place.
</P>
<P>
   I remember that weekend fondly even though I was being yelled at
much of the time. I hadn't been on the campus five minutes when I
tried to take a shortcut across a grassy knoll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey you, get off the grass! Can't you read?'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, there was a sign right by my feet.
</P>
<P>
   Denise later informed me that it was some sort of Aggie
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Then at the game, I committed the ghastly offense of sitting
down during the second quarter. We'd been standing since the game
started and I thought it was because everyone was really excited. I
didn't know anything about the student body representing the
``Twelfth Man'' on the football team. It was another Aggie
tradition, Denise said. So I stood for the entire game to keep from
embarrassing my friend even though it was unseasonably warm that
day and I was not wearing comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember who won the game, but I think it was A&AMP;M. I met
a lot of nice students whose names I can't recall. Even the layout
of the beautiful campus eludes me. But I do remember the fire.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never seen a bonfire like that, and even now I cannot say
that I've experienced anything remotely comparable. It was a wonder
to behold. I remember turning to my friend and saying, ``You Aggies
sure do know how to build a bonfire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a longstanding tradition,'' she said somberly.
</P>
<P>
   After only a few weeks, she was already part of all those grand
traditions and I secretly admired my friend and her school for
forging those emotional ties so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, tragedy has added an emotion to one of those grand
traditions. The thousands of logs used to fuel the fire came
tumbling down on the hopes and dreams of young students and their
families. In a moment no one ever imagined, the youthful optimism
of a single college campus became the despair of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   My friend is now Mrs. Denise Carter Bowman, successful mother,
engineer and restaurateur. Her husband is the chief of police in
our fair city, Arlington. But after speaking to her this week, I
couldn't use any of those titles to describe her position in life.
She was just sad. Sad for her alma mater and sad for those who lost
their lives following a longstanding tradition.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sad, too. Yet, I know that the A&AMP;M family will persevere
through their pain and learn much from this difficult lesson.
</P>
<P>
   My friend says that's an Aggie tradition.

COMMENTARY: LEAD OR GET OUT OF THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scene (NU)1: &LR;  A few days after the coup in Pakistan, the coup
leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, held a news conference that surely
was a historical first. The Pakistani general said he had had to
mount the coup in order to pull Pakistan out of its morass of
corruption, and to prove that he was up to this task the general
offered to disclose his tax returns. Think about that. When in the
history of coups has a general sought to win legitimacy by offering
to disclose his tax returns? He didn't vow to retake Kashmir or to
nuke New Delhi. He vowed to prove that he had played straight with
the Pakistani IRS.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scene (NU)2: &LR;  I just attended a seminar in Sri Lanka organized
by US AID on competitiveness. The audience was made up of Sri
Lankan, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Nepalese business
leaders. One of the speakers was the former Costa Rican president
Jose Maria Figueres, who gave the audience a spellbinding
description of how Costa Rica got Intel to set up a factory there,
started to bring the Internet into all its schools and successfully
adapted to the Information Revolution. The audience of South Asians
was awed, and when it came to question time, several people stood
up and asked Figueres: ``Would you run for president in my
country?''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on out here? It's this: We are entering an age when
everyone increasingly knows how everyone else lives _ especially
the 30-to-40-year-old educated generation in South Asia. And the
more members of this generation know about wider trends in the
world today, the more they realize that their own leaders don't
``get it,'' the more they are feeling left behind, frustrated and
willing to consider non-democratic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   A 46-year-old Sri Lankan woman banker said to me: ``We have lost
25 years. In 1964 Lee Kuan Yew (the leader of Singapore) came to
Sri Lanka and said Singapore should become like Sri Lanka. We were
his model _ on literacy, on health care, on education. But now
Singapore is the model and (ours is) a destiny we never achieved.
So when people listened to Figueres, they said: `Why can't we get
leaders like this?' Where did he come from? How did he happen? Is
it that people get the leaders they deserve? Have we done something
wrong? We need to take all our leaders who are corrupt and bumbling
and ostracize them, but we never do. There are so many people whose
heads haven't rolled that should have.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, she added, that ``so many people walked out (after
Figueres' speech) and said, `If we don't have that kind of
competence within our own country, why can't we hire it?' One of
the big Sri Lankan businessmen said to me, `I wouldn't even mind
paying his salary myself.' Look at the number of companies that Sri
Lankans or Indians have started (in Silicon Valley), but we don't
have the leadership here to manage our own ship.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pakistani journalist, Anjum Ibrahim, remarked to me about the
coup in her country: ``I was confused. I didn't know whether to
condemn the military or not. On the one side they put in power (a
general) with no qualifications for running a government. But then
there was nothing democratic about how (the previous prime
minister) ruled _ except that he held elections. I'm not ambivalent
about democracy. I'm ambivalent about those who claim to represent
it in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason this is bubbling over now is because the rising
middle classes are becoming less economically dependent on the
state for their livelihoods, but more aware that the state is still
the plug and framework through which they will relate to today's
global economy. If that plug is faulty, if it only works with
bribes, if it has no rule of law or vision of how to succeed in
this world, these rising middle classes will never thrive for long
or protect what they have achieved. So they desperately want better
governance _ any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle classes all over South Asia are getting really teed
off,'' says Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, director of Sri Lanka's
Center for Policy Alternatives. With the exception of India, he
said, many people ``are turning their backs on the electoral
process and speaking now about `partyless democracy.'
Representative democracy in the subcontinent has earned a bad name,
and it has come to a point where the whole notion of it is now
being threatened.''

GLADYS YANG, TRANSLATOR OF CHINESE CLASSICS, IS DEAD AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, N.J.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gladys Yang, a British translator who spent most of her life in
China, translating and promoting Chinese literature for foreign
readers, died Thursday in Beijing, the official New China News
Agency reported. She was 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``After such famous translators from Chinese as Arthur Waley and
James Legge of an earlier generation, Gladys Yang was No. 1,'' said
Perry Link, a professor of modern Chinese language and literature
at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran the gamut _ going as far back as China's classical
period in the 5th century B.C., through later imperial works in the
7th through 19th centuries, and on to the moderns,'' Link said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yang was born in Beijing in 1919 to British parents and
moved to Britain with them when she was 4. She graduated in 1940
from St. Anne's College at Oxford University, the college's first
student to receive a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature, the
official newspaper China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   She married a fellow Oxford student, Yang Xianyi, and the couple
returned to China, where she taught for a while in Chongqing,
China's wartime capital. After the communist takeover in 1949, the
Yangs began careers in Beijing devoted to translating Chinese
literature for the Foreign Languages Press, the magazine Chinese
Literature and other publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mrs. Yang's major translations was ``The Selected Stories
of Lu Xun'' (Foreign Languages Press, 1960) by one of the foremost
Chinese writers of the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yang's relationship to the Communist government was at
times tense, although in general she and her husband occupied a
privileged position.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, Mrs. Yang translated ``Keep the Red Flag
Flying'' (China Youth Publishing House, 1957) by Liang Bin, a
pro-communist socialist-realist novel. She expressed no
reservations about the propagandistic nature of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Like many foreign intellectuals living in China during the
tumultuous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Mrs. Yang was
persecuted and jailed. In the hope of sparing their son from the
worst excesses of the period, the Yangs sent him to London. Once
there, he committed suicide by burning down the house he was living
in.
</P>
<P>
   After the Beijing killings of 1989, when troops moved in to
suppress the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, Mrs.
Yang and her husband gave a joint television interview deploring
the brutality of the government's actions. But they did not leave
Beijing or publicly disavow communism. ``She clung to it the way
someone holds on to a stock that falls in value,'' said Link, who
knew Mrs. Yang. ``She kept hoping that it would rise again.''

 SINGER JEWEL'S SCREEN DEBUT IS A GEM 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madonna, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra
and even Bob Dylan and Fabian have tried it _ with varying success.
Now it is Jewel's turn to test whether the magic that has
catapulted her to fame in the music world translates to the silver
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to disappear into a character so audiences forget
they are watching a popular singer. Sinatra pulled this off some of
the time; Madonna has yet to. In ``Ride With the Devil,'' opening
D &LR; ec. 10 &LR; , Jewel is surprisingly effective at turning herself into
a Civil War widow, who is part Scarlett O'Hara, part Melanie.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Jewel is believable on-screen may be the period
costumes, which are a far cry from the low cut T-shirts, jean
jackets and leather trousers her fans are used to seeing her in.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel, 25, studied acting in boarding school and had an inkling
she'd be able to finesse a movie role. Still, it was no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely like a challenge, but picking such a hard
dramatic role for my first movie was like jumping into the deep end
of the pool,'' she says, sipping tea late in the morning. ``It was
horrifying. Oh f_ I was worried. It took years off my life. At the
same time, I loved the perversity of knowing there is a lot at
stake and if you pull it off, it's good, and if you don't, you're
screwed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her speaking voice has the same lilting, honey tone heard on her
best-selling albums, ``Pieces of You'' and ``Spirit,'' and on her
new release, ``Joy: A Holiday Collection.'' With her oval face and
straight long blond hair, she resembles Helen Hunt if Hunt ate
three square meals a day. Jewel has that rare ability, especially
for a celebrity, of being right there, thoughtfully answering each
question with no apparent desire to be somewhere else. Or maybe she
REALLY &LR;   &LR; is a helluva actress.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing herself to do something outside her field would have
been a lot easier if her CDs weren't all over record stores, she
says. ``That kind of courage pre-fame is real easy, because if you
fall on your a_, who cares? But fame is an odd creature. It has a
life of its own and an influence on you, which is a force to be
reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're famous and you fail, it's in front of the whole
world. The world does not value growth over perfection. People are
very unforgiving and that causes self-censorship. It makes you go,
`Ooh, I got to be safe and stick with what I know.' I knew I might
look bad, and knowing that, I went ahead and did it because
otherwise you die creatively.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Jewel had been looking to make a movie, but the timing had to
be right so it wouldn't interfere with her recording or touring
schedule. Just as a window of opportunity opened, her agents were
approached by Avy Kaufman, casting director for ``Ride With the
Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way over 40, so I didn't know who Jewel was,'' says Ang
Lee, the film's director, who is best known for ``Sense and
Sensibility.'' Kaufman sent him Jewel's music videos as well as a
tape of her playing Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz'' as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Jewel, Lee made it clear she would have to take
acting lessons for three months before any casting decision was
made. ``I was very frank with her. She was so devoted to the
possibility of acting in this movie, she agreed to the lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   This proved to be more stressful than she thought. ``I was
touring and taking acting lessons in between,'' Jewel recalls. ``I
had some days where I went, `I'm going to be all right' and other
days where it was like `Uh, I can't get out of bed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lee suggested she take up tai chi as a way to relax and get into
the role. ``He could see I wasn't real grounded at that time of my
life. All of a sudden, I was famous and I had a stalker during that
time and I was working with this brilliant director, who really
intimidated me. The tai chi was just to get me back settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that going on, Lee's instincts told him Jewel was
up to the role. ``Her part doesn't require her to carry the movie,
so I didn't think it was such a big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a risk with a payoff if her legion of fans, most of
them young women, rush to see her in ``Ride with the Devil.'' The
film stars Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich, who are not hot enough
yet to get people into theaters on the strength of their names.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the film's screenwriter, James Schamus, points out:
``Being a star in one area is no guarantee of ticket sales in
another.'' He admires Jewel for her willingness to ``completely
erase her rock star personality on the set. She worked like a
maniac on this movie. You don't see people work like that too
often.''
</P>
<P>
   The first few weeks on the set, ``Jewel was pretty raw,'' Ulrich
says. ``She didn't know what was going on when it came to
technique. She didn't even know what a mark was,'' he adds,
referring to where actors are supposed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   But she caught on quickly. Ulrich thinks it helped that she
seems in some ways like her character, Sue Lee, a shy Southern
woman who comes into her own when she has to fend for herself
during the grueling war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil War widows became quite notorious by 1862-63,'' Schamus
explains. ``Because they were sexually aware, they realized that in
order to survive and get through the battle, they really had to go
out there and attract husbands. There was a kind of sexuality and
assertiveness these women had going after their next guy. They
began to address men in public and introduce themselves _ all
things that were quite shocking at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel nails her character's sexuality, and there were other ways
in which she could relate to Sue Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on the land. I was raised to be feminine, but not
in the kind of contrived way where you are playing a game of
seducing men,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have never lost a husband; I have never slept with a man
who ended up dying right afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   She also never wore a corset before she had to squeeze into one
for her role. Like all self-respecting 19th century women, Sue Lee
wouldn't have gone out without one. ``That was a hard part about
the movie for me. The corset was so tight, I couldn't breathe when
I bent over. I wanted to die,'' Jewel recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else about making a movie appealed to her, however,
and she would like to do it again, although writing and singing
songs takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music allows you to talk directly to people. No other art
medium does that. I can actually tell people what I think. I can
get in front of kids and say, `Don't lose hope' or `Gee, I feel
like s_' ''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, she would like to be in a contemporary film. But she
isn't rushing into anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nice things about the position I'm in is that I
don't have to be an actress,'' Jewel continues. ``I don't need the
money, so I don't have to take parts I don't want. It's a purely
creative endeavor. That's a luxury most actors don't have. I can
wait and be real picky.''

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS SHE IS STICKING TO HER QUEST FOR SENATE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton declared Tuesday
that she is sticking by her plan to run for the U.S. Senate from
New York, making a renewed commitment to run after some fellow
Democrats had questioned her intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she will move after Jan. 1 to the $1.7 million
five-bedroom home the Clintons purchased in Chappaqua, N.Y., once
the U.S. Secret Service deems security preparations are complete.
</P>
<P>
   She pledged to ``scale back'' her duties as first lady in order
to focus ``more and more on my campaign and becoming a candidate,''
adding that she would remain in New York and only go to Washington,
D.C., ``from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brief rally at the headquarters of the United Federation of
Teachers, union president Randi Weingarten stood by Clinton at a
podium, urged her to run and then asked, ``Is it yes or is it no.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied, ``I believe if we work together we really can
make a difference for the children and families of New York _ so
the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later denied that her comments two days after returning
from a 12-day foreign trip were an effort to recover from campaign
missteps or to quell Democrats' criticism of her part-time Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just became convinced that this is a campaign that needs to
be made,'' Clinton explained at a news conference. ``It's time to
get moving and get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she would formally announce her campaign platform
after Jan. 1, with what aides described as a round-the-state
barnstorming campaign trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to face New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
serving in his second term of the predominantly Democratic city.
Both Clinton and Giuliani have already completed the legal
requirements of the Federal Election Committee to qualify as full
fledged Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During her 45-minute news conference, Clinton twice defended her
decision to remain silent earlier this month in the face of what
she dubbed ``false, baseless and inflammatory'' allegations by Suha
Arafat, wife of Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat, that Israel has
used poison gas to quell rioting by Palestinians on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who sat through Arafat's presentation and later kissed
her on both cheeks, said Tuesday she could have imperiled Middle
East peace efforts if she had immediately challenged Arafat's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she remained silent because she did not want to
stir an ``international incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's failure to immediately rebuff criticism of Israel's
alleged use of poison gas voiced in her presence had provoked
criticism here in New York where Jewish voters are an influential
constituency in New York state politics. GOP allies of Giuliani
have aired campaign ads showing Clinton's silent reaction to
Arafat's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also defended the New York Democratic Party's decision
to use so-called party building campaign contributions on behalf of
her Senate campaign in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that her Senate campaign against Giuliani would be
``hard fought'' and inevitably underscore contrasts in the two
candidates' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton added: ``At the end of the day, I will be asking
voters to vote for themselves, not either one of us. I think if
people vote for themselves it will turn out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments came amid widening speculation that she might
withdraw from the Senate race because of the controversy over her
meeting with Arafat and earlier missteps in her campaign, the first
by a first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has traveled to 35 New York counties over the
past four months to listen to voters and that she was ``excited''
by what she had heard.
</P>
<P>
   She later conceded that Weingarten had tipped her off about the
question regarding her political intentions. Her meeting with the
teachers union had been scheduled by her campaign aides on Monday
after her return from a trip to the Israel, Jordan, Turkey and
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democratic Chair Judith Hope, Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., have voiced criticism over
Clinton's part-time campaign and urged her to shed the competing
duties of first lady in order to shift her entire attention to
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made her announcement just hours after State Sen. Carl
Kruger, a Democrat from Brooklyn, announced support for Clinton's
expected Republican rival on the steps of New York City Hall
earlier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had not told her husband, President Clinton,
nor the couple's daughter, Chelsea, of her decision to move to New
York because they were visiting Kosovo on Tuesday. Clinton added:
``But I don't think they will be surprised.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was the demise of affirmative action that got
Daniel Garza, the son of an immigrant construction worker, into one
of the best public universities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Garza's good grades in a small Hispanic town at the tip of
Texas, combined with his low standardized test scores, probably
would not have met the threshold for admission to the increasingly
competitive University of Texas here. After an appeals court threw
out the university's admission system favoring minorities in 1996,
Garza's chances seemed even more remote.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a new state law guaranteeing the top 10 percent of
graduates from every Texas high school a spot at the public
university of their choice, Garza, 18, is now suffering through
calculus and chemistry as a freshman here at the state's flagship
institution.
</P>
<P>
   He is a bit player in Texas' bold experiment, which has already
been imitated by California and Florida and is being closely
watched by universities nationwide as they agonize over how to
enroll more black and Hispanic students in the face of mounting
challenges to affirmative action. Two years into the startlingly
simple top 10 percent program, the racial mix on this campus has
been restored to what it was under affirmative action, and the
university has also been able to attract students like Garza from
impoverished rural and inner-city schools that rarely sent
graduates here before.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the program's success in attracting those minority
students depends in part on the continuing segregation of the
state's high schools; it has also helped rural white students who,
historically, had been hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does allow us to do a better job, a much better job,
actually, of serving all of the state's communities,'' said Larry
R. Faulkner, the university president. ``If we can achieve ways of
building representative student bodies without the use of race
explicitly, we're healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the strongest opponents of racial preferences _ both on
campus and around the country _ have little criticism of the top 10
percent rule, and some of affirmative action's ardent advocates
favor the current program because it eliminates suspicion that
students may have been admitted solely on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush backed the program and his brother, Gov. Jeb
Bush of Florida, also a Republican, has proposed automatic
admission for the top 20 percent of graduates in his state; in
California, where affirmative action was outlawed by a statewide
vote, Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has promised slots at the
University of California _ though not any particular campus _ to
each high school's top 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, black and Hispanic enrollment has increased under the
new rules at most of the state's selective institutions, though
Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station has lost minority
representation, a trend that began before the death of affirmative
action. On the Austin campus, the state's most prestigious, some
thorny questions remain: How will students from the state's weaker
high schools fare in the rigor of the university? What happens in
small private high schools or competitive suburban ones, where
students with stellar College Board scores do not make the top 10
percent? With race-based scholarships also deemed illegal by the
court, will the university lose top minority students to
out-of-state schools and private institutions?
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 percent rule also does nothing for graduate programs
like the law school, which remains overwhelmingly white. In
addition, it has squeezed the number of slots for foreign and
out-of-state students, who help build a university's international
reputation, and swelled total enrollment to 49,034, making the
University of Texas at Austin the largest campus in the country,
struggling to find space for its students.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since top 10 percenters are admitted without regard to their
scores on standardized tests _ which all applicants must take _ the
Texas system may help answer the long-debated question of whether
grades or tests are better predictors of college performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not have the academic preparation, they may not have
four years of math,'' acknowledged Arthur Allert, assistant dean
for undergraduates at the college of business. ``But when they come
in they have that go-getter attitude. Four years of performance in
high school over four hours of performance on a test, you get
something different. You get someone who thinks of themselves as
being at the top of their class.''
</P>
<P>
   To address academic deficiencies, administrators across the
university are scrambling to create special programs of small
classes and extra counselors. One, the Partnership for Excellence
in the Natural Sciences, or PENS, gives 50 pre-medical students
whose SAT scores are typically 200 points below the university
average their own sections of calculus, chemistry and biology, plus
a study-skills seminar and peer mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids, without intervention, only one in 10 of them will
go on to get a degree and make it into the health professions,''
said David Laude, the director of PENS and the undergraduate dean
for natural sciences. ``If I see even a hint of a student having a
problem, if somebody does badly on a quiz, I call them into my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. on a recent Wednesday, Laude was barking into the
microphone clipped to his tie, flashing a red laser pointer on the
Web site projected overhead and strolling the aisles of the
500-student lecture hall like a talk show host, calling on
anonymous students as ``guy'' or ``sir'' or ``ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, he was scrawling the same equations on the
board, prepping freshmen for the same quiz on redox reactions, but
his patter _ his very breathing _ was slower as he scanned the room
of PENS students, meeting many eyes. ``Laurie, what's a
titration?'' he asked. ``Carrie, what's the conservation of
matter?''

 &HT;    For Georgia Tech's O'Leary, mediocrity is not acceptableBy J.C.
Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the middle of the college football season. But
George O'Leary was like a kid at Christmas. One with a brand-new
toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come see this,'' O'Leary commanded, eyes glued to a
wide-screen TV in his office, remote in hand. ``Look how neat this
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The object of fascination for Georgia Tech's coach was a
recently arrived digital video system. It allowed O'Leary to call
up any facet of any game played by the Yellow Jackets or opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Want to see all of Duke's special teams' plays?
</P>
<P>
   Need a look at Virginia's short-yardage defense?
</P>
<P>
   How about plays the Jackets have run on third-and-long?
</P>
<P>
   All there at the click of the remote, and O'Leary was in pigskin
heaven. He could have stared at that screen all day and all night.
Sometimes, he actually does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love this stuff,'' O'Leary said. ``Not all coaches
do. Those usually are the ones who don't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing draws O'Leary's affection more than preparing his team
for a game. Unless it's taking on rival Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd play those guys on the moon if I had to,'' he said in the
preseason, when the subject of possible ACC expansion brought up
the question of conflicts with non-conference games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets (7-3) won't have to head toward outer space.
On Saturday, the Bulldogs (7-3) visit Tech for their annual grudge
match.
</P>
<P>
   Tech goes into the game with mixed emotions about the '99
season. A year that started with high expectations _ dimmed hardly
at all by a six-point loss at Florida State _ came down to earth
with losses to Virginia and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a win over Georgia this weekend would be the Jackets'
eighth for the season _ an acceptable record, considering injuries
to two starting tailbacks and two-thirds of the linebacker corps.
</P>
<P>
   That O'Leary has revived the program to the point that it is
back in contention in the 106-year-old series against Georgia is
testimony to his coaching, recruiting and attention to each and
every little detail.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's 21-19 win by Tech broke a seven-year losing
streak. Jackets fans insist that only a controversial late call
against Tech in `97 has kept it from being a two-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech has accomplished that only twice in the past 30
years. They will be trying again Saturday to do it, and one thing
is certain: Tech will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Wilson, the Jackets tight-ends coach, is a 32-year college
coaching veteran who has worked for Hank Stram, Lou Saban and Homer
Smith. He says O'Leary has all the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, he's exceptionally well-organized in every facet of
being a head coach,'' said Wilson, 59, ``from planning practices to
implementing game plans to knowing what's happening on both sides
of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very tough-minded, and he doesn't waver. Peaks and
valleys don't disturb him too much. Whether it's the high of a
victory or the low of a loss, he's going to stay the course.''
</P>
<P>
   When O'Leary took over for Bill Lewis late in the 1-10 campaign
of 1994, his plan was to instill discipline and increase the
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a coaching change, there are usually attitude
problems or a lack of talent,'' O'Leary said earlier this season.
``Here, it was both.''
</P>
<P>
   On the disciplinary front, O'Leary immediately raised
expectations. Mediocrity would not be accepted. That went for
coaches as well as players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's demanding, very much so,'' Wilson says. ``There's no
slack cut for anybody. He expects a top performance from each and
every coach, in each and every way.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary likes to say that ``all coaches have pencils, and that
next guy is just as sharp as anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   What's given Tech an edge, besides being well-prepared, is
O'Leary's ability to get the most out of available talent. While
that level is far superior than when O'Leary took charge, the
Jackets overall talent is no better than third- or fourth-best in
the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tech has won 17 games over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I've worked with some excellent on-field coaches,
and some that were exceptional managers of people,'' Wilson says.
``George is great at both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical, knowing what players, or what coaches, you have
to push a button on _ while other players or coaches you know not
to speak as harshly to. How you approach them is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   One of O'Leary's best players, quarterback Joe Hamilton, says he
understands his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, I love the guy,'' Hamilton said, ``because I want
to go out there each day in practice and be the best and work hard.
That's what he demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he can be (hard-nosed),'' Hamilton said, ``but that's
because he wants to win and get everything out of every player.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of O'Leary's resurrection plan was to raise Tech's
profile with high school coaches around the state. It has worked so
well that 58 players on the roster, including walk-ons, are from
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing that Tech is a state school with strong
academics and a great football tradition, just like Georgia,''
Butch Brooks says. Brooks is a veteran high school coach whom
O'Leary hired last year as director of high school relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech is not just some place stuck in Atlanta,'' Brooks said.
``It belongs to the entire state. We're getting noticed, now.''

AUSTIN, Texas: of matter?''

   To date, PENS students have an average chemistry grade of 2.63,
slightly below the 2.7 average in the 500-student lecture, yet far
above the 2.1 of the students in the larger class with comparable
College Board scores. But there are only 50 seats in PENS
classrooms. Small classes are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody would benefit from this kind of attention,'' Mary
Ann Rankin, dean of the college of natural sciences, said with a
sigh. ``We just can't afford it.''

   The overall percentage of freshmen at the university who
graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school has changed
little, up to 43 percent this year from 41 percent in 1996. But
some of the more popular colleges have been overrun: 87 percent of
the business majors who started this fall are top 10 percenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the volunteer work, the extra-curricular activities _
all the stuff they ask you to do,'' said Mike Dayon, a freshman
from El Paso who ranked No. 25 out of 170 at his Catholic school
and was accepted into the university, but not into his choice
major. ``You're not in the top 10 percent, you're not in the
business school.''
</P>
<P>
   Urton Anderson, the undergraduate dean for business, has fielded
scores of calls from angry parents and counselors of those he has
rejected, but he said the companies that recruit on campus want the
minority students enrolled through the top 10 percent rule.

   As word of the new system filters across the state, it is
changing the entire college application process. For those in the
top 10 percent, it has reduced the stress enormously _ many apply
nowhere but the University of Texas at Austin now, and forego
repeat attempts at the SATs.
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Norris, 17, a senior at Clements High School in
fast-growing suburban Houston, it has done the opposite. Norris
makes A's and B's, but hovers in the top 30 percent at Clements,
which serves an upper middle-class community whose highest-ranked
students typically go out of state for college. He got a cumulative
score of 1240 out of a possible 1600 on the College Board, and is
sharpening his No. 2 pencils for a retest next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it's not fair,'' Norris' father, Warren, said as
they took the campus tour here one day last week. ``Obviously,
we've got to try a little harder. I've got a couple of friends in
the state legislature I might have to prevail upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has there been a bigger turnaround than in the
underprivileged schools where few graduates in the past ever went
on to attend the University of Texas. Now, when university
administrators visit, they can guarantee admission to 10 percent of
the seniors in the room. To replace race-based financial aid banned
by the court in 1996, the university created the Longhorn
Opportunity Scholarships, which cover tuition and are reserved for
students in underrepresented high schools (most of which are
overwhelmingly black or Hispanic).
</P>
<P>
   This year's freshman class includes 115 students from 49
Longhorn scholarship schools; next year, the program will serve 64
high schools plus several community colleges. University alumni,
through a private organization, have also raised more than $4
million for minority scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the money, and I was like, well, maybe they do really
want me,'' said Rochelle V. Brown, a black freshman from Houston
who was offered a Longhorn scholarship.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On campus, racial tension still flares over affirmative action,
but students rarely talk about the top 10 percent rule. Its impact
is subtle: Phillip Uri Treisman, a popular calculus professor, sees
it in the homemade salsa that small-town Hispanic students, used to
bonding with their teachers, bring him after class.
</P>
<P>
   Treisman, who runs a research center on campus devoted to
improving education in kindergarten through 12th-grade, said he can
also see a change in the attitudes of administrators, who now have
a vested interest in the quality of the state's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, it was clearly a controversial issue.
There were senior administrators who just didn't feel comfortable
with the university getting involved in K-12,'' he said. ``Wow, has
that turned around. Now, there's, `How can we do this, how fast,
what do you need?' ''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The most profound impact of the program, of course, is on the
top 10 percenters themselves, students like Garza, who is the first
in his extended family to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked No. 52 in his high school class of 850, Garza is now
hoping to major in engineering, but is teetering on the brink of
failure in two required courses. Even his roommate, Emilio Alvarez,
who was the valedictorian back in Lajoya, the town of 3,567 where
both grew up, is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stuff I should have done in high school, I'm doing
now,'' said Alvarez, who found his year of high school calculus
covered in three weeks of Treisman's class. ``A lot of the other
kids, they know stuff already. It's a humbling experience. I never
felt slow or dumb before.''
</P>
<P>
   When Garza got a 68 on a test recently, he was afraid to call
home. In Lajoya, a tight-knit community where the few who pursue
higher education typically stay nearby, the young men get teased
when they wear their University of Texas Longhorn caps and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back where we're from, we were always ranked real high, we
were always in honors,'' Garza explained. ``You still feel a lot of
pressure. That you can't fail.''

SITING OF MOSQUE DIVIDES NAZARETH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ Through windows cracked during anti-Christian
rioting by Muslims last Easter, Amer Nijim looked out Tuesday as a
crowd of some 5,000 triumphant Muslims celebrated the laying of a
cornerstone for a new mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all used to live together here, Muslims and Christians as
one,'' said Nijim, 40, a Greek Orthodox Christian who eyed the
celebrations through the splintered windows of GB Tours, the travel
office he manages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest part of all of this is the deep divisions it has
left behind,'' he added over the sound of blaring Muslim music and
bursting firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the planned construction of the mosque in
the town where Jesus lived as a boy, next to the Basilica of the
Annunciation, one of the holiest Christian shrines, has not only
divided the city's Muslims and minority Christians, but has set off
a bitter dispute between the Vatican and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican said Tuesday that Israel, by allowing the mosque to
be built, was ``laying the foundation'' for division. Israeli
officials responded that the Holy See's protests were part of
Christianity's history of ``finger pointing'' at Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In one of several strange alliances produced by the episode,
Yasser Arafat's mostly Muslim Palestinian Authority has backed the
churches, while Israel is being accused of favoring Muslim
militants who wanted the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil has cast a cloud over hopes for a visit to the Holy
Land by the pope in March to highlight interfaith understanding as
Christianity enters its third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old dispute reached a milestone Tuesday when Muslim
leaders lifted a green velvet prayer cloth from the marble slab
that will be the cornerstone of the mosque.
</P>
<P>
   As they unveiled the stone, the crowd chanted, ``With our blood,
with our souls, we redeem you, Shahab el Din,'' referring to a 12th
century cleric who fought the Crusaders and who Muslims believe is
buried in a corner of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began when Nazareth City Hall, led by a Christian
mayor, approved a plan to build a tourist plaza at the base of the
towering basilica, where Christians believe the angel Gabriel
revealed to Mary that she would bear the son of God.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Movement, a growing militant political group, seized
the lot at night and demanded that a towering mosque be built to
honor Shahab el Din. In December 1997, the Muslim group erected a
tent and loudspeakers and began holding daily prayer services.
Riding the issue in elections last year, they won a majority of
Nazareth's City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Last Easter, the roiling political and religious battle turned
violent as rioters vandalized and looted dozens of Christian
businesses. A hail of rocks crashed through the windows of Nijim's
tour office, directly across from the roughly half-acre lot that is
the focus of all this trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, trying to mediate the dispute, resolved to give the
Muslims one-third of the land to build a smaller mosque and the
municipality the rest for a smaller plaza. It is clear the plaza
will not be built in time for the coming millennium celebrations,
but some city officials hold out hope that the plaza will be ready
in time for the pope's planned visit.
</P>
<P>
   This week the dispute climaxed in an historic protest and a
unique show of solidarity by the often fractious Christian
denominations here. The Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Syrian,
Armenian, Anglican, and Coptic churches came together to close the
doors of 35 of Christianity's most revered shrines in a two-day
protest that ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders said that the protest was directed at Israel's
decision to permit construction of the mosque and that Israel had
tolerated lawlessness by a fringe group of militants and then
rewarded them with a mosque. Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the Latin
patriarch of Jerusalem, called it an ``Israeli policy of divide and
rule'' aimed at pitting Arab Muslims against Arab Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a similar theme, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls
said Tuesday, ``I believe that political authorities in this case
have a great responsibility, because instead of favoring unity,
they create the foundation to foment division.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Foreign Ministry reacted angrily. Spokesman Aviv Shiron
accused the Holy See of playing ``a time-honored game of finger
pointing in the wrong direction. It is strange that when there is a
problem between Muslims and Christians, they blame the Israeli
government.''
</P>
<P>
   As fireworks lit the night sky Tuesday night, Nijim and other
Christians hurried home to avoid the Muslim street celebrations.
Loud music blared the lyrics, ``Come let Islam show you the way,''
and young men shouted, ``Allah akhbar,'' or ``God is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Nijim shook his head and said: ``This used to be a place where
everyone got along. You should have seen it then.''

HOUSE KILLS RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ANTI-MUSLIM BIAS, OUTRAGING

 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The resolution seemed innocuous enough.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of members of Congress, hoping to show good
will to Arab-Americans and the nearly 5 million Muslims in the
United States, sponsored a resolution condemning ``anti-Muslim
intolerance and discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   It called on Americans to acknowledge that ``organizations that
foster such intolerance create an atmosphere of hatred.''
Law-enforcement agencies, it said, should avoid the sort of ``rush
to judgment'' that followed the 1995 terrorist bombing in Oklahoma
City, when Arab-Americans complained of violent harassment after
they were initially singled out for suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, an Orthodox Jew who was
among the resolution's Democratic sponsors, said that it was time
to guarantee ``the promise of our nation's ideals'' to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final days before Congress adjourned last week, at
least two Republican lawmakers decided that the resolution had to
be rewritten _ gutted, its Arab-American supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   And then the resolution, seemingly on the verge of passage in
the House, was pulled off the calendar, killing it at least for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the revisions made last week: The reference to Oklahoma
City was removed entirely, as was a clause calling on lawmakers to
``uphold a level of political discourse that does not involve
making a scapegoat of an entire religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase condemning ``organizations'' that promote intolerance
was cut out, as well as a phrase condemning ``hate-inspired
violence.'' Also removed was a sentence expressing regret that
American Muslims ``have been portrayed in a negative light in some
discussions of policy issues'' relating to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American groups say they are outraged by the events of last
week on Capitol Hill, which they describe as further proof of just
the sort of stereotyping and discrimination that the resolution was
supposed to condemn.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, which
helped draft the original bill, said the resolution had been
rewritten to render it ``meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of becoming a salve to heal the wounds of the Muslim
community,'' he said, ``this has become evidence of the problems
that created the wounds in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican lawmakers _ Reps. Henry Hyde of Illinois,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Thomas M. Davis III
of Virginia, one of the resolution's original sponsors _ insist
that the changes were not intended to water down the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   They say the revisions were instead supposed to remove what they
described as unnecessarily inflammatory phrases that might have
doomed the resolution if there had been a House vote, and to bring
the wording into line with the vocabulary commonly used in
congressional resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Through spokesmen, the two lawmakers said that the Judiciary
Committee, where the resolution had been under review, had been
contacted by Christian and Jewish religious organizations seeking
changes in the resolution. But the spokesmen, who would not
identify the groups, insisted that the contacts had no effect on
the rewriting of the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestion that we or the Judiciary Committee or any of
the bill's backers caved in to pressure from special interest
groups is absolutely untrue,'' said David Marin, a spokesman for
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Davis, who is generally considered a staunch
defender of Arab-American interests and has a large Arab-American
community in his district, had sought Hyde's help in a
parliamentary maneuver to push the resolution to the House floor
before it adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to craft this in a way that would insure
speedy passage as the session came to a close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman acknowledged, however, that the behind-the-scenes
negotiations over how to rewrite the resolution were a factor in
preventing the bill from coming to a vote before the House last
week. ``We just ran out of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mooney, chief of staff and general counsel of the Judiciary
Committee, said that the protests by Arab-Americans were an example
of ``no good deed going unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the revisions were part of a last-minute effort by Hyde
to get the resolution through the House by eliminating ``some
poorly drafted language.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the reference to Oklahoma City was removed in part
because it might have led to detailed, time-consuming questions on
the House floor about what sort of violent harassment had followed
the bombing, which killed 167 people and was carried out by
antnment militants.
</P>
<P>
   But Arab-American advocates say the decision to eliminate the
reference to the Oklahoma City bombing in the resolution was
especially galling.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the April 1995 bombing, Arab-Americans across
the nation reported a wave of harassment and intimidation by
law-enforcement officers, who initially suspected that Muslim
terrorists were responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma City, a mosque was fired upon in the hours after the
bombing, and a young Iraqi refugee in the final stages of pregnancy
reportedly suffered a miscarriage after the windows of her house
were shattered by men shouting anti-Muslim epithets. Arab-American
and Muslim leaders reported death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma City showed that the misconceptions and stereotyping
of Muslims is something very harmful and dangerous to our
community,'' said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the
American Muslim Council, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Abuzaakouk said he was ``shocked but not surprised'' by what had
happened in the House last week. ``This should not have been a
controversial resolution,'' he said. ``It simply stated the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The actions in Congress came at a especially sensitive time for
Arab-American and Muslim groups, which have complained bitterly
about the conduct of investigators studying the crash of an
EgyptAir jet, and of news organizations covering the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have focused their inquiry on a co-pilot who
uttered a Muslim prayer in Arabic in the seconds before the plane
plunged into the Atlantic, suggesting that the prayer was evidence
that the pilot intended to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He uttered a Muslim prayer in Arabic, as if that somehow by
itself is an indictment,'' Zogby complained. He said the effort to
rewrite the anti-discrimination resolution _ and its failure to win
House approval last week _ had alarmed ``the already beleaguered
Muslim community in America.''

CLINTON URGES KOSOVARS TO FORGET THEIR HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ President Clinton preached tolerance
Tuesday to grateful Kosovar survivors, but the ethnic Albanians
rose to their feet to applaud the man, not the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may never forget the injustice that was done to you. No
one can force you to forget what was done to you,'' Clinton told
about 2,000 people in this southern city. ``But you must try.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to Kosovo and last leg of a 10-day,
five-nation trip, the president was greeted with cheers and
applause by the crowd, many of whom waved US flags and yelled,
``Clinton! Clinton!'' as he approached the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the group was less enthusiastic when Clinton asked them to
put aside anger to try to live in peace with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are not born hating people who are different from
them. They have to be taught to hate by people who are already
grown,'' the president said. ``We won the war. But listen: Only you
can win the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50,000-100,000 Serbs, representing about half of
the pre-war Kosovar Serb population, have fled or been forced out
of Kosovo since the NATO campaign ended six months ago and Yugoslav
forces pulled out of the southern province. Kosovar Serbs have
pleaded with international authorities to punish and halt what many
local Serbs call a new phase of ``ethnic cleansing'' by militant
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Urosevac, which Clinton Tuesday referred to by its Albanian
name, Ferizaj, has been a particular source of trouble since the
war ended, as international leaders have sought to keep Serbs from
deserting the town in fear. Only a few dozen Serbs are estimated to
still be living in Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamed of this day, to see Bill Clinton here, and my wish
has come true'' gushed Arta Kastrati, 25. But she said she could
never again live among Serbs. ``You saw it all on TV _ the
massacres,'' said Kastrati, who spent the war inside Kosovo. ``I
don't think I can'' share Kosovo with Serbs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got an equally enthusiastic, if rowdy, reception from
troops at Camp Bondsteel in southern Kosovo, where US peace-keeping
forces are based. As the loudspeaker blared Bruce Springsteen hits,
Clinton and his daughter Chelsea worked the crowd, posing for
photos with soldiers in a holiday mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told that'' Albanian ``children routinely say, `We love
you, United States.' Well, they love the United States because they
love you, because we gave them their freedom back, we gave them a
chance to go home,'' Clinton told the soldiers, who shouted a
rousing ``woo!'' after many of Clinton's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are honored to be with you. We thank you for your
service,'' Clinton added, before heading into the dining hall to
consume two plates of Thanksgiving food.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on a theme of his trip to Turkey, Greece, Italy,
Bulgaria and Kosovo, he gave the troops a short sermon on ethnic
harmony. ``The No. 1 problem in this whole world today is . . .
racial and religious and ethnic hatred and dehumanization. The
power of our weapons could win the military battle in Kosovo. But
the peace can only be won by the human heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Kosovo is beset with problems. Locals complain of
lawlessness, with Kosovo Force, the international military team
keeping the peace, unable to keep gangs and crime under control.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and teachers are not being paid, since there is no local
government yet, and the UN Mission in Kosovo doesn't have the cash
to give them. While US officials say no Kosovar will be without
shelter during the brutal, Balkan winter, many families have yet to
rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the chief of the UN's Kosovo mission, told
Clinton Tuesday that the province needs more police and more money.
About $3.2 billion has been spent or pledged for rebuilding Kosovo,
but much of that money is earmarked for humanitarian projects,
Kouchner told the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial and bureaucratic troubles are overshadowed by
the mutual distrust between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Serbs complain of revenge killings, while Albanians
insist there is no place in a liberated Kosovo for Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is denying there's work to be done,'' said Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright. ``The problems faced here are
terrible.''

 &HT;    To infinity and beyond ... and how
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with so many of Disney's animated movies, the sequel to the
computerized hit ``Toy Story'' was originally headed straight to
video. Be glad the studio realized the error of its ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' a team project from Disney and Pixar Animation
Studios, arrives on the big screen at theaters today with more rock
'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years. It's everything
so many TV sitcoms only wish they could be. Think of the slapstick
of ``I Love Lucy,'' the smart wit of ``Frasier,'' the youthful
wisdom of ``The Wonder Years'' and the cornball charm of ``The
Howdy Doody Show'' all rolled into one and juiced with first-rate
computer tricks.
</P>
<P>
   With its inspired, often hilarious script, a heartfelt new song
_ Randy Newman's ``When She Loved Me,'' sung by Sarah McLachlan _
and downright stunning visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better
than ``Cats,'' it's better than ``Toy Story.'' And like the
original, it's a movie parents should be able to enjoy every bit as
much as their kids.
</P>
<P>
   All of little Andy's lively playthings are back, and so are the
talented stars who voice them. The gangly cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks).
Gung-ho spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Pugnacious piggy bank
Hamm (John Ratzenberger). That lovable, screaming ninny of a
dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn). They're joined by new toys _
perky-as-ever Barbie shows up _ and fresh computerized characters
expertly brought to life by Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   The plot finds Woody kidnapped during a yard sale mishap by toy
rustler Al McWhiggin (Knight), who plans to sell him as the
centerpiece of his prized toy collection. Trapped in Al's penthouse
lair, Woody finds the rest of the collection and discovers his
past: He was the star of an old black-and-white marionette TV show
called ``Woody's Roundup.'' It spawned all sorts of memorabilia,
like Woody record players, Woody lunch boxes and Woody yo-yos.
Plus, he meets his ``Roundup'' sidekicks: Jessie (Cusack), a
gosh-golly yodeling cowgirl with red-yarn hair, and the
white-bearded, old-timey prospector Stinky Pete (Grammer), who, as
the type reads on his original toy box, is a ``Posable, Talking
Doll with Pick Ax.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Andy's room, Buzz, Hamm, Rex, Slinky Dog (Jim Varney)
and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) form a commando unit and head out
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with car chases, video game spoofs, knockout one-liners,
funny homages to ``Star Wars'' and ``Jurassic Park'' and a dynamite
opening sequence (Buzz battling the evil master cylinder Zurg),
``Toy Story 2'' is a rollicking joy ride from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   At some recent early screenings in both Atlanta and Los Angeles,
kids cheered, laughed and gasped during much of the film and
started clapping along with a reprise of the ``Toy Story''
franchise's Oscar-nominated tune, ``You've Got a Friend in Me.''
That's in sharp contrast to the kids who sat in silence while
watching a recent screening of the popular but woefully inferior
``Pokemon: The First Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ``Toy Story 2's'' best extended bit has our streetwise
Buzz (he's learned, for example, that his laser ray is just a
little red light) in a giant toy store meeting up with a brand-new
Buzz Lightyear, who's all hepped up with delusions of space
grandeur. It's a canny throwback to ``Toy Story,'' which had such
great fun playing off the original Buzz's naivete. Here, the second
Buzz is as over the top and endearingly insufferable as ``Star
Trek's'' Captain Kirk.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Toy Story 2'' illustrates Pixar's state-of-the-art
computerized animation. While ``Toy Story'' was a sight to behold
in its day, the original is obviously flat and constrained when
held up to its sequel. ``Toy Story 2'' enjoys much more camera
movement, at times has human characters that look incredibly
realistic and employs greater light control and shading, giving its
frames added dimension and texture. Some one-second frames took 60
hours to construct.
</P>
<P>
   Andy's peppy, slurp-happy wonder of a dog Buster, for example,
has 4 million individual hairs placed on his body. Countless bits
of everyday household dust become a visual treat that deftly
underscores the script's emotional impact. In the giant toy store,
when Buzz walks by towering shelves with box after box of new Buzz
Lightyears, the scene is almost as impressive as ``Gone With the
Wind's'' paramount crane shot of Scarlett O'Hara wandering among
hundreds of wounded soldiers, a tattered Confederate flag flapping
in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   While peppered with jokes, the script infuses the toys with
palpable human emotion. Woody and Jessie both grapple with the
reality that kids do grow up and often discard the toys they once
loved. ``I stayed the same, but she drifted away,'' Jessie whimpers
as she talks of her former young owner.
</P>
<P>
   But as you might expect, Woody ultimately would rather be loved
for a little while by Andy than never to have been loved at all.
``This is what it's all about,'' he says. ``To make a child
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' is what it's all about, too. Both giddily
creative and sweetly provocative, it is pure family entertainment.
It should easily make the kid in all of us very happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation featuring the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen
and Joan Cusack. Directed by John Lasseter. Rated G. 1 hour, 25
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A great kickoff to the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: Its best chances are for screenplay and song
,with a long shot at best picture.

 &HT;    CONGRESS TAKES CREDIT FOR ADDING 'PORK' TO APPROPRIATION BILL
 &HT;    INCLUDES BOXABLE MATERIAL AT BOTTOM OF STORY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aid for the war against the spruce beetle in
Alaska, money for computers in two rural school districts in
Georgia and funds for jazz in the schools in Philadelphia are among
the hundreds of items that Congress passed week in its $390 billion
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate continues to wage over hundreds of these
projects, many of which are specially tailored for constituents in
the districts of key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners:
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, whose sparse population ranks as 48th among the states,
came away with tens of millions of special projects. Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee,
issued a 15-page list boasting of the programs for museums, energy
projects, whaling and fishing for his state.
</P>
<P>
   Selected colleges and universities, especially those in the home
states of key legislators, won special awards. A grant of $9
million was designated for the Medical University of South
Carolina, home to another appropriator, Sen. Fritz Hollings, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen local law enforcement groups will be given special
project funds. That means a new digital radio system for New
Hampshire police, a computer network for three South Carolina
counties, and thermal imaging goggles for the Fairbanks, Alaska,
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Are such projects useful or the result of ``pork'' barrel
spending to secure future elections?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of in the eye of the beholder,'' said Sen. Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, a member of the Republican leadership.
``Clearly you could take exception to some of the projects.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he defended the final result: ``It's sort of, I have to
say, easy to sit off to the side and point to something that's
important to somebody else and label that pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he was satisfied with Georgia's share this year,
especially the salvaging of the endangered Defense Department
contract for the Georgia-built F-22 fighter plane, the deepening of
the Savannah and Brunswick ports, and authorization to buy land
around the Chattahoochee River.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that it was difficult to compare with
Alaska's Stevens when it comes to bringing federal dollars home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always going to be the case,'' Coverdell said, noting
that Appropriations chairmen have followed that practice in the
past. ``They have a pretty big plate at the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge bill has been a prime target of critics, led by Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, a Republican presidential hopeful who
charges that Congress has attached $14 billion in extra,
unauthorized or wasteful spending projects.
</P>
<P>
   That finding tracks the accounting of Citizens Against
Government Waste, a non-partisan watchdog group, which has yet to
include the projects from last week's legislation. Jim Campi,
spokesman for the group, projected that this Congress will break
the all-time record set in 1997 for ``earmarking'' projects for
their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   To some observers, that is further proof of a shift by
Republicans who won the majority in Congress in 1994 by promising
to cut spending. ``What it suggests to me is that Republicans have
adopted the spend-and-elect model of politics,'' said Stephen
Moore, vice president of the Cato Institute, a Libertarian research
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fiscal conservative's standpoint, it's depressing to
see the emphasis on parochial earmarked projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill had critics on both the right and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too much spending,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who
voted against it. ``I couldn't assure my constituents that there
was nothing bad in it.'' Even so, he applauded the grants to some
Georgia school districts, including $500,00 for Berrien and
$250,000 for Crawford county districts to help wire them into the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A more liberal member, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, voted
against the bill because he found no projects for his district,
spokesman Tom Valentine said. ``He saw no reason to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members were more enthusiastic. ``One man's pork is
another man's porridge,'' said Robyn Ridgley, press secretary to
Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., who serves on the House Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston was especially pleased that he was able to win $1.4
million for restoration of Cumberland Island, the historic sea
shore project that had been cut back in the Senate. The final bill
gave the full funding.
</P>
<P>
   BOXABLE MATERIAL FOLLOWS:
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the projects that members of Congress secured for
their home states and districts in the $390 billion budget bill
passed last week includes:
</P>
<P>
   $7.9 million for headquarters and a visitor center for the
Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge in Homer, Alaska
</P>
<P>
   $2 million to combat the spruce bark beetle investation on
Alaska's Kenai Peninsula
</P>
<P>
   $5.5 million to bail out the financially strapped Alaska SeaLife
Center, an aquarium, learning center and research facility that has
been unable to pay its construction costs
</P>
<P>
   $9 million for the Medical University of South Carolina
</P>
<P>
   $3 million to Low Country, S.C., for a three-county police
computer network
</P>
<P>
   $18.6 million for Dartmouth College in New Hampshire for the
National Infrastructure Protection Center
</P>
<P>
   $2 million for the University of Mississippi's phytomedicine
project
</P>
<P>
   $1.4 million to Texas A&AMP;M University for research in deepwater
oil and gas development
</P>
<P>
   $1 million for a Florida youth crime watch initiative
</P>
<P>
   $800,000 to Spelman College in Atlanta to renovate a health care
center for women
</P>
<P>
   $100,000 to the Philadelphia Orchestra's Philly Pops to operate
a Jazz in the Schools program

REV. ROBERT REARDON, 59; OBLATE, PRISONERS' FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS F. MULVOY JR.  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert F. Reardon, who left his native Boston 40 years
ago to become an Oblate missionary and then made his life's work a
no-holds-barred commitment to the dignity of the poor and the
imprisoned, died last Thursday of a heart attack at his residence
in Tabatinguera, Brazil. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston Latin School, class of 1958, Father Reardon
joined the Oblates of Mary Immaculate that same year, was ordained
a priest in Washington in 1968, then was assigned to pastoral work
in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   A man who brought an uncommon zeal to everything he undertook,
Father Reardon found a new home in the teeming neighborhoods of Sao
Paulo where he lived and worked with fellow Oblates for the rest of
his life. He used to delight in telling friends and relatives about
the difference between a parish like St. Mark's in Boston's
Dorchester neighborhood, where he grew up, and one in Sao Paulo:
``About 250,000 more parishioners, and a rich Portuguese language
that I am working hard to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Reardon, known to his colleagues, friends, and
parishioners as Padre Chico, was undaunted by the challenge such an
extended ministry posed. Over the next 15 years, he spent his days
and nights tending to the poor, the sick, and the dying, driven by
an enduring concern for the needs of the have-nots of his vast
parish and a growing despair over the gap between rich and poor in
his adopted land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do, and I can only do my part,'' he once
wrote to a friend in Boston, ``but if I don't work at it every
waking hour, my priesthood will be a mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, when he was home on leave, Father Reardon
seemed on edge. One of the young men whom he had coached in
baseball asked him if everything was okay. ``Everything's fine here
in St. Mark's,'' he said, ``but that's not okay with me. I'm
anxious to get back home, where I'm needed.''
</P>
<P>
   And back home he went the next day, to a new ministry: the
Brazilian prison system. ``He was utterly committed to prisoners
and their needs, and he zealously promoted the cause of human
dignity behind prison walls,'' said the Rev. James Sullivan, an
Oblate priest now living in Tewksbury, Mass. who was his superior
in Sao Paulo 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no place he would not go, no plea he would not make,
if it was in a prisoner's interest,'' said Father Sullivan, who
called their relationship ``brother to brother, from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing decade, Father Reardon was a galvanic force in
South and Central America for the cause of prisoners' rights. From
his base at a 9,000-inmate prison in Sao Paulo, he worked
tirelessly, in Brazil and around the world, with such organizations
as Amnesty International, the Brazilian Bishops' Conference, and
the World Congress of Prison Chaplains to keep a spotlight on the
subhuman conditions in Brazilian jails and police stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Padre Chico's death is a shock and a great loss,'' said Javier
Zuniga, director of Amnesty International's Americas Regional
Program. ``His energy, compassion, and generosity of spirit have
been an inspiration to us. Above all, we will remember his profound
sense of human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Father Sullivan: ``To the poor, and to the prisoners he
cared so deeply about, he was an active saint.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves five sisters and four brothers, all of Massachusetts:
Patricia Nunnally of West Brookfield, Ann of Milton, Christine and
Rosalie, both of Plymouth, and Marguerite Mooney of Brockton;
Thomas of Plymouth, Stephen of West Brookfield, Daniel of Brockton,
and James of Dorchester.

MRS. CLINTON MAKES INTENTIONS (ALMOST) CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It must have been the thousandth time someone asked
her the question _ will she or won't she run for the US Senate? But
this time, Hillary Rodham Clinton gave the jackpot reply: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady added the caveat that she will make ``a formal
announcement after the first of the year,'' but it was the first
time she has stated her intentions with so little ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   Her answer stirred her audience _ a roomful of public school
teachers in Midtown Manhattan _ to a standing ovation that lasted
well over a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration could also _ and was certainly intended to _ put
some juice back into a campaign that has faltered so badly that
some Democrats were wondering if Clinton might drop out of the
race, and at least one was encouraging her to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was speaking about more federal aid for smaller
classrooms to members of the 78,000-strong local teachers union. At
the end of the speech, Randi Weingarten, the union's president,
said, ``We need someone to push these programs. . . . So, is it
yes, or is it no?''
</P>
<P>
   To nervous laughter, the first lady smiled, rose, and said,
``I've been in 35 counties all over this state. . . . I believe
that if we work together, we really can make a difference. So, the
answer is yes. I intend to run.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said later, to questions from reporters, that she will
hire a campaign manager ``in the next couple weeks,'' and move into
her newly purchased house in Westchester County ``as soon as the
Secret Service says it's ready.'' After then, she will spend time
in Washington only ``from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters had been alerted ahead of time that Clinton would give
the long-anticipated answer if someone popped the question.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if her timing was dictated by the missteps that have
marred her campaign lately, she replied, ``I don't believe so. It's
time for me to answer a direct question. . . . It's time to get
moving, get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Democrats, most of whom support her candidacy, have
been disheartened by a series of incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The gravest took place on her trip to the Middle East two weeks
ago, when, at a public forum, Yasser Arafat's wife accused Israel
of firing ``poison gas'' on Palestinians, as Clinton sat and
listened to a translation through headphones. The first lady said
nothing in response, kissed her hostess on both cheeks when she
left, and waited until the next day before issuing a statement
condemning Arafat's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the response was outrage, especially from Jews, who
form a crucial constituency for anyone running for office from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent New York rabbis, who spoke on condition that they
not be named, said Tuesday they have been surprised by the
antipathy that the first lady now inspires among the hundreds of
Jews with whom they have spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who were very enthusiastic about her in the
beginning, very supportive of the causes she supports,'' one of the
rabbis said. ``Now I'd say 70 percent of them are turned off.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rabbi said much the same: ``I'm talking about liberal
Jews who have voted Democratic all their lives. These are people
who are certainly devoted to Israel, but not fanatically. Now just
about all of them say they cannot imagine voting for her.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic political consultant, who also asked not to be
named, called the Arafat incident ``fatal,'' saying, ``It's not
just about Jews. It raises questions about whether she'll stand up
for what she believes in, and about what it is she believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to lay these questions to rest Tuesday. Aides
handed out quotations from several New York Jewish politicians,
including Senator Charles Schumer and former Mayor Edward Koch,
praising her strong support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Koch also cited the remark over the weekend from Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, calling the first lady's visit ``highly
successful'' and saying of both Clintons, ``I wish that we Israelis
will always have such true friends in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton added, during a question-answer period, ``I hear
there are those in New York who wish I'd created some international
incident'' over Arafat's remarks. ``That would not be useful for
the peace process.'' She emphasized she was there in her capacity
as first lady, and had no business ``scoring political points.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she did acknowledge problems, saying she planned to
meet with more people, including Jews, so they could hear for
themselves where she stands.
</P>
<P>
   Jews comprise just 12 percent of the state's electorate, but
they play a decisive role in New York politics. The rule of thumb
is that a Democrat must win 65 to 75 percent of the Jewish vote to
win a statewide contest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest poll by John Zogby, Clinton leads her
likely opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, just 48-42
among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a Republican to get 40 percent of the Jewish vote, it's
very difficult for him to lose,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   The three times Republican Alfonse D'Amato was elected senator,
he won 40 percent of the Jewish vote. Last year, when he lost to
Schumer, he attracted 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, in the Zogby poll, Giuliani leads Clinton 50-43, with
a 3.3 point margin of error.

AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO CARNEGIE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for YOUTHS-BACH-RECITALS)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a lively concert season unfolds in New York, with
major institutions giving belated cram courses in the music of this
century and bracing for a Bach year, it is easy to forget for a
moment the dreary, predictable seasons of a year or two ago. It is
also tempting to assume that under the burbling surface, all is
well.
</P>
<P>
   But two recent Bach recitals suggested otherwise, showing
serious problems with the way aspiring performers are fed into the
system, or are not. In one, a 16-year-old Armenian-born pianist,
Marie Nazar, made a grandiose New York debut, playing the
``Goldberg'' Variations in the 2,800-seat Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Bradley Brookshire, 39, a harpsichordist and
conductor, continued his admirable four-year survey of Bach's
harpsichord works, performing partitas and toccatas in the 270-seat
Weill Recital Hall. Brookshire bore his own costs and, alas, did
not come close to filling Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nazar was presented by Ardani Artists Management, which
presumably helped turn out the decent crowd in Carnegie, seemingly
larded with the pianist's schoolmates and compatriots as well as
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Ms. Nazar, who studied at the Tchaikovsky School of
Music for gifted children in Yerevan and moved with her family to
Princeton two years ago, is prodigiously talented. She has been
performing publicly since she was 8. But she arrived here on a wave
of noxious publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweet 16 at Carnegie Hall,'' a press release trumpeted, going
on to claim that Ms. Nazar ``at 16 is the youngest pianist to
publicly perform the Bach classic.'' Another release went farther,
stating that a performance last year, at 14 (she was actually 15),
in the Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto, ``made her the youngest
musician ever to have performed Bach's masterpiece.'' To all of
which, if it even matters, the only response can be: prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The hype ultimately boiled over in a reference to ``this
potentially career making or breaking evening, an event made more
unusual and dramatic by her vulnerable age.'' It was as if the
young pianist were being made to walk the plank to the unseemly
glee of all around her.
</P>
<P>
   Invocations of Glenn Gould only made matters worse; Gould, after
all, retired from the concert stage prematurely to avoid what he
regarded as the circus of public performance.
</P>
<P>
   All too predictably, Ms. Nazar's performance was not one either
to make or to break a career. It was precisely half-baked, showing
promise as yet unfulfilled. Playing deftly for the most part, Ms.
Nazar marched resolutely from one variation to the next, leaving
little room in which to breathe, savor or, for a listener fighting
the flu, cough.
</P>
<P>
   Whether out of nervousness, sheer youthful energy or Gould-envy,
she favored brisk tempos, some brisker than she could comfortably
negotiate, and thus drew amply on a poise and pluck that enabled
her to recover from slips quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But of thought-provoking interpretation, there was little. Ms.
Nazar scarcely acknowledged major points of arrival, like the end
of the first half of the piece and the inspired restart in the 16th
Variation with a French overture, let alone minor ones, like the
clangorous alternating chords in the 29th Variation, which herald,
as it were, the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nazar is everything but a finished musician. To become one
will undoubtedly take time, though perhaps not much if her needs
are tended to responsibly (away from the glare of publicity, for
one thing, if not out of the public eye).
</P>
<P>
   Brookshire, on the other hand, is a splendidly finished
musician, and he fills a real need in the city's musical life,
though evidently a modest one. An unedifying parade of ``Goldberg''
performances by leading New York harpsichordists a few years ago
left a listener wondering whether any harpsichordist could muster
more than bare proficiency in Bach these days and, more than that,
whether the New York early-music scene, which has long been
struggling, had any hope of survival.
</P>
<P>
   But here, just in time for commemorations of the 250th
anniversary of Bach's death next year, is a harpsichordist of
genuine flair, imagination and humor as well as remarkable skill.
</P>
<P>
   His playing at Weill, as on previous occasions, was everywhere
stimulating and often provocative. The wonderful First Partita,
just before intermission, seemed especially enticing in prospect.
And although Brookshire's rhapsodic treatment of the Courante went
farther than one might have wished in imparting fluidity to the
rhythms, the opportunity to share in this intelligent and
unfailingly artistic exploration of the nature of the music proved
satisfying; indeed, it seemed important.
</P>
<P>
   But then the elements turned on Brookshire. In the quietest part
of the Minuet, which he allotted to the pinpoint upper reaches of
his instrument, a loud thudding sound intruded on the performance,
as though from major construction in the depths of the building. It
persisted until intermission, appearing to throw Brookshire off his
stride a bit in the rollicking Gigue.
</P>
<P>
   The ushers, seemingly unaware of any problem, were beseiged by
angry patrons at intermission. They finally produced an
explanation, later confirmed by a spokeswoman, that for a hall of
Carnegie's stature and professionalism, seemed barely credible:
youngsters playing exotic percussion instruments in the nearby
Kaplan Space and apparently inadequately supervised, had taken them
into a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall, it would seem, owes Brookshire an apology if not
a refund. Better yet, it could serve (italics)its(end italics)
purposes as well as Brookshire's by finally taking notice of the
excellent musician who has been renting itsl hall and
performing in its midst. Why doesn't Carnegie put its formidable
weight behind him in one of its own recital series?

BRADLEY POURING CASH INTO AD CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In the battle for Democratic dominance in New
Hampshire, Bill Bradley has launched an advertising blitz on Boston
and Manchester television, outspending Al Gore by almost ten to
one.
</P>
<P>
   The outlay comes at a time when Gore's poll numbers seem to have
stopped their downward drift and he has been blasting Bradley daily
on Medicare, Medicaid and prescription drug coverage. Bradley has
been largely silent in the face of the verbal onslaught, though he
shot back Monday by calling Gore's commitment to campaign finance
reform ``lip service.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown
University who specializes in campaign advertising, called the
Bradley buy large for this point in the election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley wants to make sure he didn't peak in October,'' West
said, explaining the strategy behind the action. ``I'd be surprised
if Gore doesn't boost his ad buy given the large Bradley buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials contend that they were shocked by the size of the
television buy, saying it is the type of money usually spent in the
last week or two before the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's realized that New Hampshire is it for him and is
putting all his eggs in that basket,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
press secretary. ``They have to win New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Nov. 22 and Nov. 28, Bradley is spending $86,000 to air
commercials on WMUR-TV and $290,600 on Boston television stations,
according to sources in Gore campaign media team. By contrast, Gore
is spending $35,506 on WMUR-TV and he's not now airing any
commercials in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hauser, a spokesman for the Bradley campaign, however,
accused the Gore campaign of ``lying'' about the figures. He said
Bradley is spending somewhat less: $252,000 on Boston television
for that period, and $73,600 in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been airing commercials in Iowa and New Hampshire for
five weeks, while Bradley just launched his first television ad
last week. The new Bradley buy will result in the former senator
spending more overall than Gore in this period _ though how much
more is a matter of dispute between the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Hauser dismissed suggestions that Bradley is worried about his
standing in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any desperation it's coming from the Gore
campaign,'' Hauser said. ``When an incumbent vice president has to
be the first candidate on the air and spend money -- of which they
have less than we do -- demonstrates who truly is worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Gore campaign unveiled its fourth ad of the
political campaign with the vice president reaffirming his
commitment to preserving Medicare and Medicaid, the health
insurance programs for senior citizens, the poor and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fix what's wrong with our health care system by
getting rid of things that are right,'' Gore says in the
commercial. ``Medicaid is a safety net that 40 million Americans
rely on. It needs to be improved, not eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ad never mentions Bradley, it is a direct slap at
the former New Jersey senator. Bradley's health care plan would
eliminate Medicaid and replace it with vouchers to move people into
private health insurance plans. Gore has relentlessly attacked the
idea, saying poor and disabled people would be left making up the
difference between the subsidy and the actual cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunately consistent with the increasing divisiveness
and negativity of their campaign,'' Hauser said of the Gore ad.

CAN PROPS HAVE A LIFE OUTSIDE THE THEATER?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Can dramas that have been stripped of their
actors and actions, stripped of everything but their props,
costumes and sets, still be dramatic? Or, for that matter, can they
be art? The exhibition ``Playing with Fire,'' a survey of the
artifacts of Julie Taymor's 25-year career as a director and
designer of operas, musicals, movies and plays, is a perfect test
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor, whose theatrical repertory ranges from Sophocles to
Walt Disney, is revered for her knockout masks, puppets and
costumes. The opening scene of her Broadway production of ``The
Lion King'' is an eye-boggling index of world puppetry: giraffes
played by men on stilts, gazelles played by leaping dancers with
gazelle-shaped casts on their arms, birds represented by whirligigs
on wires and a cheetah played by a bunraku puppet operated by a
cat-clad master.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that the spectacle makes some people cry. It
is inexplicably moving to see human movement transfigured through
mechanics into animal movement.
</P>
<P>
   But is it still moving when it isn't moving? Sherri Geldin, the
director of the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, where
the exhibition is being held now (it will be at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art in March), suggested that the show does have movement, the
movement provided by the visitor walking through the exhibition.
But I can testify that it is hard to walk quite that fast.
</P>
<P>
   The show, organized by Ms. Geldin and Charles Helm, the director
of performing arts at the Wexner, begins with ``The Lion King,''
plunges into Ms. Taymor's earliest works, produced during the four
years she spent in Indonesia. The exhibition then winds its way
through Ms. Taymor's middle period, including her movie ``Fool's
Fire'' and her music-theater piece, ``Juan Darien: A Carnival
Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the show emerges in the present with Ms. Taymor's first
feature film, ``Titus,'' which opens on Christmas Day. The coda is
a room devoted to her Japanese production of Stravinsky's opera
``Oedipus Rex.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taymor's overflowing ingenuity is certainly on display.
There are her sendups of shadow puppets, butoh puppets, bunraku
puppets, mud masks, body masks, head masks and hat masks. There are
drawings, photographs and artifacts of her take-offs of Balinese
initiation ceremonies, commedia dell'arte, American folk art, Latin
requiem Masses, Day of the Dead festivals, Renaissance theater,
Fascist architecture and Cycladic sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   But walking through these tableaus is not, for the most part, a
thrilling experience, and not just because the flow of the Wexner's
exhibition is awkward, requiring numerous backtrackings. When you
see these unmoving objects, it's clear that Ms. Taymor's gift is
not so much puppets and masks but their choreography, the way she
brings them to life.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the exhibition are entranced by the videotapes of
Ms. Taymor teaching her actor-puppeteers to operate their alter
egos: how to walk like a hyena, how to deal with a monstrously fat
body, how a skeleton should dance, how to give Ariel spirit and how
to make Caliban look stuck in rock. And it's not hard to see why
this is such a draw. When it comes to Ms. Taymor's power as a
director, it ain't the meat, it's the motion.

 COLUMBUS, Ohio: the motion.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the wildebeest stampede in ``The Lion King.'' In the
musical, Ms. Taymor uses a number of tricks to give the illusion of
an endless supply of wildebeests. The wildebeests in the vanguard
of the herd dance behind large, shieldlike masks. Those behind have
smaller masks. Behind all those dancers are small wildebeest models
attached to a spinning roller, and behind that roller is a smaller
one. The backdrop is a vertical screen moving downward with tiny
wildebeests painted on it. The mechanical ingenuity is
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   The Wexner exhibition offers a few artifacts from the stampede
scene, including a shoe-box-size diorama of the whole set and the
wildebeest masks worn by the dancers. It is nice to see that the
masks are cast in lightweight materials, and to see how the
stampede mechanism works, but for some reason all this stuff looks
like it came from a cheesy museum of natural history.
</P>
<P>
   The figures of the lion king, Mufasa, and the lion queen,
Sarabi, suffer, too. The couple _ she in a dress beaded with
shells, he in a gorgeous kaftan _ pose grandly in front of a sun
made of slitted silk that sets blue and rises pink. But something
seems off. In performance they look brilliant, half-human,
half-animal. In the exhibition they look like colonialist gaffes,
representations of Africans as animals. The museum setting has made
all the ethnographic alarms go off.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes Ms. Taymor a great director and designer is
her voracious grazing of theater and puppetry traditions and her
gift for finding what she calls ideographs: the essential, defining
gestures and faces for each character. Ms. Taymor exploits
stereotypes and easy-to-read signs for their dramatic value. But
these are the very things that make an exhibition like this one
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ms. Taymor's mask for Caliban in ``The Tempest.'' She
wanted to find a mask that embodied Caliban's essential plight:
``Here I am stymied in this rock.'' She went to the most literal
interpretation she could think of, and put Caliban in a mud mask
from New Guinea, a hollow stone with eye, nose and mouth holes
carved into it.
</P>
<P>
   The video clip from ``The Tempest'' shows that this was a
cunning theatrical choice, but in the exhibition the mud mask,
which is encased in a square vitrine, has become just another
ethnographic artifact.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most ambitious installations of the show is a replica
of the stage set for ``Fool's Fire,'' a movie based on an Edgar
Allan Poe story about captive dwarfs who take their revenge on some
fat royal villains. The curators have assembled all the blubbery
body forms that were worn by the actors.
</P>
<P>
   But the power of the movie lies in the eerie juxtaposition of
those grossly inhuman courtiers, completely enveloped in their body
masks, and the very human dwarfs. In the museum this contrast is
gone: every character is inanimate. And they are too far away to
examine anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a good way to turn the work of a great dramatist into a
powerful museum installation? The one unqualified success is the
museum's exhibit of the set of ``Oedipus Rex.'' Is it because the
exhibition and the opera relied on the same thing to pull in the
audience: the voices of Jessye Norman and Bryn Terfel? There is
more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the room is a huge Cycladic figure
representing Jocasta. At the other end of the room is the huge
figure of a raggedy Sphinx hanging from the rafters, hovering near
Oedipus as he falls from a red umbilical ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the stage: a rippling, slatted wood floor with a
shallow layer of water running below it and a sheet of mylar
underneath that to make the water look deeper. Just above the
platform hang the costumes of the main players: Tiresias, with eyes
in his hands; Creon, with his accusing, pointing fingers; Jocasta,
with her arms crossed in a maternal clutch; Oedipus, with his arms
outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   These ideographs are not diminished by their stasis. Against the
sound of trickling water and the booming operatic voices, they have
presence. The suspended costumes waiting for their actors, the
silent, headless figures of the chorus waiting for their heads, and
the blackbirds above waiting for their kill are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the transfixing qualities of Greek tragedy are, if
anything, heightened by museumification. Everything here is in
suspense, about to happen. And in an exhibition of retired props,
maybe that is the best one can hope for.

 &HT;    POOR COUNTRIES WAIT OUT TRADE DEBATE OVER BIO-ENGINEERED CROPS
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Nov. 28
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - The richest countries in the world square off next
week over the issue of trade in genetically-modified foods. The
world's poor will be waiting for a few genetically-modified crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Trade Organization (WTO) convenes in Seattle Nov.
30, a chief goal of U.S. negotiators will be to break an impasse
with European countries over U.S. food exports that contain
commodities whose genetic makeup has been modified.
</P>
<P>
   Trade ministers will attend the Seattle meeting of the WTO, the
relatively new world organization in which international trade
issues are negotiated and disputes resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled ``Frankenfoods'' by British consumer groups and opposed
with equal vigor in other European countries, the genetically
modified organisms _ corn, soybeans and other commodities _ are at
the center of a trans-Atlantic row that could cause most trade
disputes to pale in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. business interests have charged that in the absence of
evidence foods containing such commodities are harmful, members of
the European Community violate international trade law when they
restrict imports. U.S. trade negotiators have announced they will
press during the Seattle talks for agreement on ``transparent,
predictable and timely processes'' for dealing with bioengineered
products.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer and environmental groups both in North America and
Europe have mounted vocal campaigns for mandatory labeling of
products containing genetically modified organisms, or GMOs.
Business groups ranging from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the
Grocery Manufacturers of America have responded with condemnations
of ``fear tactics. . . unfounded concerns. . .and misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically unheard in the debate are the people who have the
most riding on the success or failure of genetically engineered
crops.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Africa and Asia, bioengineered crops could
combat hunger, reducing the need for costly fertilizers and other
chemicals and increasing the survivability of crops grown on
marginal lands.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, concern that disruptive ``super weeds'' or
``super viruses'' might emerge from environments altered by
artificially evolved plants and farm animals is most pertinent in
developing countries in which genetic diversity is greatest.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent World Bank conference on bioengineered crops, Kenyan
agriculture researcherG. Ndiritu noted that rich countries
and poor countries approach the question of GMOs from dramatically
different points of view: starvation and profit.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology-derived organisms could reduce the high costs of
agro-chemicals and water, as well as the deleterious effects of
diseases and weeds in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added that ``while Africa's agenda is based on the
urgent needs for technological change to enhance food production
and alter the course of the widespread poverty, hunger and
starvation, the West is driven by market and profit.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same conference, Manju Sharma, secretary of the
Department of Biotechnology of India, said biotechnology offers the
only promise that agriculture will be able to keep pace with
population growth in upcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the 4.6 billion population in the developing countries _
presuming that one billion do not get enough to eat and live in
utter poverty, malnutrition, vitamin-A and iron deficiencies _ is
there any other strategy or alternative pathway?'' she asked. ``It
is biotechnology research which will provide the new tools to the
breeders to enhance the plant capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, decisions about biotechnology are not being made by
India or the countries of subsaharan Africa or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Monsanto's shipping-durable ``FLAVRSAVR'' tomato
was taken to Mexico _ not because the people of Mexico, where fresh
tomatoes are available year-round, needed it _ but so that it could
be grown there and shipped to markets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, those concerned about hunger in the underdeveloped world
will watch and worry when WTO negotiators sit down in Seattle and
the forces of profit and consumerism take over.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, whose Carter Center in Atlanta
has been at the forefront of agricultural development efforts in
Africa, has spoken out against what he calls ``extremist group''
opposition to the development of bioengineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If imports like these are regulated unnecessarily, the real
losers will be in the developing nations,'' Carter said in an op-ed
article in The New York Times in August. ``Instead of reaping the
benefits of decades of discussion and research, people from Africa
and Southeast Asia will remain prisoners of outdated technology.''

 &HT;    For Georgia, playing Tech is culmination of accomplishments,
shortcomings
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia coach Jim Donnan was speaking to the
Greater Atlanta Bulldog Club at the Sheraton Colony Square Hotel in
Atlanta in August. A woman, who obviously had a drink or two
beforehand, stood up and interrupted him with a three-word
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just beat Tech!'' she shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to worry about that, lady,'' Donnan answered
dutifully. ``I hear you loud and clear.''
</P>
<P>
   That exchange succinctly summarizes the Georgia-Georgia Tech
rivalry from the viewpoint of the Bulldog Nation. Whatever
struggles or accomplishments the team might have encountered during
the regular season, all of them become moot Thanksgiving week when
this 106-year-old rivalry is renewed.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the 16th-ranked Bulldogs (7-3, 5-3 SEC) are
disappointed to be dragging three defeats to Grant Field for their
traditional season finale against Georgia Tech. Donnan's preseason
talk, even at that aforementioned meeting, was about how Georgia
was closing the talent gap on the SEC powers and moving ever closer
toward achieving championship status.
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, the Bulldogs were unable to get past SEC Eastern
Division rivals Tennessee and Florida and they were manhandled at
home by an underdog Auburn team to boot. But all that
disappointment will be erased if Georgia can handle the No. 20
Yellow Jackets (7-3, 5-3 ACC).
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, this (game) is definitely big every year,'' Donnan
said. ``Particularly because the last two years, the game has been
so close and decided on the last play of the game. And both of the
team's records are the same since that game last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, last year's game. Georgia Tech came into Sanford
Stadium and used a 14-point run in the fourth quarter for a
dramatic 21-19, come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   These two teams don't play for a beer barrel or an egg bowl or
any other exotic trophy as they do in many in-state rivalries. The
annual prize for the winner of this game is bragging rights, which
Donnan and his players found out last year, is as valuable a
commodity as anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever loses, you've got to hear it for a whole year,'' said
Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter, a Decatur, Ga., native who
originally signed with the Yellow Jackets. ``I don't feel like
hearing it for another whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are coming into the game in a considerably better
frame of mind than they would have been if Hap Hines hadn't had a
career night last Saturday in Oxford, Miss. The senior
place-kicker, whose knock is a lack of range, tied a school record
with four field goals _ including a 51- and a 48-yarder _ to lift
Georgia to a 20-17 road victory over then No. 16-ranked Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The win snapped the Bulldogs' two-game losing streak and
eradicated the memory of a humiliating home loss to Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on where everybody thought we were a couple of weeks ago
and then where we ended up last week and now where we're back to
again, you know, it's (been) kind of an emotional situation,''
Donnan said this week. ``Lots of highs and lows. Our players
rebounding from the (Auburn) game, it really helps that we were
able to win. We were kind of on the mat.''
</P>
<P>
   Said senior center Miles Luckie: ``Last week was a big morale
booster. We were playing a tough team on the road at night. It just
did a lot to lift our spirits. We were down for a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more tangible rewards for this year's winner as well.
To the victor will likely come an attractive bowl bid. The loser
will find itself in third-tier locale.
</P>
<P>
   But neither team has talked much of those such goals this week.
And predictions have also been kept to a minimum as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say,'' Donnan said of the possible outcome. ``
It's an emotional game; you just never know.''

KEITH JARRETT MEDITATES ON MORTALITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Jarrett's new solo album, ``The Melody at Night, With
You,'' begs a listener to think about the relationship between
music and mortality. Jarrett, the Proust of jazz, had chronic
fatigue syndrome recently, and for a while the Internet was
bubbling with rumors of his imminent demise that gained credence
after he canceled several concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The album is dedicated to his wife, Rose Anne, and if one reads
the song titles _ ``I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ``Somebody
to Watch Over Me,'' ``Don't Ever Leave Me'' _ it can be surmised
that she has been an integral part of making Jarrett healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, something has happened because ``The Melody at Night,
With You'' (ECM 1675), a collection of standards, is a radical
departure from Jarrett's expressionist, ruptured-water-main
improvisations. The performance is spare; it relies on melody. It
is elegant, balanced and introspective, and the grandly romantic
gestures of his musical personality are nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The piano, in jazz, has always been the meeting ground between
European and American musical practice, and the beauty of the album
aside, what Jarrett has produced is another important work in the
continuing wrestling match between the two cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett now regularly records pieces from the European canon,
and on the new album it shows. He has taken the accentual
subtleties and the concern for tonal color of the European
classical piano tradition and applied them to jazz solo piano. But
the classical tradition doesn't overwhelm Jarrett's jazz
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In tune after tune he creates scrims of harmony, drawing on
substitutional thinking, one of jazz's harmonic legacies in which a
set of more elaborate chord movements replaces the simpler,
standard harmony of pop tunes.
</P>
<P>
   His playing rarely moves beyond a whisper, using a melody note
with a few supporting notes to give the song its context. Bass
lines sift through pieces. Jarrett's harmonic movement is
beautiful, each chord falling into place, even when he drifts from
the confines of the song. His touch, intimate with fine gradations
of percussion, sprinkles sun through the shade of the ballads. The
pieces are marvels, small chords and melodies quietly wandering to
their logical destination.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett brings an austere sensibility to his musings on
mortality. The funereal celebration, joyful and explosive, so much
a part of jazz culture, isn't present here. And he uses a musical
and dramatic language accessible only to adults, imbuing elegiac
moments with grown-up honesty. Suffering and the awareness of
limitations, even in the fullest life, aren't enough to guarantee a
mature work; at 54, Jarrett has the rhetorical technique to
translate his experience into art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Melody at Night, With You'' is a recording not possible by
a younger musician. In the recording's silences and slow tempos,
and the pianist's desire to make an uncomplicated statement, it is
as if Jarrett has come to the conclusion that certain things work
in music, including melodies, powerful chord movements, silence and
songs of love.

TINY BRADFORD COLLEGE FAILS TO FEND OFF SPRING SHUTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVERHILL, Mass. _ Bradford College, a liberal arts institution
founded when Thomas Jefferson was in the White House, will close at
the end of this academic year, the victim of a higher education
market that more and more squeezes out small schools.
</P>
<P>
   The 600-student college had struggled over the past months to
come up with a plan that would allow it to stay open. As late as
last week administrators thought they had succeeded. But over the
weekend, officials said, it became clear that the money simply
wouldn't last as long as it would take to put that lifesaving plan
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Students sobbed openly at a morning assembly as the head of the
school's trustees announced the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only place I applied, the only place I wanted to
go, and it's still the only place I want to go,'' said Jess Blood,
a junior. ``I still can't believe it's come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the school, its historic buildings and 80-acre
green campus the very picture of a New England college, is a
visible sign of the end of an era when most students attended
small, private four-year colleges close to their homes. In 1960,
more than half the students nationwide attended private colleges;
now, less than 20 percent do.
</P>
<P>
   Students now tend to prefer state universities, seen as better
brand names. More want to go to school in urban areas; small
schools tend to be in smaller towns. And more and more, they are
willing to travel out of state to college.
</P>
<P>
   To stay attractive, small colleges have discounted their
tuitions _ in fact, Bradford was offering three-fourths of its
students some kind of grant. Those students paid an average of
about $12,500, more than half off the so-called ``sticker price''
of $28,000, placing Bradford among the top five best values for
colleges in the Northeast in this year's US News and World report
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   But small schools also have small endowments, which makes them
more dependent on tuition, so they can't afford to discount too
much. Bradford's enrollment fell short by 31 students this year;
that alone was the difference between staying open and closing,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear so much about the Harvard drama, the Princeton drama,
the Williams drama, that we forget that there are a whole lot of
schools out there that are really living hand to mouth, or quite
close to it,'' said Gordon Winston, director of the Williams
College Project on the Economics of Higher Education. ``People are
thinking so broadly geographically that the little local colleges
that could get by fine when there wasn't competition are having a
tough time of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford officials said they wanted to announce the closing
before the Thanksgiving break, so students could talk with their
families about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   But even for them, the decision to close was a relatively sudden
one. They had begun working on the strategic plan since August, and
expected to have the final draft ready in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at things that take two to three years to
develop,'' said President Jean Scott. ``We realized this weekend we
didn't have two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What became clear, as we were looking at the kinds of cuts we
would have to make, is that if we made the cuts that brought us
anywhere close to where we need to be, we didn't think we had a
college left. We're very proud of the tradition here and of the
quality of the education we offer. We were not willing to decimate
it just to stay open.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Sughrue, a television producer who is chair of the board
of trustees, said in a statement, ``As an alumna, I share the
sorrow that everyone on campus is feeling today, but we will close
this college knowing that we have never compromised the value and
integrity of a Bradford degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and the 1996-97 school year, 167 institutions
nationally shut their doors, according to the American Council on
Education. Of those, 112 were private, two-year colleges. Across
the nation, there are about 300 schools like Bradford, four year
colleges with fewer than 750 students. About 15 schools with
similar profiles have closed in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Those who study the higher education market say the number would
be even higher if not for two factors: the booming stock market has
stretched endowments farther, and the number of students is at an
all time high.
</P>
<P>
   Small schools have tried to stay competitive by emphasizing
special programs or qualities. At Bradford, the niche has been
one-on-one attention in liberal arts courses combined with career
experience. The student-faculty ratio is 12-to-1, the average class
size is 15 students. Even Tuesday, students said they could not
imagine a warmer campus environment.
</P>
<P>
   Once a junior college, the 197-year-old school was one of the
region's first coeducational institutions. It became a four-year
college in 1971. It has reached beyond its traditional geographical
boundaries to attract students from 27 states and 35 countries this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Its Web site advertises plans to expand to 750 students, which
officials Tuesday said had been part of the strategy they hoped
would keep the school alive. They had also considered offering a
bachelor of liberal studies, which would allow Bradford to tap into
the large and lucrative adult education market. They considered
aggressively marketing use of the campus buildings, many on the
National Register of Historic Places, for conferences or other
functions during weekends or in the summers. They also thought
about discontinuing more programs, or seeking a large alumni
donation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Scott would not say what the school's debt is, except
to say that it is ``substantial,'' or what the endowment is, except
to say that it was stretched too thin and would just allow the
school to pay off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't going to get the infusions we needed,'' said
Scott, who arrived at Bradford in July 1998 from the State
University of New York at Potsdam. ``What we would have needed was
the cushion to give us several years in order to implement the
strategic plan.''

WANT A BALLOON IN THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE? NO PROBLEM FOR
$200,000 OR MORE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone who goes to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade knows there is a price to be paid: Getting up at dawn to
grab a curbside spot, getting squashed by hordes of out-of-towners,
getting home too late to put the turkey in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's not $200,000 _ or more. That is what companies
say they pay to get their mascots and cartoon characters made into
the super-sized balloons that are the parade's inflatable icons.
Almost all of the big balloons have sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their investment, the companies are guaranteed a
place in the parade for three years, exposure to the eyeballs of
almost 60 million television viewers and a chance to approve the
scripts read by NBC's commentators (and you thought Katie and Matt
were ad-libbing). And there may be other tie-ins; the Honey Nut
Cheerios bee balloon, new this year, is pictured on the back of
cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And in these days of ``product placement,'' ``brand building''
and advertising just about everywhere, the companies get something
that is hard to come by: a commercial that does not look like a
commercial. And for less than the cost of a 30-second spot on the
``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is, of course, a commercial enterprise, but it refuses to
utter a word about anything as crass as money, at least when it
comes to the parade. The event, the company says, is a gift to the
city. And it is obviously an expensive gift _ Macy's has a
substantial staff devoted to the parade (and other annual events,
like the July 4th fireworks over the East River).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless sponsorship pervades the event. John Deere makes
the parade's ``official utility vehicle,'' for example, while the
``all-new 2000 GMC Yukon XL'' is the ``official float vehicle,''
Macy's says.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate partnerships date back decades, to the days when
Walt Disney personally supervised the creation of the Mickey Mouse
balloon, said Jean McFaddin, who has been producing and directing
the parade since 1977. When she took over, the parade, like the
city itself, was a little threadbare; financial support from other
companies helped Macy's spiff things up and keep the parade fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not just any old cartoon character can get into the
parade. The folks at General Mills were worried that their mascot
bee might be too commercial to make the cut, said Liv Lane, a
company spokeswoman. Though when it comes to children's characters,
she added, ``It's hard to find one that isn't, anymore.'' The
company paid about $200,000 to get the bee in the parade, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, Macy's might have rejected it out of hand just a
year or two ago, Ms. McFaddin said. Not enough personality, she
said, adding that recently the bee seemed to have developed a sense
of humor. ``He's really funny, and bees are wonderful _ kids love
bees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it wasn't a dog. Ms. McFaddin works hard to make sure the
parade has lots of variety, and there is already a big canine corps
in the parade this year. In addition to a new version of Snoopy,
there will also be Blue, the star of Nickelodeon's ``Blue's Clues''
and a passion among the preschool set.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Paws.com mascot, which might have been a new
balloon except that the company only decided to participate in the
parade a few weeks ago. And the fact that ``the shape would not
have made a good balloon,'' Ms. McFaddin said.
</P>
<P>
   So the dog, who has no name other than ``the Paws.com
sock-puppet dog,'' will be a 36-foot tall ``falloon,'' which is
what Macy's calls a balloon that rides on a float. And the company
is delighted. ``He'll be cruising down the Great White Way,'' said
John Hommeyer, vice president for marketing at the company, which
sells pet-related merchandise over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Macy's approached Paws.com, Hommeyer said, many companies
knock on Macy's door. If Ms. McFaddin is convinced that the
character is really popular with kids, and that the addition of a
new float or balloon will add some pizazz to the parade, then the
work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's builds all the balloons and floats, in consultation with
the sponsors. First, there is a clay model, then two fiberglass
models and then _ a giant balloon. The new balloons get a trial run
on a field in Hoboken, N.J.; this year it was on Nov. 7, Ms.
McFaddin said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the balloons are clearly corporate creations,
despite their sponsorship. Most children who see Maurice Sendak's
Wild Thing, for example, will think of Max and his trip to ``Where
the Wild Things Are,'' not of Bell Atlantic, which is sponsoring
the balloon.
</P>
<P>
   But the bee is not the only commercial character; the Nesquik
Bunny is making his 12th appearance in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing gurus say that Macy's must walk a fine line if it is
to preserve its own brand, which is the parade itself (some New
Yorkers have been known to call it ``The Macy's Day Parade,''
leaving out the Thanksgiving altogether).
</P>
<P>
   The bee may be a bit much, said Allen Adamson, managing director
of Landor Associates, a consulting firm. ``Real commercial icons
cross over the line of what's wholesome fun and what's product
endorsement,'' he said. Noting that brands have become pervasive in
American life, he added that ``If you're standing at the parade
getting some fresh air and get pitched by a cereal company, that
hits the overload button for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies say it is well worth the cost (if not exactly
cheap at the price).``It is a significant out-of-pocket expense,''
said Ruth Sarlin, senior vice president for brands at Nickelodeon,
which, she said, is paying about $280,000 for the Blue balloon.
``As a promotional expense, I wouldn't call it a bargain, but it is
an extremely good value, a good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   And both the balloons and the parade somehow remain magic. When
she first saw Blue fly, Ms. Sarlin said, ``It was very thrilling.''
So thrilling that even though she has 23 people coming to
Thanksgiving dinner in New Jersey, she said, ``I'm actually going
to the parade for the first time in my life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As Internet retailers crow that the country is about to have
another e-Christmas, brick-and-mortar stores are striking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish list programs,'' first promoted by online sites as the
perternet holiday convenience, are now being usurped by
traditional shopping destinations.
</P>
<P>
   A ``me generation'' update of the bridal registry, the wish list
allows any candidly acquisitive consumer to record gift choices by
simply checking size, color and model number. Dan Swaab, a
29-year-old architect, recently put a black pullover from clothing
outlet Butch Blum and customized picture frame at a store called
Fireworks, among other items, on his list. But instead of signing
up on a computer site, he did so at the University Village shopping
mall outside Seattle, which has been providing forms since the
beginning of November for visitors to fill in as they visit their
favorite boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The completed lists can be dropped off at locations throughout
the complex and are entered into a database (at no cost to
shoppers) that is available both on the mall's Internet site and at
kiosks. Swaab, who said he is familiar with the Internet but ``not
a full bore browser,'' sees no advantage to doing a wish list
solely on the Internet. ``Returns can be such a hassle,'' he
explained. ``This way I've tried everything on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if this holiday season's online sales reach the high-end
predictions of $12 billion, traditional retailers will ring up
about 14 times that amount. But mall merchants need to do more than
hold their own during the season that accounts for much of their
profits for the year. Retailers know they are facing a pervasive
stereotype that real-world holiday shopping is a parking and
service nightmare. So to make sure Americans do not stay home in
front of their computers to buy gifts, stores are beefing up basics
like customer service and displaying innovative incentives that
range from cash to psychics who select something for hard to please
in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season always brings out a creative streak in
merchants, and that has been accented this year by fear. Since the
economy remains strong, the official outlook for Christmas 1999 is
very bullish _ the National Retail Federation predicts total sales
will be about $184 billion, up 6 percent from last year. But the
growth in retail sales slowed in October and November, suggesting
that consumers might finally be satisfying their appetite for DVD
players and pashmina shawls. For merchants who rely on Christmas
foot traffic for a large chunk of the year's sales, the potential
softening of consumer demand has combined with heightened Internet
hype to put them on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Although most merchants and malls will not admit having such
Internet fears for the record, retail analysts say the early rush
to put decorations in the windows and the ever-earlier markdowns
show that retailers on the ground are feeling pressured. ``Mostly
traditional retailers are acting very defensively about
Christmas,'' said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic
Retail, a consulting firm. ``They feel that all the talk on the
Internet is going to drain them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the most interesting retailers to watch this season are
those whose livelihoods are most directly challenged by the Web.
The Web site of Borders Group is a footnote in the battle between
Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com to dominate cyberspace book
sales, but the chain is rolling out holiday ideas to remain
competitive for in-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Borders' stores will hold art-and-crafts workshops
where children can make bookmarks out of construction paper and
crayons. The chain will also hand out booklets of appropriate
quotations for book inscriptions for the wit impaired. For example,
shoppers giving books on personal finance are advised to copy a
quote from Mark Twain, ``The lack of money is the root of all
evil,'' onto the front flap. ``We wanted to be extra resource for
our customers this year,'' said a Borders spokeswoman, Ann Binkley.
</P>
<P>
   Malls, which have the most to lose if shoppers decide to avoid
their crowds and parking headaches, are also being creative. Gurnee
Mills outside of Chicago has set up a Psychic Aid Station, where a
``tried and tested'' clairvoyant, Joanna Ammons, will conduct free
readings to help shoppers with holiday gift ideas every Saturday to
Dec. 18. Ms. Ammons, who claims to have successfully predicted 94
marriages, 74 divorces and eight lottery/casino lucky winnings in
the first six months of this year, only requires the name and date
of birth of a loved one to divine the perfect stocking stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   Other malls owned by Mills Corp. will have ``procrastination
stations'' where Mrs. Claus will be on hand to offer last-minute
gift suggestions and maps, as well as milk and cookies. Naturally,
Santa will be there, too. As an extra incentive to shoppers, the
mall is offering to take photos of children in order to create
postcards that can be sent free to anyone in the country.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even retailers that have been doing well with consumers are
looking for new twists to make their stores more appealing. Target,
the low-price stylish unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., has opted for a
very direct kind of consumer gratification: money. Each day in
November and December, a user of the Target credit card will win
$2,000 as part of a ``2000 'til 2000'' promotion.
</P>
<P>
   And Banana Republic, a unit of Gap Inc. and a formidable
Internet presence itself, is taking its cut at luring the
technology generation by providing services like free cell phone
recharging and a download to Palm Pilot devices that includes a top
10 list of fun attractions near its flagship stores in urban
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the retail chain Electronics Boutique will be
roving the aisles with hand-held cash registers in 30 of its
Northeastern stores this holiday season. Seth Levy, the company's
chief information officer, calls the new system ``a line buster.''
He adds that the devices, which are equipped to take credit card
sales, create a intimate transaction. ``If I can talk to you
face-to-face in front of the register, we feel it is a closer
relationship than if there is a 4-foot block of wood between us,''
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the innovations, improved convenience is a mantra among
the stores this season, as they are determined to combat the
perception that the Internet is less annoying for shopping,
according to J'Amy Owens, president of the Retail Group, a
Seattle-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Toys `R' Us Inc., the big retailer that has taken a
thrashing at the hand of disenchanted consumers in recent years and
faces fierce online competition from Amazon.com and Etoys.com, has
put special effort into polishing its performance for this
all-important season. Starting last June, the retailer sent sales
associates through a training program at the Disney Institute to
teach them to be more responsive to requests and more informed
about the products.
</P>
<P>
   Big department stores, which some say are difficult to shop in
because entering, reaching the gift and exiting can be tiresome,
are again focusing on ``bundling'' _ the practice of choosing
gifts, prewrapping them and putting them out front where consumers
can grab them on the go. For example, Provenance, a vitamin and
herbal retailer newly available on the cosmetics floor at Macy's,
has packaged groups of products in iridescent fabric and given them
names like Peace and Holiday Survival, which contains an enzyme
dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's will be experimenting with a new kiosk technology
that allows visitors to bypass the sales staff and do everything
from search for a product to completing a purchase through the
interactive machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers show that they are not going to roll over and die on
the customer service sword,'' Ms. Owens said. ``The real surprise
this season is that the traditional retailers are going to clean
the clock of the e-retailers. I am predicting a lot of online
flops.''

 &HT;    Historic N.C. town standing pat
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ Officials of America's first town founded by
former slaves have decided to rebuild rather than seek federal
funds to buy out flood-ravaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, historic flooding from Hurricane Floyd breached
an earth levee that was supposed to protect Princeville. Water
nearly submerged the town of 2,100, destroying more than
three-fourths of the 1,004 houses and mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have questioned whether the town founded by
freed slaves after the Civil War should try to rebuild in the Tar
River flood plain. The officials told Princeville leaders they had
to decide whether to seek federal funds to buy out property owners
or ask the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild the levee.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the town's Board of Commissioners voted 3-2 to ask
the corps to repair and improve the levee, at an estimated cost of
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the levee is enhanced, (Princeville) will not be in the
flood plain,'' Mayor Delia Perkins said Tuesday, hopeful that the
board's vote will quiet discord among residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebuilding is staying with your heritage,'' she said. ``We
plan to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said town officials are eager to meet with corps
officials on the chance that Congress might insert money to rebuild
the levee in this year's federal budget. If that happens, Perkins
said, repairs might be completed before next year's hurricane
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the start of major demolition in Princeville, abandoned since
residents fled the flooding, crews have torn down three
flood-ruined houses. As many as 150 houses and 700 mobile homes
will be razed, said Sam Knight, the town's planning and zoning
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who plans to rebuild her flooded home, said only three
Princeville residents filed applications seeking federal buyouts.
As residents learned about the buyout program, many concluded
they'd wind up with too little money to build new homes elsewhere,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's to say the rain won't come on your side of town next
time?'' Perkins said.

DEFIANT MUSLIMS BEGIN BUILDING MOSQUE IN NAZARETH

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ Thousands of jubilant Muslims chanted prayers
to Allah, threw fists into the air and set off firecrackers Tuesday
as they defiantly laid the marble cornerstone of a mosque in the
shadow of the Basilica of the Annunciation.
</P>
<P>
   A nun in white, a monk in brown and a priest in black watched
the celebration glumly from the crenelated roof of the church,
which, like all the major churches in the Holy Land, had been
shuttered for two days in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of the Muslim majority here to build a mosque
adjacent to a central Christian pilgrimage site has not only
divided the once harmonious Israeli Arab town but strained Israel's
relations with the Vatican as the millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican on Tuesday issued a sharply worded criticism of the
Israeli government's decision to authorize the mosque in the
boyhood town of Jesus. But it did not mention any change in the
plans for Pope John Paul's visit to the Holy Land in March, a trip
that local Christian leaders here had said would be jeopardized if
the cornerstone were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision of the Israeli government seems to lay the
groundwork for future contrasts and tensions between the two
religious communities, Christian and Islamic,'' said Joaquin
Navarro-Vals, the chief spokesman for the Vatican. ``I believe that
political authorities in this case have a great responsibility,
because instead of favoring unity, they created the foundation to
foment division.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign ministry responded angrily later in the day,
saying, ``It's their unfortunate but time-honored habit of pointing
the finger of blame in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   At the eleventh hour before Tuesday's festivities, Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, worked unsuccessfully to dissuade
Muslim leaders from moving ahead with the project. It put him in an
unusual role, mediating not only between his fellow Muslims and the
Christian world, but between Israeli Arabs and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat fears that the troubles in Nazareth could harm his
plans to attract thousands of pilgrims to Palestinian-governed
Bethlehem and could sow religious discord among Palestinians.
Muslim leaders in Jerusalem also called on their counterparts in
Nazareth to cancel their plans, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The usually sleepy center of this northern Israeli town was
strung with balloons as a few thousand Muslim men filled the square
to pray and to bask in their accomplishment. With several of them
deliberately facing the church, they waved the green flags of the
Islamic Movement and released canisters of green smoke as speaker
after speaker heralded the day as a critical first step in
reclaiming Islamic land throughout Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's liberate al Aksa next,'' said Ahmed Abu Nawaf, who runs
the Islamic religious trust in Nazareth. He was referring to the
Jerusalem mosque that is one of Islam's holiest, and he held his
fingers aloft in a V.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of the unveiling, hundreds elbowed close to the
marble slab. When its textile cover, embroidered with verses from
the Koran, was lifted, the crowd went wild. They shouted ``Praise
to God,'' as the fireworks exploded so loudly that the nun on the
church roof covered her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should anyone be upset with us?'' asked Salman Abu Ahmad,
a local councilman who rode on the shoulders of his supporters.
``We are not building a dance hall or a casino. We are building a
house of prayer next to another house of prayer. May our city be
filled with blessing upon blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   A man wearing a T-shirt that said ``Islam is the solution''
smiled broadly in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israeli riot police officers, armed with truncheons,
tear-gas launchers and automatic rifles, were positioned around the
old city, but the celebration did not get out of hand. In fact,
many of the Christian-owned stores were shut and the Christians
stayed away from the old town center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle, because we are not Muslims and we are
not Christians,'' said an Israeli officer who would not give his
name. ``The Muslims are a lot stronger than the Christians, a lot
more deadly. Without the protection of the Jews, I don't think
there would be any Christians left here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious statement, given that Christian leaders accuse
the Israelis of disregarding Christians' interests because their
population is small. The leaders say that Israel gave in to the
demands of a small group of militant Muslims who were seen to
represent a large population of Israeli Arab voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dignity of man does not depend on numbers,'' said
Archbishop Michel Sabbah, the Latin patriarch, who is the
highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric in Israel and the Palestinian
territories and who is from Nazareth. ``Because of neglect, we were
forgotten and put aside.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The basilica is a modern building atop the ruins of a
12th-century Crusader Church, which sits on the site where
tradition says the angel Gabriel told Mary she was pregnant with
the child of God. On Tuesday its gates were locked, with a notice
posted explaining the conflict to ``all ambassadors, local
Christians, Christian pilgrims and travel agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church's locked gate, a local Christian man said he
feared that things would never again be the same in Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind closed doors, everyone can express their feelings, but
not out here,'' he said, giving only his first name, Khameis.
``It's sad, though, shameful. We have the same language, the same
culture, the same foods. We grew up together, neighbors. That's
what hurts me, that these people I went to school with turned out
to be fundamentalists. What if we tried to put a church in Mecca,
their holy place?''
</P>
<P>
   A priest called the man away from the gates and cautioned him
not to talk. Any frank conversation was seen as inflaming tensions
in a city determined to proclaim to the world that nothing was
really wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Returning, the man called out to a friend passing by. ``See, he
is Muslim, he is my friend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the nearby marketplace, Hamed Bana, who owns a shoe
stall, pointed to Rima Bana, who runs the neighboring clothing
store and who shares his last name but is not related. ``I'm a
Muslim and she's a Christian and she's like my daughter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adnan Zoubi, another shopkeeper, said: ``It's important for the
leaders to start calming people down. What is done is done. Now we
will have a mosque and church side by side, just like in Jerusalem.
Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here began as a very parochial issue at a very
scruffy site in the center of the largest Arab town in Israel,
where Muslims outnumber Christians about 42,000 to 18,000. Almost
two years ago, local leaders set out to build a millennial plaza in
the half-acre lot adjoining the basilica.
</P>
<P>
   They tore down a school, and then began to fight with local
Muslims over a tiny mosque that is believed to contain the holy
tomb of Shehab el-Din, who is venerated by association: His uncle
was Saladin, the Muslim hero who ousted the crusaders in the 12th
century.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslims erected a protest tent on the site, promised to
build a huge mosque, and a tug-of-war between religious and
political forces in the town ensued. It came to a boil last Easter
when an outburst of violence brought the friction between Muslims
and Christians to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government proposed _ and imposed _ a compromise to
build a small mosque, leaving some land for the intended plaza. The
compromise was initiated by the right-wing Likud government of
Benjamin Netanyahu and completed by the new centrist government of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak. But the compromise was not fully
accepted and led to the church protest. ``Each government erred out
of narrow party political interests,'' Ehud Olmert, the Likud mayor
of Jerusalem, said Tuesday.

<P>
   In protest, churches were closed for the second day Tuesday.
Tuesday morning, at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem,
an elderly woman, dressed entirely in black, crossed herself,
kneeled and kissed the sun-drenched wooden door several times. A
group of Polish pilgrims prayed silently outside the locked
entrance. A Belgian, Daniel Verschoore, said, winking, ``Maybe I'll
become a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, Santos Nery, a visitor from Guatemala, stood on the
outskirts of the Muslim gathering studying the event. He had
intended to visit the basilica Tuesday, but shrugged off the
disappointment. ``I'll come back in the morning,'' he said, adding
that he would not begin to pass judgment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are different cultures, with different perspectives.
This country has its own way of doing things.''

FROM RUSSIA, WITH DARK HUMOR (LIKE THE OLD DAYS)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>

 Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
Srdjan Dragojevic, director of ``The Wounds.''  
 By NANCY RAMSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At last year's New York Film Festival, the director
Aleksei Guerman, a bear of a man with a disarming wit and a
typically Russian sense of irony, introduced his latest work,
``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' to the press.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in his 40-year career, he said, that he
had completed a film that had not been immediately shelved by the
authorities. His previous work, ``My Friend Ivan Lapshin,'' spent
four years in limbo before its release in 1985, when it became a
celebrated film of the perestroika era. ``After every film I made,
I was fired from my job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khroustaliov, My Car!'' which on Friday opens FilmFest, a
series of recent films from Russia and the former Soviet republics
at the Museum of Modern Art, is set in 1953, during the last days
of Stalin's reign of terror. It was a time when it was not clear
from one minute to the next who would fall out of favor, often with
deadly consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in black and white and centering on an army brain surgeon
who swills cognac and lusts after women with equal fervor, the film
boldly addresses the paranoia, anti-Semitism and sheer lunacy of
the times. Resembling an oversize Hieronymus Bosch painting, the
film offers at least one scene that isn't for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   For Guerman, it's a film that he felt he had to make. He
recently turned 60, and, he said at the press conference, ``it was
time to tally the score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are expressed by the grandmother in my film, `I know
so much; what a shame this is all going to vanish with me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Guerman began ``Khroustaliov'' before the collapse of the Soviet
Union. French financing of the film was subject to the fall of the
ruble, and production sometimes shut down for up to a year. Yet he
persevered. ``So you realize,'' he said wryly, ``how foolish I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Foolish, perhaps, but not atypical for a Russian director.
Filmmaking in the Soviet Union was a serious matter. Shortly after
the Revolution, Lenin reportedly declared, ``Of all the arts, the
most important to us is the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   What evolved over the next 70 years was an industry that not
only glorified sailors, workers and young women falling blissfully
in love with both tractors and heroes of the Revolution, but also,
after Stalin's death, a parallel aesthetic, one based on irony,
satire, humor, metaphor and surrealism. Working within the
state-run film industry, writers and directors created a sort of
``kitchen democracy,'' presenting the humor and pathos of everyday
life in a way that would pass the censors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole generation developed this secret language,'' said
Sergei Solovyev, the director and former head of the Russian
filmmakers union, at the Moscow International Film Festival in
1997. ``But along with the social system, the aesthetic system
collapsed. Now you can go to Red Square and shout whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Artfulness often took a back seat to freedom of expression as
films began to criticize the Soviet system. Chernukha, or
blackness, became the rage during perestroika. The death of the
regime brought mobster shoot-'em-ups and deliriously self-indulgent
meditations on the Russian soul. But gradually filmmakers are
returning to the irony, humor and subtle pathos that had endeared
Soviet films to their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the better films that will be shown at the Modern (and
at another festival of more than a dozen Russian films that runs
Dec. 10-12 at both the Directors Guild Theater and the Anthology
Film Archives in Manhattan) are, if not documentaries, then at
least documentary-style. It is not only a wise stylistic choice but
also a sound economic one in an industry sorely lacking money.
</P>
<P>
   One such film, Larissa Sadilova's fictional ``Happy Birthday,''
was shot cinema verite style on a low budget ($70,000, according to
the director) in a provincial maternity hospital. Praised by
Russian critics, the film is warm, sometimes humorous, but not
sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russian literature, medical institutions are often
metaphors for the state,'' said Susan Larsen, who teaches Russian
literature and film at the University of California at San Diego.
``They are places that are supposed to be about nurture but often
aren't. `Happy Birthday' has the gritty quality of chernukha films,
but it's not rubbing your nose in the despair.''
</P>
<P>
   As if picking up where Ms. Sadilova left off, Viktor
Kossakovsky's ``Wednesday'' tracks down people born on his birth
date, July 19, 1961, in Leningrad. The camera takes us over the
rooftops of what is now St. Petersburg and down into its
apartments. A pregnant woman phones hospitals searching for an
empty bed; a new Russian describes his plans for converting a
Soviet naval vessel into a luxury yacht.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pavel and Lyalya,'' the first in a trilogy about love and
devoted to Pushkin, Kossakovsky visits a former teacher and his
wife, an emigre couple in Jerusalem, for a warm and respectful look
at their life.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a less tender approach to the lives of the elderly is
``Bread Day'' by Sergei Dvortsevoy; his style is to let life unfold
before his camera. In a remote, snowy village, pensioners meet the
train for the weekly delivery of bread. Recriminations ensue, with
the characters revealing more than they had intended.
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Ordinary President,'' the president of Belarus,
Aleksandr Lukaschenko, shows himself in a bad light once footage of
him is spliced into this piercing satirical documentary by Yuri
Khashchevatsky. The film opens with a parable: When God granted the
Belarussians their land, no one could believe how beautiful it was.
But God frowned and said, ``So that life shouldn't seem a paradise
to you, you will always have the worst bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``President'' was officially banned in Belarus, some
150,000 bootleg videos have reportedly been distributed. It has
been shown abroad too, with dire consequences for the filmmaker; in
late 1997, after ``An Ordinary President'' was shown on French
television, two men broke into Khashchevatsky's studio, beat him
and stole only his scripts.
</P>
<P>
   Politics are also engaged in Aleksandr Rogozhkin's fictional
``Checkpoint,'' featuring a platoon of Russian soldiers stationed
on a border in the Caucuses. ``It is one of the first Russian films
to tackle the problems of an ethnically splintered society,'' Ms.
Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Tajikistan, ``The Flight of the Bee,'' directed by
Jamshed Usmonov and Min Biong Hun, is driven by a lyrical
simplicity. When his rich neighbor builds a latrine next to his
house, a schoolteacher sets out to right a wrong. ``Central Asian
films take their cues from oral traditions,'' said Jytte Jensen,
FilmFest's curator. ``A simple story turns into something poetic
and beautiful about how you have to live with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Nikita Mikhalkov, the Academy Award-winning
director of ``Burnt by the Sun'' (1994) and the current head of the
Russian filmmakers' union, was in New York on a trip sponsored by a
consultancy, Eurasia Group. (Mikhalkov's ambitions are not confined
to films; he's reportedly toying with the idea of running for the
presidency.)
</P>
<P>
   He recently completed ``Barber of Siberia,'' a romanticized epic
set during the reign of Czar Aleksandr III. His reason for
returning to the past? ``As a Russian poet once said, `You can see
something big at a distance,''' he answered. ```When you're close
you can't see it.' Cinema is not a gazette. In Russia, we have
dramatic, serious problems. It's as if we're trying to balance in
asphalt that's still not dry.''

IN AFRICA, MORE WOMEN THAN MEN HAVE AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Russia, the Philippines, Thailand))  (See also AIDS-RUSSIA) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIDS has long been considered primarily a men's disease, but
Tuesday the United Nations reported for the first time that more
women than men were infected with the AIDS virus in Africa, the
site of the vast majority of such infections in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released in advance of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the
United Nations said that of the 22.3 million adults in sub-Sahara
Africa infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, 12.2 million, or 55
percent, are women.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that data have been available to make
such a comparison, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the precise reasons for the shift were
unclear, though they noted that HIV was spread in Africa primarily
through heterosexual intercourse. The virus passes more easily from
men to women than from women to men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, it was hard to make people listen when we were
saying AIDS wasn't just a man's disease,'' said Dr. Peter Piot,
head of U.N. AIDS, which joins a number of U.N. agencies, including
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates among women are much lower in the United States
and other developed countries than in Africa. But more women,
primarily in minority groups, are becoming infected through
heterosexual sex in the United States, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence that Africa has six infected women for every
five infected men comes from a number of studies in several African
countries, Unaids said. Many AIDS experts have assumed that more
women were infected than men in Africa. But documentation was not
possible because much of the data was not broken down by sex, Dr.
Bernhard Schwartlander, an epidemiologist for the agency and a
principal author of the report, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the shifting demographics in Africa, the
report said, is the different age patterns of HIV infection in men
and women. Studies in several countries have found that African
girls 15 to 19 are five to six times as likely to have the virus as
boys their own age. Men tend to be more promiscuous, and ``older
men, who often coerce girls into sex or buy their favors with
sugar-daddy gifts, are the main source of HIV for the teen-age
girls,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk to women, Piot said, health workers need to
devise strategies to change men's actions, starting with sex
education among boys. Another goal is to reduce the cost of female
condoms, so they can be used more widely.
</P>
<P>
   Although Africa is by far the continent most affected by the
virus, with nearly 70 percent of the infected people in the world
living in the countries below the Sahara, AIDS remains an unabated
epidemic in many countries. This year, an estimated 5.6 million
adults and children became infected with the virus, bringing the
worldwide total to an estimated 50 million since the AIDS epidemic
was first recognized in 1981. Of those, more than 33 million
infected people are alive today. But AIDS has killed 16 million;
2.6 million of them have died so far in 1999, a record for any
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS remains a fatal disease'' despite the availability of
newer combinations of drugs, Piot said, and ``the threat of HIV has
not diminished in any country.''
</P>
<P>
   How high will the number of AIDS cases reach worldwide?
</P>
<P>
   Schwartlander said the answer would depend on the number of
infections in Asia, a number that cannot be determined now. Because
the factors that influence changes in sexual behavior are difficult
to predict and because risk factors like injecting drugs vary, he
said, Unaids cannot predict when AIDS will peak.
</P>
<P>
   Even if prevention programs completely stopped new infections,
deaths would increase for years, because third-world countries
cannot afford drugs to fight the virus, and their health systems
are overwhelmed by related illness.
</P>
<P>
   The steepest curve in rising infection rates in 1999 was in the
newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, where drug use
by injection is increasingly common among unemployed people and
schoolchildren. In the Russian federation, nearly half of all
reported cases of HIV infection since the start of the epidemic
were recorded in the first nine months of 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, three times as many cases were reported in the first
nine months of 1999 as in all previous years combined. Towns around
Moscow have even sharper increases, with more than five times as
many infections reported in the first nine months of 1999 as in all
previous years combined. In Siberia, most of the 1,300 infections
in Irkutsk were reported in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HIV rates in adults are about 2 percent in the Caribbean, the
highest outside sub-Sahara Africa, where it is 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS has emerged as the single greatest threat to development
in many countries of the world,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy in southern Africa, which climbed to 59 in the
early '90s from 44 in the early '50s, is expected to drop back to
45 in 10 years. Fewer than 50 percent of the South Africans now
alive can expect to reach 60, compared with 70 percent for
developing countries and 90 for industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of commercial farms in Kenya found that illness and
death now rivaled old-age retirement as the leading reason why
employees left work. Some life insurance companies have found that
a third or more of deaths are related to HIV, even in plans that
require a negative test as a condition of acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Unaids noted some bright spots. Strong prevention efforts have
had success in lowering or stabilizing rates in the Philippines,
Thailand and a few other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said that political efforts were increasing in a number of
countries, but that it took five years before statistics showed
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seth Berkley, head of the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, said, ``A vaccine is the world's best hope for ending
the pandemic.''

MACAU'S FLAMBOYANT CRIME LORD SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAU _ In a last act of justice before it turns this compact
colony over to China, a Portuguese court here convicted a
45-year-old Chinese man on Tuesday of leading a powerful criminal
organization that infiltrated Macau's casinos and terrorized its
government.
</P>
<P>
   The court found the man, Wan Kuok-koi, guilty of loan-sharking,
money laundering and other charges stemming from his reign as the
undisputed lord of the Macau underworld. Declaring that Wan had
shown no remorse, Justice Fernando Estrela sentenced him to the
maximum term of 15 years in prison. Seven of Wan's associates,
including his brother, Wan Kuok-hung, received lesser sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Wan Kuok-koi has mesmerized this Portuguese enclave
on the southern coast of China in the twilight of its colonial
rule. For the Portuguese, it represented a last bit of
housecleaning before it turns Macau over to the Chinese government
on Dec. 19. For Macau's Chinese population, it represented perhaps
the last chapter in the saga of the man known as Broken Tooth Koi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portuguese are doing this to show the world that they
finally did something about organized crime,'' said Joao Severino,
the editor of Macau Hoje, one of the few Portuguese-language
newspapers left in the colony. ``But there will be big trouble
every night after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous convictions of organized crime leaders in Macau have
led to ugly explosions of violence. Tuesday, the authorities were
taking no chances. A police sharpshooter squinted from the roof of
a building across the street from the courthouse. Inside, security
troops from Portugal, clad in bulletproof vests, ringed the austere
courtroom as Estrela read the verdict in a matter-of-fact, almost
subdued, tone.
</P>
<P>
   As the guards surrounded Wan to lead him out of the court, he
began hurling abuse at the judge, prosecutors, and the police in
Chinese and Portuguese. ``You're corrupt, you've taken dirty
money!'' Wan shrieked, jumping on a bench and gesticulating wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Wan subsided, and seeming close to tears, he was
manacled by the guards and led away to begin his sentence in a
high-security prison on a nearby island.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese authorities have been anxious to see Wan
sentenced ever since he was arrested on May 1, 1998, the same day
that his gang allegedly planted a bomb under the car of Macau's
police superintendent. With his flamboyant style and theatrical
boasting about his gangland exploits, Wan had symbolized Portugal's
inability to stamp out organized crime in its last colonial
redoubt.
</P>
<P>
   The mayhem threatened to overshadow Macau's return to China,
embarrassing Portuguese administrators and provoking clucks of
disapproval from senior Chinese officials. Local officials contend
that the violence has been exaggerated by the Hong Kong news media
and that the gangs originally came from Hong Kong and Guangdong
Province in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police here are fighting a very particular type of
organized crime,'' said Jorge Rangel, Macau's secretary for public
administration. ``It won't go away, just because of the handover.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people believe the Chinese government will do a
better job of snuffing out criminal activity, in part because it
plans to station army troops in the territory. Chinese courts have
also dealt more harshly with suspected gang leaders than Portuguese
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung Tze-keung, a Hong Kong crime boss known as Big Spender,
was executed last December after being convicted of kidnapping and
arms trafficking. Although Wan's gang, called 14K, is suspected of
drive-by shootings, car bombings and attempted assassinations of
public officials, prosecutors tried him on less serious charges,
which carried the maximum sentence of 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Wan contended he was a businessman and a
high-roller who had no idea why he was on trial. With his squat
build, round face and loud tropical-print shirts, Wan looks like
many of the weekend wagerers who jam Macau's down-at-the-heel
casinos. But he inspired deep fear among people here _ not least
the prosecutors and judges whose job it was to go after him.
</P>
<P>
   The first judge in the trial resigned, so the government drafted
Estrela from Portugal. Estrela, a tough disciplinarian, professed
to be unfazed by the defendant's fearsome reputation. Yet the
judge, too, took unusual precautions during the monthlong case. At
lunchtime Tuesday, people in front of the court saw the judge dash
to his waiting car flanked by armed bodyguards.

 &HT;    Williams a surprise as one of highest-paid college presidents
 &HT;    By Steve Visser and James Salzer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sid Williams may not be the highest paid private
college president in the county, but the founder of Life University
isn't far down on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Williams receives $355,500 annually _ which puts him just
outside the top 20 paychecks at private colleges and universities
listed in the Chronicle of Higher Education's annual survey
published this week.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Williams cleared far more than his annual salary.
His board of trustees tossed in a $150,000 bonus. And he has an
annuity for retirement, which is worth in the neighborhood of
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The total package, when reported to the Internal Revenue Service
as is required for the non-profit university, came to $900,923 in
1998
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very high. . . .it's quite amazing actually,.'' said
Ted Marchese, vice president of the American Association for Higher
Education. ``I've certainly seen it before in the proprietary
school sector. I haven't seen it in the non-profit sector.''
</P>
<P>
   John Trainer, president of the Association of Private Colleges
and Universities in Georgia, said some college presidents like
Williams may be paid more because their schools opened as
for-profit campuses and the leaders are paid like corporate
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's survey listed Washington and Jefferson College
President Howard J. Burnett as the highest paid in the nation
during 1997-98, the last year for which figures were available. His
package of just over $1 million also included hefty retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Life University was not part of the survey, but the Chronicle
did list Williams' total earnings of more than $900,000 in a
separate piece.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the figures distort his salary as well as that of
his wife, Nell, who as vice president of student affairs had salary
and benefits at $468,500, the Chronicle reported. Williams said
that figure is largely annuity for compensation in retirement and
listed her pay as around $97,000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as he makes clear, he and his wife built the Marietta,
Ga., chiropractic college over the last 25 years _ from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a nice compensation but we've been here 25 years,'' he
said in his on-campus office. ``We founded this college and we've
dedicated all our energy to its development.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams have worked assiduously for more than two decades
to win public approval for chiropractic medicine. When the campus
first opened in 1974, the school faced public skepticism. But over
the years _ through a combination of sports, community involvement
and advertising, Williams said he has won adherents to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   The school in some ways still operates more like a for-profit
proprietary trade school than a non-profit college in part because
of its practice of hiring Williams' friends and relatives. His
sister-in-law, Mildred Kimbrough, is assistant vice president with
a total compensation package of $323,271 in 1998, the Chronicle
reported. A childhood friend, Durie Humber is a vice president with
a total compensation package of $625,870, the publication said. His
daughter, Kim, also works for the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most schools have nepotism rules that would make those
arrangements highly unlikely but its more common in the for-profit
proprietary sector,'' said Marchese, who noted that even private
colleges depend on tax-payer funds in the form of student loans and
grants. ``They have a charter from the public, they're given a tax
status, so what do these salaries look like against that public
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams won't discuss how many family members work for the
school and while he says he answers to a board of trustees, it is
unclear how independent the board is.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgia schools that were included in the Chronicle's
survey, Emory University President William M. Chace's $325,334
salary during the 1997-98 school year was the highest. His pay rose
from $303,584 to $325,334 from 1996-97 to 1997-98, according to the
Chronicle. He also received an estimated $16,000 in benefits.
Mercer University President R. Kirby Godsey was second in Georgia,
with pay of $249,000 and benefits of $30,806 in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, University System of Georgia Chancellor Stephen
Portch, who heads the state's 34-school public college system, will
each a package worth $324,800 this year. Georgia Institute of
Technology President Wayne Clough is scheduled to get $289, 812 in
state salary, ``subsistence'' pay and the school's foundation
supplement.

<P>
   When Both the AAA and the Air Transport Association predict a
record number of travelers over the Thanksgiving holiday period,
you can pretty well count on crowded highways and skyways. AAA
(formerly the American Automobile Association) is predicting a
record 28 million vehicles on the roads during the holiday period,
while the ATA is predicting almost 20 million airline passengers
between last Friday and next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers returning Sunday should get to the airport extra,extra early, because an average of 87 percent of airline seats are
expected to be filled that day, the highest percentage of any day
this year. Bookings that day on U S Airways already exceed 90
percent. Thursday the industry average is expected to dip to 44
percent, possibly the lowest percentage of passengers this entire
year. But with airlines cutting back on flights on Dec. 31 _
because of the usual low demand on New Year's Eve, combined with
the reluctance of many people to fly for fear of Year 2000 computer
problems _ that day could easily result in the fewest passengers in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 Toll
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 computer fears appear to have taken a toll already, in
the grounding of a Concorde chartered from Air France by Donald
Pevsner, an aviation lawyer and tour operator. He had expected to
carry 100 or so jet-setters between Paris and New York to celebrate
the millennium in both Europe and the United States. But despite
lowering the one-way price from $10,000 a person to $6,000. Pevsner
canceled the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers whom I sold the flight to for resale _ one bought
30 seats, the other 66 seats _ could not sell more than four seats
between them,'' he said. ``Everybody stood to take an enormous bath
so we called it off,'' he added, attributing the inability to sell
seats on the supersonic plane to ``Y2K nausea.''
</P>
<P>
   Pevsner had chartered the Concorde four times previously, twice
for luxury flights (1989 and 1990) and twice for round-the-world
trips (1992 and 1995), all of which carried dozens of passengers
who paid handsomely for the privilege. The 1992 flight set the
westbound round-the-world record (32 hours, 49 minutes and 3
seconds, including six stops to refuel), the 1995 flight broke the
eastbound record (31:27:49, also with six stops). The flight that
had been scheduled for next month may have broken the record for
futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleague in Miami approached over 1,300 corporations to
sponsor it, as Coors Light beer sponsored my 1995 flight,'' Pevsner
said, ``but nobody would touch it, even though their logo would
have been all over the plane.'' And the general public balked even
when the price was lowered to $6,000, or not much more than the
standard one-way Paris-to-New York fare on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' added Pevsner, who now plans to welcome in 2000
from his boat dock in Florida, ``is that everybody believes the
world's coming to an end'' _ a conclusion he scoffs at.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Travelers
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, 51 percent of business travelers took
their cellular phones with them on business trips, 22 percent took
pagers, 20 percent laptop computers and 6 percent hand-held digital
assistants. The respective figures for leisure travelers were 46
percent, 18 percent, 6 percent and 3 percent. The poll, of 1,200
U.S. adults, was conducted by the nonprofit Travel Industry
Association of America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early next yar, the U S Airways Shuttle will operate
its first flight of the day between New York and Washington at 6
a.m., an hour earlier than currently scheduled. The new, earlier
flight, which will go into effect at both airports, begins Feb. 1
and will operate every business day.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines is rolling out new menus created by
celebrity chefs for first-class passengers on domestic flights.
Dinner menus, for example, include grilled grouper or shrimp scampi
and black bean ravioli with lemon zucchini sauce; lunch includes
soup and hot sandwiches. And meals have been added at nonmeal times
and on flights under 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder airlines go all out to keep their highest paying
passengers happy. A report issued Tuesday by the International Air
Transport Association found that just over 14 percent of passengers
flew first class or business class last year, but accounted for
almost 32 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Booked in Manhattan
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of Manhattan's hotels will be sold out on
Dec. 31, according to Sean Hennessey of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
the percentage would have been higher except for recent
cancellations by Brazilians and other foreigners whose nations have
been battered by currency devaluation. But last-minute bookings may
boost occupancy to 93 percent in Manhattan hotels, even though 90
percent of those hotels require a three- or four-day stay
overlapping New Year's Eve.

 &HT;    Hatch unfazed by being an underdog
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans _ It wasn't at all hard to pick out Orrin Hatch in
the crowd Saturday night as the senior senator from Utah made his
way from one Republican post-election party to the next in Baton
Rouge and the New Orleans suburbs of Metairie and Kenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go tell him he needs to loosen his tie a
little,'' said a reveler at Orleans Parish Councilman John
Lavarine's victory party, which he eventually did as the GOP
presidential candidate was leaving. Hatch listened to the advice
with a chuckle and walked out of the Kenner Knights of Columbus
Hall, without a button loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is so sober he can make drinking two Dr Peppers over
dinner sound like he went on a bender. Slim-Fast-thin,
ramrod-straight, he seemed as out of place on a Saturday night in
Louisiana as he did when he joined an already crowded and heavily
funded field of Republican presidential contenders last July.
</P>
<P>
   The day Hatch got into the race, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
announced he'd already raised $36 million. Hatch seized on the
number for his ``skinny cat'' campaign, urging a million voters to
send him $36 each.
</P>
<P>
   So far he's raised less than $2 million and doesn't scratch in
the polls. But with a self-confidence found to a peculiarly high
degree on the north side of the United States Capitol, he believes
he is by far the most qualified candidate in the presidential
field, and could win if he can make people understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People start realizing that here's a guy who's got the most
experience, who's got the best record of accomplishment, who
literally can bring people together and force the most liberal to
work with the most conservative to get things done. And that's
something we've got to have now going into this next century,''
Hatch said as he rode toward Baton Rouge with three aides and a
reporter before the polls closed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch is a United States senator through and through: protective
of his colleagues on either side of the aisle, particular about his
status and not shy to boast of the legislation that bears his name.
Elected in 1976 with the help of Ronald Reagan to the only
political office he has ever held, Hatch dresses the part, right
down to the Senate emblem on his suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   He does not claim to have invented the Internet like Vice
President Al Gore, himself no stranger to Senate culture. On the
other hand, he'll tell you, ``most intellectual property bills are
Hatch bills,'' and he was the senator who took on Microsoft in
Senate antitrust hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As one of a ``handful, four or five,'' who convinced President
Reagan to cut marginal tax rates, he believes he should share
credit for the economic prosperity that he believes that act
triggered. He authored the bill that ``saved the dietary supplement
industry'' and in the past session sponsored the ``most sweeping
patent law reform in the past half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has his senatorial range been only domestic, he notes. He
flew to Asia on Vice President George Bush's plane in the 1980s, he
recalled, to seal the deal giving Stinger missiles to Pakistan and
the Afghan mujahadeen _ what some consider the straw that broke the
back of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time, Hatch has blossomed as a lyricist, sharing
songwriting credit for several songs with religious and patriotic
themes. ``I Am Not Alone,'' co-written with Madeline Stone,
recently hit No. 9 on the Christian Research Report chart of
contemporary Christian music. Hatch has also written two novels,
neither published to date.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Elaine, have six children, all now grown.
</P>
<P>
   Given his position as a ranking Republican, chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, it seems paradoxical for Hatch to run
as a grass-roots challenger to his party's establishment. But Hatch
maintained he has never been a part of that elite, and said he has
set foot in the headquarters of the Republican National Committee
fewer than five times in his 23 years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A metal lather's son who worked his way through college as a
janitor, Hatch combines a dapper image and conservative politics
with the hint of hard-scrabble beginnings in a way that calls to
mind another Republican, Georgia's 11th District Rep. John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   A certain amount of prejudice against him as a Mormon is one of
the reasons he's been written off by many in the media, Hatch said.
He dismissed the importance of Mormons as contributors _ ``by the
time they get through paying 10 percent of their gross income for
tithing they're not too enthused about spending their money for
anything else.'' But his church links provide a national network.
Before heading out for the post-election parties Saturday, he met
with a Mormon group at a reception in Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch canceled part of his Saturday Louisiana trip because the
final votes on the budget agreement kept him in Washington until
late the night before. Arizona Sen. John McCain's criticism of this
year's Congress did not sit well with this Senate loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoken by somebody who's missed 160-something votes. Somebody
who was not there during most of the battles that have been fought
in the last throes of this thing,'' Hatch said of McCain's comment
in Atlanta on Friday that the budget deal was ``obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, he offended a lot of members of the Senate,
especially the Republicans who have been fighting their hearts out,
knowing the President has a veto that's sustainable,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   If in Hatch's perspective Bush is the unseasoned, undeserving
front-runner, McCain is the rival who irritates him most _ another
senator from the West, another conservative who claims the ability
to work with Democrats, who is currently riding higher in the
polls. Hatch faults McCain for ``cheap shots'' at his beloved
Senate, and for espousing changes in campaign finance laws that he
ought to know would kill the Republican Party in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real campaign reform is what Orrin Hatch does, running on
small contributions from people who don't usually give to political
campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch can sport an impressive list of bills that pair his name
with a Democrat's: the Hatch-Waxman generic drug bill, the
Hatch-Biden violence against women bill and the Hatch-Lieberman
capital gains tax reduction bill, among others. But he was an early
Reagan supporter in the days when they were considered pretty far
right by many in their own party, and his cultivation of Senate
manners hasn't changed his politics much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as I like them personally, they are far-left committed
ideologues,'' he said of Gore and his Democratic rival, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, summing up the senator and the
conservative in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest reasons I feel I've got to run _ and I
think I can win _ is by the end of eight years Bill Clinton will
have appointed 50 percent of the federal judiciary and two U.S.
Supreme Court justices. This is a third of the separated powers of
government, and people don't center on it,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his opponents with no experience in federal judicial
matters, he said, ``I know who to pick, how to pick 'em and how to
make sure they do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   With little money or support base, Hatch has little chance to
fill that role in the Oval Office, but since his Senate term is up
next year also, he could be a contender for a Cabinet post in a
Republican administration, or possibly on the vice presidential
list. He has criticized his opponents, but like a true senator, not
so harshly he couldn't work with them in the future.

PLAINTIFFS' RIFT OVER SANCTIONS PROMPTED MICROSOFT JUDGE TO APPOINT
A MEDIATOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trial judge for the Microsoft antitrust case said he
appointed an outside mediator partly because of ``disturbing
reports'' that the Justice Department and the 19 states suing the
software maker were split on the issue of what sanctions to seek
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson made the comments in a meeting
last Thursday involving lawyers for the Microsoft Corp., the
Justice Department and the 19 states in the judge's chambers in
Washington. It was at that meeting that Jackson surprised both
sides by telling them he planned to appoint Richard A. Posner, a
highly respected federal appeals court judge and an antitrust
scholar, and asked both sides for their ``voluntary'' agreement.
Posner will serve as a mediator in efforts to reach an out-of-court
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's remarks, reported Tuesday in The Washington Post, were
recorded in a 16-page transcript of last week's meeting, which was
made public Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts who read the meeting transcript Tuesday said
that some differences of opinion between the government and states
prosecuting the case would probably be of less concern to Jackson
than the prospect of the drift of suggested sanctions going in a
direction that he found worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Since the judge issued his findings of fact earlier this month,
concluding that Microsoft is a monopolist that stifles innovation
and harms consumers, the state representatives, in particular, have
emphasized the need for harsh sanctions against the company.
Previously, discussion of sanctions such as breaking up Microsoft
or the forced licensing of its Windows operating system had been
confined mostly to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the findings of fact, state officials publicly reiterated
their call for powerful remedies. They noted that Jackson's
document had shifted the debate on remedies, declaring that the
states' suggestions, once deemed extreme, had moved into the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states have a lot of influence and they can be the
gravitational pull in this process,'' said William Kovacic, a
professor at the George Washington University law school. ``It may
well be that Jackson sensed he was facing the possibility of a
runaway train, and Posner is going to be the brake man.''
</P>
<P>
   As a hands-on mediator, Posner, antitrust experts say, will
likely try to give both sides a dose of reality. To the government
and states, these experts say, Posner will probably point out that
the outcome of the case, especially on appeal, may not favor them
as much as Jackson's findings alone might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft, they add, he will likely stress that it may get a
few allegations set aside on appeal, but it is now almost certainly
going to be found a monopoly whose actions did violate the
antitrust laws. They believe Posner will say that settling the case
now would spare Microsoft the risk of court-mandated remedies and
then perhaps a raft of private litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's meeting, Jackson told the two sides that his
decision to bring in Posner was ``partly motivated by what I think
are somewhat disturbing reports in the press that the plaintiffs
are proceeding on, quote, parallel tracks, or something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson specifically cited an article in The New York Times a
day earlier about the ``divergent views'' of the states and the
government. ``I would not like to deal with divergent points of
view,'' he told the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's step to call on a respected mediator was considered a
shrewd move, whether the two sides reach a settlement or not. If
they do not settle, Jackson is expected to issue a final ruling
early next year, followed by a hearing on remedies. Afterwards, an
appeal is considered all but a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson may have been surprised by the impact of his
findings of fact and how much they seem to have emboldened the
states especially,'' observed George L. Priest, a professor at the
Yale law school. ``By bringing in Judge Posner, he is going the
extra mile to take some of the pressure off his initial decision _
his findings of fact.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to dispel a cloud of doubt that has shadowed
her emerging campaign for public office, Hillary Rodham Clinton
flew to New York Tuesday to declare that she was in the race for
U.S. Senate to stay. She said she would move into her new house in
Chappaqua, N.Y., as soon as the Secret Service said she could, and
begin campaigning ``as vigorously as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get moving and get started,'' she said at a news
conference at the United Federation of Teachers headquarters in
Midtown Manhattan. Mrs. Clinton said that after four months of
traveling across the state, ``I just became more and more convinced
that this is a campaign that needs to be made, that the issues at
stake are important ones, and that I have a lot to say about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the white-on-blue teachers union banner at her back, and
facing a room filled with reporters and television crews, including
many who had flown up from Washington, Mrs. Clinton jumped
full-force into the race with the help of Randi Weingarten, the
union president, in what Ms. Weingarten's aides described as a
scripted exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Mrs. Clinton finished delivering remarks urging a
greater federal role in improving the nation's schools, Ms.
Weingarten walked to her side at the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone to push this agenda,'' Ms. Weingarten said.
``And we need someone to be the successor to Pat Moynihan, who
really cares about education. So is it yes or no?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Randi, in the last months I've been, at last count,
to 35 counties all over this state,'' Mrs. Clinton responded,
smiling broadly as cameras clicked and room grew hushed. ``And
everywhere I've gone people talk to me about issues, like what we
discussed today. And that's very exciting to me. Because I believe
that if we work together, we really can make a difference for the
children and families in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton had anything to say beyond that _ and it
appeared that she might have _ it was lost in the tumult of loud
cheers and hand-clapping of the union members as they rose to their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's plan to live in the Clintons' new $1.7 million
house in Westchester County presents a historical oddity: the last
time a president lived in the White House without a wife was more
than 80 years ago. The Clintons say they will rejoin each other on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   For all the stage-managed drama of Mrs. Clinton's appearance,
what the first lady said Tuesday was only incrementally different
than what she has said on numerous occasions over the last few
months. For anyone parsing Mrs. Clinton's statements on the
subject, this was the first time she did not include a tiny
qualifier when talking about her intentions, which she might have
used as a way out of the race. In fact, Mrs. Clinton and her aides
have repeatedly said she was all-but-certain to run.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Mrs. Clinton felt compelled to make this
announcement _ she had not been planning to return to New York
until after Thanksgiving _ reflects rising anxiety among many
Democrats about the depth of Mrs. Clinton's commitment to the race
and the fear that the longer she waited, the harder it would be to
find an alternative if she decided not to run. The party leaders
also expressed concern about her political competence in what is
expected to be a difficult contest to replace Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring at the end of his term.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent is expected to be Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The speculation that she might not run has filled the vacuum
that was created by absence from New York over the last two weeks
while she was traveling with President Clinton overseas, her aides
said in explaining her decision to make this statement. The concern
about the viability of this first-time candidate for office was
heightened by the criticism by Jewish leaders about her handling of
the trip to Israel, as well as by her decision before she left to
postpone her formal announcement once more, this time from January
to February. Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday that she would formally
announce her candidacy in a statewide tour sometime early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 minutes Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton sought to dispel any
notions that she might quit the race before it begins, to quell
concerns about her political skills, and to address the criticism
that arose about her actions while in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she intended to move to Chappaqua and cut back
on as many of her duties as first lady as possible. She went on to
sketch out a high-powered version of a commuter relationship for
the nation's first couple, with the president tending to the
nation's business in Washington and Mrs. Clinton pursuing her
political future in New York. The two would rejoin each other on
weekends, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be living in Westchester and I will be traveling around
the state and campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks Tuesday _ and even her formal
announcement of candidacy, once it comes _ does not significantly
change her legal position. Since October, when she filed a
statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission, she
has been subject to federal campaign fundraising rules, although
her announcement could also make it easier for her to raise money
among people who doubted her candidacy. She has also been subject
to restrictions on using White House resources _ like her White
House staff _ to advance her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has been a constant rumble of speculation from the
moment she began traveling around New York last summer, largely
encouraged by her critics. The Wall Street Journal suggested in an
editorial last summer that Mrs. Clinton would abandon the race in
favor of a job as president of the World Bank. And Dick Morris, the
Clintons' former consultant, has regularly predicted in his New
York Post column that Mrs. Clinton would step aside because she
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty about her political skills escalated after her
trip to the Middle East, when Mrs. Clinton was criticized for
sitting silently as Suha Arafat, in a ceremony in Ramallah, on the
West Bank, suggested that Israelis were poisoning Arab women and
children with the use of toxic tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton defended her actions, saying she was there not as a
candidate for office, but as first lady. ``There were people who
believed that I should have caused an international incident over
whatever it is she said,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I just respectfully
disagree with that. And I know that there were people who knew I
could score political points for myself in New York by doing
something that would cause such an incident. I did not think that
was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the campaign itself, Mrs. Clinton demurred when asked to
offer contrasts between herself and Giuliani _ indeed, to even
mention Giuliani's name in a critical way _ or to sketch out how
she would present herself to voters. She said she would prefer to
reserve that for her formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of contrasts between the both of
us,'' she said. ``So I'm going to be drawing those contrasts out.
I'm going to be responding whenever I can. But ultimately, this
election is not going to be about me or Rudy Giuliani. It's going
to be about the issues that concern the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, personality is fine,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But
ultimately you have to ask yourself, `How is this person going to
vote?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked at his daily news conference Tuesday whether he thought
Mrs. Clinton had made her announcement because her campaign was in
trouble, the Mayor said: ``I don't think very much about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of the mayor's Senate exploratory
committee, said that he still wasn't sure whether the first lady
was in the race for good. ``To me it sounds like political
double-speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's news conference drew huge attention from the
media: it was broadcast live on a number of television stations,
including CNN. Reporters repeatedly pushed Mrs. Clinton to give
ever-more-definitive statements about her political intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton seemed pleased by the attention, if slightly taken
aback by it. Indeed, the first lady said she had not informed
Clinton or their daughter, Chelsea, about what she was going to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in Kosovo and they don't know about this,'' she said.
``But they're getting home tonight, and I don't think my husband or
daughter will be surprised.''

U.N. OFFICIALS SAY IRAQ IS COMPLETING THE SHUTDOWN OF OIL EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq continued to close down its oil export
operations on Tuesday by loading the last tanker waiting at the
Persian Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr, U.N. officials said. Experts
said the loading would be completed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is protesting a shorter-than-expected extension of the
program that allows it to sell some oil to pay for civilian goods
to offset the hardships of international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Iraqi government's decision over the weekend to
stop selling oil was considered a temporary measure, oil prices
rose to recent record levels before leveling off on Tuesday at
$25.57 a barrel for Brent North Sea crude, down slightly from a
closing price of $25.78 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq gave no indication on Tuesday that it would prolong the
freeze on exports if the Security Council reverts as expected to
the normal six-month extensions of the program. Last week, as a
weekend deadline for renewal approached, the three-year-old ``oil
for food'' program was extended for only two weeks because of a
deadlock in the Security Council. The problem stemmed from a
Russian attempt to improve the terms of the deal on Iraq's behalf,
which was opposed by other council members.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the government-controlled Iraqi press has
unleashed a harsh campaign against not only the stop-gap extension
in the oil-sales plan but also the larger issue of a new arms
inspection system for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq expelled a previous commission set up after the Gulf War
charged with ensuring that it destroyed its weapons of mass
destruction. The creation of a new disarmament commission is also
under intense discussion among the council's five permanent members
with veto power: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United
States. Diplomats say that this is Iraq's real concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis, who want an unconditional end to sanctions imposed
after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, called the Security Council's
renewed efforts to re-establish arms inspections ``a U.S. and
Zionist plot which amounts to a declaration of war against Iraq.''
But under a 1991 resolution, Iraq cannot hope to have the embargo
on uncontrolled oil sales, international air traffic and most
imports removed unless President Saddam Hussein's government is
declared free of prohibited weapons and the means to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats expect that the extent of Iraq's defiance will be
tested in the next few weeks as the Security Council, which has
been stalled for almost a year, moves closer to an agreement on the
inspection issue. No concrete measures are proposed for dealing
with the Iraqis if they refuse to accept a new arms inspection and
monitoring system _ except an automatic continuation of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the oil sale program, Iraq is permitted to export $5.26
billion in oil every six months. That rose to more than $7 billion
in the last six months because of higher prices and an exemption to
make up for earlier quota shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   It now seems likely to be renewed without changes. Any
relaxation of the program's rules to increase relief aid and speed
reconstruction of basic services in Iraq would be included in the
larger Security Council measure on resumed arms control.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no inspections in Iraq since last December, when
the U.N. Special Commission wrote its last report, laying out
examples of Iraqi noncooperation that the United States and Britain
used as a rationale for a bombing campaign against Iraq. The
inspectors left ahead of the bombing.

grittier and riskier film starring the always prestigious Robert De
Niro. Unfortunately, it's not likely to do the trick for him.

FOREIGN INVESTORS WIN COURT ORDER IN RUSSIAN OIL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A prominent foreign investment group won a Siberian
court order Tuesday to temporarily halt the sale of one of Russia's
largest oil producers. It was the latest maneuver in a struggle
widely viewed as a test of Russia's respect for the rights of
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The Sputnik Fund, which includes such high-profile investors as
Harvard University and financier George Soros, maintains that the
sale of the oil producer, Chernogorneft, would cause the demise of
the producer's parent company, Sidanko, a bankrupt Russian oil
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Sputnik holds a 10 percent stake in Sidanko, as does BP Amoco,
the big British-American oil company, which over the last 12 months
has struggled to preserve Sidanko and its own half-billion-dollar
investment in the Russian oil concern. Sputnik, BP Amoco and some
other Chernogorneft creditors say that a rival Russian oil concern,
Tyumen Oil Co., started the bankruptcies and has used the process,
reportedly through tampering with the courts, to strip away
Sidanko's most valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   It had been widely predicted that Tyumen Oil would buy
Chernogorneft in a court-supervised auction scheduled for Friday,
similar to the way Tyumen acquired another Sidanko unit,
Kondpetroleum, several weeks ago at a rock-bottom price.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Tyumen Oil say the company has used the courts to
appoint its own people as external managers of bankrupt Sidanko
units to swing the auctions in their favor. Tyumen Oil has said it
is interested in acquiring Chernogorneft, but it has repeatedly
denied accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing a court order halting the sale, the municipal court
in Nizhnyvartovsk, where Chernogorneft is based, affirmed Sputnik's
complaints that the oil company obstructed the fund's efforts to
get the necessary paperwork to offer its own bid.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread belief that Sputnik is acting at the
behest of BP Amoco, which has so far been unwilling to engage
Tyumen Oil head on. But officials at BP Amoco and Sputnik have said
that while the fund has kept BP Amoco informed, Sputnik is working
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Sputnik also filed suit Monday in New York state Supreme Court
against Tyumen Oil; one of Tyumen's primary shareholders, Access
Industries, Inc.; and the president of Access Industries, Len
Blavatnik. The suit contends that Access Industries and Tyumen Oil
``have stolen one of Sidanko's key assets _ Kondpetroleum, an oil
production company and are further poised to purloin another
Sidanko subsidiary _ Chernogorneft.''
</P>
<P>
   Blavatnik could not be reached for comment. A Tyumen Oil
spokesman declined to comment on the Russian court injunction and
the New York court case.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for an American court to accept a suit concerning
activities overseas. But courts review such cases when the parties
involved are U.S. citizens or when there is reason to believe that
the plaintiffs will not get a fair hearing in the jurisdiction
where the events are said to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The questionable effectiveness of the Russian court order may
show why Sputnik has sued in the United States as well. In Russia,
court decisions are often difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco officials are hoping that a postponed auction of
Chernogorneft would give them more time to press Tyumen Oil to
relent in its takeover fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this allows the bankruptcy process to be reversed and an
amicable settlement to be implemented, it would be an encouraging
development,'' said Howard Chase, head of external affairs at BP
Amoco's Moscow office.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial test will come Thursday if, at a scheduled meeting,
Chernogorneft creditors and the external manager decide to abide by
the court order. If the order is ignored, a new round of lawsuits
would then begin to thwart the auction, which could drag out the
resolution of Sidanko's fate and further sully Russia's
questionable reputation among foreign investors.

 (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generations of music students have gained admission to
20th-century music theory through the imposing but welcoming portal
of George Perle's book ``Serial Composition and Atonality.''
Published in 1961, it is in its sixth edition and was recently
translated into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of its readers may not have known that Perle is
himself a fine composer, or that paradoxically, his creative work
stands distinctly aside from many of the practices detailed in his
book. From a study of Berg's work, in particular, he developed a
system within which a sense similar to that of key is maintained
even though all 12 notes are in play, a system he called ``12-tone
tonality.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities to hear his music arrive in anticipation of his
85th birthday, next May. On Tuesday evening at Cooper Union in New
York City, the Da Capo Chamber Players will present a concert of
songs as well as chamber works. And on Dec. 6 at Merkin Concert
Hall, an exceptional succession of pianists, including Russell
Sherman, Leon Fleisher, Michael Boriskin and Seymour Lipkin, will
display the range of joy and virtuosity in Perle's writing for
their instrument. Boriskin can also be heard on a new Albany CD in
the First Piano Concerto, which is perhaps Perle's most important
work of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Perle's 12-tone tonal music merges logic with delight. New,
expanded notions of consonance and dissonance are set up, and
invention proceeds as freely and coherently within them as it ever
did in older tonal music.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, rhythmic irregularities are strongly felt against a
persisting background of pulse and meter. Not only Berg but also
Bartok and Stravinsky are important ancestors, though the outcome
is unique: a lucid Classical style without irony, a distinctive
character to each movement, a fluency that flatters the ear.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perle's work on 20th-century music theory and Berg has
won him international renown as a scholar, for him this is
secondary. ``I was always a composer,'' he said recently at his
Manhattan apartment. ``That was all I ever wanted to do in music.''
</P>
<P>
   His first musical experience came when he was 7, and his
father's niece Esther Wieland immigrated to the United States from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, who was also an immigrant from Russia, was a house
painter, but he had an intuitive love of music,'' Perle said. ``And
though he didn't have any money, he bought a piano for her arrival.
He was so proud. So I heard my cousin play the Chopin Etude in F
minor, the first of the `Trois Nouvelles Etudes.' It was a total
shock for me, and I connected with the idea of composing, not
playing. My cousin told me nobody did that anymore, but my mother
said that if that was what I wanted to do, I should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perle also started analyzing music early on. ``I used to sit at
the piano and think,'' he said. ``And my cousin, who lived with us
and gave me my first piano lessons, would wonder what was going on.
I remember very vividly the first technical discovery I made about
music. I noticed that this little folk song I was playing had two
halves that were exactly alike, except that the two chords at the
end of the first eight bars came in the opposite sequence the
second time. So I found for myself a half cadence and a full
cadence. And I just sat there in ecstasy, because this meant that I
could learn to compose, that music wasn't some transcendental thing
that came from somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Those early experiences shaped Perle's life. His mother's advice
made him independent and persistent, and what he taught himself at
the piano was that music had rules to be ascertained and creatively
used. He went on to professional training _ with Wesley La Violette
in Chicago in 1934 and Ernst Krenek in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1939 _
but the big lessons were those he found for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Most crucial was his introduction to 12-tone composition, by way
of the score of Berg's ``Lyric Suite,'' which he first saw in 1937.
Nearly half a century later, he found a copy annotated in Berg's
hand, revealing the work's secret references to a love affair that
was central to the composer's last decade.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But what initially mattered to Perle was the music's technique.
He made observations, and by the time he got to Krenek, he had
formed an understanding of the 12-tone system that was, he was
surprised to find, very different from Schoenberg's: different
especially in embracing tonal features.
</P>
<P>
   He seems never to have doubted that his system was right for his
compositional needs, but it took him a long while _ more than 20
years _ before he was regularly producing works he felt worth
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a big catalog of discarded works,'' he said. ``There's
a whole string quartet that was a kind of miniature work based on
Schoenberg's colossal First Quartet. That was annihilated, though
in a sense it wasn't, because I learned such a lot writing that
piece. There were also a lot of works I saved but withdrew. When
people ask me how many string quartets I've written, I say four:
No. 5, No. 7, No. 8 and No. 9.''
</P>
<P>
   Perle took up a neatly typed list of his compositions (``The
first thing I did when I got the MacArthur fellowship was engage a
part-time secretary,'' he said) and recalled his beginnings as a
composer, more than 60 years ago. ``There's a little organ piece,''
he said. ``It had its first performance on May 11, 1939, and on
that same day the Bartok Third String Quartet was being performed
in Chicago. So I didn't go to my premiere, which was the first real
public concert I had.''
</P>
<P>
   From the late '30s through the late '50s, Perle composed
assiduously, often on a large scale. He mentions a violin concerto
and two symphonies as well as missing numbers in the sequence of
quartets. He turns through page after page of his catalog. But the
only things from this period that he now wants performed are short
and for small forces: songs and little instrumental pieces.
</P>
<P>
   What happened then, at the end of the '50s, that enabled him to
write much more music that would satisfy him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pulling things together,'' he said. ``I don't know what
else to say. I guess I was learning to do what I really wanted to
do. I wanted to do with composition what had always been done with
composition. I wanted it to work as an authentic language, and I
can say what I mean by `authentic' by talking about a question that
occurred to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, in my teaching of music appreciation, I would play
the introduction to `The Rite of Spring.' It meant I heard that
movement quite a bit, and I noticed that the bassoon melody at the
opening starts on C and comes back at the end half a step down.
When something like this happens in tonal music, you can see how
and why it got there. So I asked myself why it happens in the
Stravinsky, and I found the answer. There's a logic that gives us
the potentiality for a real musical language, a language like that
of Bach, Beethoven and Schubert but different, because we have a
different kind of tonal material. We have a 12-tone scale.''
</P>
<P>
   He has got to that language sometimes, he suggested, and he has
also written good pieces without getting to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you which pieces work from this point of view, and
they're all pretty recent,'' he said. ``My First Piano Concerto is
one. It's a big statement. The first movement is about 12 minutes
long, and I think it's coherent in the same way that a piece of
tonal music is coherent. My Fifth String Quartet, which dates back
to 1960, is also successful in this way, but it's on a lesser scale
altogether. Then there are a lot of little pieces: both sets of
etudes for piano and the Nine Bagatelles for piano that I recently
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting more than half a century before he could write the music
he knew he needed to write, Perle kept to his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I knew how dissatisfied I was until later,''
he said. ``I'd go through a period of accepting a piece and then
decide I didn't want to accept it anymore. But I didn't feel
frustrated. I felt just the opposite, optimistic and confident. I
knew what I wanted to do. I knew how to do it, except I didn't know
how to do it yet. But I knew I was on the right track, I knew that
what I wanted to do was important, and I was stimulated and excited
about what was going on in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he still feel optimistic? ``More than ever,'' he said.
``All I need is another 50 years.''

NEW BOND MOVIE (RE)ASSURES US THAT WE'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' sounds like the first James Bond
picture adapted from a Harlequin Romance novel. And that probably
wouldn't have been a bad idea, given how predictable a commodity
the 007 adventures have become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough'' has the mindless proficiency of a 30-year drive-in
window employee; yes, he can do the job, but he should've accepted
the gold watch a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan is back as James Bland ... Bond, and the best
thing to be said about him is that he has developed a particularly
winning bloodthirsty expression in the midst of the stunts and
projectile conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Though you may feel you've seen Brosnan proudly stroke the
lapels of a handmade suit once too often, he's savvy enough to
enjoy getting behind the wheel of the latest BMW and smile for the
weapons assignment/product placement, stripping England's last
bastion of pride of his final vestiges of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Timothy Dalton _ the best actor ever to play Bond, and
who had so much contempt for this Tory that he couldn't even bring
himself to smile _ Brosnan luxuriates in the name-brand
superficiality. ``Enough'' looks like its set design came right off
eBay. (These movies should come with a Web address so you can buy
what Bond is wearing.)
</P>
<P>
   Just before a recent screening of the film, director Michael
Apted talked about coming aboard the Bond franchise to restore a
level of characterization to the film. Which translates into: This
time, it's personal.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, it's personal for M (Dame Judi Dench, who's so
brusque and cool you'd think she was playing Camille Paglia). She
has more at stake in ``Enough.'' M's handling of a friend's
daughter's kidnapping sets things into motion.
</P>
<P>
   The women are given more of an active role in this Bond movie,
and a woman manipulates Bond for the first time. There's Elektra
(Sophie Marceau), who has a pair of liquid eyes runny with hurt.
And nuclear expert Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), who
combines the curviness of pre-politically correct Bond girls (not
to mention the stripper name) with an ability to handle herself
physically. Those ... abilities don't prevent her from delivering
her lines as if English were a second language. She gives the worst
performance since Carey Lowell in ``License to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is even a director of Apted's skills to do with a Bond
film? He's as hamstrung as the equally capable Roger Spottiswode,
who got to ``direct'' ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' _ a movie even
Brosnan didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't direct a Bond film; you follow the constraints of the
boilerplate. Hearing Apted mention ``characterization'' made me
wonder if he were going to scale the Bond conceits back a little
bit, do away with the pre-credit action that's as institutionalized
as ``Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the attempt to explain the villain, Renard (Robert
Carlyle), has a by-the-numbers baroque quality. He has a bullet
lodged in his brain, leaving him so he can feel no pain, a
condition that presumably made it easier to get through the filming
of this picture. (Imagine an actor as imaginative as Carlyle being
rendered glum and nearly passive and you get a sense of what being
in a Bond picture can do to talent. It's the equivalent of swimming
laps with a refrigerator strapped to your back.)
</P>
<P>
   As exciting as the pre-credit sequences always are, it's hard to
build interest in people when a movie has to be launched with a
climax. The Bond movies set the stage for what could by now be
called the Jerry Bruckheimer School of Thrillseeking _ he's the
producer behind such movies as ``The Rock,'' ``Armageddon'' and
``Con Air.'' ``Enough'' begins with a flash and keeps things
popping until your corneas are permanently dilated.
</P>
<P>
   The Bond movies have become the equivalent of comfort food.
Directors _ and the stars _ use them as a way to stabilize their
careers. They were the first films in which the hero tossed off a
pun after dispatching a bad guy in some outrageously visual
fashion, a gesture that has calcified into tradition.

   Their slavish devotion to what has worked in the past is almost
touching, if it weren't so boring. When John Cleese turns up as Q's
new weapons-master in training, you wait for his first pratfall.
(If he had to reprise part of his old act, it's too bad he's not
allowed to fume with hilariously pathetic superiority, like Basil
Fawlty of ``Fawlty Towers''). At least Robbie Coltrane, returning
as the Russian hustler he first played in ``Goldeneye,'' the best
of the recent Bond movies, knows how to stylishly offer pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brosnan shows some energy, this series is so tired that
the movie should be called ``The World Has Passed You By.'' Even
what used to pass for bawdy repartee as Bond sized up his latest
conquest has been outstripped by every sitcom on television. I
think ``Rugrats'' comes closer to lewd wit that James Bond does
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Stevie Wonder used to talk about preferring to stay
in Holiday Inns, because the rooms were all exactly the same.
That's ``The World Is Not Enough'': The best surprise is no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' is rated PG-13 for violence and
sexual innuendo.

ADVERTISING: JOE CAMEL GONE, TOBACCO MAKERS TRY A MORE DIRECT
APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Joe Camel gone, at the federal government's insistence, to
that palm-studded marketing oasis in the sky, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
is turning to the magazine industry to give its biggest nondiscount
brand a boost.
</P>
<P>
   The result is CML, a quarterly printed on oversized matte paper
and featuring what might be called the smoking lifestyle. Described
by a Reynolds spokeswoman as a ``magalog,'' as in both magazine and
catalog, the first issue includes articles on fashion, food, travel
and shopping, plus what is billed as the first installment of a
fiction serial that the magazine modestly characterizes as ``the
trashiest tale this side of Melrose Place.'' There are also ads for
Camel cigarettes as well as for accessories like ashtrays and
lighters _ the better to smoke something with.
</P>
<P>
   Lest CML, which is being mailed this month to hundreds of
thousands of people identified as smokers older than 21 in 30
states, is confused somehow with other lifestyle magazines, say
Martha Stewart Living, a quick look at the food section establishes
where the CML target audience is coming from. The main article,
``Cheat and Eat,'' tells readers how to position themselves as
chefs by relying on packaged foods like Campbell's tomato soup,
Stove Top stuffing (made by Kraft, a division of R.J. Reynolds'
archrival, Philip Morris) and Jiffy corn muffin mix.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the articles about the bars of Miami's South
Beach _ not incidentally, all of the ones that made the list
participate in Camel marketing programs _ and biker dudes at a
festival in Sturgis, S.D., home of the Camel Roadhouse, a bar
declared ``a focal point for the main action'' in a picture caption
accompanying the article.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine begins with ``The CML Charter,'' in which the
difference between Arabian and Bactrian camels are discussed. (The
Camel camel is an Arabian.) The magazine moves on to describe
itself as ``informative, inspiring and above all entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   And, it adds, ``As well as this, you're unlikely to track down a
more inspiring source of exotic new blends from Camel than right
here.'' The blends, which include vanilla-flavored and
citrus-flavored cigarettes, are being marketed solely through the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread changes in the tobacco industry in the last year,
including the settlement agreement that bans some kinds of
cigarette marketing as well as steep price increases and more
competition among brands, led to the decision to produce CML, said
Carole Crosslin, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds. ``We need
advertising vehicles to work harder for us in this new world and to
powerfully communicate our brand's positioning to adult smokers,''
she said. ``CML will provide us with this opportunity to reach
adult smokers with our brand message.''
</P>
<P>
   And other tobacco companies have reached the same conclusion.
Brown &AMP; Williamson, a unit of BAT Industries, began publishing Real
Edge late last year. The magazine focuses on men of a certain
mindset with articles on James Bond and extreme sports. Earlier
this year, the company added Flair, which is aimed at women and
modeled after magazines like Glamour, said Steve Kottak, a Brown &AMP;
Williamson spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris went into the magazine business in 1996 and now
mails Unlimited, published by Hachette Filipacchi, to about 1.8
million households. The magazine, subtitled ``Action, Adventure and
Good Times,'' is ``not about smoking,'' said Michelle Berman, a
vice president and group publisher at the custom publishing
division of Hachette Filipacchi, a subsidiary of Lagardere.
Unlimited has no articles about smoking and no photographs of
people smoking, concentrating instead on outdoor adventure and
other pursuits, Ms. Berman added. ``The only thing you'll see are
Marlboro ads,'' she said. ``It's going to customers who are 21- to
29-year-old smokers. This is really about their lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Brown &AMP; Williamson plans to mail The Art of Simple
Living, which could also be subtitled Not About Smoking. With
articles like ``In Search of the Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie''
and ``Starting School,'' and other features on pumpkin carving and
household money management, the magazine's pilot issue seems to
draw more from Good Housekeeping's train of thought than the
tobacco industry's. But a closer inspection turns up ads for
Carlton, Kool, Capri and Misty Lights cigarettes, all made by Brown
&AMP; Williamson. Like Real Edge and Flair, the magazine is published
by Hearst's custom publishing division.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pecoriello, a tobacco and beverage analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein, said that as billboards and other channels for
advertising had been closed off to tobacco companies, magazines
became more attractive. ``You're going to see more of this type of
direct communication with smokers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Custom publishing in general has surged the last five years as
advertisers seek ways to eliminate the guesswork in getting their
message to the appropriate audience. With custom publishing,
``content can be shaped directly by the advertiser,'' said David
Wilkofsky, the managing partner of Wilkofsky Gruen Associates, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If an advertiser promotes his product on standard
media, he can shape his material but he can't shape the content
surrounding his advertisement.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising, then, that there is nothing approaching
a health-and-fitness section in CML. Fire, smoke and cigarettes
seem to be the dominant themes, set against a vaguely
international, middle-income backdrop. A business profile zeroes in
on Cengiz Emek, the general manager of a Turkish tobacco company.
Turkey, the magazine informs its readers, is ``the smoker's
paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Emek, ``There is something almost shy about the way he
explains that his job is the culmination of a lifelong love affair
with tobacco,'' the article says. ``It started when he smoked his
first cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The global news pages of CML include an article about Swissair's
smoking lounge in the Zurich airport and an update on the
Montserrat volcano, which is apparently attracting tourists once
again. Samsonite's line of clothing also gets a mention, as does a
new Chinese restaurant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is being produced by Wink Media in London, a unit
of Time Warner. Tyler Brule, the creative director, is best known
for Wallpaper, a home and lifestyle magazine that Time Warner
acquired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Philip Morris magazine, CML has no advertising other
than that placed by R.J. Reynolds. Unlimited, on the other hand,
includes ads from Kawasaki, Jack Daniels, JVC Mobile and the
Franklin Mint, Ms. Berman said. Flair has ads from Reebok, Rite Aid
and Subaru. Real Edge includes ads from Honda and Kawasaki.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: THANKSGIVING CROWDS; Y2K JITTERS; CELL PHONE
TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication notice: also sent with `f' code)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Both the AAA and the Air Transport Association predict a
record number of travelers over the Thanksgiving holiday period,
you can pretty well count on crowded highways and skyways. AAA
(formerly the American Automobile Association) is predicting a
record 28 million vehicles on the roads during the holiday period,
while the ATA is predicting almost 20 million airline passengers
between last Friday and next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers returning Sunday should get to the airport extra,
extra early, because an average of 87 percent of airline seats are
expected to be filled that day, the highest percentage of any day
this year. Bookings that day on U S Airways already exceed 90
percent. Thursday the industry average is expected to dip to 44
percent, possibly the lowest percentage of passengers this entire
year. But with airlines cutting back on flights on Dec. 31 _
because of the usual low demand on New Year's Eve, combined with
the reluctance of many people to fly for fear of Year 2000 computer
problems _ that day could easily result in the fewest passengers in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 Toll
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 computer fears appear to have taken a toll already, in
the grounding of a Concorde chartered from Air France by Donald
Pevsner, an aviation lawyer and tour operator. He had expected to
carry 100 or so jet-setters between Paris and New York to celebrate
the millennium in both Europe and the United States. But despite
lowering the one-way price from $10,000 a person to $6,000. Pevsner
canceled the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers whom I sold the flight to for resale _ one bought
30 seats, the other 66 seats _ could not sell more than four seats
between them,'' he said. ``Everybody stood to take an enormous bath
so we called it off,'' he added, attributing the inability to sell
seats on the supersonic plane to ``Y2K nausea.''
</P>
<P>
   Pevsner had chartered the Concorde four times previously, twice
for luxury flights (1989 and 1990) and twice for round-the-world
trips (1992 and 1995), all of which carried dozens of passengers
who paid handsomely for the privilege. The 1992 flight set the
westbound round-the-world record (32 hours, 49 minutes and 3
seconds, including six stops to refuel), the 1995 flight broke the
eastbound record (31:27:49, also with six stops). The flight that
had been scheduled for next month may have broken the record for
futility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleague in Miami approached over 1,300 corporations to
sponsor it, as Coors Light beer sponsored my 1995 flight,'' Pevsner
said, ``but nobody would touch it, even though their logo would
have been all over the plane.'' And the general public balked even
when the price was lowered to $6,000, or not much more than the
standard one-way Paris-to-New York fare on the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' added Pevsner, who now plans to welcome in 2000
from his boat dock in Florida, ``is that everybody believes the
world's coming to an end'' _ a conclusion he scoffs at.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Travelers
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, 51 percent of business travelers took
their cellular phones with them on business trips, 22 percent took
pagers, 20 percent laptop computers and 6 percent hand-held digital
assistants. The respective figures for leisure travelers were 46
percent, 18 percent, 6 percent and 3 percent. The poll, of 1,200
U.S. adults, was conducted by the nonprofit Travel Industry
Association of America. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airline Update
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early next yar, the U S Airways Shuttle will operate
its first flight of the day between New York and Washington at 6
a.m., an hour earlier than currently scheduled. The new, earlier
flight, which will go into effect at both airports, begins Feb. 1
and will operate every business day.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines is rolling out new menus created by
celebrity chefs for first-class passengers on domestic flights.
Dinner menus, for example, include grilled grouper or shrimp scampi
and black bean ravioli with lemon zucchini sauce; lunch includes
soup and hot sandwiches. And meals have been added at nonmeal times
and on flights under 500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder airlines go all out to keep their highest paying
passengers happy. A report issued Tuesday by the International Air
Transport Association found that just over 14 percent of passengers
flew first class or business class last year, but accounted for
almost 32 percent of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Booked in Manhattan
</P>
<P>
   More than 85 percent of Manhattan's hotels will be sold out on
Dec. 31, according to Sean Hennessey of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and
the percentage would have been higher except for recent
cancellations by Brazilians and other foreigners whose nations have
been battered by currency devaluation. But last-minute bookings may
boost occupancy to 93 percent in Manhattan hotels, even though 90
percent of those hotels require a three- or four-day stay
overlapping New Year's Eve.

KEYCORP TO LAY OFF 3,000 EMPLOYEES, 11 PERCENT OF ITS WORKFORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KeyCorp, the Cleveland-based financial company that in five
years has grown from a regional bank into a broader financial
services concern with home equity, investment banking and credit
card operations from Maine to Alaska, said Tuesday that it will lay
off 3,000 employees to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company would not specify how the 11 percent reduction in
its workforce will be carried out over the next 13 months except to
say that it would flatten its management structure.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were made to cope with weak growth in revenue. The
lower labor costs should add a net of 3 cents to 8 cents a share to
earnings next year and more in 2001, said chief executive Robert
Gillespie in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying, yet again, to get the earnings better,'' said
Michael Plodwick, who follows the company for Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Flannigan of Merrill Lynch said that ``even though
management suggests these job cuts can be a net positive to
earnings next year, and even more so in 2001, the market is
reacting with skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   KeyCorp shares, which have been falling since they peaked at
$44.875 in April 1998, closed Tuesday at $25.6875, down 48.4375
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie was unavailable Tuesday to respond to the comments of
analysts, who faulted him for lurching from one strategic
initiative to another without generating expected growth in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Flannigan said that KeyCorp has had ``a number of shifts in
strategy and not as much focus on sticking to a strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   KeyCorp said it would take a fourth-quarter restructuring charge
of up to $180 million. The charge will include $120 million for the
layoffs, consolidating facilities and outsourcing work now done by
employees, $37 million for unneeded software and $20 million in
other one-time charges.
</P>
<P>
   The charge will offset most of the $190 million gain reported
from the sale in October of 28 KeyCorp bank branches on New York's
Long Island to Dime Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   David Hilder of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who had no criticism
of Gillespie's strategic moves, said slow revenue growth is the
major problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Key had been counting on somewhat better revenue in its
capital markets businesses,'' Hilder said, ``partly from its
purchase of McDonald &AMP; Co. a year ago. They found that McDonald
really is not well positioned in the parts of the market that are
growing. McDonald is primarily a regional firm based in Cleveland
and its strengths tend to be in industries that are heavily
represented in that area, not the ones with the greatest growth.''
</P>
<P>
   John Otis, a fixed-income analyst at Bear Stearns, said he is
concerned that too much emphasis is being placed on cutting costs.
``Revenue growth remains sluggish and if you don't have the revenue
growth you have to cut costs to maintain profits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   KeyCorp said in October that it might sell its credit card
business, which would add to the trend towards a few large players
dominating that business. KeyCorp customers have borrowed $1.3
billion on its credit cards. It also owns Champion Mortgage, a home
equity lender.

CLINTON FAILS TO GET WORLD LEADERS TO ATTEND SEATTLE TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has quietly tried _ and failed _
to persuade leaders of major countries to attend next week's huge
trade summit conference in Seattle in order to break political
deadlocks over workers' rights, agricultural subsidies and
America's self-proclaimed authority to block low-cost imports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's concerns were underscored Tuesday when negotiators for
the 135 nations that will attend the conference abandoned their
effort in Geneva to work out an agenda. Their failure calls into
question whether Clinton can achieve many of his negotiating
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Tuesday afternoon, the White House gave
up on its last-minute attempt to persuade the leaders of Japan,
Brazil, the European Community and several developing countries to
attend the conference of the World Trade Organization, after
several leaders said they had scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the conference is to lay the groundwork for a
global ``millennium round'' of trade negotiations, which could last
for at least three years. The inability of the negotiators to reach
an agreement on the agenda after weeks of trying reflects
fundamental disagreements on some of the most politically sensitive
economic issues around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for example, wants Europe to abandon its huge subsidies
for farmers, which he says are protectionist measures designed to
cripple more efficient American producers. The Europeans and the
Japanese have refused, and have said that any trade accord must
include the question of protecting rural communities _ a code-word
for protecting the livelihoods of the farmers who live in those
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton has riled developing nations like India and
Brazil by insisting that the next round of trade talks take up, for
the first time, the question of protections for workers _ allowing
the WTO, for example, to ban the export of goods made by child
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from developing nations say that is merely an effort
by the United States and Europe to erect barriers against low-cost
goods _ and to satisfy their trade unions. It is also an issue for
Vice President Al Gore, who has come under intense pressure from
unions, whose support he will need if he wins the Democratic
presidential nomination, to kill any trade negotiations that do not
make workers' concerns the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Those are only two of the many festering disputes that have
plagued the negotiations leading up to the Seattle session starting
next Tuesday _ which is intended only to begin a negotiating round,
rather than settle any of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the new head of the WTO, Mike Moore, a blunt-speaking former
politician from New Zealand, warned recently that the talks were
``in danger of failure.'' On Tuesday, speaking in Geneva, he said
trade ministers had gone as far as they could and that ``it's now
up to our political bosses to make this a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times over the past few weeks Clinton and his staff have
attempted to get some of those political bosses _ whether
presidents or prime ministers _ to Seattle, hoping that the
pressure of gathering them in one place would force several nations
to compromise. They feared that trade and foreign ministers alone
could not break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks the White House got tangled up in the question of
whom to invite, compiling lists and then abandoning them. ``Every
time we put together a list of names,'' one White House aide said,
``it became clear that we would make 20 enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, to avoid the embarrassment of being explicitly
turned down, Clinton's top aides informally contacted Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan; Romano Prodi, the president of the
European Commission; Thabo Mbeki, the new president of South
Africa; President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil; Prime
Minister John Howard of Australia, and a small number of others.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that the one leader most interested in
attending was the one Clinton would not talk to: Cuban president
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started too late and it just didn't work,'' one White House
official said Tuesday, insisting that no formal invitations were
ever extended and that Clinton had never placed calls directly to
the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating ``trade rounds'' is always contentious business: The
last big negotiation, which created the World Trade Organization
from a weaker predecessor, took years longer than originally
scheduled and left many issues completely unaddressed. And any new
negotiations promise to be even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   New members of the WTO _ soon to include China _ argue that
special rules should be cut for countries most afflicted by poverty
and long isolation from the world economy. And longtime members,
like France, are convinced that the United States is using its
economic rise and unchallenged global power to draft rules that
play to the strengths of American industry.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most bitter arguments have surrounded questions of
labor standards _ a particularly difficult issue for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO, in a formal sense, does not recognize that links
between trade and labor exist,'' Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S.
trade representative, said Tuesday. ``This is not a position which
can endure. It is intellectually indefensible, and it will over
time weaken public support for the trading system.''
</P>
<P>
   But many other countries refuse to discuss labor issues, saying
that they are not interested in having the WTO dictate how much
workers get paid, whether they should be allowed to form unions, or
even how old they must be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a recent visit to India, one of Ms. Barshefsky's top aides,
Sue Esserman, declared that ``great democracies ignore labor issues
at their peril,'' but she failed to persuade India's leaders to
engage in a global study intended to lead the WTO to start setting
labor standards.
</P>
<P>
   There are similar divisions on enforcing intellectual property
rights and other features of past trade accords. Many developing
nations, for example, want more time before they enforce
copyrights, an alien concept in many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The result of these disagreements is that negotiators in Geneva
could not even agree on the scope of the upcoming negotiations. The
European Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, said in Brussels,
Belgium, on Tuesday that ``we are concerned we might not be able to
leave Seattle with a decision on opening a new round.''

   BRITAIN: BOMB ALERT

   Scotland Yard has added street patrols, tightened security in
cities and issued warnings to major companies, utilities and
military and political figures for fear of a possible bombing
campaign by renegade groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace

   NORTHERN IRELAND: QUEEN HONORS POLICE
</P>
<P>
   The queen awarded the George Cross, one of the monarchy's
highest honors, to the Royal Ulster Constabulary for its ``courage
and dedication.'' The award to the mainly Protestant force was
praised by the Ulster Unionist Party, which this weekend will
decide whether to enter government with Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army. A Sinn Fein spokeswoman branded
the action ``grossly offensive.''

   McDonald's restaurants, the repeated focus of anti-American
protests, are fighting back with an advertising campaign
highlighting a policy of buying French farm products. Using the
slogan ``Born in the U.S., made in France,'' the ads promise
McDonald's will not buy American beef, and guarantee its ``basic
products'' are not genetically modified. ``Not bad for a company
accused of poisoning its clients,'' the ads read.

   RUSSIA: JEHOVAH VICTORY
</P>

   The Constitutional Court struck down a key part of a law that
had kept some religions, including Jehovah's Witnesses, from
legally operating in Russia. The court waived for some
non-traditional religions a rule barring their registration unless
they could prove they had existed in Russia for 15 years _ a
difficult hurdle because the Soviet Union banned many faiths. The
court left other curbs on smaller groups intact, and the Jehovah's
Witnesses called the ruling only a partial victory.

   ATLANTA _ When Pavan Kumar stops at a water fountain on a
Chattahoochee River running trail, he no longer is surprised to
detect a bit of an accent in the voice of the guy sweating nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, from Marietta, Ga., by way of India, and his training
partner, Canadian Ron Strilaeff, almost expect to see fellow
runners carrying flags down Peachtree Street on Thursday morning _
and not ones that are red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are among a record number of international entrants
in the Atlanta Marathon and Half-Marathon. The record field of
nearly 9,000 includes at least 58 from more than 19 countries, the
widest international field for the race in its 38 years, including
the marathons leading up to the Olympics. And unlike the Peachtree
Road Race, dominated this decade by winners from other countries,
no prize money lures runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw those numbers, I thought someone pushed the wrong
button on the computer,'' said Atlanta Track Club executive
director Julia Emmons, who oversees details of the 38th marathon
and 16th half-marathon. ``I thought this could not be possible.
This has always been a race for local heroes _ and now we have a
remarkable representation from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the international runners study or work in Atlanta and
remain intensely loyal to their home country. They might reflect
Atlanta's growing diversity, but they definitely are part of the
spread of technology, at least at the track club's Buckhead office.
This year was the first that the track club accepted online
registrations, and most of the foreign runners sent in their
entries that way. The online application included a line where
runners could fill in the country they represent. That line is not
on the paper application.
</P>
<P>
   The race field might have been so diverse in the past. But many
of those who revealed their home countries say that their numbers
prove Atlanta's increasingly international flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic diversity of Atlanta has increased dramatically
since the Olympics,'' Harry Soweija, 42, said. Soweija is a project
manager from Roswell who will wear a cap emblazoned with the
green-red-and-blue Namibian flag with a sunrise in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Nigeria, Iceland, South Africa, Netherlands, Finland,
Argentina, Austria, Colombia, England, Hungary, Japan, Mexico,
Ireland, Panama, Sweden, Switzerland and Germany are some of the
other countries represented in Thursday's race.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that running helps them cope with adjusting to a new
culture and gives them an outlet for stress and a chance to make
new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I move to a new place, I like to run popular local
races, because it is the best way to get to know the city, people,
culture and other runners,'' said Emi Yang, 36, a housewife from
Japan who has lived in Atlanta for about a year and will run the
half-marathon. ``I think one of the reasons for the big
international turnout for the Atlanta half- and full marathon is
because there are an increasing number of newcomers who want to
experience local festivity.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kumar and Strilaeff, their roots in countries of the British
Commonwealth gave them a common ground while working in adjoining
cubicles at UCB, a Belgian-based chemical company. Their friendship
really took off when Strilaeff, a triathlete and accomplished
runner who has qualified for the Boston Marathon, helped coach
Kumar to his first road race, on Labor Day. After Kumar enjoyed
that challenge, the pair began training for the half-marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about (our differences) when we train,''
Strilaeff, 43, said. ``Running is sort of a transparent culture for
everyone. ... There's pretty good camaraderie among runners
regardless of location. It's kind of like a miniature of the
Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally agree that running transcends cultural
differences,'' said Kumar, 36. ``And I think there is a lot of
diversity here in Atlanta, and there is unity in that diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   A smattering of runners will travel here to run the race from
their home countries, many of them to visit friends or family or
because the city and the race has a warm reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a enormous admiration for the city and an immense
respect for the race itself,'' said Wilson Gaitan, 30, a computer
scientist from Colombia who will travel from New York. ``The
running of the marathon in the Olympics in 1996 has given Atlanta
an important place in the world of marathons. The Atlanta Marathon
is a very common name among New York runners. ... These few facts
give me an idea of the international diversity experienced in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter their origin, runners don't enter Thursday's races of
13.1 and 26.2 miles to get a fast time. The courses follow
rigorous, hilly terrain, with a northern crest at Chamblee and the
finish line at Turner Field. About 95 percent of it replicates the
1996 Olympic marathon course.
</P>
<P>
   The international runners, for the most part, take on this
challenge for the same reasons as the American-born entrants.
</P>
<P>
   For structural engineer Zsolt Nemedi, 31, of Hungary, there's
the satisfaction of completing a historic, tough course. ``I enjoy
running through the city, especially knowing that I am running in
the footsteps of Olympians.''
</P>
<P>
   For Joost M. Kutsch Lojenga, 28, an international tax consultant
from the Netherlands, the half-marathon keeps him motivated to run
while he is in Atlanta on a three-month assignment. ``It takes away
the bore that sometimes comes up when running longer distances
without an event coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sigurbjorn Arni Arngrimsson of Iceland, 26, an exercise
physiology student at University of Georgia, the half-marathon is a
great way to stay in shape for other sports. He runs track in the
spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   For Bruce and Laurie Diamond of Toronto, they combine enjoying
the physical challenge with visiting friends and family in Atlanta,
his hometown. She will be doing the half-marathon while six months
pregnant. ``As I get older,'' her husband said, ``I use this as a
measure to make sure that I can still run at least a
half-marathon.'' For Canadian Mike Perry, 46, the half-marathon
became a goal after his wife ``called me a flat slob,'' he said.
``I haven't run this far since college.'' His sentiments are echoed
by Engin Toksoz, 40, of Turkey, who described himself as ``a former
couch potato'' motivated by ``a midlife crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a momentary relapse of good sense,'' said Gary
Binfield, 33, of England, entered in the marathon. ``I'm a former
Olympic swimmer and can't resist a competitive challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   For Yang, there's the traditional American feast a few hours
after crossing the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone from the Far East, simply eating turkey, mashed
potato and pumpkin pie on the Thanksgiving Day is an interesting
experience,'' she said. ``This year, it will be more interesting
because I get to see what many Atlantans do in the freezing
Thanksgiving Day morning.''

 David Bahr's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about
``Love Reinvented,'' a series of 10 short films about AIDS.  
 By DAVID BAHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sporting several days' stubble, a forearm tattoo and
camouflage fatigues, Tim Roth sits at a table in a sleek Manhattan
hotel looking oddly battle-ready. ``I'm prepared for anything,'' he
says after a sip of bottled water. ``I'm bulletproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he's an actor preparing for the opening, on Dec. 10,
of his directorial debut, ``The War Zone.'' And he has reason to be
wary. Based on the British writer Alexander Stuart's novel about a
family destroyed by incest, the film is an unflinching adaptation
of a disturbing story that has already provoked sharply divided
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   When the novel was published, in 1989, it was variously praised
by reviewers as ``savagely seductive,'' ``sharp'' and ``sensuous.''
But it had its detractors. After being awarded Britain's Whitbread
Prize that year, it was stripped of the honor when one of the
judges objected to the book's treatment of incest. The judge called
the novel ``repellent'' and its author ``disturbed,'' Stuart says.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that when the film opened in Britain in
September, a few critics there were similarly outraged. ``There
were some people who said it should not be made,'' Roth says. ``And
they're absolutely welcome to their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, the film centers on a family of four, the simply
named Dad (Ray Winstone), Mum (Tilda Swinton) and their children
Jessie (Lara Belmont) and Tom (Freddie Cunliffe), the last two
actors newcomers. As the story begins, they have just moved from
London to a bleakly beautiful seaside town in Devon, in the
southwest of England.
</P>
<P>
   Against a blustery backdrop of crashing winter waves and craggy
cliffs, the family lives a laconic life of solemn adjustment. Tom,
apparently an ordinary adolescent upset about the move, is
withdrawn, sulky and watchful. Returning home late one afternoon,
he spies his sister in the bathroom with Dad engaged in something
seemingly sexual. Jessie, confronted by Tom, at first denies it,
but the ever-vigilant brother soon uncovers more evidence until he
(and the audience) witnesses his father savagely sodomizing his
sister in a bunker, a remnant of wartime Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Culminating in unresolved violence reminiscent of Greek tragedy,
the film recalls the European art-house style of Andrei Tarkovsky
and Ingmar Bergman with its lingering camera shots and unnerving
stillness. Roth acknowledges the influence of both auteurs, as well
as his early experience as a painter, in his approach to ``The War
Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the audience a chance to reflect on what they are
seeing,'' he says of such deliberative techniques. ``Although I did
have film references, I thought more about painting when I was
doing `The War Zone.' It's a wonderful exercise in silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Though eager to direct for some time, Roth says, he held off
because he couldn't find the right project. ``Directing takes a
good three years,'' he explains. ``I didn't want to be away from
acting that long. I was worried they wouldn't want me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter the producer Sarah Radclyffe (``My Beautiful Laundrette,''
``Caravaggio''), who met Roth when they were working on Chris
Menges' film ``A World Apart'' in 1987. Having heard that Roth was
looking for something to cut his directorial teeth on, she gave him
Stuart's book in 1996 and urged him to consider it. He read it and
immediately decided to make the leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I finished it, it was never, `Should I do it?''' he
says. ``It was, `How the hell am I going to do it?' It broke my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Setting out ``to break everyone else's heart,'' as he says, Roth
brought in Stuart to write the screenplay and began searching for
likable actors with whom the audience could identify. As the
pregnant Mum, he cast the usually winsome Ms. Swinton, who, having
actually given birth just before shooting, is radiantly plump in
the film. Perhaps less expectedly, he cast Winstone as Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Roth had strong reservations about Winstone, whose
portrayal of a monstrous wife beater in Gary Oldman's ``Nil by
Mouth'' was completely at odds with the way the director envisioned
Dad. But when the two men met, and Winstone told Roth that it would
be great to play ``a nice guy for a change,'' Roth knew he had his
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want Ray's character to be a monster,'' Roth says.
``If I made him a big Blue Meanie, it might make us feel good as a
viewer: `He is the Devil; he can't be me.' But I wanted him to be
one of us, the guy down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart agrees. ``I couldn't have written a gross condemnation
against abusers,'' he says in a telephone interview from his home
in Los Angeles. ``That would be foolhardy, since most abusers have
themselves been victims. Just to see the abuser as a monster
doesn't really solve any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Winstone is less compassionate toward his character. He
confesses to neither liking nor understanding the role. He took it,
he explains, to work with Roth and challenge himself as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only character I ever played that I didn't like,'' he
says by telephone from England, uneasily admitting that portraying
the wife beater in ``Nil by Mouth'' bothered him less. ``Funny
thing is, I was actually playing me more than any other character I
played, not in the sense of abuse, but in being a dad and making
tomatoes and toast and talking to his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Winstone almost quit at one point, while filming the bunker
scene. ``I questioned myself why should I put myself and this young
girl through this,'' he says. ``But ridiculous as it sounds, she
got me through it. She came up afterward and thanked me, which
obviously helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back to how it felt playing the sexually precocious yet
vulnerable Jessie, Ms. Belmont, 19, recalls: ``Ray was amazing. He
didn't make it feel like rape, but the whole atmosphere while
filming this thing was that nobody wanted to be there. Even the
sound guy was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belmont, who was discovered by the film's casting directors
on the street while shopping in London, says the hardest part was
taking the role, not doing it, even though she had no previous
acting experience. ``I really understood her,'' she says. ``Not
because I'd been abused. It's just the stuff she did and said. I
really felt something for her. When I went to see Tim for the first
time, he goes, `What do you think?' I said: `It's really truthful.
I should imagine being abused is a bit like that. I can do it, but
I don't know if I want to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roth says he consulted victims of sexual abuse in making film
and even hired some for the crew. ``So many abused people worked on
this to get it right,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If audience reaction is any gauge, he does seem to have gotten
it right. He cites numerous instances in which people have come to
him after viewing the film, thanked him and then recounted,
sometimes for the first time, experiences similar to Jessie's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exhausting,'' he says, rubbing his temples.
``Victims have been coming out of the audience in huge amounts. And
I'm not a therapist, and it's been really, really __'' He pauses,
sighing. ``This was one thing I was not prepared for, the amount of
people standing up in screenings and saying: `I've never talked
about this in my life. That's what it's like. That happened to
me.'''

LEGAL CONCERNS MEAN MCDONNELL DOUGLAS WON'T FULLY MERGE WITH BOEING
YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   Legally, enough to keep The Boeing Co. at arm's length from
McDonnell Douglas Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Company lawyers have decided, at least for the time being, not
to fully merge McDonnell Douglas into Boeing because of concerns
about a recent federal indictment against McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted
McDonnell Douglas Corp. for its part in an alleged conspiracy
allowing machine tools intended for a commercial aircraft venture
to end up at a Chinese military factory.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnel Douglas has said it did nothing wrong, and when it
learned the tools were diverted it reported this to the U.S.
government. The tools were never used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The violations of U.S. export laws alleged in the government's
indictment took place more than two years before Boeing acquired
McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For administrative and tax reasons, McDonnell Dougals Corp.
remained a separate corporate entity, or subsidary, of Boeing after
the merger. That is not unusual in big mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, McDonnell Douglas is still a corporation with its
own name.
</P>
<P>
   That was supposed to change at the end of business on Dec. 31,
when, according to a Boeing memo obtained by the
Post-Intelligencer, McDonnell Douglas would cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Boeing North America, which was formerly
Rockwell International's space and defense business that Boeing
acquired in late 1996, also would be fully merged into Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the merger of the two previously acquired businesses
had been in the works for months.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, James Johnson, Boeing's corporate secretary,
notified Boeing Chairman Phil Condit and other top executives that
only Boeing North American would be merged into the company at
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo, Johnson said the merger of McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
which it referred to as MDC, would be delayed pending a resolution
of the government indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the adverse consequences of the indictment, or any
conviction, would be limited to MDC,'' Johnson wrote. ``However, if
MDC were merged into Boeing, there would be significant exposure to
Boeing with respect to its commercial and military business.'
</P>
<P>
   Boeing corporate spokesman Larry McCracken said there are
administrative expenses in keeping McDonnell Douglas and Boeing
North America as separate corporate entities. Merging both into
Boeing would eliminate those extra costs.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the indictment, McCracken said, ``it was decided
it was prudent to wait until this is resolved.'' Boeing North
America will be merged into Boeing as planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts noted that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
consolidated operations and earnings when the merger was approved
in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change anything that goes on as far as how the
business operates,'' Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragan MacKenzie,
said of the delay in merging McDonnell Douglas into Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the outside world, Boeing will look no different,'' he
said. ``And inside Boeing, there will not be any noticeable
difference either _ other than to finance and legals folks.''

WANT A BALLOON IN THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE? NO PROBLEM FOR
$200,000 OR MORE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone who goes to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade knows there is a price to be paid: Getting up at dawn to
grab a curbside spot, getting squashed by hordes of out-of-towners,
getting home too late to put the turkey in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   But at least it's not $200,000 _ or more. That is what companies
say they pay to get their mascots and cartoon characters made into
the super-sized balloons that are the parade's inflatable icons.
Almost all of the big balloons have sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   In return for their investment, the companies are guaranteed a
place in the parade for three years, exposure to the eyeballs of
almost 60 million television viewers and a chance to approve the
scripts read by NBC's commentators (and you thought Katie and Matt
were ad-libbing). And there may be other tie-ins; the Honey Nut
Cheerios bee balloon, new this year, is pictured on the back of
cereal boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And in these days of ``product placement,'' ``brand building''
and advertising just about everywhere, the companies get something
that is hard to come by: a commercial that does not look like a
commercial. And for less than the cost of a 30-second spot on the
``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is, of course, a commercial enterprise, but it refuses to
utter a word about anything as crass as money, at least when it
comes to the parade. The event, the company says, is a gift to the
city. And it is obviously an expensive gift _ Macy's has a
substantial staff devoted to the parade (and other annual events,
like the July 4th fireworks over the East River).
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless sponsorship pervades the event. John Deere makes
the parade's ``official utility vehicle,'' for example, while the
``all-new 2000 GMC Yukon XL'' is the ``official float vehicle,''
Macy's says.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate partnerships date back decades, to the days when
Walt Disney personally supervised the creation of the Mickey Mouse
balloon, said Jean McFaddin, who has been producing and directing
the parade since 1977. When she took over, the parade, like the
city itself, was a little threadbare; financial support from other
companies helped Macy's spiff things up and keep the parade fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not just any old cartoon character can get into the
parade. The folks at General Mills were worried that their mascot
bee might be too commercial to make the cut, said Liv Lane, a
company spokeswoman. Though when it comes to children's characters,
she added, ``It's hard to find one that isn't, anymore.'' The
company paid about $200,000 to get the bee in the parade, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, Macy's might have rejected it out of hand just a
year or two ago, Ms. McFaddin said. Not enough personality, she
said, adding that recently the bee seemed to have developed a sense
of humor. ``He's really funny, and bees are wonderful _ kids love
bees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it wasn't a dog. Ms. McFaddin works hard to make sure the
parade has lots of variety, and there is already a big canine corps
in the parade this year. In addition to a new version of Snoopy,
there will also be Blue, the star of Nickelodeon's ``Blue's Clues''
and a passion among the preschool set.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Pets.com mascot, which might have been a new
balloon except that the company decided to participate in the
parade only a few weeks ago. And the fact that ``the shape would
not have made a good balloon,'' Ms. McFaddin said.
</P>
<P>
   So the dog, who has no name other than ``the Pets.com
sock-puppet dog,'' will be a 36-foot tall ``falloon,'' which is
what Macy's calls a balloon that rides on a float. And the company
is delighted. ``He'll be cruising down the Great White Way,'' said
John Hommeyer, vice president for marketing at the company, which
sells pet-related merchandise over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While Macy's approached Pets.com, Hommeyer said, many companies
knock on Macy's door. If Ms. McFaddin is convinced that the
character is really popular with kids, and that the addition of a
new float or balloon will add some pizazz to the parade, then the
work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's builds all the balloons and floats, in consultation with
the sponsors. First, there is a clay model, then two fiberglass
models and then _ a giant balloon. The new balloons get a trial run
on a field in Hoboken, N.J.; this year it was on Nov. 7, Ms.
McFaddin said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the balloons are clearly corporate creations,
despite their sponsorship. Most children who see Maurice Sendak's
Wild Thing, for example, will think of Max and his trip to ``Where
the Wild Things Are,'' not of Bell Atlantic, which is sponsoring
the balloon.
</P>
<P>
   But the bee is not the only commercial character; the Nesquik
Bunny is making his 12th appearance in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing gurus say that Macy's must walk a fine line if it is
to preserve its own brand, which is the parade itself (some New
Yorkers have been known to call it ``The Macy's Day Parade,''
leaving out the Thanksgiving altogether).
</P>
<P>
   The bee may be a bit much, said Allen Adamson, managing director
of Landor Associates, a consulting firm. ``Real commercial icons
cross over the line of what's wholesome fun and what's product
endorsement,'' he said. Noting that brands have become pervasive in
American life, he added that ``If you're standing at the parade
getting some fresh air and get pitched by a cereal company, that
hits the overload button for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies say it is well worth the cost (if not exactly
cheap at the price).``It is a significant out-of-pocket expense,''
said Ruth Sarlin, senior vice president for brands at Nickelodeon,
which, she said, is paying about $280,000 for the Blue balloon.
``As a promotional expense, I wouldn't call it a bargain, but it is
an extremely good value, a good investment.''
</P>
<P>
   And both the balloons and the parade somehow remain magic. When
she first saw Blue fly, Ms. Sarlin said, ``It was very thrilling.''
So thrilling that even though she has 23 people coming to
Thanksgiving dinner in New Jersey, she said, ``I'm actually going
to the parade for the first time in my life.''

ALBANIANS IN KOSOVO GRATEFUL THAT U.S. ARMY IS THERE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UROSEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Braving the first snow of the year,
hundreds of Kosovo Albanians packed the main street here Tuesday to
try to glimpse President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Blocked by U.S. soldiers standing atop armored troop carriers,
many of the Albanians could see only the presidential helicopter
lifting off behind the trees, but they were in happy mood and
cheered and whistled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albanians have really strong feeling for Clinton,'' said Fetah
Selimi, 34, a builder, who brought his two small daughters and a
pair of binoculars to try to spot the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the father of the world,'' said Mohamet Lushi, 15, who
was wearing a purple hooded sweatshirt and had a broad grin. ``It's
a big pleasure. We are very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians in Urosevac, or Ferizaj as they call the town,
said that more than anyone else, Clinton was the person they
thanked for delivering them from persecution by the Serbian
authorities and allowing them to return home from refugee camps
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government sent troops and
paramilitary units into Kosovo, the southern province of Serbia, to
put down an independence movement by the largely Albanian
population.
</P>
<P>
   After NATO started bombing in April, thousands of the Kosovo
Albanians were killed or forced to flee into the hills or to
neighboring countries and regions. After NATO peacekeepers arrived,
many of the refugees were able to return.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit Tuesday was seen as another sign of his support
for Albanians in the face of Serbian aggression and even as a hint
of support for Kosovo's future independence, although the United
States has not taken a position in favor of independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is being treated like an independent place that can
expect and be host to guests, even world-ranking guests, without
having to ask permission from anyone,'' wrote an independent
Albanian-language daily, Kosovo Sot.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call, during his visit, for Albanians to try to
forgive what was done to them fell on mostly deaf ears. ``There is
no possibility of living together with the Serbs,'' said Suat
Berisha, 30, a trader who was standing in the crowd. ``We don't
like them. We respect Clinton, but we cannot love the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Behar Bajrami, 49, a factory worker, added: ''We would respect
what he says. The problem is, we can only forgive someone who has
no blood on his hands, and there is not anyone like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Urosevac was a grim staging post for hundreds of thousands of
Kosovo's Albanians during the expulsions by Serbian forces earlier
this year. People were herded from the surrounding villages and
mountains to the railway station here and packed onto trains headed
for neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Now the town is under the control of U.S. peacekeepers, and just
down the road lies a vast U.S. Army base, Camp Bondsteel, which
houses 6,000 troops. Most Serbs have left, and for the local
Albanians, Bondsteel is seen as the guarantor of their safety and
freedom from Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling three hilltops, Camp Bondsteel looks like a whole
city under construction. It flashes with the lights of earth movers
and trucks shifting mounds of soil and gravel. Lines of huts for
the soldiers have sprung up in recent weeks. At night the orange
glow of the camp's lights can be seen from miles around.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled about Camp Bondsteel, but far from
complaining about the intrusion, the villagers living in a small
settlement opposite the camp, Sojevo, say they are delighted to
have it on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get no trouble from a rich man,'' said a local farmer,
Berat Mehmeti, whose 18-year-old daughter has a job at the Burger
King on the base.
</P>
<P>
   He said his fields had been swallowed up in the vast sprawl of
the camp and were now off limits to him. ``They told me do not even
come close or you will get a bullet,'' he said. ``But that's not a
problem. They got rid of the Serbs for us _ they can have the land
for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Bondsteel is a welcome source of jobs and an endless
subject of discussion among the locals. ``There are 5,000 Albanians
working there,'' said Oruc Hyseni, the energetic owner of the
village flour mill, which is across the road from the camp. ``It's
a great pleasure to have them here. I would close up my mill and go
there if I could get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, he said, he values the camp because of its
political significance. ``I hope they stay forever,'' he said. ``We
will pray toward that end. The Serbs burned all my property. We
were hiding up in the mountains for seven weeks. Now I am just
happy to see the Americans here in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the scale and complexity of Camp Bondsteel give it a
sign of permanence. Army spokesmen at the camp explained recently
that the experience in Bosnia had taught them to build permanent
structures for the troops immediately, rather than make do with
tents through the first winter.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers from other countries are not building on such a
large scale. They are using tents or existing buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 200 buildings for sleeping quarters, the Army has
built a gym, a PX, a chapel, a post office, a barber shop and a
mess hall. There is a state-of-the-art hospital, housed in a
network of tents and prefabricated units but with equipment
superior to anything in any other medical center in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That has raised some criticism in Kosovo, since the U.S. troops
will be far better looked after than hundreds of thousands of the
Kosovo Albanians, who will have to brave the winter in tents
pitched among the burned ruins of their houses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. peacekeeping operation is seen by some aid and
peacekeeping officials as detracting from the effort to help
Kosovo's civilians. Army trucks take precedence over loads of aid
supplies at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Root, the Houston-based company that has the U.S. Army
building contract, has hired many of Kosovo's best builders for the
base. They are people who could be repairing houses for homeless
refugees instead, said Peter Kessler, spokesman for the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Albanians in Sojevo are understanding, even though 40
percent of their houses are damaged. ``Certainly they have to set
up themselves up first,'' Mehmeti said of the U.S. troops. ``They
have to sort out their own security. Then maybe they will help
us.''

POLITICAL BRIEFS: CALIFORNIA, MISSISSIPPI, MINNESOTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polls and Politicos See California Long Shot  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Tom Campbell, a Republican from California's 15th
Congressional District, announced last Friday that he was jumping
into the race to unseat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a liberal Democrat,
he declared the task ``do-able.'' Most political experts think
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   They note that while the senator has had a mixed record in
statewide campaigns, winning re-election in 1994 by only two
percentage points, her popularity and job-approval numbers have
since been steadily improving.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the experts believe that Campbell, an ideological
moderate and something of a political maverick, will probably not
be able to raise the huge amount of money needed to challenge an
incumbent senator in the nation's most populous state, in good part
because the California Republican Party has taken such a beating in
recent elections that it is deeply dispirited and disorganized.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a poll that seems to support the experts'
conclusion that Campbell faces long odds.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by Research 2000 for the San Francisco Examiner and
televisiion KCRA, it found Feinstein leading Campbell better
than 4 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   A poll in mid-October by the Field Poll of California put the
senator ahead by about 5 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the Research 2000 survey, Campbell easily outdistanced other
Republicans planning to run, including Ron Unz, a wealthy
businessman who has been a force in Republican politics in
California in recent years. But Campbell's contention in his
announcement that his political moderation would help him pull
Democratic and independent votes away from Senator Feinstein
appears, at least for now, to be fallacious.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot for Open Seat Has One Empty Slot
</P>
<P>
   And what of the coming election in the 15th Congressional
District now that Campbell is leaving?
</P>
<P>
   The district, just south of San Francisco in the San Jose area,
leaned mostly Democratic until Campbell captured it in a special
election in 1995, playing up his credentials as a political
moderate. But with no Republican incumbent to contend with and the
Republican hold on the House down to a handful of seats, Democratic
leaders are thirsting to win back the district.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, they have been unable to settle on a favorite
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, on the other hand, have already settled on a
well-known state legislator, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen. And, they
note, like Campbell, Cunneen practices a moderate brand of
Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Stop the Train; He's Not Getting Off  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been three weeks, and still the folks in Mississippi
don't know who will be their next governor.
</P>
<P>
   But what now seems certain (maybe) is that the mess left by the
Nov. 2 vote, which ended with no candidate having a clear majority,
will be cleaned up Jan. 4 by members of the Mississippi House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The second round of counting has been completed and it changed
nothing. Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, the Democrat, ended up with 49.6
percent of the vote and former United States Representative Mike
Parker, the Republican, ended up with 48.5 percent. Minor
candidates got the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Mississippi constitution, a result like that throws
the election into the state House.
</P>
<P>
   As for the requirement under Mississippi law that a winning
candidate for governor must capture not only a majority of the
popular vote but also a majority of the vote in 62 of the state's
122 House districts, well, that is moot because of the failure of
either candidate to meet the first requirement. But for what it's
worth, each man carried 61 districts.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen when the state House votes?
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three of the 122 members are Democrats and 53 of them,
according to a count by The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, are already
on record as favoring Musgrove.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But wait ...
</P>
<P>
   Parker is still under a lot of pressure to bow out, some of it
coming from editorial writers and columnists but most from
frustrated Democrats. They contend he is a sore loser and is
embarrassing the state by hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   He has refused to comment other than at a brief press conference
right after the election in which he was essentially noncommittal.
In fact, he has seldom been seen around the state since Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday he surfaced briefly, telling a Jackson television
station, WLBT, that he had no intention of backing down and would
let the state's Constitution and laws decide the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only one who can stop this train,'' he said, ``and I
would always feel that I didn't do what I was supposed to do if I
did stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, House chamber. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Twin Cities Churches Take On the Governor  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura declared a couple of
months back that religion was nothing but a ``crutch for
weak-minded people''?
</P>
<P>
   The ``weak-minded'' have replied to the growlly voiced former
professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise.
</P>
<P>
   They did not turn the other cheek, though maybe that would have
been the better part of valor.
</P>
<P>
   They chose tongue-in-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, 68 churches in Minneapolis and St. Paul, calling
themselves Christian Churches of the Twin Cities, ran a full-page,
$13,500 ad in the Star Tribune that listed their addresses and
phone numbers and proclaimed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Strength training for the `weak-minded.' There's a work-out
location near you. Find out if Jesse is right.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they wanted to ``engage the governor in a meaningful
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   His office called the ad ``pretty clever'' because it was ``all
about giving people a choice.''

REAR ADM. WALTER FORD, 95, DESTROYER COMMANDER, CIA CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Walter Chilcott Ford, a destroyer commander in World
War II and the executive director of the newborn CIA in the later
1940s, died Nov. 20 at the Mariner Health facility in Bethesda, Md.
He lived in Annapolis and would have turned 96 on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Ford spent 40 years in the Navy and the Maritime Administration.
After his retirement in 1961, he worked as a maritime consultant
and corporate director.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buffalo, N.Y., Walter Ford graduated from the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis in 1925. He reached the rank of captain soon
after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States
entered the war.
</P>
<P>
   Serving in the South Pacific, he commanded the USS Perkins and
Destroyer Squadron 23 and saw combat in the Battle of the Coral Sea
and the Guadalcanal campaign. His conduct at the Coral Sea earned
him a Bronze Star and his night operations against Japanese forces
at Guadalcanal brought a Silver Star and assignment as
administrative aide to the undersecretary of the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Congress decreed the transformation of Gen. William
Donovan's Office of Strategic Services into the CIA. Ford was named
its executive director and served until 1949, after which he was
assistant naval chief of staff for intelligence in the Eastern
Atlantic and Mediterranean command.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to the Maritime Administration in 1954 and served
intermittently as deputy and acting administrator until his
retirement. He instituted various shipping programs, encouraged
research and oversaw the construction of the country's first
nuclear merchantship, the Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is survived by a daughter, Barbara Rosin of Columbia, S.C.;
9 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. His wife of 66 years,
Channez Gates Ford, died in 1992.

CONGRESSMAN WANTS CASTRO ARRESTED IF HE SHOWS UP AT WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The promised warm welcome for Fidel Castro in Seattle
will be a lot chillier if a Florida congressman has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., has asked Washington state
Attorney General Christine Gregoire to arrest Castro if the Cuban
leader comes to town for the meeting of the World Trade
Organization next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully request that you take all necessary actions so
that Fidel Castro may be charged forthwith so that he an be
arrested in the United States to stand trial for the murders of
Armando Alejandre, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena and Pablo
Morales,'' Diaz-Balart wrote to Gregoire, referring to the three
U.S. citizens and one U.S. resident who died in 1996 when the Cuban
military shot down two U.S. civil aircraft in international
airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart cited as precedent the treatment of former Chilean
leader Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is in custody in Britain fighting
extradition to Spain on torture charges, and former Panamanian
military leader Manuel Noriega, who was convicted in the United
States of cocaine trafficking, racketeering and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire's spokeswoman, Liz Menidzabal, said Castro's behavior
is not an issue for state authorities, but rather a question for
the federal government. Castro last travelled to the United States
in 1995, when he was in New York for the 50th anniversary of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has not said whether he will come to Seattle, but several
organizations are preparing to welcome him. His attendance at the
WTO meeting has been encouraged by Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who
has offered to host a session at which Castro could talk with
members of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Castro could be the only world leader, besides Clinton, to come
to Seattle. A White House spokeswoman said Tuesday that Clinton has
abandoned the notion of rounding up a group of industrial nation
leaders to come to Seattle because it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Prime Minister John Howard of Australia had reported
that he was one of as many of 30 world leaders the White House was
hoping to bring to Seattle during the WTO to talk up global trade.
The White House said its goals were more modest, and by Tuesday it
seemed to have given up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an idea that we explored with the WTO, but given the
late nature of it, it wasn't practical,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is not on Clinton's invitation list, but is still
considering a visit to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Castro comes he'll be welcomed in Seattle,'' said
McDermott's spokesman, David Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what you think about how the Cuban regime
operates, it seems clear people in Seattle want to engage with Cuba
and establish some kind of relationship with that country,''
Schaefer said. ``I don't think Diaz-Balart represents the
mainstream of American thought. He represents a small constituency
in Miami that has their own concerns and they've got a right to
express them, but my boss's view is that it's time to end the trade
embargo and move on.''

SURGERY IMMINENT FOR RELIEVER GORDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox relief pitcher Tom Gordon could undergo elbow
surgery as early as next week, as representatives of the
commissioner's office and players union have made progress in
resolving the disagreement between the player and the club
regarding his medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery would be performed by Lewis Yocum, the noted
orthopedist who serves as team doctor for the Anaheim Angels. The
Red Sox no longer are opposed to Yocum doing the surgery, according
to a source familiar with the discussions between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Gordon agree that because of a bone spur that is
affecting the ligament, his elbow requires open surgery, as opposed
to arthroscopic surgery, which would be less invasive. Yocum is in
agreement with Red Sox team doctor Arthur Pappas on that point, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas remains hopeful that Gordon's elbow can be repaired
without Tommy John tendon-transfer surgery, which requires a
reconstruction of the ligament using a tendon grafted from the
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Yocum) believes he could debride (cut away) the spur
without damaging the ligament, then he would attempt to do that,''
the source said. ``If he believes it can't be done, then he'll do
the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference of opinion is the predictions the doctors
are making. Dr. Pappas's prediction is a little more optimistic
than Dr. Yocum's.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon pitched just 3 2/3 innings for the Red Sox after June 12,
when he was placed on the disabled list for a second time with what
was described as a strained right elbow. At that time, the Red Sox
recommended rest and rehabilitation, though Pappas said that if the
elbow did not respond, reconstructive surgery could be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, there was a conference call in which Gordon, his
agent, Jeff Borris, and Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette
participated, along with representatives from the players' union
and commissioner's office. Enough progress was made at that time, a
source said, that remaining details have been left for the player
and the club to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Sox players already have had surgery since the end of
the season. Pitcher Bret Saberhagen had surgery to repair a torn
rotator cuff in his right shoulder, which probably will sideline
him until at least midseason. Third baseman John Valentin underwent
arthroscopic surgery to remove a bone spur beneath his left
kneecap. Infielder Donnie Sadler had surgery to repair damage to
the labrum in his right shoulder. And pitcher Juan Pena had an
appendectomy. Valentin, Sadler, and Pena are expected to be ready
for the start of spring training.

   CHARITY FACES ALLEGATIONS OF SHODDY MEDICAL PRACTICE
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, serious allegations of shoddy medical
practices and questions about direction and conduct have stirred
bitter struggles within Operation Smile, a charity that raises
money to provide surgery for thousands of children a year who
suffer facial deformities but live in countries lacking skilled
physicians or money for the procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegations focus on the medical operations
themselves. Critics contend that the organization has put volume
and publicity over safety, leading to high numbers of complications
and even deaths.
</P>
<P>
   SOME LEADERS TO SKIP TRADE MEETING
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has quietly tried _ and failed _ to persuade
leaders of major countries to attend next week's trade meeting in
Seattle in order to break political deadlocks over worker's rights,
agricultural subsidies and America's self-proclaimed authority to
block low-cost imports.
</P>
<P>
   SHIFTING GEARS ON THE FAST TRACK
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a laid-back management style worked for
Christopher Williams, the founder and chief executive of the
Williams Capital Group, a boutique investment bank. But his
start-up grew so fast that he had to shift gears. He replaced his
open-door policy with a more aloof stance. He began writing
memorandums. And to enhance performance, Williams set up a
profit-sharing plan this year and recently inaugurated peer
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   METLIFE PLANS STOCK ISSUE IN SPRING
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life intends to file a formal plan with New York
state regulators today for a reorganization in which the life
insurer will issue shares next spring. The stock would instantly
become the most widely held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT-TAKING SENDS STOCKS LOWER
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled as investors took profits. The NASDAQ composite
index slipped 49.69 points, or 1.46 percent, to 3,342.87. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 93.89 points, to 10,995.63. And the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 16.30 points, or 1.15
percent, to 1,404.64.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell slightly, leaving the yield on the benchmark
30-year issue at 6.19 percent, its highest level in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Stock Exchange and Goldman, Sachs said they were in
talks to form an electronic options market that would compete with
the four major stock options exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   SPLIT CONCERNED MICROSOFT JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge for the Microsoft antitrust case said he
appointed an outside mediator partly because of ``disturbing
reports'' that the Justice Department and the 19 states suing the
software maker were split on the issue of what sanctions to seek
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   KEYCORP TO LAY OFF 3,000 WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   KeyCorp, the Cleveland company that has grown from a regional
bank into a broader financial services concern, said that it would
lay off 3,000 employees to cut costs. The company did not specify
how the 11 percent reduction in its work force would be carried out
over the next 13 months. KeyCorp shares fell 48.4375 cents, to
$25.6875.
</P>
<P>
   HOLZMANN TURNS TO COURT FOR HELP
</P>
<P>
   Philipp Holzmann asked a Frankfurt court to help run its
business after Deutsche Bank and other creditors failed to agree on
a rescue plan to keep the 150-year-old builder going.
</P>
<P>
   PFIZER SUES WARNER OVER LIPITOR
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer sued Warner-Lambert, contending that the company breached
their contract to jointly market the blockbuster
cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. The suit is part of Pfizer's
legal strategy to break up Warner-Lambert's deal to merge with
American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   DURABLE GOODS ORDERS DROP 1.3%
</P>
<P>
   Supply disruptions for computer and electronics makers after an
earthquake in Taiwan led to a 1.3 percent drop in orders for
durable goods in October, government figures showed. Demand for
most other items increased.

 &HT;    Ritz hotels enjoy 2nd Baldrige citation
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One Atlanta business is putting on the Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. has been named one of the winners of the
prestigious 1999 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time the company, which has 35 properties
worldwide, has received the award. Only one other company,
Solectron Inc., has won twice. Ritz-Carlton, a subsidiary of
Marriott International, is also the first hotel company to ever win
the award, given annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The three other winners this year were STMicroelectronics Inc. _
Region Americas in Carrollton, Texas; BI, in Minneapolis; and Sunny
Fresh Foods, in Monticello, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The awards were established by Congress in 1987 to increase the
competitiveness of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   What is the Ritz touch?
</P>
<P>
   ``We gear all our work around our customers, and we know what
the customer wants,'' said President and Chief Operating Officer
Horst Schulze. ``And we involve our employees in the work planning.
That's really the secret. Because of that, we continuously improve
our product, our customer satisfaction and our employee
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners must ``have shown significant achievement and
improvement in all aspects of their organization,'' said Jan Kosko,
a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton has two hotels in Atlanta, and a third, Reynolds
Plantation on Lake Oconee golf resort, is expected to open late
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Ritz-Carlton has 17,000 employees.

THROUGH A LENS THE BODY'S MANY GUISES MULTIPLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ In strictly physical terms, the evolution of
the human body may be slow, yet our perception of the body has been
undergoing rapid change throughout this century, thanks to
photography.
</P>
<P>
   More democratic, accessible, unforgiving and narcissistic than
painting or drawing, it has shaped how we look at each other _ and
ourselves. It has also redefined our notion of the body in
everything from entertainment, sports and fashion to wars, famine
and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   This is the premise behind ``The Century of the Body: Photoworks
1900 to 1999,'' an ambitious photographic exhibition that runs
through Dec. 19 at a cultural center in Lisbon. It is organized as
an art show and, as such, many famous photographers are represented
in its 450 or so works.
</P>
<P>
   But it goes beyond compiling the best-known figurative images of
this century (which accounts for two-thirds of the history of
photography). Its focus is the body, and it has found myriad ways
of showing the familiar in a new and sometimes disturbing light.
</P>
<P>
   The curator of the exhibition, William A. Ewing, currently
director of the Musee de l'Elysee in Lausanne, Switzerland, can
boast expertise on the subject. In 1994, he published ``The Body:
Photographs of the Human Form'' (Chronicle Books), an illustrated
book of essays that became a best seller in many countries, and he
has just published a follow-up, ``Love and Desire: Photoworks''
(also Chronicle Books), which looks more closely at tenderness and
sensuality as well as sexuality and eroticism, again with essays
and illustrations. This show, then, is his third take on the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in putting books on walls because it never
works,'' explained the tall, affable 56-year-old Canadian, who in
the late 1970s worked as an assistant to Cornell Capa at the
International Center of Photography in Manhattan. ``The show has
many photographs from the books, but also many others. I love books
and graphic art, but it can also be frustrating because everything
is reduced to printer's ink and a tiny scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Scale is certainly no hindrance in the large, rambling gallery
made available for ``The Century of the Body'' by Culturgest, a
Portuguese arts foundation created in 1993 by a government-owned
bank, Caixa-Geral de Depositos.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, Ewing has placed Helmut Newton's well-known
life-size photographs of striding models, one showing them naked,
the other dressed. And at the start of the show, beyond a tiny
medical image of an egg and sperm, there are giant polaroids by
Chuck Close of a young man and a young woman, both naked.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has divided the exhibition into 13 sections and has chosen
to give them generic titles like ``The Gaze,'' ``The Icon'' and
``Power,'' because even in such a large show he could not aspire to
be encyclopedic. To have isolated more concrete themes, say, dance
or sports, he said, would have drawn attention to photographs that
are not included.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he adopted the approach he used in ``The Body'' _
although not always the same titles _ and went for the conceptual.
This show will also be presented in three parts in the Musee de
l'Elysee from February through the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never set out to do a sociological or chronological show,''
he said. ``I want the whole thing to be a metaphor for the human
body. I want people who enter the show to feel they are moving
through the body, perhaps to think of their own body.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sculptural work in the exhibition, ``Sea of Sun'' by
the English artist Andrew Sabin, catches this spirit. In a room
divided into 24 spaces, photographic images of faces and landscapes
printed on aluminum chain curtains appear, dissolve and reappear as
visitors walk haphazardly through the curtains. Appropriately, the
section is called ``The Mind: Labyrinth of Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there is nudity galore. Studio portraits of naked
womered almost as soon as photography was invented in the
mid-19th century, although at first they were of interest only to
artists (they were cheaper and less fidgety that live models) and
pornographers. Only in the early years of this century did nude
photography become accepted as art, thanks to the pioneering work
of the likes of Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Edward Weston
and Imogen Cunningham (whose poetic 1931 photograph of a
bare-breasted Martha Graham performing privately is in this show).
</P>
<P>
   The new use of ``fragmentation,'' or close-ups, which
dramatically altered appearances, underlined the infinite
sculptural possibilities offered by the naked body. And
successively through Man Ray, Bill Brandt, Manuel Alvarez Bravo,
Lee Friedlander, Pierre Radisic, Arno Rafael Minkinnen and others,
this exploration has never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last 20 years or so, though, have male bodies been
treated with the same freedom as female bodies. Until the late
1970s, while naked men were routinely photographed for homoerotic
purposes, they were often presented as athletes. But Nan Goldin and
Robert Mapplethorpe, among others, shattered these taboos.
</P>
<P>
   This show neither avoids nor dwells on eroticism, although only
one room includes explicit images, among them Ellen von Unwerth's
1992 photograph of a young man with an erection from her series,
``Nudes at the Royalton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place where I should have a curtain,'' Ewing said
with a laugh as he showed a visitor around the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   To dramatize how photography has influenced contemporary views
of beauty, in the section called ``The Icon,'' part of the floor is
covered with glossy fashion magazines from Europe and the United
States, creating a sort of mosaic of perfectly formed features and
glimpses of shapely figures.
</P>
<P>
   The body as icon, though, is hardly new: from photographs of
Isadora Duncan dancing to advertisements for Charles Atlas'
body-building program, this century has been pushing the notion
that the human body is inseparable from the human identity. (Those
interested in different cultural ideas of beauty can find them in
``Body Art: Marks of Identity,'' at the American Museum of Natural
History in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Many photographs also show the body in a less idealized, less
conventionally beautiful, light. Melanie Manchot, a young British
photographer, presents a nine-foot-high photograph of her aging
mother naked; printed on canvas, it resembles a drawing. Yves
Tremorin's close-ups of the fleshy torso of his grandmother also
evoke how time's passage is recorded on every body.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Luthi illustrates this poignantly with a photograph of a
naked 3-year-old boy holding onto the gnarled leg and wrinkled hand
of his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the grotesque and macabre are also in the
exhibition. Antonin Kratochvil's ``Florida Sideshow'' shows an
immensely obese man who supposedly tried to kill himself by
overeating and, when this failed, chose to exhibit himself for a $5
fee. And from his series ``Morgue Work,'' Jeffrey Silverthorne's
``Woman Who Died in Her Sleep'' is disturbing mainly because the
corpse looks so very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of this show, Ewing's own special interest in
scientific and medical photography has the effect of bringing the
exhibition into the present day. Just as the turn of the last
century brought the invention of the X-ray, the end of the 20th
century is seeing development of new macroscopic techniques, as
illustrated by Gary Schneider's magnified images of minuscule body
details, from a drop of blood to a single hair, the effect of which
is almost abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ewing has chosen to close the show with more poetic
images from Pierre Radisic's series ``Celestial Bodies,'' in which
the Belgian photographer has sought to identify the 88
constellations through natural beauty marks found on women's
bodies. The two-sided photographs _ 10 are in this exhibition _
show a body and its beauty marks on one side and the constellations
traced on a negative image of the same body on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   What these images have in common with the rest of the
exhibition, of course, is that they alter our perception of the
body. And while advertising strives to achieve the same result,
``The Century of the Body'' demonstrates that artists have always
led the way. Images that were once shocking or disturbing or
original become acceptable as we absorb them into how the body is
viewed. But happily, photographers seem never to tire of finding
new ways of retelling a very old story.

MAKER OF ZINC LOZENGE AGREES TO DROP CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The maker of popular over-the-counter zinc lozenges
and a national home shopping network have agreed to stop making
claims that the lozenges can prevent colds and alleviate allergy
symptoms, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley Corp., based in Doylestown, Pa., which manufactures
Cold-Eezer Plus zinc gluconate lozenges and Cold-Eeze zinc
lozenges, and QVC Inc., in West Chester, Pa., which operates two
cable shopping services and a Web site, have agreed to settle FTC
charges. They were accused of making deceptive representations that
the products could prevent colds, relieve the symptoms of allergies
and hay fever, reduce the risk of getting pneumonia and help reduce
the severity of cold symptoms in children.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement does not address Quigley's core assertion
that Cold-Eeze can reduce the severity and duration of cold
symptoms in adults, agency and Quigley officials said. Nor does it
include any admission of guilt by Quigley or QVC.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Quigley, the president and chief executive for Quigley
Corp., said the FTC's accusations ``largely relate to spontaneous
statements made on QVC'' several years ago.

DETROIT MOBILIZES TO FIGHT RAPISTS OF SCHOOLGIRLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ill., Calif.)   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Crime has been walking children to and from school
here, and this city is enlisting an army of volunteers to fight
back.
</P>
<P>
   After the rapes of eight schoolgirls in just two months,
beginning on the first day of school, parents have begun driving
their children to school, or even schooling them at home.
Principals have urged boys to walk girls home from school. After
students walked out of class last week to urge the city to take
more action, Detroit's mayor has mobilized tens of thousands of
parents, police officers, city workers and neighbors to patrol the
streets to make it safe to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, an attempted rape was reported, the fourth since
September, and on Tuesday night, each of the city's 263 public
schools were to hold meetings for parents and other volunteers to
discuss the situation. A man has been arrested and charged in one
of the rapes, and two more men are being sought. The police have
refused to say how many of the other seven rapes each of the two
men are suspected of committing.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests cannot come soon enough for students at Denby High
School in northeastern Detroit, where four of the eight victims
were students. ``I'm just hoping they catch this guy,'' said Kim
McCullum, 15, whose brother has begun walking her to school. ``We
had a meeting and they gave out whistles and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Chennele Simpkins, a 10th-grader who stepped out of her mother's
van in front of the school, said that with four rapes at her
school, ``it could easily happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Melissa Whitley, said, ``I feel the kids shouldn't
have to come to school and worry about their safety.''
</P>
<P>
   While students and parents remain nervous, they are pleased that
the city is trying to protect the students. ``I do feel safe now,''
said Marquetta Scott, a 16-year-old student. ``This morning we
missed our bus and a police officer picked us up _ she asked if we
wanted a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   However slowly, the city has mobilized tens of thousands of
volunteers, along with city workers and parents, to patrol near the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for every Detroiter to do what he or she can
do to make our streets safe,'' Mayor Dennis W. Archer said in a
televised address on Monday night, when he called for volunteers.
The city sent 300,000 letters asking parents, teachers, city
employees and other concerned citizens to attend the organizational
meetings Tuesday night at their local schools. ``These are our
children and it is our responsibility to ensure their safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning police cars patrolled near Denby High where, as
in many of the city's neighborhoods, well-kept brick homes give way
to abandoned houses and vacant lots. Volunteers attached yellow
patrol lighteir car roofs and drove along routes that
students walk.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding the city with volunteers is a technique that Archer has
used in the past. The city sent notices to 90,000 of those who had
volunteered for past efforts to patrol on Halloween, when arsonists
in the past often went to work on Detroit's abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the first time the city has mobilized after attacks on
schoolgirls. In 1984, Coleman Young, who was then mayor, enlisted
the aid of utility workers in more than 3,000 radio-equipped
vehicles to monitor neighborhoods near schools after more than 50
schoolgirls reported sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have had problems with schoolgirl rapes, too. In
April, two schoolgirls were raped in Memphis where, five years ago,
a serial rapist attacked seven girls in a month. Two years ago in
Chicago, 10 schoolgirls were raped. In 1996, six students were
raped in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts said the problem here is serious. ``This is
certainly a lot, even for a big city like Detroit,'' said Scott A.
Berkowitz, president of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National
Network, which runs hot lines across the country for victims of
sexual assault. ``It is pretty unusual for there to be a localized
outbreak like that, particularly when there isn't a serial
rapist.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>

   LaWanda Daniels, 36, had already been driving six pupils in her
neighborhood to school. But she recently added her niece to the car
pool, stopping at Denby High. ``Once the rapes started happening, I
started driving her,'' Ms. Daniels said.

   Thomas R. Roberts, 58, perhaps best expressed the anger felt by
many parents as he drove his son Jason, a ninth-grader, to school
Tuesday. Several years ago, after his oldest son was badly beaten
on the way to school, he switched to the night shift at a nearby
Jeep factory so that he could drive his three children to school
and pick them up afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He said he helps protect his block by sitting on his porch at
night with a shotgun on his lap, and watches out for trouble
involving neighborhood children. ``I watch out for all of them, all
that I can,'' he said.

 NEW YORK: New York.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speculation that she might not run has filled the vacuum
that was created by absence from New York over the last two weeks
while she was traveling with President Clinton overseas, her aides
said in explaining her decision to make this statement. The concern
about the viability of this first-time candidate for office was
heightened by the criticism by Jewish leaders about her handling of
the trip to Israel, as well as by her decision before she left to
postpone her formal announcement once more, this time from January
to February. Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday that she would formally
announce her candidacy in a statewide tour sometime early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 minutes Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton sought to dispel any
notions that she might quit the race before it begins, to quell
concerns about her political skills, and to address the criticism
that arose about her actions while in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she intended to move to Chappaqua and cut back
on as many of her duties as first lady as possible. She went on to
sketch out a high-powered version of a commuter relationship for
the nation's first couple, with the president tending to the
nation's business in Washington and Mrs. Clinton pursuing her
political future in New York. The two would rejoin each other on
weekends, her aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be living in Westchester and I will be traveling around
the state and campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks Tuesday _ and even her formal
announcement of candidacy, once it comes _ does not significantly
change her legal position. Since October, when she filed a
statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission, she
has been subject to federal campaign fundraising rules, although
her announcement could also make it easier for her to raise money
among people who doubted her candidacy. She has also been subject
to restrictions on using White House resources _ like her White
House staff _ to advance her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has been a constant rumble of speculation from the
moment she began traveling around New York last summer, largely
encouraged by her critics. The Wall Street Journal suggested in an
editorial last summer that Mrs. Clinton would abandon the race in
favor of a job as president of the World Bank. And Dick Morris, the
Clintons' former consultant, has regularly predicted in his New
York Post column that Mrs. Clinton would step aside because she
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty about her political skills escalated after her
trip to the Middle East, when Mrs. Clinton was criticized for
sitting silently as Suha Arafat, in a ceremony in Ramallah, on the
West Bank, suggested that Israelis were poisoning Arab women and
children with the use of toxic tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton defended her actions, saying she was there not as a
candidate for office, but as first lady. ``There were people who
believed that I should have caused an international incident over
whatever it is she said,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I just respectfully
disagree with that. And I know that there were people who knew I
could score political points for myself in New York by doing
something that would cause such an incident. I did not think that
was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the campaign itself, Mrs. Clinton demurred when asked to
offer contrasts between herself and Giuliani _ indeed, to even
mention Giuliani's name in a critical way _ or to sketch out how
she would present herself to voters. She said she would prefer to
reserve that for her formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of contrasts between the both of
us,'' she said. ``So I'm going to be drawing those contrasts out.
I'm going to be responding whenever I can. But ultimately, this
election is not going to be about me or Rudy Giuliani. It's going
to be about the issues that concern the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, personality is fine,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But
ultimately you have to ask yourself, `How is this person going to
vote?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked at his daily news conference Tuesday whether he thought
Mrs. Clinton had made her announcement because her campaign was in
trouble, the Mayor said: ``I don't think very much about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of the mayor's Senate exploratory
committee, said that he still wasn't sure whether the first lady
was in the race for good. ``To me it sounds like political
double-speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's news conference drew huge attention from the
media: it was broadcast live on a number of television stations,
including CNN. Reporters repeatedly pushed Mrs. Clinton to give
ever-more-definitive statements about her political intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton seemed pleased by the attention, if slightly taken
aback by it. Indeed, the first lady said she had not informed
Clinton or their daughter, Chelsea, about what she was going to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in Kosovo and they don't know about this,'' she said.
``But they're getting home tonight, and I don't think my husband or
daughter will be surprised.''

HANCOCK TO SPEND $713   MILLION ON LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. will spend a
total of $713 million, at least one-third more than originally
anticipated, to settle a landmark 1995 class-action lawsuit over
deceptive insurance sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   The sum is more than twice the $350 million in benefits that the
Boston insurer agreed in 1997 to pay to nearly 4 million
policyholders nationwide to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   That smaller figure, used by both Hancock and state officials in
the past to characterize the minimum financial burden that Hancock
would shoulder from the case, did not include administrative
expenses and underestimated total costs, Hancock said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an unanticipated and costly rise in the number of
aggrieved policyholders seeking special compensation, the insurer
said it would pay out $471 million in pretax dollars _ $121 million
more than the original $350 million, or one-third more overall _ in
benefits to 3.8 million policyholders affected by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's sixth-largest mutual life insurer will also spend a
whopping $242 million on administration and paperwork. Hancock's
chief financial officer, Thomas E. Moloney, who provided the new
figures, could not say how much the company had originally budgeted
for such costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, which will conduct an initial public offering in
January, said its costs had risen because twice as many
policyholders as expected, or around 120,000 people holding 135,000
policies, had filed claims through an ``alternative dispute
resolution'' process that was a key feature of the settlement. The
process entitles policyholders to opt out of general relief and to
seek separate benefits from Hancock. A source familiar with the
matter said alternative claims were three times the number Hancock
had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock could not provide a breakdown for compensation through
general relief and alternative dispute resolution, although the
latter appears to account for a good chunk of the settlement's
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's court-approved settlement, one of many in the
tarnished insurance industry, stemmed from customers who alleged
they were misled by company sales agents about policies they
purchased from 1979 to 1996. Policyholders charged that agents
tricked them into buying policies with premiums, or regular
payments, that were supposed to vanish but never did, and sold them
souped-up policies they did not need. The settlement covers every
single whole, universal, and variable life insurance policy Hancock
sold over 17 years _ the insurer's core business. Despite the
settlement, Hancock has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative resolution process takes longer and costs more
than general relief because Hancock must wade through scores of
paper documents to determine how much each policyholder is entitled
to receive. The process even involves questioning Hancock agents
who sold policies more than two decades ago. The insurer has 1,000
staffers working to process settlement claims.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog means that the settlement process, which was
supposed to end this year, will drag out well into next year,
company officials said. So far, about one in 10 aggrieved
policyholders had received compensation, Moloney said, declining to
provide an average figure. The total settlement kitty works out to
an average $123 per policyholder, but that figure is not a useful
indicator because each policy is unique, Moloney said.
</P>
<P>
   The total $713 million that Hancock will spend to close out the
case does not include approximately $40 million in compensation
that the insurer must pay to approximately 290,000 Massachusetts
policyholders under a 1997 agreement with the state in connection
with the broader settlement, according to company officials. And it
does not include the low-interest loans and premium reductions that
Hancock also agreed to make.
</P>
<P>
   But Moloney said the total does include $39 million in legal
fees to Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, the New York law firm
that represented policyholders in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a filing to securities regulators late Monday showed
that Hancock executives have increased their personal wealth.
Hancock chairman and chief executive Stephen L. Brown was granted
equity rights in 1999 worth up to $9.9 million. Brown earned a $1
million salary, $1 million bonus, and $899,941 in performance-based
incentive awards last year, about even with 1997.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, the number two executive and chief
executive-elect, was granted performance-related equity rights
worth up to $6 million and a $2 million retention bonus, payable in
2002. He earned a $600,000 salary, $420,000 bonus, and $554,605 in
performance-based incentive awards last year, up from 1997 lev   Also separately from the lawsuit settlement, Hancock told state
insurance regulators Tuesday that it had hired a company to search
Census Bureau, voter registration, Social Security, and Division of
Motor Vehicle records nationwide for some 400,000 missing
policyholders. Hancock is under fire for originally losing track of
twice that number, or one-quarter of its total customer base, as it
prepares to go public. Most policyholders are eligible for
compensation in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   A Hancock critic, Boston lawyer Jason Adkins, Tuesday questioned
why Hancock had not searched those databases when it first
discovered it had lost shareholders earlier this year.

   Congress bestows poor grades for hunger effortsBy Benjamin Kline
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Congress deserves no better than a
``D-plus'' overall grade for its minimal efforts to alleviate
hunger in America during the last fiscal year, U.S. Rep. Tony Hall
(D-Ohio) said in a report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall reviewed what he called ``a miserable record of responding
to the needs of miserable people in our country,'' the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot: Congress' 31 percent increase in funding to
$147 million for Meals on Wheels. But Hall spewed shame and an
``F'' grade on the government for its failure to try to meet the
needs of children 6 and under, of whom he said 42 percent live at
or near poverty, 10 percent live in extreme poverty and two-thirds
live in families who receive no public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's report also ``graded'' Congressional efforts for working
families (D), senior citizens (B), veterans (C+) and legal
immigrants (F).
</P>
<P>
   Hall's study asserts that in 1999, more than 31 million people
in 10.5 million American homes faced hunger. In a recent survey, he
said, 20 percent of all families in America reported food
shortages; of these, half reported significant difficulties putting
food on the table. Among those receiving food stamps, 40.1 percent
are white, 36.3 percent are African American and 18.3 percent
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens are better off than ever before, with only 10.5
percent at the poverty level, Hall said. He attributed that to
rising Social Security benefits, without which half of elderly
Americans would be poor.

   Delphi to buy Lucas Diesel from TRW, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   By Lynn Hulsey
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Delphi Automotive Systems will spend $871 million
to buy Lucas Diesel Systems, further expanding its customer base
and positioning the company in the rapidly emerging diesel common
rail injection technology.
</P>
<P>
   Once Delphi completes the acquisition of Lucas Diesel from
Cleveland-based TRW Inc., it will be the world's second largest
producer of diesel fuel-injection systems for light-, medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles. Annual revenues are projected at $1.1 billion.
The deal should be complete by late this year or early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Diesel will be renamed Delphi Diesel Systems and be a part
of the company's Energy and Engine Management Systems. Dayton-based
Delphi Chassis Systems is being merged with Energy and Engine
Management, but the diesel business purchase will have no direct
impact locally, said Steve Gaut, Delphi spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said area Delphi plants could benefit as the purchase creates
the opportunity to win more non-General Motors business. For
example, Ford is a major customer of Lucas Diesel and Delphi's new
relationship with that customer could open doors for other Delphi
products, Gaut said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition increases Delphi's non-GM business by about 16
percent to $8 billion annually. All of Lucas Diesel's revenue comes
from European customers, so the acquisition will boost Delphi's
European business by more than 20 percent to about $5 billion
annually, Gaut said. Most of Lucas Diesel's 8,600 employees are
based in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Diesel is Delphi's largest acquisition since spinning off
from GM in May. The company was particularly attracted to Lucas
Diesel's virtually particulate-free engine technology, known as
common rail injection, said Donald L. Runkle, president of Delphi
Energy and Engine Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization brings unusual expertise in high-precision
diesel fuel injection which will also complement Delphi's gasoline
engine management business,'' Runkle said.

AT&AMP;T PLANS TO CREATE TRACKING STOCK FOR ITS CELL PHONE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See also AT&AMP;T explain.)  
(DW) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top executives at AT&AMP;T are planning to create a separately
traded tracking stock for the company's fast-growing cellular unit
and to invest billions to deliver high-speed Internet access and
local phone service to millions of American homes using wireless
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, outlined Tuesday by executives close to the company,
would open a broad new front in AT&AMP;T's battle with the Baby Bells
to recapture part of the local communications market.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's board has not given final approval to the tracking stock,
but the company's management wants to announce plans for the
spinoff and the new wireless initiative at a meeting with financial
analysts on Dec. 6, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While the company does not appear to have made final decisions
about the wireless company's management, executives close to AT&AMP;T
said John D. Zeglis, AT&AMP;T's president, stands an excellent chance
of being named to run the new operation. The executives also said
Daniel E. Somers, who recently left his post as chief financial
officer to run AT&AMP;T's far-flung cable television unit on an interim
basis, would probably be formally tapped as chief executive of that
operation.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Given the success that Sprint had in forming a tracking stock
for its wireless operation last year, AT&AMP;T's board appears
supportive of the plan, executives close to the company said. But
if AT&AMP;T intends to issue a tracking stock before it completes its
acquisition of the Mediaone Group next year, the move would also
require approval from Mediaone's board.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of accepting AT&AMP;T stock in that deal, Mediaone,
the big cable television carrier, insisted that it have a veto over
any big changes in AT&AMP;T's capital structure before the acquisition
was completed.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is currently negotiating with Mediaone about the tracking
stock plan, according to executives close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a wireless tracking stock would be an unusually
aggressive financial move for AT&AMP;T, one of the nation's most widely
held stocks. Owners of AT&AMP;T shares would receive shares in the new
wireless unit, though the wireless operation would not be a totally
independent company a la Lucent Technologies, which AT&AMP;T spun off
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks are meant to mirror the performance of
particular units within a larger company, while reporting
independent financial results. Hughes Electronics, for instance,
trades as a tracking stock of General Motors, which owns Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, tracking stocks were sometimes considered a
bit unseemly because they did not give stockholders a true economic
stake in the operation being tracked. But they have become much
more widely accepted in more recently, especially as they have
unlocked value for shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Some AT&AMP;T executives are frustrated with the company's somewhat
dormant stock and are convinced that the market is not giving the
company credit for the value of its wireless operation, one of the
nation's biggest. By issuing a new stock to track the wireless
operation, AT&AMP;T is hoping to bolster overall returns for its
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The company's management does not, however, appear to believe
that the cable television operation is similarly ready to stand on
its own, according to executives close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether AT&AMP;T would offer shares in the wireless
unit to the public as a way to raise cash. On Monday, Credit Suisse
First Boston, which has advised AT&AMP;T on many of its recent deals,
announced that it had hired away Daniel P. Reingold, a top
telecommunications analyst, and the rest of his team from Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   As it tries to raise the visibility of its wireless unit, AT&AMP;T
also appears set finally to move its long-ballyhooed Project Angel
from the laboratory to the marketplace. In development at McCaw
Cellular Communications even before AT&AMP;T acquired McCaw earlier
this decade, Project Angel is a technology that can theoretically
deliver torrents of digital data to fixed locations, like houses or
places of business, using frequencies usually associated with
mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has made deals to become the biggest cable television
company in the nation, acquiring Tele-Communications Inc. in
addition to the pending Mediaone deal, and the company's dominant
strategy remains to use cable lines to deliver all sorts of local
communications services across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But even AT&AMP;T's broad cable footprint does not cover the entire
nation, and senior AT&AMP;T executives now want to use Project Angel to
reach millions of homes beyond the company's cable systems,
according to executives close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T intends to use the wireless systems to deliver high-speed
Internet access and local phone service in competition with the
Baby Bell local phone giants, which in some cases appear poised to
jump into AT&AMP;T's core long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   The new wireless systems could enable new sorts of products. For
instance, at an AT&AMP;T board meeting last week in Kirkland, Wash.,
home of AT&AMP;T's wireless headquarters, the directors were shown a
demonstration of a phone that could be used as a cordless unit
within the house and as a cellular unit outside it, executives
close to the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded wireless plans could also be seen as a tool to
persuade independent cable television operators to cut deals with
AT&AMP;T to jointly deliver telephone service over their cable lines,
lest AT&AMP;T move into their markets on its own using wireless
technology.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T's corporate core has long been valued by investors
and analysts on the basis of the company's earnings, many small,
fast-growing communications concerns today are valued based on
their revenue growth and cash flow or on earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is hoping that a tracking stock associated with its
wireless business would be valued on that basis, allowing the unit
to invest in Project Angel without undermining the strength of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   One potential wrinkle is that in that situation the wireless
stock would not be a so-called pure play in mobile telephone
service, a known quantity with investors. An enhanced role for
Project Angel could confuse some investors who are considering
buying a wireless tracking stock.

 GORE TO MEET KAZAKH LEADER AFTER MiG CASE  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore plans to meet with the
leader of Kazakhstan in December, despite reports of that country's
sale of Soviet-built weapons to North Korea, administration
officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office said he would meet President Nursultan Nazarbayev
in Washington on Dec. 20, during the annual session of a bilateral
commission on U.S.-Kazakh affairs. Gore is co-chairman of the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to meet Nazarbayev after reports in the summer of
Kazakhstan's sale of 40 MiG fighters to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The White House stressed that the meeting would occur after
Nazarbayev had addressed U.S. concerns over the MiGs.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that the shipments of the 1960s-era jets planes, which
the administration learned about in August, could harm relations
with the United States, Nazarbayev ordered a series of arrests,
ousted his closest adviser and announced that he was reforming his
government's system of arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   After Nazarbayev had moved quickly to deal with the problem, the
State Department announced this month that it would not sanction
Kazakhstan for the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman said because the State Department had decided
to waive sanctions, there was no reason why the MiG shipment should
delay Gore's meeting with Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also talked to Nazarbayev to express his concern over the
shipments when they were discovered, said the spokesman for the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery in August that a trainload of disassembled MiGs
had been shipped from Kazakhstan to North Korea followed an
incident in the spring, when Azerbaijan announced that it had
stopped a cargo plane from Kazakhstan that was carrying MIG
fighters that was also headed to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems still cloud relations between the United States
and Kazakhstan. Gore has expressed concern how October's
parliamentary elections were handled and plans to press further for
election reforms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the important ingredient in U.S.-Kazakh relations is oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is eager for oil-rich Kazakhstan to
devote at least some of its supply to a Caspian region pipeline to
Turkey that circumvents Russia, to reduce Moscow's influence over
the giant Caspian oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   The administration now sees itself competing with Russia for
influence over the Caspian region's energy resources, and that has
turned U.S. policy in Central Asia into a complicated game of
pipeline politics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nonproliferation and political reforms, the
session will most probably cover U.S. proposals for changes in
Kazakhstan's laws that govern foreign investments in its oil and
gas industry.

SUPERSUCKERS SURE KNOW HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Spaghetti has an evil little laugh that, combined with the
tales of debauchery and excess his band the Supersuckers has always
traded in, lets you know that he is bent on having more fun than
anybody else on the rock 'n' roll road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're in Atlanta tonight, and that place is notorious
for craziness,'' Spaghetti said on the eve of the release of the
band's first rock record in four years, ``The Evil Powers of Rock
'n' Roll.'' ``There's no reason it shouldn't rock.''
</P>
<P>
   These are clearly good days for the 'suckers, which also
includes Dancing Eagle on drums and Dan ``Thunder'' Bolton and The
Heathman on guitars. There's always a good-size club to play, a
party fraught with various excesses to be had afterward, and a
highway pointing to the next town, where they will raise the roof
again, party again, and sleep into the afternoon again.
</P>
<P>
   The current tour is a big relief for Spaghetti (real name Edward
Carlyle Daly III) and pals: For most of the two years since they
put out their tongue-in-cheek country effort, ``Must've Been
High,'' the band has been in a hellish purgatory brought on by the
Seagram's/Polygram merger of late 1998. Thanks to the
merger/consolidation, hundreds of employees at numerous labels were
fired, and scores of bands were dumped. The 'suckers ended up being
one of them, but not without a long, long wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, four years _ we're pathetic, I know,'' he said. ``What
happened was, we signed with Interscope after `High' and recorded
the CD _ we figured it'd be out in a couple months. And they sat on
it for nine months. They cut bands and cut bands, and we kept
thinking we were making the cut, and at the end they dropped us. So
we had to find a new label and re-record the record because
Interscope wouldn't let us release the one we'd done.''
</P>
<P>
   Spaghetti is still spitting mad at Interscope. ``One of us had
to get a day job,'' he said disgustedly, declining to say who.
``No, it wasn't me. Everyone thinks when you sign with a major
label your troubles are over, and we were never broker than when we
were on Interscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever think of giving up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No _ there's no givin' up,'' he said with a laugh. ``It's just
another hurdle, just another hassle. I have no other career skills.
I want to do this forever _ guys like Willie (Nelson) and Billy Joe
Shaver don't even think of giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The medium-size Koch label came to the band's rescue, and
``Evil'' was cut quickly; about half the songs were re-recorded
versions of songs on the shelved Interscope project, and about half
was material Spaghetti had written in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evil'' is a fine addition to the 'suckers' catalog, a punkish,
high-volume, raucous, nasty joy ride of busted relationships, road
stories and glee at being able to play rock 'n' roll for a living.
While not quite the sweaty masterwork of 1995's ``The Sacrilicious
Sounds of the Supersuckers,'' it is a darned good time, 13 songs in
38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, all killer, no filler,'' said Spaghetti. ``It's a much
better record than the Interscope one, much more warts-and-all rock
'n' roll. That punkish stuff is our calling card _ I'd enjoy making
another country record, but the main thing we do is spit out rock
'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't, he says, think that the evil powers of the title are
a reference to Interscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking that _ if the title refers to corporate
music, record companies,'' he said. ``But I'm talking about the
good stuff _ I'm celebrating the women, the liquor, the drugs, the
blood spilled, all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, now that you're on the road again, new CD to flog to the
masses, do you really party as hard as ``Evils'' suggests?
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, we do,'' he said. ``You can't live like that 24
hours a day, but when you travel around, it's great to enjoy a
little vice. Every night is a late night, and every morning is in
the afternoon. Hey, it beats digging a ditch.'' nn

says Rhoden, 36, who directs the Ailey-inspired company Complexions

earned a reputation for being somewhat insular and aloof since his
astonishing debut in 1983 as the brutal Nazi concentration camp
director in Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List,'' for which he
was nominated for best supporting actor. But after being swamped by
acclaim, who could blame him for feeling a trifle antisocial?

Samantha's clothes, including these T-shirts. ``In the past,
mothers were extremely conservative,'' says Ms. Rosenthal, a
40-year-old who frequently wears capri pants, a Prada body bag, and
trendy power-bead bracelets. The physical fitness craze means more
40-something women can actually fit into younger styles. (Tom

COMMENTARY: AND SHE'S OFF! 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We knew she was running when she showed up in earth tones.
</P>
<P>
   Like Al Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped onto the stage in
New York all toasty-looking in a brown suit. ``So the answer is
yes,'' she said with a huge smile, like a blushing fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters raced to the back of the room to call their offices
with the news flash, like those old courtroom dramas when the jury
comes back and the press guys in porkpie hats run for the
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The icon became a pol Tuesday. No longer protected by the mantle
of royalty, she will now be subject to all the rough-and-tumble
treatment accorded pols. She offered herself up as candidate first,
lady second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, I had always intended to scale back my duties
as first lady, and that is what I'm doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was reminiscent of Gore in more than autumnal color
and moving to a different state. The exploratory part of her
candidacy has been as bumptious and disaster-prone as Phase One of
the vice president's bid.
</P>
<P>
   She has had more flapdoodles already than many candidates get in
a whole campaign. The Puerto Rican clemency mess. The Chappaqua
house mortgage mess. The kiss of doom with Mrs. Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But like the vice president, the more the first lady tries to
fix, the more bollixed up things get. Both keep trying to change
the subject to issues, but the subject keeps getting dragged back
to their personalities _ are they authentic or merely entitled? Do
their dizzying changes of look and image signal that, at core, they
don't know who they really are?
</P>
<P>
   Both Al and Hillary will have endless headaches juggling their
dual roles at the White House and on the trail, straining to get
out of Bill's shadow while straining to take advantage of his
continuing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has hedged a bit on how much he wants the president to
campaign for him. But Mrs. Clinton was less equivocal. Although it
was her husband's connubial betrayal that sent her numbers soaring
and catapulted her into the Senate race, she said she wanted his
help in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I want my husband to campaign for me? Absolutely,'' she
said. ``I think he has been a great president for New York and for
the country. And the progress that we have made in the last seven
years is progress that I think has been good for the people of New
York. And he would say _ and I agree with this, and I will be
talking about it in the campaign _ we have unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished business?
</P>
<P>
   One would think that eight years running the country is a pretty
good shot at getting your business done. But there's something so
rootless and chaotic about the Clintons. They seem like a virus or
alien that needs a host body to survive. They've invaded our
national psyche and we're going to have to keep living with their
weird marital problems and tangled ambitions forever and ever.
Their business will never be finished.
</P>
<P>
   They are never going to go away because they have no place else
to go. They will get some worthy things done, but they will also be
in our faces, exhausting us with their ``We want to do good so we
can break the rules when we need to'' ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's news conference was fascinating because she mirrored
all of Bill's good habits and bad habits.
</P>
<P>
   Good habits: She was articulate. She was charming. She called
reporters by their first names. She laughed. She said she would
come up with real answers for real people.
</P>
<P>
   Bad habits: She told gratuitous little stretchers. She pretended
her decision to announce was spontaneous, in response to a question
from the head of the teachers' union, when it was orchestrated. She
said she wanted campaign finance reform, but then offered an
ends-justify-the-means excuse for using Democratic soft money. She
tried to have it both ways: She rearranged her schedule in the
Middle East to accommodate her political needs in New York. But
then when the trip blew up, she used the excuse that it was a
diplomatic mission so she had been constrained from speaking out
boldly on political matters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and 1996, Bill Clinton won by arguing that what he stood
for was more important than who he is. His character flaws did not
matter, he told voters, his issues mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' Mrs. Clinton said Tuesday, ``this election is
not going to be about me or Rudy Giuliani. It's going to be about
the issues that concern the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   One Clinton is banking that the formula of the other Clinton
will work one more time.

was always a chance taker. ``Dancers are attracted to the Ailey
repertory beyond Alvin's spirituality, because it is so diverse,''
says Rhoden, 36, who directs the Ailey-inspired company Complexions
with the former Ailey star, Desmond Richardson. ``One has to be
versed in all dance techniques and at the same time have some sense
of theatricality.'' (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

ChefShop.com is $32.99. The boutique food business is still largely

of the cyberworld. And when they do, they are not always better

a tribute to the actress - who triumphed in ``Virginia Woolf'' when
it first arrived on Broadway 37 years ago - on her 80th birthday,
and to benefit the HB Playwrights Foundation and Theater, which she
heads. Yet all the work was being done by Ms. Hagen and her

recently. This very private actor, who turns 37 this month, has
earned a reputation for being somewhat insular and aloof since his
astonishing debut in 1983 as the brutal Nazi concentration camp
director in Steven Spielberg's ``Schindler's List,'' for which he
was nominated for best supporting actor. But after being swamped by
acclaim, who could blame him for feeling a trifle antisocial?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of its 17 years, Operation Smile seemed a model
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by a charismatic plastic surgeon and his wife, it
garnered millions in donations and sheaves of plaudits for the
surgeons it sent abroad to fix the cleft palates and lips of
children in poor corners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Donors from Bill Gates to Goldie Hawn pitched in generously, and
the numbers of children granted a pretty smile grew by leaps and
bounds. The founders often appeared on television, and the group
won many awards.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, however, serious allegations of shoddy
medical practices and questions about the charity's direction and
conduct have stirred bitter struggles within the organization, well
outside public view.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegations focus on the surgeries themselves.
Critics charge that the organization has put volume and publicity
over safety, leading to high numbers of complications, and even
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, four children died during or after the surgery,
adding to at least 12 other patients that the charity acknowledges
losing since it began operations in 1982. Repairing a cleft lip or
palate in the developed world is a rather low-risk proposition, and
in the United States, deaths are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians in China, where Operation Smile has performed many of
its operations, have accused the surgeons of ``assembly line''
medicine. In Bolivia, a pediatric surgeon branded the
organization's practices ``a form of neo-colonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have also charged that Operation Smile exaggerates its
size and impact on the group's tax returns by including the medical
services that its volunteer nurses and doctors donate. And some
question the charity's priorities for choosing to finance projects
like its recent World Journey of Hope, a whirlwind mission around
the globe that cost $8.8 million, $910,000 of which went for
promotion and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive is leaving, many staff members have quit and
seven of its most prominent board members have resigned. Charles B.
Wang, the chief executive of Computer Associates International,
pulled back a $10 million donation, which he has now promised to a
rival charity. Warner-Lambert, a corporate donor that had been
contributing at least $1 million a year to the $40 million that the
charity spends on programs, also retracted its support.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of Operation Smile, Dr. William P. Magee Jr. and
his wife, Kathleen S. Magee, neither of whom have ever taken a
salary from the charity, have dismissed much of the criticism as
the assertions of those who do not understand what they are trying
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is put this behind us and not get
distracted,'' Magee said in an interview last week at the charity's
headquarters in Norfolk, Va., flanked by the many awards he has
won, including this year's Charity Executive of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Magee declared that without an operation to correct a facial
deformity, a child has ``no chance to live a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the charity launched a counteroffensive at a news
conference in Manhattan, where Magee addressed some of the recent
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile is not without its supporters, including Johnson
&AMP; Johnson. ``I personally, and the organization, believe very
strongly in the fine work that Operation Smile has done,'' said
Robert Darretta, the chief financial officer for Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
who remains a director. Acknowledging the challenges faced by the
charity, Darretta said he and other directors are staying to
``bring about constructive change.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how Operation Smile has pursued its goals
exposes a fundamental problem facing many nonprofit organizations:
When a charity gets into trouble, who ought to slam on the brakes?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike companies that have shareholders who could lobby for
change, nonprofits do not usually have stakeholders who can easily
complain or regulators who have much muscle. Fearful of the time
and negative publicity involved in trying to force change, even big
donors and directors may simply wash their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resigning is the final weapon,'' said F. Warren McFarlan, a
Harvard Business School professor who has studied nonprofit boards.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the surgeons' charity, while apparently concerned
about some of the quality-of-care issues being raised, seem most
deeply divided about the founders' role and the increasing view
among some directors that their own input was being ignored, one
former director said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Operation Smile is vowing to do a thorough
internal investigation of its conduct, according to Magee. He said
the charity has hired a lawyer, F. Bradford Stillman, to review its
operations and report by January, though so far the lawyer has not
been asked to look at the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   The Procedures: A Child's Death in China Sets Off an Alarm
</P>
<P>
   As long as Operation Smile remained a modest organization, it
could bask in praise. But as it tried to reach its stated goal of
treating 10,000 children a year, troubling reports began to surface
that the charity was sacrificing safety.
</P>
<P>
   No surgery is without risk; in poor countries, operations are
always more difficult. Sanitation might not be up to par, and
patients may have other complications they do not explain to
doctors for fear of being rejected for the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile has had 16 deaths, according to Magee, about one
for every 2,000 cases, which he claims is about average for such
missions. In the last four years, the average has been slightly
better, about one death in every 3,200 cases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But Interplast, a competing charity in Mountain View, Calif.,
that also operates on children abroad, had a mortality rate over
the last four years of about one death for every 10,000 cases,
according to David Dingman, the director of Interplast's medical
program. Its own rates had been no better than Operation Smile's
until it tightened quality controls and took advantage of improved
technology about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The death that has caused the most stir at Operation Smile
occurred recently in China. A medical volunteer who was in Beijing
sent an anonymous E-mail in November to members of the board that
voiced serious criticism about how the death occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the direct result of a poorly run mission with far too
much attention being paid to publicity and not enough to patient
safety and standard monitoring techniques,'' said the volunteer,
who was subsequently identified and interviewed by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also my impression that Operation Smile not only did not
learn from this tragedy in Beijing and make changes to ensure that
it did not happen again, but continues to send missions that
operate in a similar unsafe, reckless and unprofessional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   What most troubled the volunteer was the decision not to use
carbon dioxide monitoring equipment that was readily available, a
decision the charity acknowledges but is at a loss to explain. If
the monitoring equipment had been engaged during the cleft-lip
operation, doctors might have known that the toddler being operated
on was responding badly to anesthesia and about to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we not use the same standard of care'' as in the
developed world, the volunteer asked. ``The goal is just volume,''
the volunteer concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Medical professionals at the Beijing hospital where Operation
Smile conducted the mission were also severely critical, voicing
concern over the high number of serious complications, where
children suffered from unusually excessive bleeding or had to have
emergency surgery because their palates had collapsed. The Chinese
described much of the work done by the charity's doctors and by
others who were not qualified or skilled in this surgery as crude.
They concluded that about 29 percent of the 169 children with
complications needed further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chinese medical professionals, who later wrote
a detailed report about the mission outlining some of their major
concerns to help direct future missions, Operation Smile conducted
an ``assembly line,'' where patients were known by their numbers
rather than names and surgeons spent little or no time seeing
patients before operating. ``Even though we only worked together
for a few days, we got the impression that the international team
prioritized numbers treated at the cost of quality and safety,''
said a translated copy of the report, which was obtained by The New
York Times. The charity said it has never seen a copy of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Other medical volunteers echo similar concerns about the
pressure to do as many surgeries as possible. While all charities
want to impress donors with large numbers of operations and find it
heart-wrenching to turn away patients, Operation Smile seems more
concerned than others about the final tally, according to a medical
volunteer who has traveled with them and with other comparable
charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of numbers does not seem to be as significant'' with
the others, according to the volunteer, who recalled having to
persuade a team leader not to do surgery on one mission.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile takes every serious complication
``extraordinarily seriously,'' said Magee, and the charity has made
changes as a result of the incident in Beijing. For instance, team
leaders overseeing anesthesia will be doctors, not nurses, and will
be required to use monitoring equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Magee, who is persresponsible for selecting the
group's surgeons, denied that the volunteer physicians, many of
whom are not from the United States, were not able surgeons. While
the Chinese saw them for only a few days, he had known them for
years, he said. ``I have no doubt about their work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble in Beijing, however, was hardly an isolated example.
In Kenya, a child died last year because the mission ran out of
oxygen during the operation _ a mistake that could be easily
remedied in the United States but is fatal in a country where
additional supplies of oxygen are not necessarily available. A
Vietnamese child also died last year when his asthma went
undetected.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been complaints about other missions. In March,
after Operation Smile came to Bolivia, several children needed
extensive follow-up care at San Gabriel Hospital, according to Dr.
Roberto Rosa, a pediatric surgeon there who was sharply critical of
Operation Smile and other charities. In one case, the technique
used by Operation Smile on a little girl was clearly inappropriate,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a form of neo-colonialism,'' argued Rosa, who said his
hospital had performed about 2,000 of these surgeries. While his
hospital would be eager to cooperate with surgeons from the United
States, Operation Smile had committed ``surgical safaris against
our children,'' who are from poor families unlikely to complain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile said it had no knowledge of complaints from
Bolivia and has been invited back to provide more operations.
</P>
<P>
   Also problematic, Magee, whose background as a surgeon is
nothing if not impressive, has been criticized for allowing people
without medical training to have too large a role. One volunteer,
who insisted on remaining anonymous, said that he was once allowed
to assist Magee in surgery _ even to perform minor surgery _
although he had no medical background. ``I shouldn't have even been
there,'' the volunteer said.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said volunteers may have been allowed to cut sutures from
time to time, but he has no memory of this incident and he doubted
it happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One recurring grievance among volunteers and others associated
with the charity is the lack of independent review when there are
problems. While Interplast has in place a quality assurance
committee, made of medical professionals who had nothing to do with
the care, to investigate unusual outcomes and report to the board,
the Magees rely on councils that only meet once a year and are not
necessarily privy to all incidents. Magee personally chairs the
council for plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggerating The Numbers
</P>
<P>
   The quest to dazzle donors and outsiders alike with its good
works seems to have led Operation Smile to exaggerate how many
children it has helped. While the organization has helped literally
tens of thousands of children overseas, its activities at home are
less impressive. The 20,000 to 25,000 children in the United States
that Operation Smile says it has helped in brochures, press
briefings and speeches, represent children cared for by its medical
volunteers with little or no involvement by the charity, according
to an internal memo written by Magee in October.
</P>
<P>
   The charity also appears to have taken steps on its latest tax
return, the only public document by which charities can really be
judged, to make itself look much larger and more efficient,
according to Daniel Borochoff, the president of the American
Institute of Philanthropy, a Bethesda, Md., watchdog group that
grades charities. In completing its 1997 tax return, the latest
available, the charity included the ostensible value of the
services donated by its volunteers _ $30.8 million _ as part of its
$59.7 million in revenues from program services.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service explicitly tells charities not to
include donated services as a part of those revenues, according to
an official from the service. Operation Smile appears to have
filled out the forms correctly in 1996, only to have Borochoff
criticize the charity at the time for not spending more of its
money on its programs. By including donated services, the charity
can make it appear that each dollar goes farther, and Interplast,
its rival, has also improperly included the value of services in
its revenues in its 1997 return but says it is now amending the
document. Operation Smile officials say they too have decided to
amend their return.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning The Charity's Goals
</P>
<P>
   Other events over the last two years have also created serious
criticism of the organization even as it would seem to be enjoying
unprecedented success. In early 1998, with much fanfare, Operation
Smile had announced a new program called the Smile Train, whose aim
was to provide training and equipment to Chinese doctors to allow
local doctors to operate on children. Glowing with a $10-million
pledge from Wang, the largest in the charity's history, as well as
$1 million from Gates and millions of dollars promised by other
donors, the charity said it would begin this work in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the project ended up being sidetracked in favor of another
idea: the World Journey of Hope, a nine-week tour of 18 countries,
from Honduras to Russia to China, to treat 5,300 children.
</P>
<P>
   Within Operation Smile, the World Journey project was met with
heavy criticism from directors, staff and volunteers. A huge
endeavor, involving the leasing of a flying hospital from Pat
Robertson, the $8.8 million price tag seemed, to some, hard to
justify. About $465,000, before expenses, was paid to the charity's
public relations firm, Ruder-Finn, to generate publicity. Another
$446,000 was spent on materials and outreach.
</P>
<P>
   The World Journey certainly proved a photo opportunity in the
various countries it landed, with dignitaries and other politicians
quick to call. But many associated with the charity say that too
many volunteers treated the trip as a personal vacation, and the
opportunity to provide education and equipment was squandered. ``It
was basically a promotion,'' said one disappointed volunteer, on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   With concerns growing about the charity's conduct, several
members of the board and large donors began pulling their support.
By the end of 1998, two directors _ Wang and Brian F. Mullaney, a
New York advertising executive, had resigned. The money Wang
originally pledged for the Smile Train was diverted into a new
charity of the same name. Wang declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Magee said Operation Smile was willing to let go of the Smile
Train project and all the money earmarked for it because the
organization was in danger of becoming too ``China-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   But tension continued to grow between other directors and the
Magees. Operation Smile had experienced huge turnover among its top
staff, and by spring 1999 the founders wanted to oust Operation
Smile's chief executive, Thomas Fox, the former chief executive of
the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, who had been brought in
to try to run the organization more professionally. But
foreshadowing a showdown, the board instead voted to keep Fox.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the first round of scathing anonymous e-mail began
making the rounds to the charity's board and top officers. Later
that month, the Magees abruptly canceled a scheduled board meeting.
A few days later, Fox agreed to leave the charity at the end of the
year. Outraged, board members began to resign: Ann Ziff, a
prominent philanthropist; Robert A. Peterson, the vice president of
development for Thomas Jefferson University; Stephen O'Conner, the
president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, a N.J. civic group. Nancy
Gary, president of Educational Commission for Foreign Medical
Graduates, also resigned, according to Operation Smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to participate in a farce,'' one exiting
director said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate donors were also alarmed. Gregory Johnson, the general
counsel for Warner-Lambert, quit, calling for an independent
investigation into the allegations made in the September anonymous
e-mail. Warner-Lambert has since cut all ties to the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Smile denied Fox was ever fired but said he will not
be renewing his contract next year. Fox declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that many of those involved in Operation Smile
are genuinely upset when a child dies or is hurt or would contend
that anyone delivering medical care will always have perfect
outcomes. ``Everybody wails,'' said Julia S. Heffernan, director of
international missions for the charity, ``and then we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is exactly this calculus that troubles many of the
charity's critics. When Magee talked about the devastation he felt
back in 1993 when two children died in China while he personally
oversaw the surgery, he said he was convinced about the need to go
on, given how many more children desperately needed his services.
He never did determine the causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere it lost its innocence,'' said one longtime volunteer
who left Operation Smile and spoke only on condition of anonymity.
Without the Magees, ``there wouldn't be an Operation Smile,'' this
person acknowledged, but the two refuse to hear any criticism about
how the charity is run. ``They wouldn't listen,'' the person said.
``It was their vision.''

MET   LIFE WANTS TO ISSUE STOCK TO 10 MILLION POLICYHOLDERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metropolitan Life, one of the nation's largest life
insurers, intends to file a formal plan with New York state
regulators on Wednesday for a reorganization in which it will issue
shares next spring. The stock would instantly become the most
widely held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the insurer, which is formally owned by
policyholders and known as a mutual company, said they expected
shares to be distributed to as many as 10 million policyholders,
giving the company far more shareholders than the current leader,
Lucent, which has 4.6 million shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it expected to issue 838 million shares valued
at $14 to $24 each. Most of the shares will go to policyholders as
compensation for their ownership in the company, but the company
expects to raise up to $5.6 billion in sales to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, a spokesman for MetLife, said it was not clear how
many shares would go to each policyholder. But he said the shares
would be apportioned according to several factors, including the
value of the insurance, and added that the vast majority of the
company's policies were worth $10,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife is one of several big insurers that are abandoning their
mutual structure, which was created to provide insurance to people
at the lowest possible price and which functions much like a
cooperative. MetLife began moving toward restructuring about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual insurers, including the John Hancock Insurance Co. in
Boston and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, say that
the creation of publicly held shares will give them a currency to
use in acquiring other insurers and businesses like banks and
brokerage firms as the financial services industry consolidates.
All the leaders are striving to dominate their markets and to
achieve greater economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion will also provide a fortune in bonuses for the
executives of MetLife and the other mutual companies who, for the
first time, will be able to receive stock optetLife
executives will be able to receive their first options a year after
the initial public offering which, according to a spokesman, Kevin
Foley, was expected to take place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York law, a mutual company is required to distribute
its accumulated profits or equity to its policyholders when it
converts to shareholder ownership. In information on the plan being
sent to policyholders and regulators, equity was shown as $13.5
billion. The plan must be approved by New York regulators and
two-thirds of the policyholders who vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversion to a stock company will compensate our
policyholders for their membership interests in MetLife,'' said
Robert H. Benmosche, the chief executive of the insurer, ``and will
provide MetLife with the capital structure it needs to aggressively
pursue strategic opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   While the vast majority of policyholders will be eligible to
receive stock, Foley said, about 10 percent of the 11.5 million
policyholders will receive either cash or enhancements to their
coverage because of tax laws and for ease of administration.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that for years the company had been unable to find
about 600,000 holders of small insurance policies worth a few
hundred dollars each. Their share of the accumulated profits, he
said, will be held in trust and eventually turned over to the state
if it goes unclaimed. &QL;

 &HT;    Loan, pawn or check, and try your luck, too
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Cash-strapped workers who resort to
400-percent interest-rate loans against their next paycheck can
also take a spin with Lady Luck _ all at the same counter, thanks
to the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Lottery tickets are sold by 161 check-cashing stores,
payday loan stores and pawnshops, many located in low-income
neighborhoods, according to a Palm Beach Post newspaper analysis of
lottery sales from the 1998-99 budget year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the state has no business offering lottery tickets
in places that cater not just to poor people, but to poor people in
dire straits. ``Folks who go in there are desperate enough
anyway,'' said Doreen Barker, head of Florida Legal Services, a
group that helps the poor with legal problems. ``I'm outraged that
the State of Florida would actually contract with this industry to
sell lottery tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Lottery Secretary David Griffin defended the decision, even
though he joined the Lottery in July and the 156 check-cashing
stores and five pawn shops in question were all awarded the
contracts under previous leadership. ``It's unfair to disparage or
generalize the people who use these stores,'' Griffin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I've used them myself to pay a phone bill simply
because it was convenient. Many people do the same. That does not
mean we or the Lottery is taking advantage of anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Check-cashing stores allow customers _ many who have no bank
account _ to cash payroll checks for 3 percent to 6 percent fees.
At least half of the stores identified by the Post also offer
payday loans _ short-term, high-interest loans against a coming
paycheck. Pawn shops offer high-interest loans with customers
leaving jewelry or other valuables as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   None is barred by Lottery rules from becoming a ticket vendor.
The only rule defining who can and cannot sell lottery tickets is
one that prohibits a business from selling only lottery tickets and
nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery spokesman Leo DiBenigno defended the agency's giving
ticket franchises to the stores, saying the outlets represent ``an
insignificant percentage'' of the 11,500 Lottery vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The Post analysis of lottery sales and outlets found that
checking-cashing stores and pawnshops tend to be located in areas
with high percentages of poor, less-educated residents _ areas that
also show disproportionate ticket sales compared to wealthier,
better-educated communities.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top lottery vendors among the check-cashing stores
last year, for instance, was Check Cashing USA on Northwest 17th
Street in Miami, which sold $387,000 in lottery tickets. Residents
of that area, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics, had an
average per-capita income of $6,177, compared to the state's
average per-capita income of just over $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the stores, however, sold far fewer tickets. The average
sold just under $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   One such store was Any Kind Check Cashed on U.S. 1 in Fort
Pierce, which last year sold $21,490 in scratch-off tickets to its
customers. The average income in the neighborhood is $9,381.
</P>
<P>
   The store takes no position on whether payday loan customers
should buy tickets. ``It's up to them,'' said teller Brenda
Thompson. ``After we give it to them, it's their money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state shouldn't be providing any temptations, said
Attorney General Bob Butterworth. ``Somebody has to go there for a
payday loan, and we're going to sell them a lottery ticket?''
Butterworth said upon hearing of the Post's findings. ``That's just
wrong.''

 &HT;    Judge to hear whether pig music is soothing or savage
 &HT;    By Pat Moore

<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ A Treasure Coast judge will take a musical
sojourn this spring to a Stuart neighborhood where a golfing
community is feuding with two farmers over the volume of the radios
they play for their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could take my golf clubs and, when I make my back
swing, turn on the music to see if I jump or not,'' Circuit Judge
Ben Bryan told attorneys representing the pig farmers and the golf
club Tuesday.

Rossano and their wives, before reaching a verdict in the non-jury
trials he tentatively set for March or April.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Club filed suits in April 1998 accusing their
hog-owning neighbors of directing loud radio speakers in their
direction to harass golfers and discourage potential home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Thompsons and Rossanos insist the country and pop music
reduces their hogs' stress, causes them to fatten quicker and
enhances the tenderness of their meat.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for both sides asked the judge to visit the
neighborhood near Kanner Highway and Kansas Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the judge to different parts of the golf
course to show him just how far the sound goes,'' said Florida Club
attorney Louis Lozeau. ``We want him to get a flavor for really how
loud this music is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie Richard, attorney for both farmers, said she wants the
Bryan to hear the music, which experts have determined falls within
levels allowed by Martin County's noise ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about being in the middle of a rock concert
_ or even noise as loud as a lawn mower,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the 4th District Court of Appeal refused to hear the
Rossanos' appeal of an earlier Martin County code enforcement board
decision that their property is not zoned for raising pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Lozeau said the county has started levying daily fines against
the Rossanos because they have refused to remove pigs from their
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe (the Rossanos) are going to continue playing music
to benefit some animal _ whether it's geese, pigs, a cow or
chickens,'' he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard argued the case was about music _ not pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of whether they want to play music for their
pigs or they want to play music for their teenage daughter while
she's washing the car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said he would listen to music from any place on The
Florida Club or the farmers' properties that the attorneys suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody might want to analyze my ears to see if I have normal
hearing,'' he added.

 &HT;    Judge tells Bisek to release documents
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Details of former U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's six-year affair with a congressional aide won't remain
murky for long.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a judge here ordered Gingrich's lover, Callista
Bisek, to turn over a range of letters, gifts, phone records, bank
statements and appointment books dating back to 1995 that could
help chronicle their relationship. Gingrich's wife, Marianne,
subpoenaed the items more than two months ago in the couple's Cobb
County divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   With Bisek's challenge to that subpoena now behind her, Marianne
Gingrich may get the chance to depose Bisek under oath as early as
Dec. 14. Lawyers for both sides like that date, assuming Bisek is
able to comply with the judge's order in time. The Gingriches are
scheduled to meet for court-ordered mediation in Georgia two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich hopes the Bisek records and a deposition will
reveal the depth of her husband's admitted ``intimate
relationship'' with the Virginia woman, who works as a scheduler
for the House Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 9 deposition Bisek gave to Gingrich's attorneys, she
was vague about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until 1993 that we really started to know each
other,'' Bisek said, according to an excerpt from an unreleased
transcript of that deposition that was read in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, told Washington
Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge that he wants to know everything
Gingrich spent on Bisek and why. Under Georgia law, such details
become important at trial when it comes to dividing assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what's being funneled where,'' said Mayoue, who
questioned a $1,300 charge card purchase Bisek made for golf clubs,
presumably the same ones Bisek has said Newt Gingrich gave her as a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, through his attorneys, has denied he has tried to hide
assets from his wife since filing for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling gave Marianne Gingrich, 48, her second victory
in as many court appearances since Newt Gingrich, 56, filed for
divorce in July. Her first win came two weeks ago when a Cobb
County Superior Court judge ordered Newt Gingrich to respond to
several dozen questions he has refused to answer. One question even
asks Gingrich whether his married life is in keeping with the
``family values'' he has espoused politically and professionally.
Gingrich's responses are due Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   This week's ruling wasn't all one-sided, however. Hedge also
took steps to protect Bisek's privacy where Newt Gingrich is not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Phone records, for example, will mask the names of persons other
than Gingrich to whom Bisek, 33, placed calls. Descriptions such as
``doctor'' or ``high school friend'' can be used instead, the judge
ruled. Marianne Gingrich will have to go back to court to learn
more about those people. The same technique goes for bank records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think it's the province of everybody on the
street to know these things,'' Hedge said, later issuing a
protective order over the excluded material. ``I will be very upset
if it gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisek had argued that many of Marianne Gingrich's requests for
documents were either too vague or broad, and violated her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge pointed out that Bisek couldn't be compared to a
bystander at an accident scene who just watched things happen.
</P>
<P>
   As for information concerning Bisek's affair with Gingrich,
there was nothing in the judge's ruling that prohibited Marianne
Gingrich's attorneys from making those details public.

EDUCATION COLUMN: EMPHASIS ON SCORES COMES AT A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Va., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a national consensus that students need more competency
in reading, math, science and history. But Americans also want
schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.
When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do
they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
</P>
<P>
   When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers
inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills. Less easily
tested ones get shorter shrift. For example, it is simpler to test
vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may
dilute literacy, not enhance it.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic
competencies. The public once trusted teachers and administrators
to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and
other activities. They may not always have gotten it right, but
today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good
balance either. If basic skills were undervalued before, they are
probably overemphasized now.
</P>
<P>
   Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives. Teachers
must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop
citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.
Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to
schedule the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas. Consider the
Academy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly
poor and minority students. It may be closed if scores do not
improve, so it now requires extra drills in basics. To find time,
teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth. It
has doubled math and English requirements for half its
ninth-graders because they cannot graduate without passing state
exams. To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an
elective, like fine arts or gym.
</P>
<P>
   And in the affluent Washington suburb of Waterford, Va., an
elementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans
for environmental studies because these cannot increase passing
rates on statewide exams.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the current math and science focus is working. More
high schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and
physics. Test scores are rising. But more teenagers have fatty
diets; physical education enrollment has plummeted. Adolescent
obesity has soared. Neither children nor our economy will prosper
if graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor
exercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior. Should
Charlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education
instead?
</P>
<P>
   Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills. But
pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative,
project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on
standardized exams.
</P>
<P>
   People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation,
not violence. But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly
accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do
more. A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public
wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take
responsibility.'' Only 39 percent say it should be academics. The
rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first''
in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth
for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community
service), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having
them ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps
Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if
that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.
Perhaps not. The public cannot debate these choices if schools are
accountable only for basic skills results.
</P>
<P>
   Standardized tests have improved many American schools.
Nonetheless, society pays a price for this progress. If Americans
do not equally demand accountability for less easily measured
outcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public
education.

MARKET PLACE: QUESTIONS ABOUT DETECTING FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when a brokerage firm's auditor discovers that some
of the firm's assets have been used to support another company and
that as a result the firm has run out of capital? At a brokerage
firm in Texas, the alarm bells sounded. The company quickly came up
with additional capital and the National Association of Securities
Dealers began an investigation. The firm's chief financial officer
was fined and suspended from her job for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one seems to have looked very carefully at
where the extra capital came from. The Securities and Exchange
Commission now alleges in a civil case that the $1.7 million of
capital that was supplied was simply stolen from the firm's
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firm, Sunpoint Securities Inc. of Longview, Texas,
continued operating for nearly two more years _ during which time
the SEC now says an additional $23 million was stolen. The firm,
which did business in many states and had more than 200 brokers
with about 9,000 customers, closed its doors last week after the
SEC, tipped off by a Sunpoint employee, discovered that millions
were missing from customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunpoint was not a major firm, the case raises questions
about the ability of regulators to detect and prevent fraud, even
after problems have been spotted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, where people set out to deceive regulators and
cover their tracks very well, it can be very difficult to uncover
fraud,'' said Mary Schapiro, the president of NASD Regulation Inc.,
the regulatory arm of the NASD, in a telephone interview on
Tuesday. ``Often an informant makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the customers of Sunpoint will end up
losing money. Their accounts are covered up to $500,000 by
Securities Investor Protection Corp., which has appointed a trustee
for Sunpoint. Customers with less than $500,000 in their accounts
will receive the securities, although they will not be able to
trade them for at least several weeks. Customers with account
balances larger than $500,000 could suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
   After the capital shortfall was discovered in December 1997, the
firm received some special regulatory attention _ including
examinations by the NASD once a year, more frequent than those
given to most brokerage firms. But an examination this summer did
not reveal the missing money, nor did an audit last year by the
firm's auditors, Cheshier &AMP; Fuller of Dallas. The firm was forced
to make promises regarding the way it would be run, but those
promises appear to have been broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly had some concern about how the company was
operating,'' Ms. Schapiro said. ``While we didn't believe those
earlier cases evidenced fraud, they caused us to take regulatory
action and to put them under heightened regulatory scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC began its own investigation of Sunpoint at the same time
the net capital issue arose. But a lawyer for Sunpoint said that
investigation, which has not led to charges, dealt with whether
customers were sold unsuitable securities, not with issues
regarding the firm's books.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a tip from a Sunpoint employee led to action. That
tip came on Friday, Nov. 12, said Spencer Barasch, associate
district administrator for the SEC in Fort Worth, Texas. He said he
sent examiners to the firm's offices on the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with the federal court in Tyler, Texas, as
part of the fraud charges filed by the SEC, Douglas Michael Dieter,
who worked in Sunpoint's accounting department, said that he began
diverting money from a money market fund in December 1997, at the
instruction of Mary Ellen Wilder, the firm's chief financial
officer. That was about the same time that the auditors found a
capital shortage, and the SEC claims that the money diverted then
was funneled through other accounts controlled by Van Lewis ,
Sunpoint's chief executive officer and controlling shareholder, and
then sent back to Sunpoint as new capital.
</P>
<P>
   The practice at Sunpoint was to sweep all excess cash in
customer accounts into a money market account maintained by the
firm with Alliance Capital. When a customer sold securities, the
money would go into that fund unless the customer instructed
otherwise. When a customer wanted to use that money to buy
securities, it would be transferred out. As a result, there were
daily flows into and out of the Alliance account. Alliance is not
suspected of any wrongdoing.

</P>
<P>
   By the end of October, Dieter said, the firm's records showed
that customers had $37.6 million in the money market account. In
fact, the account had only $12.4 million. Barasch said that at
least $3 million was diverted into the personal accounts of Lewis.
The SEC says that Ms. Wilder, the chief financial officer, diverted
some money this month to pay her legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilder's lawyer did not return telephone calls. Lewis'
lawyer said neither he nor his client would comment. Jeff Cheshier,
a partner in the auditing firm, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the SEC examiners sent to Sunpoint on Nov. 15 was Gordon
Cox, a senior staff accountant. In an affidavit filed in federal
court, he said he asked for records related to customer ownership
of the money market fund account and was told by Ms. Wilder that
she knew of no such records. When he asked for a particular record
by its computer file number, she said she was unable to get it in
the computer system and promised to try to retrieve it overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Tuesday, Nov. 16, Ms. Wilder did not come to work,
Cox said. Other employees provided the record in question, which
showed the shortfall. On Wednesday, Nov. 17, Sunpoint officials
told Cox that Ms. Wilder had resigned and that Lewis, the chief
executive officer, had flown to the Virgin Islands. The firm closed
the next day, and the SEC filed civil fraud charges on Friday
against Sunpoint, Lewis and Ms. Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   Sunpoint had a previous brush with the NASD. In 1994, Lewis was
fined $40,000 and suspended from the industry for 10 days after the
regulator concluded that Sunpoint had overstated its capital. In
addition, Lewis was permanently barred from working as a financial
principal with a brokerage firm. So far as the regulators were
concerned, that meant he could not be chief financial officer, but
he could still be chief executive _ and the boss of the chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators seem to have concluded that the case showed that
Sunpoint needed better financial systems, but did not raise
questions of intentional wrongdoing. In settling the case, Sunpoint
agreed to hire a certified public accountant, Ms. Wilder, to
supervise its finances.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 case, the auditors discovered that certificates of
deposit shown as belonging to Sunpoint were pledged to support
loans to another company owned by Lewis. They also discovered that
one company account had substantially less money than Sunpoint had
claimed. The penalties included a $50,000 fine of Ms. Wilder, who
was also suspended for 10 days. Sunpoint was ordered not to use its
securities to guarantee other loans and was required to regularly
sweep customer cash into a money market fund _ the same fund the
SEC now says was raided by executives.
</P>
<P>
   The trustee appointed by SIPC, Robert Richardson, a partner in
Jackson Walker, a Dallas law firm, said Tuesday night that most of
the Sunpoint customer accounts would be transferred to two firms _
J.P. Turner &AMP; Co. of Atlanta and Corporate Securities Group, a
subsidiary of J.W. Genesis Financial Services of Boca Raton, Fla.
He said he expected that customers would get letters in about a
week stating which firm had received their accounts, and hoped that
the customers could gain access to their accounts, to trade in them
or transfer them to another firm, by Dec. 20.

ON READING HISTORY BETWEEN THE LINES OF FACES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It seems that no two 20th centuries are alike. Most of
the planet lived through the same amazing technological changes and
the same two world wars, and in this media era the vast majority
saw the same or similar visual reports of major events;
nonetheless, every nation has a distinct version of history and a
distinct way of looking at the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even within one country, people see and experience the time
largely the way they choose to; it may be that each one of us has a
personal version of national history and another of international
history as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faces of the Century: A Sainsbury's Photographic Exhibition,''
currently at the National Portrait Gallery in London (through Jan.
30), points this up quite cleverly. (Sainsbury's is a private arts
sponsorship program set up by grocery chain money in 1981 to
deliver, as the accompanying catalog explains, ``high quality,
imaginative and dynamic arts sponsorships involving as many people
as possible in the communities where we trade.'')
</P>
<P>
   Restricting the century to faces, and British faces at that _
you had best look elsewhere for anyone important, like Stalin or
Mao, beyond these sceptered isles _ ensures a certain idiosyncratic
slant. The show, which will travel to three British venues, sails
breezily along with a pound or two of profundity for ballast.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting the century through faces sounds like Carlyle's
notion that history was synonymous with major figures: ``The
history of the world is but the biography of great men.''
Historians (and, among others, Karl Marx) have been notoriously
dubious about this proposition, saying that larger forces were at
work that men (and perhaps on one or two occasions women) merely
harnessed or fit into.
</P>
<P>
   Photographic portraits are not biographies anyway, nor are they
particularly effective at conveying or symbolizing events or ideas
or drives larger than the subjects themselves unless those subjects
happen to be holy figures, heads of state or sex goddesses.
</P>
<P>
   A portrait of Enrico Fermi or Robert Oppenheimer could stand for
the atom bomb, but if you want to get the message over fast, I
suggest a picture of a mushroom cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the National Portrait Gallery has allowed ``portrait''
to be defined broadly enough to include groups and crowds, a few
action pictures and photographs of the anonymous. The great man _
and now woman _ principle still rules, but with a twist: they are
the people who chose the pictures. Ten well-known Britons (some
better known in the United Kingdom than in the United States) were
each asked to select 10 photographic portraits to illustrate their
ideas of what mattered in this century.
</P>
<P>
   David Bowie (rock singer, songwriter, actor), Asa Briggs
(historian), Anna Ford, (broadcaster), Max Hastings (newspaper
editor, author), Stephen Hawking (scientist), Helena Kennedy
(college president, chairwoman of the British Council, president of
the National Children's Bureau), Trevor Phillips (broadcaster,
chairman of the London Arts Board), David Puttnam (filmmaker), John
Sainsbury (chairman of the Sainsbury Arts Sponsorship Panel,
director of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, college president)
and Vivienne Westwood (fashion designer) selected good, bad and
indifferent photographs for the sake of what they represented as
much as whom.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the photographs, though many are fine enough, turn out
to be less interesting than the choices and explanations of this
diverse and independent-minded group of people, each of whom looked
at the 20th century through a lens so individual as to suggest that
no two lists in the world would be entirely the same.
</P>
<P>
   Vivienne Westwood, who chose some of the most amusing pictures,
including one of herself parodying Margaret Thatcher, stayed
largely with fashion from ``some sense of responsibility,'' she
says, ``of what people might expect of me,'' an odd bit of
kowtowing to public opinion by the woman who was the co-creator of
the punk look.
</P>
<P>
   Most selectors were more diverse, but speaking roughly, and
leaving out a lot of asides, they focused on three major changes in
Britain in this century: the communications revolution, the status
of women and the advent of multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs, who has spent much of his scholarly life writing about
broadcasting, makes the case for communications. Lord Northcliffe,
who founded The Daily Mail and The Daily Mirror around the turn of
the century and soon acquired control of The Times, turns up, and
so do Mrs. Thatcher and Francois Mitterrand signing the Channel
Tunnel Treaty in 1986, setting in motion another kind of
communication. And then there's a baby clutching a stuffed toy and
staring at a computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The media message could scarcely go unrecognized in a show about
photographs of the century. Ms. Kennedy selects a photograph of an
enormous crowd listening to the Sinn Fein leader Michael Collins in
1922 and remarks that face-to-face political communication like
that has just about gone with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie chooses two fairly dull pictures of major subjects: one of
John Logie Baird, who first transmitted images by wireless waves in
1924, and one of a talking head on television in 1946. And the many
movie stars and popular entertainers like Vivien Leigh and the
Rolling Stones may not be singled out here as media products but
that is what they are.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens with a large blow-up of a frantic mob of
teenagers, mostly girls, struggling with bobbies on the day the
Beatles received their MBEs (Member of the Order of the British
Empire) from the Queen, an event that in itself marks the nation's
recognition of the importance of heroes who ride the media waves.
</P>
<P>
   As for women, Stephen Hawking says he ``concentrates on
scientists and women, whom I consider the important members of
society.'' The four women in his group, none of them scientists (an
accurate reflection of the position of women in the sciences for
most of this century), are Virginia Woolf; Mrs. Thatcher (a glamour
portrait by the fashion photographer Norman Parkinson); Diana,
looking a bit like a piece of Hummel porcelain in a photograph by
Snowdon (who goes by a single name, much as she did), and a sedate
portrait of the suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Pankhurst turns up again in a different incarnation in Anna
Ford's group, being bodily carried off by the police in 1914. A
nameless suffragist addresses a group of working-class men in 1908
in Asa Briggs' section. (The campaign for women's suffrage did not
succeed in Britain until 1928, the year of Pankhurst's death.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ford chose women only, remarking that their lives changed
radically in this century but slowly, and that they are still
underrepresented in the top ranks of almost everything. Britain
elected its first woman to parliament in 1919, appointed its first
female government minister in 1924, its first female life peer in
1958 and its first female high court judge in 1965. (For what it's
worth, America elected its first woman to Congress in 1917 and
appointed its first woman to the cabinet in 1933.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, incidentally, get a bad rap in this show. Hastings
excluded them, because, he says, ``so few exercise lasting
influence upon their times.'' Lord Sainsbury permitted none in but
Churchill, because politicians generally ``will be barely
remembered in a hundred years.''
</P>
<P>
   Women constitute a category that will last longer. Among Ms.
Ford's images of women are a group of laughing coal workers during
World War I, women slaving to keep their households clean in ``The
Steamies'' (the public wash house) in 1939 and the founders of
Virago Press, which from 1973 has published books by and about
women.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures were not necessarily taken for feminist causes.
The first was probably a report on the home front in wartime; the
second was taken by Humphrey Spender, a fine journalist, for a
series on British towns in Picture Post; the third, by Susan
Greenhill, looks like a news photograph. Photographs were
undoubtedly one of the most widely produced products of the
century, and those that are indexed and accessible constitute a
voluminous historical archive, to be read and plumbed by different
people for different ends. They are malleable documents that can be
appended to various histories and causes, and they are, all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The selectors include one black man, Phillips, who traces
multiculturalism, and a white man, Puttnam, who does the same. This
facet of British life is the closest anyone comes to speaking of
the breakup of empire. Both men chose pictures of Sir Oswald
Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists and admirer of
Hitler in the 1930s, and both included a picture taken on the
Empire Windrush, a ship that brought 492 passengers and eight
stowaways from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also presents a picture of Earl Mountbatten, last
viceroy of India, and his wife sitting on the same level as a crowd
of Indian dignitaries in 1948, preparing to relinquish the jewel in
the crown. Phillips says the overriding change has been the chance
for everyone to determine his or her own life, a judgment that
could be made about women's issues as well.
</P>
<P>
   David Bowie, who favors creative types, turns the explanatory
caption on its ear with captions composed of anagrams spat out by a
computer program. The first two lines for ``Samuel Beckett Irish
playwright'' are ``This huge typewriter blackmails. Superbly hit
witchlike megastar.'' The first and last lines for ``Peter
Mandelson British politician'' are ``The brainiest implication
splendor'' and ``Cheerio! Brilliant disappointments'' _ which
sounds like an offhand British comment on the century itself. What
a relief to have the computer scrambling words instead of images at
this point in time!

IMMEDIATE TAKEOVER OF IBF IS DENIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.J.)   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A federal judge Tuesday turned down a request by
federal prosecutors to remove control of the International Boxing
Federation from its indicted leaders immediately, but he said he
would hear additional arguments in the case on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the judge, John Bissell, came in response to an
attempt by the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Robert Cleary, to
bring the sanctioning and ranking organization under the control of
a court-appointed monitor. In a 32-count indictment filed Nov. 4,
federal officials charged that the IBF's top officials had extorted
money from boxers and managers in exchange for rankings and a shot
at lucrative bouts. The law-enforcement officials announced Monday
that they were seeking a monitor who would have subpoena power and
a mandate to restructure the organization, ridding it of what the
federal officials called corruption and racketeering influences.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's hearing also added a new and confusing wrinkle to
the already complicated case. Lawyers for the IBF and its New
Jersey-based officials said their clients themselves were victims
of misconduct by other officials of the group. Lawyers for IBF
president Robert W. Lee Sr., one of those under indictment, said
Tuesday that late last week Lee had moved in state court here to
wrest control of the bank accounts of the IBF from three people who
were described as Oregon-based minority shareholders and officers
of the for-profit company that is the owner of the not-for-profit
ranking organization.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, New Jersey Chancery Judge Julio Fuentes granted the
motion sought by Lee to bar the three people, Robert Weitzel, Zola
Weitzel and Hugh McDonald, from access to the sanctioning body's
Oregon bank accounts and ordered them to turn over records of the
organization that were in their possession. Lee charged in court
papers that the three had ``diverted'' a total of $1.5 million from
the organization since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures represented perhaps the first public
acknowledgment by Lee and other IBF officials that a for-profit
organization has been behind the organization since 1986. The
organization had always publicly represented itself as a
not-for-profit entity, but as recently as 1996, rumors and reports
began surfacing about the for-profit corporation based in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Pat English, the lawyer for Main Event boxing promotions, said
TUesday that he had first discovered the existence of a for-profit
entity in 1996 when he was representing Michael Moorer in a lawsuit
against the IBF Moorer contended that the organization's rankings
had fraudulently denied him a heavyweight title bout. In his
investigations, English said, he learned of the existence of the
for-profit corporation and learned of the names of the Weitzels and
McDonald, who were listed as vice president, secretary and
treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortly after I disclosed this information the case settled in
favor of my client,'' English said in an interview Tuesday. ``We
were planning to point to this as an example of the organization's
corruption and attempts to hide something, and I concluded that the
settlement was related to what I planned to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. District Court in Newark on Tuesday, Lee's lawyer,
Gerald Krovatin, and the IBF's lawyer, Linda Torres, said that the
leadership of the group had ``decided to wind down the for-profit
entity in Oregon and place it under the control of the nonprofit
entity,'' which is incorporated in Rhode Island. The two lawyers as
well as the papers filed in state court contend that the move is an
attempt to ``consolidate'' the assets of the organization and
protect them from being dissipated by the minority shareholders in
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Weitzels, who are a married couple, could not be reached for
comment. McDonald, reached by telephone, acknowledged that he had
been a shareholder of the for-profit corporation and called Lee's
allegations ``a total fabrication''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a scramble by our illustrious president to try
to shift the attention away from himself,'' said McDonald, who hung
up saying that he had nothing else to say.
</P>
<P>
   In their court papers, the not-for-profit IBF and Lee maintain
that it was the Weitzels and McDonald who advised him in 1986 to
incorporate the IBF as a for-profit entity in Oregon. But board
members of the not-for-profit organization at the time, such as
Alvin Goodman, a Miami lawyer, said they knew nothing of such
advice or the creation of another IBF entity.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he learned of the existence of the for-profit
corporation in 1997 and said he had been ``shocked'' at the news.

<P>
   As Internet retailers crow that the country is about to have
another e-Christmas, brick-and-mortar stores are striking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wish list programs,'' first promoted by online sites as the
perfect Internet holiday convenience, are now being usurped by
traditional shopping destinations.
</P>
<P>
   A ``me generation'' update of the bridal registry, the wish list
allows any candidly acquisitive consumer to record gift choices by
simply checking size, color and model number. Dan Swaab, a
29-year-old architect, recently put a black pullover from clothing
outlet Butch Blum and customized picture frame at a store called
Fireworks, among other items, on his list. But instead of signing
up on a computer site, he did so at the University Village shopping
mall outside Seattle, which has been providing forms since the
beginning of November for visitors to fill in as they visit their
favorite boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   The completed lists can be dropped off at locations throughout
the complex and are entered into a database (at no cost to
shoppers) that is available both on the mall's Internet site and at
kiosks. Swaab, who said he is familiar with the Internet but ``not
a full bore browser,'' sees no advantage to doing a wish list
solely on the Internet. ``Returns can be such a hassle,'' he
explained. ``This way I've tried everything on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if this holiday season's online sales reach the high-end
predictions of $12 billion, traditional retailers will ring up
about 14 times that amount. But mall merchants need to do more than
hold their own during the season that accounts for much of their
profits for the year. Retailers know they are facing a pervasive
stereotype that real-world holiday shopping is a parking and
service nightmare. So to make sure Americans do not stay home in
front of their computers to buy gifts, stores are beefing up basics
like customer service and displaying innovative incentives that
range from cash to psychics who select something for hard to please
in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday season always brings out a creative streak in
merchants, and that has been accented this year by fear. Since the
economy remains strong, the official outlook for Christmas 1999 is
very bullish _ the National Retail Federation predicts total sales
will be about $184 billion, up 6 percent from last year. But the
growth in retail sales slowed in October and November, suggesting
that consumers might not be as willing to dip into their pockets to
satisfy their appetite for DVD players and pashmina shawls. For
merchants who rely on Christmas foot traffic for a large chunk of
the year's sales, the potential softening of consumer demand has
combined with heightened Internet hype to put them on edge.
</P>
<P>
   Although most merchants and malls will not admit having such
Internet fears for the record, retail analysts say the early rush
to put decorations in the windows and the ever-earlier markdowns
show that retailers on the ground are feeling pressured. ``Mostly
traditional retailers are acting very defensively about
Christmas,'' said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic
Retail, a consulting firm. ``They feel that all the talk on the
Internet is going to drain them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the most interesting retailers to watch this season are
those whose livelihoods are most directly challenged by the Web.
The Web site of Borders Group is a footnote in the battle between
Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com to dominate cyberspace book
sales, but the chain is rolling out holiday ideas to remain
competitive for in-store sales.

   This season, Borders' stores will hold art-and-crafts workshops
where children can make bookmarks out of construction paper and
crayons. The chain will also hand out booklets of appropriate
quotations for book inscriptions for the wit impaired. For example,
shoppers giving books on personal finance are advised to copy a
quote from Mark Twain, ``The lack of money is the root of all
evil,'' onto the front flap. ``We wanted to be extra resource for
our customers this year,'' said a Borders spokeswoman, Ann Binkley.
</P>
<P>
   Malls, which have the most to lose if shoppers decide to avoid
their crowds and parking headaches, are also being creative. Gurnee
Mills outside of Chicago has set up a Psychic Aid Station, where a
``tried and tested'' clairvoyant, Joanna Ammons, will conduct free
readings to help shoppers with holiday gift ideas every Saturday to
Dec. 18. Ms. Ammons, who claims to have successfully predicted 94
marriages, 74 divorces and eight lottery/casino lucky winnings in
the first six months of this year, only requires the name and date
of birth of a loved one to divine the perfect stocking stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   Other malls owned by Mills Corp. will have ``procrastination
stations'' where Mrs. Claus will be on hand to offer last-minute
gift suggestions and maps, as well as milk and cookies. Naturally,
Santa will be there, too. As an extra incentive to shoppers, the
mall is offering to take photos of children in order to create
postcards that can be sent free to anyone in the country.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Even retailers that have been doing well with consumers are
looking for new twists to make their stores more appealing. Target,
the low-price stylish unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., has opted for a
very direct kind of consumer gratification: money. Each day in
November and December, a user of the Target credit card will win
$2,000 as part of a ``2000 'til 2000'' promotion.
</P>
<P>
   And Banana Republic, a unit of Gap Inc. and a formidable
Internet presence itself, is taking its cut at luring the
technology generation by providing services like free cell phone
recharging and a download to Palm Pilot devices that includes a top
10 list of fun attractions near its flagship stores in urban
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the retail chain Electronics Boutique will be
roving the aisles with hand-held cash registers in 30 of its
Northeastern stores this holiday season. Seth Levy, the company's
chief information officer, calls the new system ``a line buster.''
He adds that the devices, which are equipped to take credit card
sales, create a intimate transaction. ``If I can talk to you
face-to-face in front of the register, we feel it is a closer
relationship than if there is a 4-foot block of wood between us,''
Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the innovations, improved convenience is a mantra among
the stores this season, as they are determined to combat the
perception that the Internet is less annoying for shopping,
according to J'Amy Owens, president of the Retail Group, a
Seattle-based consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Toys `R' Us Inc., the big retailer that has taken a
thrashing at the hand of disenchanted consumers in recent years and
faces fierce online competition from Amazon.com and Etoys.com, has
put special effort into polishing its performance for this
all-important season. Starting last June, the retailer sent sales
associates through a training program at the Disney Institute to
teach them to be more responsive to requests and more informed
about the products.
</P>
<P>
   Big department stores, which some say are difficult to shop in
because entering, reaching the gift and exiting can be tiresome,
are again focusing on ``bundling'' _ the practice of choosing
gifts, prewrapping them and putting them out front where consumers
can grab them on the go. For example, Provenance, a vitamin and
herbal retailer newly available on the cosmetics floor at Macy's,
has packaged groups of products in iridescent fabric and given them
names like Peace and Holiday Survival, which contains an enzyme
dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's will be experimenting with a new kiosk technology
that allows visitors to bypass the sales staff and do everything
from search for a product to completing a purchase through the
interactive machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers show that they are not going to roll over and die on
the customer service sword,'' Ms. Owens said. ``The real surprise
this season is that the traditional retailers are going to clean
the clock of the e-retailers. I am predicting a lot of online
flops.''

CHICAGO EXCHANGE AND GOLDMAN, SACHS MAY FORM AN ELECTRONIC OPTIONS
MARKET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Stock Exchange and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
said Tuesday that they were in talks to form an electronic options
market that would compete with the four major stock options
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed exchange would use an electronic system to trade
options on companies like Dell Computer and IBM in direct
competition with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American
Stock Exchange, the Pacific Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a group of large brokerage firms, including the
E(asterisk)Trade Group, Ameritrade and Knight/Trimark Group, said
they had formed the International Securities Exchange, an
electronic options market that is expected to begin operating in
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come as the Securities and Exchange Commission is
trying to increase competition in the options market and brokerage
firms and the financial exchanges are trying to find a way to deal
with the explosive growth of low-cost electronic trading.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Tuesday, executives at Goldman, Sachs said
they were discussing the creation of an electronic options market
that would be modeled on electronic exchanges in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking with numerous market participants including the
Chicago Stock Exchange on how such a market could be built,'' the
company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the world's
largest options market, said they were not troubled by the new
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already much more electronic than any other exchange,''
said Lynne Howard, a spokeswoman. ``So these threats of electronic
exchanges are less of a threat to us than to some other exchanges.
We have our own electronic system to roll out, so we're not quaking
in our boots.''
</P>
<P>
   The new electronic exchange, if approved by regulators, would
enter a market that has in recent months become increasingly
competitive after the nation's leading options exchanges began
listing equity options that were previously traded on just one
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The change has created a fierce battle for volume and dropped
the prices of many stock options, helping customers but hurting
some who make a market in such products.
</P>
<P>
   In the new competitive environment, several market makers and
options exchanges have been trying to lure volume to their venues,
sometimes paying for order flow and, in many cases, keeping order
flow internalized rather than sending it out to the larger market.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are not illegal, the SEC has frowned upon such
arrangements, and warned that the agency will aggressively patrol
the market to make sure that they don't reduce price competition.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Colby, the deputy director of market regulation at the
SEC, said that the agency welcomes competition in the options
market, but that there could be new pressure to steer orders to one
market and thereby prevent the market from operating efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like setting up a private little marketplace that no one
can play in,'' he said in an interview Tuesday. ``The question is:
will other people be able to compete for the orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Kelly, an executive vice president at the Chicago Stock
Exchange said that payment for order flow was not a factor in
setting up the exchange, but he did not rule out the possibility of
some arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Though several exchanges, including the CBOE, have explored
payment for order flow deals, the issue is a delicate one for
options exchanges and market makers, who are trying not to raise
the ire of regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, though, is a hot one in a world that is dramatically
changing because of multiple-listing of options, electronic trading
and pressure from the SEC, which wants the options exchanges by
January to submit a proposal that would allow them to link up with
one another to create a more competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape has become very competitive as of late,'' said
William J. Brodsky, chairman of the CBOE. ``This announcement
continues our resolve to do what were doing. We're trying to be the
best of both worlds, floor and screen.'' l

GENE LEVITT, TELEVISION WRITER WHO CREATED `FANTASY ISLAND,' DIES
AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ohio, Wyo., Calif.)   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Levitt, a television writer, director and producer who
created ``Fantasy Island,'' a popular show in the late 1970s, died
on Nov. 15 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on May 28, 1920, Levitt hitchhiked to
Wyoming on a whim after seeing a billboard about the west. A few
years later, he received a degree from the University of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   He then went to work for City News Service in Chicago. His
career in journalism was interrupted by World War II; he joined the
Marines and served as a bomb disposal officer in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he renewed a friendship with Robert Mitchell,
whom he had met at the University of Wyoming, and they started
working together. Their first joint project was the 1947 radio
drama ``The Adventures of Philip Marlowe.'' The series ran until
1949, with Gerald Mohr playing Raymond Chandler's detective.
Mitchell, who went on to write for various television shows
including ``Charlie's Angels,'' died on Oct. 13 in a car crash.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt wrote, directed and produced numerous television features
and series. His best known credits include ``Barnaby Jones,''
``Hawaii Five-O'' and ``Alias Smith and Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   His big hit, however, came in 1978, when he created ``Fantasy
Island,'' a romance about a faraway resort where guests' wishes
were fulfilled by the suave Ricardo Montalban.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``Da plane! Da plane!'' with which Montalban's
diminutive assistant, played by Herve Villechaize, greeted the
guests, has become part of the American lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous success of the show, as well as others he produced,
gave Levitt the freedom to pursue other interests; he lived on a
sailboat in Hawaii for three years. He was also an avid poker
player.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Levitt is survived by three sons, Chris, of
Seattle, Jon, of Cleveland, and Doug, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a
daughter, Lisa Levitt, of Pasadena, Calif.; two stepsons, Randy and
Tony Markes, both of Los Angeles; two stepdaughters, Julie Markes
Schine, of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Jennifer Markes, of Los Angeles; and
four grandchildren.

RUSSIA TO CUT ITS MILITARY FORCES IN GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a move that will blunt its influence in the
Caucasus, Russia has agreed to slash its military forces in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was negotiated last week in Istanbul during the
summit meeting of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in
Europe and completed even as Russia pressed ahead with its military
campaign in Chechnya, Georgia's neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We achieved almost everything we would have liked,'' said
Archil Gegeshidze, the foreign policy adviser to Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze, on Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``It is
very important and the beginning of a new relationship with the
Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Tuesday was not the only understanding
sealed in Istanbul. Moscow also agreed to withdraw its 2,500 troops
from Moldova by 2002, marking a further retreat from the former
Soviet republics around Russia's periphery, which Russians refer to
as the ``near abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, a former Soviet republic with a pro-Western policy, has
a complex relationship with Russia. Russia has four military bases
in Georgia, and the Georgians do not want all of them to close just
yet. Still, Georgia has been looking for a way to reduce Russia's
military presence, and the new accord will help Shevardnadze's
government move away from Moscow's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgian and Russian foreign ministry and military officials
began a final round of talks last week, however, the outcome was
far from certain. The negotiations were part of the broader effort
to update the treaty governing conventional military forces in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgian officials feared that the Russian campaign in
Chechnya was part of a new assertiveness in the Caucasus, and might
jeopardize the talks on reducing Russian forces in Georgia. Those
fears were aggravated by a blunt speech just before the summit
meeting by Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, casting the
Caucasus as a new area of heightened East-West competition.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, which fought a 1994-96 war to suppress a secessionist
movement in Chechnya, began its current offensive in September
after accusing Chechen militants of terrorist bombings in Russia
and of incursions into neighboring Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   As Shevardnadze and his aides arrived in Istanbul last week they
also received some ominous news that appeared to bode ill for the
talks. Russian helicopters had ventured across the border into
Georgia last Wednesday and dropped mines near the town of Shatili
in an apparent effort to seal one of the routes from Georgia into
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has charged that Chechen militants continue to receive
arms shipments across the 50-mile-long Chechen-Russian frontier,
something Georgia has denied. And Georgia has rejected Moscow's
proposal to dispatch Russian troops to the Georgian side of the
border, fearing that it would be drawn into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   As the Istanbul meeting got under way, some Georgians thought
the helicopter episode might have been intended as Moscow's way of
pressuring Georgia to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have refused to comment on the helicopter
incident. However, Vitaly Pavlov, the chief of aviation for the
Russian army, told reporters Tuesday that Russian Mi-8 helicopters
are dropping mines near the Chechen-Georgian border.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dispute and some tense exchanges, Russia and Georgia
worked out an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the new accord, Russia will close two military bases in
Georgia by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Vaziani air base near Tiblisi, which has been a
symbol of Russian influence near the Georgian capital and,
according to the Georgians, a center of some Russian intrigues.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the Gudauta base, which is located in the
seccessionist province of Abkhazia. The Georgians have long accused
Russia of sympathizing with the Muslim rebels there and even
providing them with aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will still be allowed to use their bases in
Akhalkalaki and Batumi. The Georgians fear the economic impact of
closing the Russian base in Akhalkalaki, an ethnic Armenian area,
because it is one of the region's main employers. And Georgians say
that closing the base in Batumi could lead to instability there.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia's ultimate goal is to force the closure of those
Russian bases as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord will also require the Russians to reduce their
weapons in Georgia. The most significant cut is in armored combat
vehicles, which will be slashed to 241 from 481.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians did not get everything they wanted. They had hoped
to get the Russians to accept the principle that their forces
should not exceed those of the Georgia's own modest military, but
eventually dropped that demand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the anxiety about Russia's ambitions in the
Caucasus, the accord was a welcome development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgians basically got what they wanted,'' said U.S.
official.

CONCERNS RAISED OVER ENCRYPTION REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration Tuesday began circulating its
long-awaited plan for easing export controls on encryption
technology, industry representatives and privacy groups said the
proposal fell short of promises made by the White House two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, floated to industry representatives and groups, puts
into writing the plans that Vice President Al Gore announced during
a trip to Silicon Valley in September to ease the administration's
controversial controls on the data scrambling technology.
Encryption is widely used to keep computer data and online
communications like e-mail private.
</P>
<P>
   But while the draft represents a substantial easing of licensing
controls, privacy advocates said it did not go as far as Gore had
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, who heads Americans for Computer Privacy, a
lobbying group that favors lifting all controls on the export of
encryption, said: ``Two months ago we were looking at a clean
lifting of export restrictions. Now we are looking at a complicated
mass of regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gillespie also noted that the proposal was only a draft.
Indeed, administration officials said they would continue seeking
industry input before publishing their final rules in December.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's biggest concerns lay in complicated and ambiguous
language placing restrictions on products sold to governments.
Those reviewing the draft said they were unsure how the
restrictions would affect the ability of U.S. companies to compete
with companies overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposal's defenders was Stewart Baker, a partner with
the Washington law firm of Steptoe &AMP; Johnson and a former National
Security Agency counsel who was part of the committee that advised
the administration on how to change encryption export policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some respects, it's better than promised,'' he said. ``In
fact, there's a part of me that wants to say, `You've been upgraded
from a prop plane to a Concorde, and now you're going to complain
that you didn't get a window seat?'''
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the under secretary of commerce who heads the
Bureau of Export Administration, said the administration both
expected and welcomed the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective was to put forth a good-faith effort that
reflects what was said in September,'' Reinsch said. ``This is a
genuine work in progress, and we intend to take their criticisms to
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has for years fought attempts to eliminate
export controls on encryption, in part because the FBI and the
National Security Agency contend that encryption makes it easier
for terrorists and criminals to conceal their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, strong-encryption products needed a license
to be exported. The new plan lifts license and review requirements
for many mass market products but still requires Commerce
Department reviews in a number of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ipsen, senior government affairs manager for Cisco Systems
Inc., the leading maker of networking equipment, said there was
``clearly more work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concerns about restrictions on telecommunications and
Internet service providers,'' she said. ``We will continue to work
with the administration and Congress to achieve the landmark
encryption reform promised in September, which this overly complex
draft falls short of achieving.''

TEXAS GETS `C' IN MADD RATING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite lowering the legal standard for driving
while intoxicated and passing a stricter seat-belt law this year,
Texas received average marks in a survey released Tuesday by
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   Texas earned a C grade because too many traffic deaths in the
state involved alcohol, MADD director of public policy Bob
Shearouse said. The passage of tougher laws in Texas ``was a major
accomplishment, but we can't let one piece of legislation serve as
a litmus test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 other states and the District of Columbia ranked below
Texas in the survey, which measures everything from the performance
of governors to the quality of state records.
</P>
<P>
   The survey credited the George W. Bush administration for its
role in lowering the state's legal standard for driving while
intoxicated from .10 blood-alcohol level to .08. But MADD gave the
Texas Legislature a C-plus partly because of what the group called
its unfriendliness toward open-container laws. Texans can travel in
a car with open cans of beer, for example, and be legal as long as
no one actually drinks from the container.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the weak laws send the wrong message. ``Common sense
legislation says I shouldn't be able to drive down the road and
drink and drive,'' Shearouse said.
</P>
<P>
   The state was also handed a D for its lack of youth prevention
programs to combat alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all traffic accidents in Texas involve alcohol,
putting only the District of Columbia at a higher rate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 1,792 traffic deaths were alcohol-related, down from
1,991 in 1996 when MADD issued its last survey and Texas also
scored a C.
</P>
<P>
   The nation as a whole earned a grade of C-plus, up slightly from
the C grade awarded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. House of Representatives got a D-minus for
inaction, MADD said. The group criticized lawmakers for failing to
schedule a vote to set a national standard for blood-alcohol levels
at .08 for conviction of drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 15,935 people were killed and nearly 900,000 were
injured in alcohol-related traffic crashes, according to MADD.
</P>
<P>
   The survey drew from National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration statistics, which tracks alcohol-involved traffic
using state data.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA also estimates the number of instances where the
police did not check for the presence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates are used to make up for under-reporting of deaths
that involve alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas implemented more drunken driving laws this year,
officials acknowledge the state has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor realizes that the high number of fatalities
continues to be a problem, and that's why he uses the bully pulpit
to push for tougher legislation,'' Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards
said.

   Look For Stability in a Franchise 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
By PETER SINTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Q: What are some of the better franchise opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   A: That depends a lot on what you mean by ``better,'' starting
with your interests, abilities, the amount of capital you have to
invest and the competitive landscape.
</P>
<P>
   You probably also want a franchise opportunity with a superior
long-term track record. Each year, between 200 and 300 new
companies offer franchises for sale for the first time, according
to the Small Business Administration, but three-quarters of them
are extinct within 12 years. Given that fact, you might want to
consider how stable a franchise is before investing in it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new ranking of ``failure-resistant'' franchises
by Frandata Corp. of Washington, D.C., these are America's top 10
franchises:
</P>
<P>
   Do It Best (hardware), Servicemaster (cleaning), Merle Norman
Cosmetics, AAMCO Transmissions, Interim Services (personnel),
Terminix (pest control), Carvel (ice cream), Snelling (personnel
services), Ziebart (car care) and Property Damage Appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that the ranking is not based on consumer
polls but on longevity (35 or more years in existence), size (260
or more units) and initial investment of $200,000 or less. Food for
thought: There isn't a single food franchise in the lot.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Corporate Gifts
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a small business. With the year-end approaching, I am
considering donating some of the inventory to local charities. What
can I deduct? The fair market value or the cost of the donated
inventory?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: On the eve of Thanksgiving, what could be a more
appropriate question? After all, it is better to give than receive
(especially if there are tax deductions). The answer, however,
isn't that easy to digest.
</P>
<P>
   Word from CPA Carolyn Amster of San Francisco's Burr, Pilger &AMP;
Mayer is that the deduction for a charitable contribution of
inventory by a corporation (other than an S Corporation) is
generally the fair market value of the property less one half the
amount that would be ordinary income if the item had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW24 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  For example, a furniture store donates a chair for which it paid
$150. The chair normally sells for $250 (its fair market value).
The store would be entitled to a charitable deduction equal to $200
(fair market value of $250 less half of the $100 ordinary income
that would be realized if the chair had been sold).
</P>
<P>
   Amster also notes that the deduction may not exceed twice a
corporation's cost basis of the property. Additional limitations
apply to the type of organization earmarked for the donation and
the intended use of the donated property by that organization. Like
most accounting issues, this one can get complicated, so it's
probably best to consult a tax adviser before making a
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column, CPA Fred Daily suggested giving away
outdated inventory as well as obsolete business equipment. Reader
Gretchen Black adds that if the equipment has already been written
off or fully depreciated, the owner has taken a tax deduction and
is not eligible for second one for a charitable donation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; More Export Info
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I mentioned some export resources for small
businesses. Reader David Nagao wrote to say I missed a major one _
the Center for International Trade Development (CITD). This
initiative of the Economic Development Network of the California
Community Colleges is designed to help small businesses become
export ready. It provides one-on-one counseling, assistance in
market research, trade leads, and workshops and seminars. Topics
include preparing documents for letters of credit, understanding
cargo insurance, developing an international business plan and
developing export strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, there are seven CITD offices, and
services are available to all businesses. For further information,
visit their Web site (www.ednet.cc.ca.us). Click Initiatives, then
International Trade Development.

HOLIDAY RETAIL OUTLOOK GOOD FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- This holiday season promises to leave a little
something under the tree for retailers, especially discounters and
online sellers, experts said Tuesday on the eve of the first big
holiday shopping weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy is expected to translate into increased sales
overall, with shoppers spending most of their time _ and money _ at
discount stores, said Richard Giss, a partner in the consumer
business practice group of Deloitte &AMP; Touche. The largest
percentage growth will be among online retailers, which isn't
surprising considering online sales still represent a very small
percentage of overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Deloitte &AMP; Touche survey of consumer shopping plans
reveals that 81 percent of Southern California shoppers plan to
spend the same amount or more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, nearly half of American shoppers
intends to spend the bulk of their holiday budgets at discount
retailers, while 16 percent plan to shop at traditional retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 10 percent plan to shop mostly at
superstores and through catalogs, and 2 percent will do most of
their shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online locations show a dramatic increase from last year, but
to put that into perspective, when you look at them in terms of
total buying, they're still very small,'' said Giss of the online
retail segment, which is expected to generate an estimated $4
billion in sales this holiday season. ``The time is not far off
when they're a significant factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the big names in online retailing are the same names in
traditional retail, Giss said. The goal among retailers is to
complement in-store sales with online sales through targeted
specials and suggestive selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what they're hoping is that people who browse the Web
are making some impulse purchases,'' he said. ``The beauty of the
Web and database marketing is that you can tailor a sale for an
individual customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail market newsletter Barnard's Retail Trend Report predicts
a 5 percent increase in holiday sales over last year. The industry
watcher cites strong home sales, employment and consumer confidence
as factors in its forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Bethers, spokeswoman for the Glendale Galleria, said the
mall has been running 11 percent ahead of last year's sales and
expects to maintain that double-digit increase through year's end.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the size of the increase in part to 14 new stores
that opened this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our retailers are reporting that they're very
optimistic,'' Bethers said.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming millennium celebration also is expected to carry
increased sales through into the traditional slow period in
January, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desire of people to have items to commemorate that is an
extension of the holiday shopping season,'' Bethers said. ``Between
Christmas and New Year's we'll see more business than usual because
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little dread among the mall's stores that online
shopping will take customers away, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galleria's retailers view the Internet more as a partner
than as a competitor, Bethers said. Many of them have their own
sites, as does the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoppers are going online to research the items they want to
buy, but when they're ready to buy they still come to the store
where they can feel it and smell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Cameron, manager of the Camarillo Premium Outlets outlet
mall, said discount stores' popularity has driven the shopping
center's growth in its five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ahead of last year,'' Cameron said. ``We've seen
increases every year. We're very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the outlet stores will open early Friday and have
special discounts for early birds.
</P>
<P>
   Such sales are a traditional strategy employed by outlet
centers, Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is designed to really kick off the shopping season and
get people out in those malls early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history has shown the holiday shopping pattern to have
two peaks: An early frenzy of shopping beginning the Friday after
Thanksgiving and the late rush of last-minute shoppers buying gifts
just before Christmas.

HMOS FACING LAWSUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Lawyers filed suit Tuesday against five of the
nation's largest health maintenance organizations, including
Foundation Health Systems, based in the Woodland Hills section of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, seeking class-action status, were filed in federal
court in Hattiesburg, Miss., plaintiffs attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says the HMOs put profits before patient care and
accuses the companies of violations of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act and the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're acting today to fix the broken promises the HMO industry
has made to the people who entrust their very lives to these
companies,'' said a statement from lead attorney Richard Scruggs.
``We will ensure that MDs _ not MBAs or CPAs _ will determine
patient treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also allege that HMOs impose gag clauses and
conditions that penalize physicians who discuss certain treatment
alternatives with their patients, along with limiting access to
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The class-action lawsuits are designed to level the playing
field for America's patients and doctors,'' Scruggs said. ``HMOs,
as we know them, have woven a wide pattern of pain and tragedy
across the entire country and it's time for it to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs' Mississippi-based firm helped engineer the legal
assault on the tobacco industry and is expected to collect hundreds
of millions of dollars in fees from the $246billion nationwide
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   John Rex, an analyst with Bear Sterns in New York, said the
lawsuits were part of a strategy by Scruggs and other attorneys to
name every HMO in a suit to get them to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue to do our job of providing quality
health insurance coverage at affordable costs,'' said David Olson,
a spokesman with Foundation Health Systems. ``The lawsuits will not
divert us from completing that mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said FHS has not been served with the suit. ``These
lawsuits will not improve patient care and will result in higher
costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   FHS has 6million members in 15 states and is the nation's
fourth-largest publicly traded managed care company. Foundation
Health shares lost 31.25 cents to close at $9.438 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not yet been served with the lawsuit, and, therefore,
have not been able to review the allegations, so it is in
appropriate to speculate on the specifics at this time,'' said Alan
Hoops, president and chief executive officer of PacifiCare Health
Systems, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana-based PacifiCare has 3.7million members in nine states
and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the lawsuits are: Philadelphia-based Cigna, with
6.4million HMO and 2.9million PPO subscribers; Louisville,
Ky.-based Humana, with 6.2million enrollees; and Newark, N.J.-based
Prudential, with 6.6million HMO, PPO and point-of-service plan
members.

 When Opportunity Knocks: Franchiselike businesses lure
world-be  entrepreneurs  By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Glenn Williams started a dental drill repair service in Novato that
is doing so well that he is also making money selling the
opportunity to set up similar businesses in other parts of the
country.
<P>
   Ken Kindt has gone one step further at Signworld. Instead of
creating computer-generated signs, he now spends his workdays
signing up new licensees. There are 122 and one of them is Cynthia
Ramsey, past president of the San Francisco chapter of the National
Association of Women Business Owners.
</P>
<P>
   Business opportunities, also called ``Seller Assisted Marketing
Plans,'' or SAMPs, can be a portal to profits and entrepreneurial
independence. But before signing any documents or forking over any
money, it is essential to do careful research.
</P>
<P>
   The business opportunity arena is full of scams. Instead of
cleaning up, many a buyer has been cleaned out.
</P>
<P>
   A business opportunity is like a franchise but without many of
the costs and protections. Both services offer would-be
entrepreneurs a business model and some training and supplies so
that they do not have to start their enterprise from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But there are major differences. Franchisors provide continuing
support and take from 6 to 10 percent of revenues in royalty
payments. Promoters of business opportunities, on the other hand,
typically charge a one-time fee and offer minimal hand-holding
after an initial training period.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure requirements are dramatically different, too.
Franchisors must provide prospective buyers a Uniform Franchise
Offering Circular that details the business and an annual list of
all franchise owners with their addresses and phone numbers. New
buyers can easily contact current franchisees to assess how they
are doing and ask whether they would do it again.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, business opportunities have no uniform filing
requirements, and they are governed by state attorney general
departments rather than the department of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware,'' advises Gayle Weller, the Seller Assisted Marketing
Plan enforcement officer for the California attorney general's
office. For starters, only deal with business opportunities that
are registered in your state. In California, only about 110 are
registered.
</P>
<P>
   Although registration is a safeguard, it is no guarantee. ``Even
companies that appear to be complying can be leading people down
the garden path,'' Weller said. Special problem areas include
medical billing scams, pyramid sales schemes involving cleaning
materials and bogus vending machine opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Southern California has been besieged by work-at-home
medical billing schemes that have snookered thousands of consumers
out of more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ads suggest that for an investment of $250 to $7,000, buyers can
get software to handle insurance claims and bills for doctors and
make perhaps $30,000 a year serving medical groups who are hungry
for such services.
</P>
<P>
   But Weller said the software is often ``crummy.'' The list of
doctors who supposedly want the service are typically culled from
medical directories and have no interest. Finally, the promise of
refunds after a 90-day product trial is often a sham because fees
paid by credit card cannot be disputed after that length of time.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California has its share of business opportunity
abuses. In February, a criminal trial is set for San Francisco
Superior Court against Edward A. Durante, Walter J. Zink and one
other owner of the defunct X.clusive Vending Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The state charges the trio with violating Seller Assisted
Marketing Plan laws and grand theft for allegedly misrepresenting
X.clusive's business and profit potential and using other tactics
to bilk dozens of buyers out of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has set up a database so states can
share consumer complaints and other information about bogus
business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   To improve your chances of success, experts say it is essential
to do plenty of research and check the background of the promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people it is a wonderful option,'' said Gordon
Dupries, a San Rafael franchise and business opportunity consultant
who also lectures on the subject for the Small Business
Administration. ``But you better know the individual is honest and
do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   When government contract specialist John Malone met his former
Novato neighbor, Glenn Williams, he recalls, ``The only thing I
knew about dental drills was on the receiving end.''
</P>
<P>
   That was several years ago, when Malone's daughter baby sat for
Williams' kids and before Malone relocated to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 30 years, Malone has bought everything from beans
to bullets for the U.S. Navy. But at 56, he was looking for a
transition to retirement _ something that offered him reasonable
pay and flexible hours. This past August, he became the first buyer
of Williams' Handpiece Express dental drill repair service.
</P>
<P>
   For about $28,000, including a $15,000 business opportunity fee
and $7,000 in parts and tools, Malone received two weeks of
training in Novato before he launched his business as a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain at all,'' he said. ``I'm doing 10 to 15
handpieces a week for about $79.95 each and can do it after hours
or during my lunch break.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams began his dental career as a manufacturer's
representative in 1984, when he got out of college. Although some
entrepreneurs blame government regulations for killing businesses,
Williams credits them for helping create his.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration required dentists to
sterilize not just the drill bit but the entire handpiece after
each use. High heat cleaned the equipment but it also baked the
lubricants and bearings inside the drill and caused them to freeze
up every six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   That development greatly expanded the service end of the
business. The dental equipment company Williams worked for at the
time charged $180 to $300 to overhaul each drill and often took
days to get the essential equipment back to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Williams figured he could charge about half as much, use courier
services to return the handpieces within a day and still make a
good living. This year, Williams said he expects revenues of about
$300,000 and hopes to earn more selling Handpiece Express
opportunities in other areas around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen-thousand dollars is a nice lump sum for two weeks of
training (of the buyer),'' said Williams, who compares his role to
Tom Sawyer painting the fence. ``They're fixing my drills and
paying me to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone sees it differently: ``I got to make mistakes at his
expense.'' Malone also appreciates the help that Williams provided
sending out promotional literature and showing him how to make
sales calls on dentists. Handpiece Express also has a toll-free
help number and Williams is willing to tackle hard-to-fix items and
split the fees.
</P>
<P>
   While Williams is making a sidelight out of selling Seller
Assisted Marketing Plans, Ken Kindt has made it his entire
business.
</P>
<P>
   After working in human resources for Ford and Memorex and a
stint as a certified financial planner in the Bay Area, Kindt
wanted to build or buy a business. He also wanted to eventually
return to Hawaii where he had earned an MBA degree.
</P>
<P>
   Kindt investigated the business of producing computer-generated
custom signs before investing about $75,000 in 1988 to create
Signworld in Sunnyvale. He liked the business because it had
regular hours, focused on corporate rather than consumer traffic,
relied on repeat business and produced around 30 percent profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few years, Kindt commuted every two weeks between
his business in Silicon Valley and his new home in Kona, Hawaii.
Then he made selling business opportunities, not signs, his main
business and cut his trips to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A Signworld business opportunity costs close to $100,000,
including about $20,000 in computer and printing equipment and
about $30,000 in working capital. So far, Kindt has found 122
buyers, including one for his original Sunnyvale business.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons he elected to sell business opportunities
instead of franchises is that franchisors have a difficult time
collecting royalties. ``People don't want to pay their bills on
time, and when they're short of cash, they can't,'' he said. To
keep his buyers happy and attract new ones, Signworld offers
customer support, online training and hosts an annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   One satisfied buyer is Cynthia Ramsey and her husband, Carl, who
started Signs America in San Francisco six years ago. Cynthia, a
vice president of Wells Fargo, and Carl, a business consultant,
were both tired of corporate travel when they began checking out
business opportunity newspaper ads and attended a franchise show.
</P>
<P>
   They were searching for something that dealt with computers, had
9-to-5, Monday-through-Friday hours, sold business to business and
had good profit potential. Before settling on Signworld, Ramsey
said she and her husband did ``a lot of due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides talking directly to Kindt, they got the names of
Signworld owners who had been in business for several years and
visited about 10 of them in California, Nevada and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The research paid off. The Ramseys say their business, which
makes signs for offices, restaurants, parks and others, racks up
more than $1 million in sales and profits topping 20 percent.

WALLACE PERSONS, 90, CEO WHO LED GROWTH OF EMERSON ELECTRIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Ohio)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace R. Persons, who in nearly 20 years as chief executive,
expanded Emerson Electric Co. from a small regional appliance maker
into a diversified industrial manufacturer, died Nov. 21 in St.
Louis, the company said. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Persons, who was known as Buck, joined Emerson in 1954 as
president when the company had two plants and annual sales of $50
million. He retired as chief executive in 1973 but stayed on one
more year as chairman. By then, the company had 80 plants and sales
of $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the years Persons was chief executive, Emerson acquired
In-Sink-Erator garbage disposals, White-Rodgers thermostats, Brook
Instruments and Ridge Tools, the maker of the Rigid brand of tools
for plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson now has annual sales of $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Persons graduated from Case Institute in Cleveland in 1923 with
an engineering degree and earned a master's degree in engineering
and management there in 1932. He later became a trustee of the
institute. He joined Lincoln Electric Co., a Cleveland
manufacturer, as a sales trainee in 1932. He was vice president for
sales and marketing and a company director when he was recruited in
1954 to run Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   He was a director of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club, a
member of the Missouri-St. Louis Airport Authority and was a
founder of BYU, a joint jobs program that was created by St. Louis
businesses, the local YMCA and the Urban League of Metropolitan St.
Louis. He received awards from the Urban League in 1969 and 1971 in
recognition of those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Helen Persons, from whom he was
estranged, and his companion, Kimberly Walker; a daughter, Barbara
Wood; two grandchildren, Helen Robin Fisher and Wallace Stanley
Wood; and a sister, Margaret Bennett, all of St. Louis.

 Bids on Virtual Pet Cemetery Start at $1 Million  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Looking for a slightly used online pet cemetery?
<P>
   The San Francisco couple who run the Virtual Pet Cemetery, the
Internet's largest online burial ground for deceased furry friends,
placed the site up for auction Tuesday on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum bid: $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Number of bids received so far: 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're hurt by the fact that we're making a profit,
unlike some other Internet sites,'' said Steve Hoffman, who
oversees the Virtual Pet Cemetery with his wife, Naomi. ``If we
were losing $16 million a quarter, we'd be much more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, he estimates that the pet cemetery pulls down
about $150 a month from listings _ a king's ransom in Internet
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how much Amazon.com is losing,'' he pointed out.
``Look at their valuation. Now look at us. How can we not be worth
a million dollars?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, eBay users have yet to see the business sense of that
observation.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman listed the Virtual Pet Cemetery on the auction site
earlier this month as well. It didn't receive any bids then either.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that no bid under
$1million will be considered. Perhaps it's just that no one wants a
used online pet cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   For Hoffman, who started the Virtual Pet Cemetery about five
years ago, the time just seems right for a sale. His hunch is that
valuations of Internet companies have peaked and are due for a
serious correction.
</P>
<P>
   With the Virtual Pet Cemetery attracting about 1 million hits a
month, Hoffman figured that some major online pet enterprise like
Pets.com or Petopia.com would be keen to snap up the Net's premier
site for dead animals.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, they haven't called.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Menta, a spokeswoman for Pets.com, declined to speculate
on whether her company would bid for the Virtual Pet Cemetery. ``I
have no idea if anyone here even knows about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to decline comment,'' said Petopia spokeswoman
Nadia Abudayyeh.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the Virtual Pet Cemetery was always a labor of love
for himself and his wife. ``The workload has overtaken the love,''
he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Their company, LavaMind, also produces computer games, which
Hoffman said bring in a bit more than $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But what if nobody bids this time around for the Virtual Pet
Cemetery? What will happen to the hundreds of dead pets
memorialized among the site's 26 plots?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absolutely worst-case scenario,'' Hoffman said, ``we
would find someone to take it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he realized the impact this admission might have on bidding
for the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I retract that,'' Hoffman said.

MORTON STAYS MUM THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC tailback Chad Morton declined one last chance
to guarantee another victory, but he is making sure the Trojans
don't overlook 25th-ranked Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm done with that stuff. It was a one-time thing. It worked
out and I'm going to leave it alone,'' Morton said of his
prediction the Trojans would defeat UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But now that he's been proven right, Morton doesn't want USC
(5-6) to waste that victory by losing to the Bulldogs (9-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing that could happen is beating UCLA and losing
the last game,'' Morton said. ``(Losing the Sun Bowl last year)
left a sour taste in our mouth going into the next year. This one
is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety David Gibson said playing in another game would be
easy but didn't look forward to more practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game itself won't be hard. It's the practices,'' Gibson
said. ``Those are tough this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Early win: Last Saturday's game against UCLA actually ended with
time left on the clock because Bruins coach Bob Toledo walked
across the field with under 30 seconds left, enough time for two
plays to be run.
</P>
<P>
   With Toledo already at midfield, the officials decided to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see Toledo with 30 seconds left conceding the
loss,'' Gibson said. ``Everyone was saying `Stay back' on the
sideline, but Toledo was already at midfield. He was beaten and
knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving schedule: Because this week's game falls the day
after Thanksgiving, USC coach Paul Hackett is excusing the team at
11:30 a.m. Thursday, allowing them to check in to the team hotel at
9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl bound? Louisiana Tech may be ranked 25th in the nation, but
it is still fighting for a berth in the Motor City Bowl. Even if
the Bulldogs win, they may have to beat out Pittsburgh for an
at-large bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing that's completely out of my control,''
Louisiana Tech coach Jack Bicknell III said. ``I can't figure it
out anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Another streak: There was a lively incident at halftime of the
USC-UCLA game. A USC water polo player, part of a ceremony honoring
the 1998 national champions, took off his sweatsuit and sprinted
around the field in his swimsuit. He was eventually escorted out of
the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rare finish: This is only the sixth time since 1936 that USC
will finish the regular season playing a team other than UCLA or
Notre Dame. The most recent occasions were in 1978 (Hawaii) and
1985 (Oregon in the Mirage Bowl).
</P>
<P>
   Haden honored: Former USC quarterback Pat Haden was named an
NCAA Silver Anniversary Award recipient Tuesday. The award honors
athletes who have distinguished themselves since completing their
careers 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is USC's sixth recipient, following football players Lynn
Swann, Mike Garrett, John Ferraro, golfer Al Geiberger and tennis
player Stan Smith.

GORE SAYS BRADLEY'S CRITIQUE WAS TOO PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONEY CREEK, Iowa _ Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday accused
Bill Bradley of leveling an improper personal attack in criticizing
his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not specifically address Bradley's remarks Monday that
the vice president was not truly interested in improving the
campaign finance system, but he insisted that he had been an
advocate of reforming the system longer than Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal attacks have no place in a campaign,'' Gore told a
local television reporter when asked about Bradley's comments. ``I
think that campaign finance is an important issue. I'm strongly in
favor of it. I have supported full public financing of campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he had backed a sweeping campaign finance bill
sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold,
D-Wis. ``Unlike Senator Bradley, I was a co-sponsor of it,'' Gore
said, ``and I feel that it's very important to get the influence of
special interest money out of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his presidential campaign did not accept money from
political action committees, Gore said, ``I believe that it's
important to set a standard that's higher than which the law
requires.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was touring the Hitchcock Nature Area here on the
western border of Iowa, was asked why he condemned personal attacks
when in his campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1988 he first
raised the issue of Willie Horton against Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election that year, Vice President George Bush
attacked Dukakis for permitting Horton, a convicted murderer whom
the Bush campaign held up to scorn, to get a furlough on a weekend
pass. Gore first raised the matter during a debate in the
primaries, but he never mentioned Horton specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bring that name up _ I didn't know that name,'' Gore
said Tuesday. ``I think the issue of corrections policy is
legitimate.'' He said he had no regrets for raising the matter,
adding, ``I think the way that George Bush's campaign brought it up
was very different.''

BEAUJOLAIS BEYOND THE NOUVEAU 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Beaujolais nouveau has arrived, but did anyone notice?
</P>
<P>
   Once, genuine excitement surrounded the shipment of the wine in
mid-November, mere weeks after the gamay grapes were picked from
the vine. Though the hoopla is gone, the wine is still here, which
is a good thing. It tastes much better without the hype, a simple
pleasure not far removed from grape juice, to be enjoyed
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an easy entry to the greater world of Beaujolais,
wines that are still relatively simple but with more depth than the
nouveau.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy Beaujolais, you cannot help but run into the name
Georges Duboeuf, the producer and marketer who dominates the field.
Duboeuf's flower label is everywhere, from ordinary Beaujolais to
the more complex Beaujolais-Villages, which comes from vineyards
considered to be of higher quality, to the superior cru Beaujolais,
which is produced in 10 villages and carries the village name on
the bottle. Many shops carry only the flower label Beaujolais,
which has a distinct fruity but insubstantial style.
</P>
<P>
   Much more interesting are wines that Duboeuf produces at other
Beaujolais vineyards. They tend to be more complex and flavorful,
yet light-bodied, and are worth seeking out.
</P>
<P>
   Cru Beaujolais can be even better values than the Villages,
which gives off sweet aromas but often turns watery in the mouth.
The cru Villages include such familiar names as Brouilly, Fleurie,
Moulin-a-Vent, Morgon and Regnie.
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais is almost always best when young and fresh, no more
than a couple of years from its vintage, though some people say the
cru Beaujolais can be aged. I say, why bother?
</P>
<P>

JURY AWARDS $79 MILLION IN SUIT OVER INJURY TO CHILD'S BRAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan jury has awarded $79 million to a family
whose son was left with severe brain damage nine years ago after a
procedure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. The judgment was one
of the largest ever against a New York City hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The case centered on the care and monitoring of Samuel
Desiderio, a 13-year-old boy who was treated at the hospital, then
known as New York Hospital, when he was 4 years old. Samuel was
born with a condition that caused fluid to accumulate in the brain.
He lived with a permanent shunt that drained the fluid.
</P>
<P>
   While he lived a normal toddler's life, the suit contended, the
shunt posed a medical problem when it malfunctioned a month before
his fourth birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel was taken to the hospital, according to court documents,
where the shunt was replaced. However, the boy quickly showed signs
that the new shunt was not functioning properly: a nurse noted that
one pupil was more dilated than the other and that he was vomiting
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, the hospital did not properly monitor
the boy's condition and failed to respond promptly to his signs of
distress. By the time doctors did perform a procedure to relieve
the pressure on the child's brain, permanent damage had been
caused, said the family's lawyer, Thomas A. Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were textbook signs that the shunt was failing,'' Moore
said, ``and they did nothing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who performed the surgery and inserted the original
shunt, Dr. Robert Snow, was also found negligent, but the jury
found that his negligence was not directly responsible for the
outcome of the case and no damages were claimed from him.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital spokeswoman issued a statement Tuesday that was
unusual in its detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital acknowledged at trial that one aspect of the care
provided to Samuel Desiderio in 1990 did not meet our standards,
and that we have a responsibility to share in the costs associated
with meeting Samuel's needs,'' the hospital said. ``Sharing these
costs is appropriate, as Samuel does have disabilities as a result
of his hospitalization beyond the severe disabilities that he has
had since birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our belief that the verdict is in excess of what is fair
and reasonable compensation in this case. We will, therefore, ask
the courts for an appropriate reduction of the award, to an amount
which will fulfill our obligation to Samuel.''
</P>
<P>
   Videotape that showed the child before his surgery demonstrated,
Moore said, that Samuel was ``vibrant, a beautiful child.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, lasted three
weeks, and the jury took two days to deliberate before reaching its
judgment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's parents are Vincent Desiderio, an artist, and Gale
Desiderio, a psychiatrist who trained at Cornell Medical Center,
which is affiliated with New York-Presbyterian. They live in Sleepy
Hollow, N.Y., and have two other children.

 FLAVIO DA COSTA, 93, BRAZIL'S SOCCER COACH IN 1950s  
 (bl)  
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flavio Rodriguez da Costa, the Brazilian soccer coach whose
23-year professional career was overshadowed by his national team's
loss to underdog Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final, died Nov. 22
at a hospital in Rio de Janiero. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa, a native of Rio, began his soccer career in 1924 as a
player for a Rio team, Helenico. One year later, he signed with
Flamenco, one of the Brazil's greatest teams, playing with that
squad until 1934, when he became its coach. In 1942, Da Costa
coached Flamenco to the first of three consecutive state
championships. He went on to coach Vasco da Gama, winning state
titles in 1945, 1947, 1949 and 1950 and the Southern American club
championship in Chile in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all his success, Da Costa endured a singular moment of
failure: Brazil's 2-1 loss to Uruguay on July 16, 1950, in the
World Cup final at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janiero. A crowd of
200,000 packed the stadium to watch a heavily favored Brazilian
team. Brazil had 1-0 lead at the end of the first half, but Uruguay
rallied for the victory, the final goal coming with only one minute
left to play. The Brazilian national publication O Globo called the
loss ``a major trauma of the sports history of Brazil.'' Da Costa,
who was blamed for the defeat, often told friends and professional
colleagues that he spent the rest of his life having to explain
that failure.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1976 interview with the Brazilian sports magazine Placar,
Da Costa, who was working as a supervisory coach of a regional
soccer team in Rio, talked about the infamous World Cup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Maracana shaken, but walking firmly, step by step,'' Da
Costa said. ``Without wavering, deaf to the generalized insults
because no one had the courage to curse me personally. I sat down
in my car, went home, hugged and kissed Florita, my companion, my
wife, a saint. I didn't want to have dinner, I drank some whiskey.
Before one hour passed two friends arrived, we spoke about the game
for an hour and a half, then changed the subject. The World Cup was
finished and lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Da Costa returned to coach the national team from 1955 to 1957,
leaving the year before Brazil won the first of its four World Cup
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1944 and 1957, teams coached by Da Costa won 42 games,
tied 13 and lost 12.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Elaina de Almeida Macalhaes and a
grandson. &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON TO LEAVE WHITE HOUSE AND SETTLE IN CHAPPAQUA HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MRSCLINTON-SENATE)  
(DW) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a matter of weeks, Bill and Hillary Clinton will
become the ultimate commuter couple.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton declared Tuesday that she was all but abandoning
her day job as first lady and preparing to move into the family's
new home in Chappaqua, a New York suburb. Mrs. Clinton, who left
little doubt Tuesday that she was running for the Senate, said she
would make New York her primary residence and would vote and pay
taxes there.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband plans to remain a resident of the White House until
he turns over the keys to his successor as president on Jan. 20,
2001, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation presents a historical oddity: the last time a
president lived in the White House without a wife was more than 80
years ago. Woodrow Wilson married Edith Bolling Galt, his second
wife, in 1915, during his first term.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she was waiting for permission from the Secret
Service to move into the $1.7 million home in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I will still be in Washington from time to time; I
have to be,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference in New York
City on Tuesday afternoon. ``There are many things that I will
still have to attend to, but I'll be living in Westchester and I'll
be traveling around the state and campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's declaration gave rise to questions about the
state of the Clintons' marriage, a subject of public speculation
for as long as they have been in public life.
</P>
<P>
   But friends and aides forcefully denied that Mrs. Clinton's
relocation meant that the marriage was somehow in peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, nope, nope, nope,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made it clear _ both of them have _ ever since they
bought this house that they intended it to be their home,'' Ms.
Berry said. ``She does not intend to exclude him; it just means
that she's going to be spending a lot more time up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, a former senior White House official and Clinton
campaign aide, said that Mrs. Clinton's comments Tuesday were
simply a realistic acknowledgment that she has to live in New York
if she wants to run for the Senate there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience of the first lady is that she means what she
says,'' Begala said. ``If she meant to say `I'm dumping him,' she'd
say `I'm dumping him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was aboard Air Force One returning from a 10-day trip to
Europe when Mrs. Clinton made her remarks. A spokesman who
accompanied the president said that Mrs. Clinton had always
intended to use the Chappaqua home as her living quarters while she
campaigned for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not surprised by this,'' said the aide, Barry
Toiv. ``This is nothing new to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that after leaving the White House he expects
to split his time between Little Rock, the site of his presidential
library, and Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   Close friends said that despite rough patches in the marriage,
the Clintons are committed to each other personally and
professionally. Clinton has said he will do whatever he can to
support Mrs. Clinton's political ambitions after the almost 30
years she has dedicated to advancing his.

NEW YORK'S TEACHING HOSPITALS FACE SHARP MEDICARE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teaching hospitals in New York said Tuesday that
they would lose tens of millions of dollars in federal Medicare
money under a budget bill that was passed by Congress last week and
is soon to be signed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers
around the country supported the legislation, because it restores
some of the money cut from Medicare in 1997. But for more than a
dozen teaching hospitals in New York, which depend heavily on
federal aid, the gains would be more than offset by the loss of
money they receive for training doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, part of an omnibus appropriations bill, would
reduce huge disparities in what Medicare pays to train doctors in
different parts of the country. The average Medicare payment for
each trainee is more than four times as much at some New York
hospitals as in other big cities. Payments to those high-paid
hospitals would be frozen for two years. Then, in each of the next
three years, the government would provide them with less than the
normal adjustment for inflation given to all other teaching
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Calculations by the Greater New York Hospital Association show
that Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx would lose $10 million
from 2000 to 2005, while Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan
would lose $8.3 million and Episcopal Health Services, with
hospitals in Queens and Suffolk County, would lose $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Over the six-year period, the association estimates, Harlem
Hospital Center and Nassau County Medical Center would each lose
$3.6 million, North Shore University Hospital would lose $2.8
million and Long Island Jewish Medical Center would lose $2.7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major New York teaching hospitals have hundreds of
millions of dollars in annual revenue, but most are poised uneasily
between profit and loss, and some have experienced operating losses
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore, for example, says it has more than $1 billion in
revenue this year, including $85 million in Medicare payments for
graduate medical education. But overall, the hospital will have an
operating loss of $1 million to $5 million this year, said Dr.
Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill had broad support in Congress, and President
Clinton has said he plans to sign it next week. The House Ways and
Means Committee said the bill would create ``a more rational and
equitable'' method of paying for graduate medical education.
</P>
<P>
   New York's congressional delegation, led by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Rep. Charles Rangel, both Democrats, has historically
protected the state's teaching hospitals, which train more than 15
percent of the nation's doctors. New York lawmakers headed off even
deeper cuts this year. But they could not halt the momentum to make
fundamental changes in the reimbursement for teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The winners include hospitals in Texas and California, two
states with powerful House members who have a large say on Medicare
policy. Academic medical centers in Texas, California and other Sun
Belt states have risen in stature, even as lawmakers from those
states gained influence in Congress in recent years.

<P>
   New York hospitals can take consolation in two facts. First,
earlier versions of the Medicare legislation would have taken much
more money from them. Second, most of the cuts take effect after
Oct. 1, 2000. New York hospitals and politicians can try to
persuade Congress to moderate the cuts before then. If Democrats
win control of the House in next year's elections, Rangel will be
in line to head the Ways and Means Committee.

EDITORIAL: THE BETRAYING HANDSHAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley used a vivid metaphor to describe
Washington's continual failure to free American elections from the
influence of special-interest money. Speaking in New Hampshire on
Monday, he recalled the moment in 1995 when President Clinton and
Newt Gingrich, then speaker of the House, shook hands in public on
a promise to pass campaign finance legislation. Nothing happened,
Bradley said, because Democrats, Republicans and their big
contributors had long ago made a ``secret handshake'' on ``a deal
between politicians and business to keep things as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is right. The public has been continually sold out on
this issue. In 1993, for example, Clinton allowed Gingrich's
Democratic predecessor, Thomas Foley, to talk him into delaying his
inaugural pledge to pass campaign finance legislation. After that
default, Clinton went on to conduct in 1996 the most financially
reckless campaign since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   But the day when presidents and presidential candidates could
get away with sleazy fund-raising may be passing. Sen. John McCain
has made a ban on soft money the center pole of his campaign and
has been the candidate most prominently identified with the reform
issue. But Bradley has also made campaign finance reform one of his
four main themes. Both are using the issue to compete for
independent swing voters in New Hampshire, and that may have had
something to do with Bradley's desire for a higher profile on the
issue. Vice President Al Gore, worried about his history with the
Clinton money machine, is emphasizing his support for the public
financing of federal elections. So far Texas Gov. George W. Bush
has remained an old-fashioned harvester of special-interest money
and believes that individuals should be free to make unlimited
soft-money contributions to the parties.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be a shortsighted strategy. Bradley and McCain
have agreed that if they meet in a general election, both will
forswear using soft money _ corporate, union or individual
contributions channeled through the party organizations to pay for
thinly disguised campaign ads. Gore says he will do the same,
provided his Republican opponent takes the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   So far no presidential candidate has promised that, if
nominated, he would not allow his national party committee to
harvest soft money regardless of what his opponent does. The
conventional wisdom is that this would amount to unilateral
disarmament in the general-election spending wars over television
and turnout. But Bradley says he thinks that the approximately $80
million allowed a nominee in reported contributions and matching
funds may be adequate for running a general-election campaign
without the soft-money subterfuge. ``I've kept that as an option,''
he said of a unilateral pledge. He added that if nominated, he
would first need to ``figure out the lay of the land. But I haven't
foreclosed that possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In only four years, then, we have gone from two nominees,
Clinton and former Sen. Bob Dole, who planned their fall campaigns
around soft money from corporations and unions to several major
candidates vying to illustrate their independence of the special
interests who hide behind the ``secret handshake.'' In Washington,
Congress continues to believe that voters do not mind having a
financially compromised political system. But in Iowa and New
Hampshire, the voters are applauding each new escalation of pledges
in the competition over campaign finance reform.

ANGELS PICK NEW COACHING STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Angels on Tuesday announced manager Mike
Scioscia's coaching staff for the 2000 season, and only one bench
coach Joe Maddon will return from last year's squad.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Carew, a seven-time batting champion and Hall of Famer, was
replaced after eight seasons as the hitting coach by Mickey
Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   The other coaches named to the staff are pitching coach Bud
Black, first base coach Alfredo Griffin and third base coach Ron
Roenicke.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have yet to name a bullpen coach to replace Joe
Coleman. Besides Carew and Coleman, the other Angels coaches who
were not retained were third base coach Larry Bowa, first base
coach George Hendrick and pitching coach Dick Pole. Bowa and Pole
had already hooked up with other teams, Bowa with the Mariners and
Pole with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Black and Maddon, Scioscia's coaching
staff is made up of former Dodgers. Black, a major league pitcher
for 15 seasons, was a special assistant to the general manager with
the Indians last season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin spent last season as a roving minor league instructor
for the Blue Jays; Hatcher was Scioscia's hitting coach at triple-A
Albuquerque last season: and Roenicke, a graduate of Edgewood High
in West Covina, was the Giants' triple-A manager in Fresno in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Maddon has been with the Angels organization for 25 seasons,
including the past six on the major league staff. He served as the
club's interim manager last season after Terry Collins resigned,
guiding the club to a 19-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike drew up a list and I drew up a list and we started
determining which people we really wanted,'' Angels general manager
Bill Stoneman said. ``Now we can focus more on having conversations
regarding players.''
</P>
<P>
   One conversation Stoneman apparently won't have soon is with
pitcher Chuck Finley, who is currently vacationing in Hawaii. Asked
if there was an understanding between the Angels and Finley that
there would be discussions upon Finley's return, Stoneman said:
``There's no understanding at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman hasn't talked with Finley's agent, Tim Shannon, since
last Wednesday. And at the news conference last week Stoneman said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Chuck I still want to meet face to face. I have to
determine what Chuck Finley really wants. Does he want to go to a
club that's been a proven contender in recent years so he can get
that ring he doesn't have? Or is it important for him to be an
Angel the rest of his career and form part of the winning here?''

DEFINITION OF ABORTION FOUND TO VARY ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The recipient of the largest amount of American
birth control aid is Bangladesh, a Muslim country that languishes
among the world's sickest, poorest and most populous. Despite a
decision by Congress last week to limit federal spending on groups
that promote abortion rights abroad, the way the United States'
contribution is spent in Bangladesh depends much more on local laws
and practices than on anything done half a world away on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Bangladesh prohibits abortion except to save a
mother's life. But the government of Bangladesh, an emphatic
proponent of birth control, and the nongovernment Family Planning
Association of Bangladesh, an affiliate of International Planned
Parenthood Federation in London, do condone a practice that amounts
to the same thing in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In the procedure, which the government and the federation call
``menstrual regulation,'' a woman who complains of having missed a
period, rather than being given a pregnancy test, can be treated by
a health care worker who suctions away the lining of the uterine
wall, including any fertilized egg.
</P>
<P>
   The government defines this as ``an interim method of
establishing nonpregnancy,'' according to a study by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a women's research organization in New York.
It does not consider the procedure an abortion, because the woman
does not take a pregnancy test and therefore is never officially
deemed to be pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In the legislation Congress wrote to restore American financing
of the United Nations, Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., won
inclusion of a clause restricting the U.S. Agency for International
Development from using its money _ $385 million for a fourth
consecutive year, down from $547 million in 1995 _ to perform or
promote abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was negotiated with the White House, however, the
provision left family planning groups with many ways around the
restrictions. It prohibits agency financing for organizations that
perform or promote abortions, whether with U.S. money or with their
own. But it applies only to foreign, nongovernment organizations.
Foreign governments and American organizations that operate abroad
can still get the aid.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where abortions are already illegal, like
Bangladesh, if the organizations continue to promote contraception
but agree not to lobby for looser regulation of abortion, they are
operating within the boundaries established by Congress and can
continue to receive money.
</P>
<P>
   And the definition of terms is left to the Agency for
International Development and the foreign governments. So what
Bangladesh calls ``menstrual regulation'' is not considered
abortion under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Joseph Rees, chief counsel of the House subcommittee that
wrote the provision, said it also leaves the Clinton administration
free to define abortion. The administration can decide whether it
applies to aspiration, or suctioning of the uterine lining, for
example, or heavy doses of mifepristone, the pill a woman takes
soon after she suspects she might have become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an abortion,'' Rees said, ``some agency has to say
it is an abortion.'' In the case of vaginal aspiration or heavy
doses of mifepristone, he said, ``AID ought to say it is. Smith
would regard that as abortion.'' If the agency agrees, the
organization would have to stop the practice or lose its subsidy.
Officials at the agency declined repeated requests for comment for
this article.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also provides that if the president waives the
restriction, a penalty amount of $12.5 million will be deducted
from the $385 million allotted to the agency and will be diverted
to children's health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction has a long history. In 1973, Congress prohibited
subsidies to foreign nongovernment organizations that used them for
abortion, and that law remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, President Reagan signed an executive order prohibiting
the organizations that received American financing from using other
money _ their own or foundations' or other countries' contributions
_ to promote abortion. President Clinton revoked the Reagan order
upon taking office in 1993, and Smith's provision put the terms of
the Reagan order into law.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Americans argued about the provision, international family
planning groups have worked to decrease their dependence on
American financing. At the same time, they say, their efforts are
helping reduce birth rates in many nations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains the world's largest source of nearly
$2 billion a year that the United Nations estimates that industrial
countries spend to subsidize family planning in developing
countries. But the Netherlands, once a relatively small
contributor, is now the second largest, followed by Germany,
Britain and Japan. Private American donors, including the Ford,
Rockefeller, MacArthur, Packard, Mellon and Gates foundations, have
been stepping in, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development reports that in the
developing countries that receive its $385 million family planning
support, the fertility rate, or the average number of babies born
to a woman, dropped from 4.4 in 1985 to 3.3 in 1997. In populous
Indonesia, the rate had fallen by half, from 5.6 in 1971 to 2.6 two
years ago. Bangladesh has achieved a major objective of its
national population policy in cutting its rate from an average of
six babies per woman to three.
</P>
<P>
   With the world population now at 6 billion and climbing by 70 to
80 million a year, nations are still far short of achieving the
fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman that demographers say
would stabilize the population and relieve pressure on world
resources. Most women in sub-Saharan Africa have six or more
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still large numbers of unwanted children,'' said
John Bomgaarts, vice president of the Population Council in New
York. ``Forty-five percent of pregnancies worldwide are unintended
_ mistakes or unwanted.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the abortion opponents' No. 1 target has
been the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London.
With affiliated family planning services in 140 countries, the
federation dwarfs all other foreign nongovernment groups in
promoting birth control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pramilla Senanayake, assistant director-general of the Planned
Parenthood organization in London, said the London office's budget
last year was $90.6 million. With that and at least $400 million
that the affiliates collect independently, about three-quarters
from their own local sources, the federation says its affiliates
distributed 250,000 condoms a day in 1997 and 600,000 oral
contraceptive pills a day. It says the affiliates saw 100,000
clients a day for sexual and reproductive health services,
including abortions. As required by law, Dr. Senanayake said the
federation uses none of its AID money _ $9.2 million last year, or
10 percent of its budget _ to perform or promote abortion. Rather
than let the United States derail its work, the federation may have
to refuse future financing, as it did after Reagan's order was
issued and until Clinton revoked it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Senanayake said the federation is likely to carry on. The
government of Japan has now displaced the United States as the
biggest contributor. But there could still be a cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the U.S. government is doing,'' she said, ``is increasing
inadvertently the number of unsafe abortions. These women will be
pushed to go and have back-street abortions.''

 INJURIES ON OFFENSE AND A TALENT GAP
UNDERCUT TEXAS A&AMP;MUS SEASON (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) By WHIT CANNING c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
 P COLLEGE STATION, Texas Q As the season has progressed, redshirt
freshman
Brian Gamble has done a commendable job filling the
inside-linebacker spot vacated by Texas A&AMP;MUs 1998 Lombardi Trophy
winner, Dat Nguyen.  P Unfortunately, he is also a whiz at math.
 P RSince the seventh grade,S he said, RI played in a total of five
losing
football games before coming here. When we lost to Texas Tech this
year, that made six. And in those six games, the total margin of
defeat wasnUt as much as what happened to us in one day [51-6] at
Oklahoma.S  P But in the continuing saga of A&AMP;MUs rather wobbly
season, that one proved
to be hardly unique. It happened again two weeks later Q a 37-0
blowout at Nebraska in which the AggiesU once-renowned ground game
picked up a total of 2 yards.  P For that reason, much of the
abundant criticism of a disappointing 7-3
season heading into the season-ending clash with Texas on Friday
has focused on the offense and coordinator Steve Kragthorpe.
Warning flags went up early, when the A&AMP;M offense went consecutive
games without scoring a touchdown, and continued waving as the
erratic Aggies scored 62 and 45 against the likes of Tulsa and
Baylor, but fell flat against tougher defenses.  P Backed by coach
R.C. Slocum, however, Kragthorpe has a plausible
explanation: Injuries have removed two interior linemen, the two
starting running backs and three tight ends.  P Opening against
Louisiana Tech, the Aggies felt good about the running game
with DUAndre RTikiS Hardeman and Dante Hall in the backfield. It
was the last time they played together. Both were sporadically
absent with injuries, and Hall has since been dismissed from the
team. Their combined rushing total sits at 334 yards.  P RWe opened
up the passing game this year, but it was not our intention to
abandon the run,S Kragthorpe said. RWe simply didnUt have the
people out there to pound the defense. To be a top team, you have
to have balance, and we havenUt had it. But some of whatUs happened
is just the nature of life these days. Look at Notre Dame, Ohio
State, UCLA.S  P Coming off a Big 12 championship year with a large
number of returning
veterans, the Aggies reached a No. 5 national ranking before the
loss to Tech, but Slocum says he believes they were overrated.
 P RWe were rated that way in the media, and I think they looked at
what we
had coming back and not what we lost,S Slocum said. ROf the players
we had last year, seven are now on NFL rosters.  P RSure, weUre
disappointed. But I think Steve has done a great job. He
called all the right plays, we just didnUt have the personnel to
execute them. Every good team should be going out there anxious to
run the ball, and the most frustrating thing has been that we
couldnUt zero in on that. But the only thing I can think of we
could have done differently would be to stand in front of the guys
we had hurt and say, TGet well!U  P RThe bottom line is, weUre just
not a great football team.S
 P A hard truth, but one the Aggies have accepted.
 P RThe worst thing about it was the way we just got shellacked in
a couple of
those games,S Gamble said. RIt was just so embarrassing. I hate to
admit this, but that OU game was one of those deals where you
finally just keep looking up at the scoreboard saying, TIs this
game ever going to end?U  P RAgainst Nebraska, it was just a matter
of playing a team that was a whole
lot better. But sometimes it helps you when you get put in your
place, and thatUs what happened to us; we got put in our place.S
 P Guard Chris Valletta, part of an ever-shifting cast in the
offensive line,
said, RWeUve just had a lot of problems. If you could put your
finger on one thing as the cause, it would be easy to fix, but that
isnUt the case.S  P Receiver Chris Taylor said, RThe OU game was a
shock. They rocked us back
on our heels, and we never recovered. We didnUt play A&AMP;M football,
and itUs hard to look at where we are now compared to what our
goals were at the start of the season.  P RBut maybe we finally got
it together against Missouri, and weUre still 7-3
and looking at a bowl. Now, we have to beat Texas and get a better
bowl.S  P The Aggies are trying to get focused during an emotional
week after the
bonfire-stack tragedy in which 12 students died last week.
 P RWeUve asked them to take the time they have in meetings and on
the field
and use that as a chance to focus on something else,S Slocum said.
RI think our guys have done a good job handling it.S  P The Aggies
believe their past two victories, 21-3 against Oklahoma State
and 51-14 against Missouri, indicate a turnaround. Sandwiched in
between, the loss to Nebraska Q removing the last hope of winning
some piece of the South Division title Q is regarded as a simple
matter of tangling with an overpowering force.  P Hardeman returned
for the Missouri game, teaming with JaUMar Toombs to give
the Aggies a 507-pound backfield tandem capable of pounding a
defense. Freshman Joe Weber contributed a 77-yard touchdown and
finished with 121 yards, the first time an A&AMP;M runner has topped
100 in a game this season.  P RWhat happened to us this year?S
Toombs said. RI donUt know.
 P RI just know we somehow lost the ability of being the enforcer
in a game.
Other teams gave us their TAU game, and sometimes it seemed that we
just didnUt match their intensity. But now weUve got a big rival
coming in here, with a top-10 national ranking.  P RWith a win in a
game like that, you can save your season.S

Sandwiched in between, the loss to Nebraska _ removing the last
hope of winning some piece of the South Division title _ is
regarded as a simple matter of tangling with an overpowering force.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman returned for the Missouri game, teaming with Ja'Mar
Toombs to give the Aggies a 507-pound backfield tandem capable of
pounding a defense. Freshman Joe Weber contributed a 77-yard
touchdown and finished with 121 yards, the first time an A&AMP;M runner
has topped 100 in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us this year?'' Toombs said. ``I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know we somehow lost the ability of being the enforcer
in a game. Other teams gave us their `A' game, and sometimes it
seemed that we just didn't match their intensity. But now we've got
a big rival coming in here, with a top-10 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a win in a game like that, you can save your season.''

HEAD TO HEAD IN MEXICO: DEA AGENTS AND SUSPECTS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By   TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two American drug-enforcement agents who had been driving around
a Mexican border city with an informer were chased, surrounded and
nearly killed two weeks ago by a posse of suspected drug
traffickers and their heavily armed bodyguards, U.S. and Mexican
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a standoff that lasted for nearly 20 minutes on a busy
street in downtown Matamoros, just across the Texas border from
Brownsville, the agents finally talked their way to safety by
identifying themselves and warning the traffickers that they would
never be allowed to get away with murdering American agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very, very close,'' said a U.S. official with
detailed knowledge of the incident, on Nov. 9. ``It was as close as
you can get without a funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the traffickers' bodyguards, who trained AK-47
rifles and other weapons on the Americans throughout the standoff,
were wearing jackets that identified them as members of the
Tamaulipas state police, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Drug Enforcement Administration said Mexican
state police officers appeared to have been in the group.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Mexican official said that had not been corroborated.
The official, Mariano Herran Salvatti, director of the Mexican drug
enforcement agency said, in a telephone interview from Mexico City
that Mexican officials had responded immediately to the incident.
``This investigation is being carried out with all the intensity
that a situation like this requires,'' Herran said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials described the case as probably the most serious
threat against American antidrug agents in Mexico since one agent,
Enrique S. Camarena, was tortured to death by traffickers in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments agreed last year on new rules to bar agents
from conducting any undercover operations without explicit Mexican
permission and supervision. But the governments have failed to
resolve how the agents should protect themselves. American agents
are not supposed to carry guns or conduct law-enforcement
operations in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although one official said the agents in Matamoros, one from the
FBI and one from the DEA, were apparently carrying guns in their
car, they did not draw their weapons. Other U.S. officials refused
to comment on whether the agents were armed.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were stationed in Monterrey in northern Mexico as
part of a program that both countries consider crucial to the
success of their efforts to combat the biggest drug-trafficking
gangs in Mexico.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Matamoros, the two agents were investigating Osiel Cardenas
Guillen, believed by American drug-intelligence officials to have
emerged as the biggest trafficker along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2:30 in the afternoon of Nov. 9, the agents were
driving around a residential area with the informer, checking
places said to be frequented by Cardenas and his associates, when
they noticed another vehicle apparently following them. Soon, the
officials said, the American agents detected a second vehicle and,
then, a third. The agents sped up and made a turn, but were quickly
surrounded by pickups and other vehicles with groups of heavily
armed men.
</P>
<P>
   As the agents frantically dialed a state police commander from a
cellular telephone, the officials recounted, one truck blocked the
agents' sedan and forced them to halt. From a caravan of eight
vehicles, officials said, 12 to 15 men jumped out exhibiting their
guns and demanding that the men leave their car, which had consular
license plates. The agents refused, flashing identification and
rolling down their windows a crack to identify themselves as
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the group, whom one agent recognized as
Cardenas, recognized the informer and had the head of his security
detail, a man with a gold-plated AK-47, demand that the agents turn
over the informer. When the agents again refused, officials said,
the gunmen took a step back, trained their rifles on the car and
appeared about to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting at the gunmen to wait, the agents then reportedly
conceded that they were American law-enforcement officials and
pleaded, telling the gunmen that it would be a grave mistake to
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an official said, the man identified as Cardenas waved
off the men, reportedly telling the agents: ``You gringos. This is
my territory. You can't control it. So get the hell out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   The two agents and the informer drove straight to the border and
have not returned to Mexico, officials said. They telephoned
immediately to American officials, and word of the incident was
immediately communicated to high-level officials of both countries,
who were coincidentally meeting that afternoon in Washington.

NATIONAL FINALS RODEO HAS COME A LONG WAY FROM FIRST VENUE IN
DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After reporting on a football game earlier this month at the
Cotton Bowl, I walked by Fair Park Coliseum, and it was hard to
believe that the quiet venue staged the first National Finals Rodeo
40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fair Park Coliseum isn't close to landing a big-time
rodeo. Today, the two biggest shows in the Metroplex are the
Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in January and February
and the Tuff Hedeman Championship Challenge in March. Both shows
are in Fort Worth. The only famous rodeo show in Dallas County is
the weekly Mesquite Championship Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked across the Dallas fairgrounds, there was the
coliseum, painted in tranquil light-green. It was a stark contrast
to the bright red Thomas &AMP; Mack Center that now stages the bustling
National Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The NFR, the championships for the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association, will celebrate its 41st event next month in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.42 million championship rodeo begins Dec. 3 and, after 10
nightly performances, closes on the afternoon of Dec. 12. Only the
top 15 contestants in each event of the PRCA and the Women's
Professional Rodeo Association barrel racing qualify for the NFR.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants accumulate points throughout the year at more than
700 PRCA-sanctioned rodeos in the United States and Canada. The
1999 season ended Nov. 7 the final performance of] with the Grand
National Rodeo in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of competition in Las Vegas, the contestants in
each event with the highest earnings _ including money earned
during the season and at the Finals _ are the world champions.
</P>
<P>
   The NFR showcases the industry's top stock contractors, who put
their prize livestock head to head with the top 15 bareback-riding,
saddle-bronc riding and bull-riding competitors. Each year the pens
of livestock at the NFR are chosen by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The NFR purse has grown from $50,000 in 1959 to $4.42 million in
1999, with 1998 attendance reaching a record 174,602. Also, ESPN
and ESPN2 are scheduled to air all 10 rounds, reaching an estimated
9 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1959, the NFR has been staged in four
cities. The National Finals was in Dallas from 1959-61. After that,
the Finals moved to the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 the NFR moved to the Jim Norick Arena in Oklahoma City.
The NFR remained in Oklahoma City for 20 years, at Norick from 1965
through 1978 and the Myriad Arena from 1979 through 1984. The NFR
moved to the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas in 1985. An
agreement signed last year will keep the NFR in Las Vegas through
2007. Quick hits Touring pros The Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association is expected to conduct a ``winter tour'' that will
feature high-profile athletes competing in at least eight rodeos,
according to the ``PRCA Business Journal,'' the association's new
publication that features schedules and rules and is mailed to PRCA
members.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials have declined to formally announce the
tour to the media in recent weeks, stating that they are working on
specifics with sponsors and rodeo committees. A news conference
announcing the specifics is scheduled Dec. 3 at the National Finals
Rodeo in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Nov. 24 ``PRCA Business Journal,'' the winter
tour will consist of eight rodeos, beginning with the National
Western Stock Show Rodeo in Denver. The short go-round (final)
qualifiers at each rodeo will be tour members and will earn points
that will apply to tour standings. The tour is scheduled to
conclude with a three-performance show tentatively scheduled in
June. The finals site is undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also is scheduled to be televised on The Nashville
Network. Ten 90-minute telecasts are scheduled from January through
June. Prize roping horses Playboy's Survivor, ridden by Robbie
Schroeder of Gainesville and owned by David and Stacie McDavid of
Fort Worth, won the junior dally team roping-heading title with a
score of 223 at the American Junior Quarter Horse Association World
Championship Show last weekend in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   In the junior dally team roping-heeling class, Minnie Commander,
ridden by former National Finals Rodeo qualifier J.D. Yates of
Pueblo, Colo., and owned by Robin Fowler of Weatherford, finished
first with a 222.5. Rising son McKinnon Wimberly, son of the
five-time NFR qualifier Joe Wimberly of Cool, won the steer-riding
title at the Professional Youth Bull Riders World Championships
last weekend at Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth. The three-day show
featured 162 contestants from six states. Fan favorite Bareback
rider Denny McLanahan of Canadian has been voted professional rodeo
fans' favorite cowboy for the first time. The Coors beer company
annually holds the contest to recognize PRCA cowboys who have wowed
rodeo fans. McLanahan is scheduled to compete in his eighth NFR in
December. Spotlight
Ron J. Jenkins Bill Freeman, shown riding Autumn Boon DNA in 1998,
is scheduled to compete in the NCHA World Championship Futurity
that starts Friday in Fort Worth.
Freeman rides to win Futurity every year Bill Freeman of Rosston
believes that the NCHA World Championship Futurity is not for the
faint of] heart.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the three-time Futurity champion is showing two
horses whose father and grandfather were strong competitors at the
National Cutting Horse Association-sanctioned show, which is
scheduled Friday through Dec. 12 at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is scheduled to compete on a filly named Purdy
Aristocrat and a stallion named Little Aristocrat. Both horses were
sired by Smart Aristocrat, a former winner of the Augusta (Ga.)
Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Aristocrat's sire was Smart Little Lena, a stud who won
the 1982 Futurity. Smart Little Lena is one of two horses who have
won the Triple Challenge, a series that consists of the Futurity,
the April Super Stakes and July Summer Spectacular, all staged in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said both Smart Little Lena and Smart Aristocrat were
thin-framed horses who didn't appear to have the athletic ability
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like Doug Flutie starting at quarterback in the
NFL,'' Freeman said. ``When you look at Doug Flutie, he's five-foot
nothing, but he's great. It's all heart with Flutie, and it's all
heart with a cutting horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Freeman's heart is turned toward winning the
Futurity as a rider. He won Futurity titles in 1979, 1982 and 1988.
Only Buster Welch with five has more titles than Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ride in there to win second,'' Freeman said.
``Sometimes second place is forced on me because of circumstances
that I can't control \Rmainly poor cattle\S, but I ride with the
intention to win.'' / nn

DALLAS STARS LACK PUNCH IN THE 1-2 LINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ So far this season, the Stars have been
punch-drunk.
</P>
<P>
   In winning 51 regular-season games last season, the Stars had a
potent one-two punch. No team had two checking lines strong enough
to defend against the Stars' top two lines, led by centers Mike
Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's 3-2 overtime loss to Colorado, the only consistent
line was that of Nieuwendyk, Jamie Langenbrunner and rookie Brenden
Morrow. Other nights, the No. 1 line of Modano has had to carry the
load.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't packed their knockout punch since the
season-opening 6-4 defeat of Pittsburgh, the last time Modano and
Nieuwendyk scored goals in the same game. In only one other game _
a 5-2 defeat of St. Louis on Nov. 9 _ have the two centers tallied
a point in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to feed off Joe's line, and Joe's line seems to feed
off ours,'' Modano said. ``When the two are going real well, I
think it makes it tough for teams to focus on one line. I think
it's an important part to our team, and if it doesn't happen, I
think we're going to be very much in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the defending Stanley Cup champions are
punchless. Only the New York Islanders have scored fewer goals than
the Stars' 43.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven goals in their past five games, the Stars take a
five-game winless streak into tonight's game against the Los
Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're scoring under two goals a game \Ractually
2.05\S, and that just doesn't cut it,'' Stars defenseman Darryl
Sydor said. ``We know we can score. The thing is we just can't get
frustrated. We can't squeeze our sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars (8-10-3) are having a hard time dealing with their
drought. They have stayed up nights. They have watched tapes. They
have looked in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time when you've just got to put your foot down
and say, `Enough's enough. We've got to change it,' '' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' power play has lost its juice, too. The team has
scored on only 13 percent (10-of-77) of its power plays, ranking
25th in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the bulk of our scoring came on our power play for
the first four months,'' Modano said. ``It was tops in the league
for a couple of years now. I think that really relaxed things
five-on-five. Now that the power play is a little bit struggling,
there are more times that we press a little bit too much
five-on-five trying to make the home run, trying to make the big
play. Usually when our power play is clicking, it seems to open
things up five-on-five.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the victory against the Blues on Nov. 9, the Stars have
only three points and an 0-2-3 record. Yet, the Stars have seen
enough of younger players such as Morrow starting to blend in,
injured players like Richard Matvichuk coming back and a revival by
Nieuwendyk (six points in his past six games) to feel they are
pointed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are now starting to really try to understand that this
is a new team and a new year, different chemistry, and I think
they're starting to really work at building that back again. I've
seen that for the last week,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It
wasn't there before. It was: Why can't we do this? Why can't we do
that? Why isn't this working? Why isn't this the same? Why are we
making changes here? And what's the difference here? All those
questions were there, and those are negative thought patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we wanted it to change, it had to go through the
process, and to me, it's starting to come back the other way now.
The process is changing, and the players have accepted this as a
new group.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season is history. This season has been a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But with 61 games remaining, the Stars do have one thing on
their side: time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing right now is not scoring and not winning,'' Sydor
said. ``But everybody is still upbeat in here. You don't see a lot
of moping around. Guys still believe in themselves. We still
believe in our team, our coaching staff and everything. We've just
got to turn this thing around. It's a long season.''

SAVE YOUR SYMPATHY FOR DEION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Between the toe thing and the divorce thing and the hamstring
thing and the fact that quarterbacks in the league are suddenly
making him look vulnerable, I was almost starting to feel sorry for
Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   But silly me. Then I read last Friday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatch I am referring to, of course, bore the headline,
``Sanders looks at baseball ... Return to Reds possible, source
says.''
</P>
<P>
   I immediately canceled the sympathy bouquet that I was about to
send to Reverend Do-Rag. Instead, I was reminded of a scriptural
passage, the one about a lizard changing his colors, yet he
remaineth a lizard. I forget the chapter and verse.
</P>
<P>
   I have always fancied myself as one of the rare ones in the
local media. I wanted to take Deion Sanders seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But each time that His Primeness flutters his eyelashes and
pretends to preach some football truth, a Babel of conflicting
words come pouring forth.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the Great American Toe Injury. He has the
surgeon's bills to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't understand is the toe injury, on top of his
announced ``concussion,'' on top of the hamstring/groin injury that
he appears to have. And now this baseball thing.
</P>
<P>
   With a tenuous stretch drive looming for the Cowboys and with
his sick leave all used up, Sanders can't be serious about
baseball. The Cincinnati Reds certainly aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the most overachieving team in baseball, an Everyman's
gang of underpaid, hard-working heroes, want Deion to rejoin the
mix?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that it probably doesn't. By placing Deion on its
40-man roster last week, Reds general manager Jim Bowden was
exercising a procedural move that protects the club's rights in the
event that someone else is even quasi-interested.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jones would do the same thing, unless your name _ oops _
is Charles Haley. By adding Sanders to the off-season roster, the
Reds prevent some team from selecting Deion in the Rule 5 Draft.
For the record, Sanders technically has been under a Reds
minor-league contract since he retired from baseball full-time in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said last week that he had spoken with Sanders' agent,
Eugene Parker, about the possibility of Deion returning to the
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the braintrust at Do-Rag, Inc., can't be serious.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering how much batting practice Sanders, a career .266
hitter, has had. I'm wondering when was the last time that he tried
to shag a sinking line drive.
</P>
<P>
   With two years of moss under his spikes, Deion should not expect
a long line of baseball suitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would probably be, at most, a good fourth
outfielder,'' one major-league scout said. ``He'd give you some
speed as a bonus. And even though he's not a donkey as an
outfielder, he has a below-average arm.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scout's scale of 2 through 8, with 5 being average, the
scout grades Deion thusly:
</P>
<P>
   ``4, as a hitter
</P>
<P>
   ``3, for power
</P>
<P>
   ``7, running
</P>
<P>
   ``maybe 5, fielding
</P>
<P>
   ``with 6 or 7 range.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, he'd probably grade out enough to be a fringe
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it's hard to imagine Sanders being serious
about taking on the baseball challenge again. He's no Ken Griffey
Jr. He's not even a Brian Jordan, his old Falcons buddy who now
bats cleanup for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders would expect more than fourth-outfielder money, as
is his custom. When he ``retired'' the first time, Family Man
Sanders complained how baseball's demands nearly cost him his
family.
</P>
<P>
   The guy doesn't even practice now, for a job that pays him $10
million a year. He's not about to commit to a spring training, plus
162 baseball games for a measly $2-3 million.
</P>
<P>
   If this Cowboys season has proven anything about Sanders, it's
that he does not embrace hard work enthusiastically. He has a
thespian's gift of making it all look so sweaty and gallant. But
stop and think _ maybe the fact that he skipped all of training
camp and also doesn't sweat much from Monday to Saturday might have
something to do with his current injury problems. Just a thought.
</P>
<P>
   And though this is, admittedly, hearsay, the major-league scout
noted, ``I heard somebody in Cincinnati say that he's disillusioned
with football now.''
</P>
<P>
   What Deion does know is that the five-year, $52.5 million
contract he signed last summer means nothing if Owner Jones wants
to clear salary cap room after this season. Jones would want a
football-only Deion, making the issue of a two-sport Sanders a key
negotiating issue.
</P>
<P>
   A cynical mind would call it a blatant salary ploy. Actually,
blatant might not be a strong enough word.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reverend Do-Rag's newfound religion, when money is
involved, Deion is more than interested.
</P>
<P>
   Silly me. I was this close to sending a sympathy card.

MASSACHUSETTS SETS LOW BAR FOR PASSING GRADUATION TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Mass. _ The Massachusetts Board of Education voted
Tuesday to set a low passing mark for a new test that students must
take to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   The delicate decision was in keeping with an emerging pattern in
which some states have adopted tough new mandatory exams but, leery
of the prospect that the vast majority of students will fail them,
set initially low passing grades that are to be raised only
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts board, meeting in an elementary school in this
town south of Worcester, voted 8-1 to set the passing grade for now
at 220 _ at the bottom of the ``needs improvement'' range and just
above the ``failing'' range _ on the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System tests, whose scores run from 200 to 280. The
board voted unanimously to raise the passing grade to some
undetermined level at a later date. Also just for now, only English
and math tests will be required, rather than exams in social
studies and the sciences as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tests have been administered for the last two years to 4th,
8th and 10th graders. But passing them becomes a prerequisite for
graduation with the class of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The option for the board would have been to put the passing
grade in the ``needs improvement'' range or even higher, and some
complained that with Tuesday's votes the state had backed away from
its commitment to tough standards.
</P>
<P>
   But others saw the chosen cutoff point, which will now be
subject to a period of public comment and is expected to be made
final in January, as dangerously high. A study by researchers at
the University of Massachusetts that was issued earlier this month
found that with the passing grade decided Tuesday, 83 percent of
Latinos and 80 percent of blacks would not graduate from high
school. The figure for whites was 43 percent, and for
Asian-Americans 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly think it's unacceptable for there to be such a gap
in minority and nonminority scores,'' said Mary Jo Marion,
associate director of the university's Gaston Institute, which
performed the analysis. ``We are trying to look at what the outcome
would be if this should stand,'' including ``the implications for
Massachusetts, for the students, for the towns and the families.''
</P>
<P>
   But board officials described the new passing grade as a fair
beginning, one that would allow the state to ease into the toughest
part of the overhaul it undertook in 1993, a sweeping program that
includes the rigorous new tests, greater accountability on the part
of schools and added money for education.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``None of us is happy with the scores'' that students have made
on the tests in the last two years, said Roberta Schaefer, vice
chairwoman of the board. ``But we have to start someplace, and we
have been presented with a case for this being a very valuable
start.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken us a generation to get to the low level of where
we are,'' Ms. Schaefer said, ``and it may take a generation to get
us out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the states have some kind of high school exit
exam either in place or on the way, but many are not very
demanding, said Matt Gandle, director of the Washington office of
Achieve, a center focused on raising school performance.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a handful of those states, including Massachusetts
and New York, have begun phasing in long, tough exit tests. The
Massachusetts exams, for example, last from 12 to 15 hours over the
course of about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Massachusetts and New York, Gandle said, ``in a
very short period of time the rubber will hit the road and the
diplomas will be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will be frustrated,'' he said, ``and that's where
the real test comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the real test of the tests seems to have long
since begun, given the heat of the debate over the new educational
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Latino and African-American groups have been warning
that high rates of minority failure on the tests could drastically
increase dropout rates. Also sounding the alarm is a national group
of critics of standardized tests, FairTest, based in Cambridge. It
is playing an active role in opposing the Massachusetts testing
system and, as part of a broader coalition, has attracted two
nationally known educators, Deborah Meier, winner of a MacArthur
Foundation grant, and Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard
School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month that larger group, the Coalition for
Authentic Reform in Education, denounced the Massachusetts tests as
``a quick-fix strategy that does not lead to sustained improvement
in learning, teaching and assessment,'' and proposed a more locally
controlled mix of assessments and reviews with some standardized
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The group bringing together proponents of the Massachusetts
overhaul, Mass Insight Education, counters by saying that the tests
are only one part, but a necessary one, of making the state's 1,800
public schools fit for the 21st century, and that it is better for
children to fail a 10th-grade test while there is still time to
help them than to send them out into the working world unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has spread to the board's decision about the passing
grade. Today the executive director of FairTest, Monty Neill,
described the decision as profoundly political.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially what it does is, it's a cut score that will still
massively flunk low-income kids and kids of color,'' Neill said,
``whereas if they had set it where they originally talked about, at
the `proficient' level, they would have massively flunked suburban
kids, too, and then the whole thing would have blown up in their
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the new score, in contrast, said they thought it
showed common sense, and board chairman James Peyser called it a
``historic and momentous'' improvement over the status quo, in
which the state requires nothing of students to graduate beyond one
year of American history and four years of gym.

SKIP DIALING `1': IS THAT YOUR FINAL ANSWER? A NEW YORKER ASKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If, perhaps, you dreamed of riches and wanted to try
your luck on the smash-hit quiz show ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' all you had to do was dial the simple toll-free
number 1-877-258-5808.
</P>
<P>
   But if you called from Manhattan and forgot to dial that
all-important 1, you did not get the game show _ you got Stan.
</P>
<P>
   For about a month, Stan _ that is, Stan Kemper, a regular guy
with terrible luck _ was caught in an awful telephonic nightmare.
Starting last month, he got hundreds of calls from aspiring
contestants, received no prize money and watched in horror day
after day as the avarice of New York City poured into his living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of it, I was answering the phone twice a
minute,'' said Kemper, 32, a playwright/actor/French teacher, who
had the terrific misfortune of owning the number 877-2585. ``I was
getting 300, 400 calls a day, and most of them were going to my
voice mail _ and that fills up after 29 calls.''
</P>
<P>
   To Kemper's credit, he was, at first, unfazed by the assault and
tried to have fun with the calls. When people asked if they had
reached the game show, he said yes _ then asked a couple of
questions of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `When dialing a 10-digit number, which do you dial
first: a) 1 or b) nothing,''' he explained, his voice still cut
with frustration. ``They'd usually hang up before I even got to
c.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a few days, the joke wore off when Kemper realized
that his voice-mail service charged him 15 cents for each message,
a little plot twist that amounted to several hundred dollars by the
end of his siege.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the prospect of going bust from a horde of would-be
millionaires, Kemper _ picked up the phone. He called ABC looking
for help but was told, he said, that it was not the network's
problem if its fortune seekers consistently misdialed.
</P>
<P>
   In a panic, he then contacted his phone company and voice mail
provider, Bell Atlantic, and was counseled, he said, to change his
phone number _ an idea he resisted at first. After all, as an actor
and teacher, Kemper's livelihood depends on being in regular
contact with directors and students who have had his number for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Nov. 15, after weeks of headaches and thousands of
calls, Kemper made the switch. But instead of peace and quiet, he
got more calls. Apparently, he said, people would hear the
operator's automatic message _ ``the number you have reached has
been changed'' _ and simply call the new number, still trying to
get on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what I was afraid would happen,'' Kemper said.
``I wasn't getting as many as before _ maybe 10 or 12 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he never changed his voice mail to alert
people that they had failed to reach the show. Then again, he never
thought he had to. Kemper's message is partly in French and greets
all callers with ``Bonjour, c'est Stan'' _ not your regular game
show fare.
</P>
<P>
   The phone calls finally stopped on Nov. 19, the very day that
ABC disconnected the toll-free line. By then, said Ann Miller,
supervising producer of the show, the network had enough
contestants for its current episodes _ the last of which will be
shown tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' on which ordinary people
answer multiple-choice trivia questions, is so wildly popular that
it attracted 26 million viewers when it was first broadcast in
August, only a few million fewer than the top-rated program,
``E.R.'' This month's incarnation has also dominated the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after speaking with a reporter from The New York Times,
Ms. Miller said that ABC was considering paying Kemper the
difference between his average monthly voice mail bills and the
charges he incurred last month. ``We want him to be happy,'' she
said. ``We are going to work this out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kemper was not quite satisfied with ABC's offer. While he
acknowledged that network officials were trying to compensate him
for his financial loss, he said they had not repaid him having been
virtually without a phone for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping they would offer a little more, especially given
the show we're talking about,'' he said. ``But at least I don't end
up poor because of this _ just inconvenienced.''

<P>
   FRANKLIN, Ohio _ Terry Wheat cherishes his new International
Eagle 18-wheeler loaded with Budweiser beer, soon to be loaded with
whatever the dispatcher assigns him next. ``My truck is built
strictly for comfort,'' he said. ``My seats swivel and kick back.''
Behind the seats is his sleeper, with double decker beds, a
television, a VCR, a refrigerator and his Nintendo games.
</P>
<P>
   This is Wheat's cocoon, his home 341 days a year. Breaking off
from the herd of hog-nosed gorillas thundering along Interstate 75
here, he said he drove 10 hours a day, seven days a week, for eight
weeks straight. Then he gets four days off, a total of 24 days a
year. He spends those days at home in Franklinton, La., with his
wife and 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm out here is my kid,'' said Wheat, who is 36 and
earns 33 cents a mile driving more than 120,000 miles a year, or
around $40,000. ``He's got more than I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat is proud of the work. ``Anything that goes in a store, we
carry,'' he said. And he likes the solitude. ``You get your whole
life in perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These are busy, good-money times for the nation's nearly 600,000
drivers of large trucks, those weighing more than 10,000 pounds.
High employment, easy credit and free-spending consumers may be
prosperity's engines, but these men _ nearly all are men _ are its
mules. Truckers lug 81 percent of the value of all the nation's
freight, and 60 percent of the tonnage.
</P>
<P>
   Trucking is more hectic than ever, in part because the economy
of the 1990s has assigned trucks a new function. They have become
warehouses on wheels. Stores and factories, many tied to the
Internet, have found they can cut costs by shrinking the warehouses
where they store the materials they use in production or the goods
they sell later to consumers. Instead, they rely on trucks to
deliver the goods the moment they need them.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by this ``just-in-time'' method of inventory control,
trucking company revenue is up more than 60 percent in this decade,
to more than $400 billion, according to the American Trucking
Associations, and the number of big trucks has risen 18 percent, to
1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Department of Transportation toughened its fines
for rule violations, like driving too long and ducking safety
measures. And Julie Cirillo, acting director of the Office of Motor
Carrier Safety at the department, said the Clinton administration
is preparing the first new rules in 60 years governing the hours
that drivers work and sleep. ``Twenty to 25 percent of the
drivers,'' she said, ``are not responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The drivers here represent a subset of the American culture most
akin to those who work the seas. They play havoc with the cycles of
the sun and the moon. Required by law to rest for 8 hours after
driving for 10, they can start driving on Monday at 8 a.m., stop at
6 p.m. and start on Tuesday at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On a run early in November, Don Maxwell, 58, and his son Wayne,
34, both of Bremen, Ohio, order their main meal of the day, the
popular Plaza Special for $7.40. It includes coffee, two slices of
white toast and a plate stacked with three scrambled eggs, two
round slabs of ham and a mound of hash brown potatoes. Don Maxwell
swamps his plate with a third of a bottle of ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxwells, unlike most other drivers, are a team. They own a
445-horsepower, 1994 bunk-bedded Kenworth tractor that they bought
used a year and a half ago for $56,000, about half what it would
cost new. Taking alternating five-hour driving and sleeping turns,
they can work 24 hours straight, with time out for showers and
meals at truck stops.
</P>
<P>
   Married, they get home to Bremen most Saturdays at noon and set
off again just before midnight on Sundays. Currently, they haul
groceries to Aldi discount food stores in Ohio, Kentucky and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We average about $1 a mile, loaded or empty,'' Maxwell said,
three times the earnings of most other truckers, who do not own
their tractors and earn nothing when moving empty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Maxwells share the complaint of most other drivers.
Starting out 23 years ago, the elder Maxwell said, ``You didn't
have to work as hard _ you run now.'' Company dispatchers get on
the phone to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is `on time,' `on time,''' he said. ``Whether you
can make it on not, `on time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for a late delivery, he said, ``we get nasty
little notes, `Why didn't you make it on time?'''
</P>
<P>
   As yet, little real evidence shows whether tight scheduling
endangers the highways. The fatality rate in accidents involving
trucks last year was 2.33 for every 100 million miles, a record
low. Alcohol is rarely a factor. Still, the absolute number of
fatalities involving trucks has rarely dropped below 5,000 in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   And some drivers here say they routinely break rules. They fudge
their log books. Like passenger car drivers, they routinely speed.
Unlike most passenger car drivers, they have citizen band radios to
warn one another of lurking ``smokies.''
</P>
<P>
   A 28-year-old Indianan, who would not give his name, said, ``I
can't drive totally legal and make good money. If I drove legally,
do you know how much freight would still be sitting in a
warehouse?''
</P>
<P>
   In this driver-short, fast-moving economy, truckers who have a
gripe with their dispatchers can quit and be driving another truck
within a week, and many do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average trucking company has a turnover rate of 100
percent annually,'' said Bob Costello, an economist at the American
Trucking Associations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Help-wanted advertisements for truck drivers filled an entire
page of The Cincinnati Enquirer's classified ads on a recent
Sunday. Company recruiters linger at truck stops. Typically, to
induce drivers to switch, companies keep a tractor just three
years, down from five a few years ago, so they can offer recruits
something new.
</P>
<P>
   Some truckers fashion a way of life that allows them to thrive
through booms and busts. Torvey McAllister Jr. of Cadiz, Ky., is
short, compact, with a Hemingway-like beard and 65 years old. He
was hauling Toyota Corollas to the Budget Car Rental office at
O'Hare International Airport in Chicago for H &AMP; H Transport of
Murray, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching his 1993 Peterbilt cab, his blue-eyed, pointy-eared,
driving companion with savage incisors peers from the driver's
seat. The companion is a usually docile, playful, year-old female
timberwolf who is a terror to the thieves and prostitutes who
cruise around ill-tended truck stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you can be a truckaholic,'' McAllister said. ``I've
hauled everything but furniture and gasoline. I sleep every night.
I don't have to wear glasses. I've got a clean record. No
accidents, knock on wood. I've had the same wife since January the
sixth, 1959,'' the year he started trucking.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt little of many other drivers' pressure to hurry.
``Nobody pushes anybody,'' he said. ``I don't run illegal.''
Drivers like McAllister exploit their freedom on the road in many
ways, like changing course to reach a customer or stopping when
they get the urge to stop.
</P>
<P>
   More of that freedom is at risk today. To keep trucks running on
time, many companies are fitting dashboards with satellite-linked
computers that can tell when the truck is running or idle, or where
it is within a block or two.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmo A. Lippolis, a 60-year-old trucker from Baltimore who is
hauling Serta mattresses from Indiana to Orlando, Fla., said the
computer saved log-keeping paperwork and made it faster to get help
after a breakdown or an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``they're watching now.''

JOHN B. BROOKS, JAZZ ARRANGER, COMPOSER AND SONGWRITER, 82 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Benson Brooks, a jazz composer, arranger and
songwriter, died on Nov. 13 at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   An early composition, ``Just as Though You Were Here'' (1942),
with lyrics by Eddie DeLange, brought Brooks prominence. The song
was recorded by Tommy Dorsey's band, with vocals by Frank Sinatra
and the Pied Pipers.
</P>
<P>
   His best-remembered hit, ``You Came a Long Way From St. Louis''
(1948), with lyrics by Bob Russell, was originally recorded by Ray
McKinley and his Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs of which Brooks was composer or co-composer included
``Where Flamingos Fly,'' ``Over the Weekend,'' ``A Boy From Texas,
a Girl From Tennessee'' and ``A Door Will Open.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1957 recording of jazz musicians improvising on music Brooks
had written, ``Folk Jazz, U.S.A.,'' on which Brooks played the
piano, was praised by John S. Wilson in The New York Times. Wilson
wrote that Brooks' arrangements of ``Shenandoah'' and other
familiar folk songs, based on the tunes' chord structures rather
than their melodies, ``emerge as relatively new compositions
melodically, while retaining the evocative nostalgic quality of the
source tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good trick and it works out as valid jazz,'' he added.
Other jazz albums of Brooks' music were ``Alabama Concerto'' (1958)
and ``Avant Slant'' (1968), which was a mixed-media collage
featuring a performance of his 12-tone jazz work, ``The Twelves.''
.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Houlton, Maine, he attended the New England Conservatory
in Boston. In the early 40s he wrote musical arrangements for swing
bands, including those of Les Brown and Tommy Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Peggy; two daughters, Stephanie Lee
Brooks and Wendy Brooks Mitchell, both of North Palm Beach, Fla.,
and a grandson.  &QL;

JERALDYNE BLUNDEN, 58, FOUNDER OF MODERN DANCE TROUPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeraldyne Blunden, the founder and artistic director of the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, died on Monday at the Franciscan
Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. She was 58 and lived in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was renal failure, said Phyllis Brzozowska, executive
director of Dayton Contemporary Dance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to guiding the small modern-dance troupe to national
prominence over its 30 years of existence, Mrs. Blunden developed a
number of leading American modern dance performers, among them the
former Alvin Ailey star Donna Wood. Mrs. Blunden, who was awarded a
MacArthur Foundation grant in 1994, was also a major and
much-honored proponent of the contributions of black choreographers
and performers to American modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Blunden had mixed feelings about that role.
``Everything in America is labeled,'' she said in a 1996 interview.
``You could call what I do black dance because I'm a black-dance
person. What I do is from a black perspective. But people who are
sure of themselves don't bother with that.'' That no-nonsense
approach to life was mixed with steely determination, a great
personal warmth and humor and an unsentimental humanity that made
her a much-loved figure on the national dance scene.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blunden began her dance training at 8, in Dayton, her
hometown, with Josephine and Hermene Schwarz , the founders of the
Dayton Ballet. As a teen-age student at the American Dance
Festival, Mrs. Blunden had her first important experience of modern
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Martha Graham,'' she recalled in 1996. ``Jose Limon.
Merce Cunningham was the new young man on the block and we flocked
to his classes, of course. My first musical concert away from home
was John Cage. I thought I was in the wrong place because he played
everything but the keys on the piano.'' Dayton Contemporary Dance
Company would later become the first black dance troupe to acquire
a Cunningham work, Channels/Inserts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blunden performed with several ballet and modern companies
in Dayton, continuing her dancing through college, marriage and
motherhood, when she began to teach. She took her students to
regional ballet competitions around the country and raised money to
bring them to a summer session at Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater
of Harlem in New York. She formed the company to give her dancers a
place to perform, at first creating the repertory herself. One of
her early dancers was her daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs. She chose
her daughter along with the choreographer and dancer Kevin Ward to
succeed her as artistic directors of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blunden's honors also included the Dance Magazine Award of
1998 and the 1999 Dance USA Honors Award. In 1997, she was one of
five female dance company directors honored as ``living legends''
by 651: An Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband,
Charles Blunden, her mother, Winifred Kilborn, and a sister, Carol
Ann Shockley, all of Dayton; a son, Derek, of Charleston, W. Va.,
and four grandchildren.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton did the smart thing, and not a moment too
soon. ``The answer is yes,'' she said at a campaign appearance
yesterday. ``I intend to run.'' Actually she should probably have
avoided the word ``intend,'' since her spinners had to explain that
the word was not meant as an escape hatch from her expected Senate
race against New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. But the main
message got through. After a series of gaffes, the first lady is
committed, at least unofficially, to running in one of the nation's
most unforgiving political environments for a rookie candidate. The
early reviews have been rough because both friends and enemies
expected, probably unrealistically, for her to be as effective in
the spotlight as she was behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly and not so quietly, New York's Democrats have been
grumbling that Mrs. Clinton might not run, that she has been
frightened off by the criticism of her trip to Israel and by her
slippage in the polls against Giuliani. But New York politics is
not conducted by sporting rules, a concept that must have lost its
abstraction this week when the first lady saw a Republican
television advertisement questioning her support of Israel. The
spot shows her kissing the wife of the Palestinian leader, Yasser
Arafat, after Mrs. Arafat charged that Israelis had used toxic gas
on Palestinians. The commercial, paid for by the Washington-based
Republican Jewish Coalition, makes no allowances for problems that
Mrs. Clinton's supporters said occurred in the translation or for
her rejection 12 hours later of the statements by Mrs. Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its impact on voters, the ad punctuated the need for
Mrs. Clinton to act decisively to prevent erosion of her base. The
defection of Democratic State Sen. Carl Kruger of Brooklyn and the
criticism of another Democrat, City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge,
are not devastating events. But they are signals that Mrs.
Clinton's core constituencies are ready for a candidate who runs
full time and seems ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to live mostly in Westchester County and cut back
her tasks as first lady is a necessary step in a contest where
Giuliani is constantly on the move and on the attack. What we will
see now is how she responds to the daily accidents, surprises and
insults of New York campaigning. She has learned that the cynicism
of her new neighbors makes tricks like putting on a Yankees cap
into something other than a bonding experience. Last Sunday's poll
in The New York Post, with questions carefully worded to make her
look bad, is surely a harbinger of hostile gestures to come from
that quarter. She certainly has to avoid another major flip-flop on
the order of the one in which she first endorsed and then opposed
her husband's pardon of 16 Puerto Rican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton says she has no illusions about what kind of
campaign it will be. The fact that she is still in the race after
this last week certainly suggests a tough resolve. Now if she
proves to be a brawler as ferocious as Giuliani and a master of the
rapid-response trick of fixing mistakes within the same news cycle,
Mrs. Clinton may be completing her initiation period just as she
becomes a full-time resident of the state she proposes to represent
in the Senate. &QL;

TRACKING STOCKS GO MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (With AT&AMP;T-TRACKING-STOCK) 
(mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once dismissed as gimmickry, tracking stocks have become an
almost thoroughly mainstream way for big companies to highlight the
performance of their far-flung units.
</P>
<P>
   Say a company generates most of its earnings making plastic. It
is a profitable, but slow-growing, business, and the performance of
the company's stock is tied to the modest growth of the plastics
unit. On the side, however, the company has a small operation that
makes sneakers, and the sneaker business is exploding. The
company's stock, however, which is tied to the core plastics
operation, does not reflect the strength in its sneaker division.
</P>
<P>
   A company in that situation could issue a tracking stock for the
sneaker business, hoping that the combined value of the old stock
and the new one would be higher than that of the original shares on
their own. The sneaker unit would remain wholly owned by the parent
company, but would report separate financial results. If investors
were optimistic about the sneaker unit's prospects, they could
invest in the tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, however, is that owning a share of the sneaker stock
would not actually give the holder ownership of part of the sneaker
business. By contrast, standard common shares represent economic
ownership of part of the company that issued them.
</P>
<P>
   The first tracking stock was issued by General Motors in 1984,
when it acquired Electronic Data Systems. The stock was called
General Motors class E. GM has remained a tracking stock proponent,
issuing an additional tracking stock to follow Hughes Electronics,
a GM subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   John Malone, the cable television and media baron, was known for
issuing blizzards of tracking stocks when he ran
Tele-Communications Inc. In fact, after AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire TCI
last year, AT&AMP;T created a tracking stock to cover Liberty Media.
</P>
<P>
   The direct antecedent to AT&AMP;T's new plan, however, is Sprint's
tracking stock for its wireless unit, issued last year. Measured by
the tracking stock, Sprint's wireless unit now has a market value
of about $38 billion.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN N.Y. SEEK TO STICK TO THEIR OWN STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Nightingale-Bamford, a private school for girls on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the chemistry labs rival those of
a small college _ well equipped and spanking new. The school's
computer classes have as many terminals as students; its auditorium
would put many Off Broadway theaters to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Those amenities are not just cosmetic. The vast majority of
Nightingale-Bamford seniors score well on the College Boards, and
graduates regularly go on to selective colleges and then to
prominent professional and corporate positions.
</P>
<P>
   So why, asks Dorothy Hutcheson, head of the school, should
private school students have to pass the state's Regents exams to
graduate, as public high school seniors across the state are now
required to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``State exams mean state curriculum,'' Ms. Hutcheson said. ``We
want our faculty to set the standards for our courses. This is
straight at the heart of what being an independent school is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be something else going on. The elite
institutions, which charge up to $20,000 a year in tuition, clearly
do not want obligatory tests that allow rankings and comparisons
with other schools, particularly public ones. In fact, for some of
the private schools, long accustomed to setting many of their own
rules, the dilemma has rekindled a sensitive, dormant issue: Do
they need the state's blessing on their schools at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that most colleges and universities couldn't care
less if Brearley, Horace Mann, Dalton or anywhere else is
officially recognized by New York state,'' said Frederick Calder,
executive director of the New York State Association of Independent
Schools, a grouping of elite private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students are subject to rigorous examinations, and the
schools to accreditation on a regular basis, measuring every aspect
of the institution,'' Calder said. ``But we cannot allow this kind
of intrusion. Otherwise, why be private?''
</P>
<P>
   A number of questions underlie this debate. One is whether
performance on standardized tests should be granted such overriding
importance. A second is whether all students should be subject to
the exact same criteria. And a third is that if expensive private
schools are permitted to skirt state tests, will that not add to
the sense that the rich live by different rules?
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Department says it simply wants to make sure
that no school is turning out underqualified graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversation we are having is not about the quality of the
curriculum or the resources or the faculty they have,'' said James
Kadamus, the state's deputy education commissioner. ``On the input
side of the equation these schools rate pretty high. But now we're
talking about the output: How can we judge whether students meet
certain requirements?''
</P>
<P>
   The private schools are one of three groups seeking to gain
exemptions from new state rules that by 2003 will require all
students to pass Regents examinations in five subjects _ math,
science, global studies, American history and English _ in order to
graduate from high school. Some alternative public high schools,
like the Beacon School in New York City, and some suburban
districts, like Scarsdale, are also seeking exemption from the
tests. Private school administrators in particular say the tests
would change the nature of what they do. At Nightingale-Bamford,
for example, three-quarters of the juniors and seniors take
advanced-placement, or college-level, courses in at least one
subject. In those subjects, therefore, the students are two years
beyond much of the material on the Regents exam, Ms. Hutcheson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want to give standardized, content-based tests
because it would force us into teaching toward those tests,'' said
Andrew McLaren, director of the Little Red School House and
Elisabeth Irwin High School in Greenwich Village. ``We certainly
support the state's desire to do the best possible thing for all of
the students in the state. But it seems to us that we, as a group
of schools, have pretty darn good and demonstrable results.''
</P>
<P>
   The tests at issue have caused an uproar among educators and
parents this year, the first in which public high school seniors
will be required to pass the Regents English exam in order to
graduate. A few weeks ago, the results for students who took the
English Regents in the 11th grade were announced, and only 55
percent of New York City students passed, even though the passing
grade was a 55.
</P>
<P>
   With the public school standards now in place, the Board of
Regents has turned its attention to the private schools. Despite
their independent nature, most private schools operate under state
charters that require certain educational standards be met.

EDITORIAL: FAILURES OF PEACE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 24:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton went to Kosovo yesterday primarily to pay a
pre-Thanksgiving call on American troops and encourage ethnic
reconciliation. His pleas for forgiveness toward the Serbs drew a
predictably chilly reception. But his visit will be valuable if it
draws broader attention to the serious problems bedeviling
international rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. Last spring NATO used
its military power to uphold humanitarian principle and allow
hundreds of thousands of brutally uprooted ethnic Albanians to
return to their homes. That precious victory must not now be
allowed to degenerate into an unstable, unworkable peace.
</P>
<P>
   More than five months after the withdrawal of Serbian forces,
Kosovo still lacks basic water, electricity and sanitation
services. With police scarce and courts nonexistent, criminals
control the streets while non-ethnic-Albanian residents, whether
Serbs, Gypsies or Bosnian Muslims, are being burned out of their
homes. European donors have been slow in following through on their
pledges of financial help and many countries have lagged in
providing volunteers for the short-staffed international police.
Officials from the United Nations and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe spend too much time and money building up
their rival bureaucratic empires and not enough helping Kosovars
create their own institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Through the hard work of local inhabitants, Kosovo's private
economy is starting to revive. But the international organizations
have not been much help. They have failed to rebuild the power
plants and waterworks sabotaged by the departing Serbs or the roads
and bridges bombed by NATO. They have not moved fast enough to put
the old Serb-run state companies into private local hands.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. and the OSCE seem intent on erecting bureaucratic
structures for long-term international administration rather than
encouraging eventual self-government. Able to offer much higher
salaries than local employers, they have drawn educated Kosovars to
their payrolls at the expense of schools, law offices and other
professions. They have poured disproportionate resources into
building competing official broadcast networks, siphoning money and
talent that should be going to strengthen independent media.
</P>
<P>
   NATO must also take responsibility for its failure to protect
Serbs and Gypsies and preserve the possibility of a multi-ethnic
Kosovo. Instead, most Serbs have either fled to Serbia or regrouped
in the northernmost part of Kosovo. There French NATO commanders
have wrongly tolerated a kind of unofficial partition, marked off
by road barricades, that has left one of the province's most
valuable economic resources, a lead and zinc mining and smelting
complex, under Serbian control.
</P>
<P>
   The peace in Kosovo is hardly lost, and Clinton was right to
urge local civilians to be patient. Bernard Kouchner, the chief
U.N. administrator, has shown an admirable willingness to listen to
critics and occasionally change direction. But unless there is a
significant reining in of the international bureaucracy and greater
efforts to involve the Kosovars more directly in the economy and
administration, the outlook is disheartening.  &QL;

FAA ACTION CANCELED 200 FLIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - A recent surge of canceled America West flights came
after the Federal Aviation Administration cracked down on the
airline for its ``abuse'' of temporary extensions for scheduled
airline maintenance, federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA early this monthhalted America West from using temporary
extensions to put off heavy maintenance, forcing the airline to
park three of its Boeing 757 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The move came after an August warning about using short-term
escalations, or STEs, that allow airlines to extend maintenance
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time the Tempe-based airline's maintenance
drew FAA criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the FAA fined America West $5 million for
maintenance violations that included overdue inspections and flying
an aircraft that was missing an elevator actuator, which controls
the tail flap for ascending and descending.
</P>
<P>
   Half the fine was waived in July 1999 after the FAA determined
the company had complied with required improvements.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, America West told regulators that it had a plan
to improve its maintenance scheduling. The FAA gave it more time
and allowed limited use of STEs.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA says America West used more than double the approved
number of days for the extensions and included aircraft not
included in the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, the aviation safety agency canceled the program Nov. 10,
which forced about 200 flight cancellations over five days.
</P>
<P>
   All told, America West canceled about 400 flights in the first
two weeks of November, which, according to one analyst, cost the
airline up to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the FAA's action are spelled out in a Nov. 15 letter
to Gilbert Mook, the airline's chief operating officer. A copy was
obtained by The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rosenhahn, a Phoenix FAA supervisor, criticized America
West's organizational deficiencies, poor scheduling and lack of
control over maintenance contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That America West Airlines has been using STEs as a method of
balancing economic convenience against forecasted scheduling
constraints was never an issue in controversy,'' Rosenhahn wrote.
``This type of abuse of the STE program was the direct reason it
was canceled by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program will be considered for reinstatement only after
America West can demonstrate it has an underlying infrastructure
fully capable of accommodating the maintenance requirements of its
airplanes without routine and inappropriate reliance on an
escalation program.''
</P>
<P>
   America West spokesman Steve Johnson denied the airline has
abused the maintenance extensions and downplayed their
significance, saying they delay maintenance by only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have used the escalation process prudently and absolutely
with a focus on safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West has never had a plane crash in more than 15 years
in business and has one of the best safety records in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns about America West maintenance scheduling, the
airline remains safe and is meeting all regulatory requirements,
FAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's ninth-largest airline has been plagued by
maintenance problems since it laid off nearly half its mechanics
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the $5 million fine in 1998, America West hired more than
90 mechanics and brought Mook in from FedEx to overhaul its
maintenance and operations.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist. The company's on-time record continues to
rank last among the major carriers and some delays are tied to
maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   America West mechanics complained during contract negotiations
last year that they routinely had to make repairs that should have
been caught during maintenance conducted by the outside
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to the FAA not to end the STE program as originally
proposed in August, America West submitted a detailed ``Get Well
Plan'' for its heavy maintenance, according to the FAA letter. The
company's goal was to get the heavy maintenance program in order
within 90 days, ending its dependence on the extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA gave America West until Nov. 7 to stop using STEs. Still
seeing abuses, the agency canceled all extensions for so-called
C-check maintenance Nov. 10. That work, required every 12 to 18
months depending on the type of aircraft, includes an on-wing
inspection of the engines and a complete check of the structural
integrity of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Caught off guard by the FAA's tough stand, America West had to
park three of its 757 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Patty Nowack said the contracted maintenance
work wasn't done on time by a United Airlines facility in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   America West was forced to cancel about 200 flights from Nov. 10
to 14. That was on top of another 200 cancellations for various
reasons earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   America West had hoped to save about $35 million over five years
by hiring outside contractors to do heavy maintenance on its
aircraft. But the recent cancellations raise questions about
whether the company has achieved any savings.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokesman Johnson said the outsourced maintenance
has saved the company a substantial amount of money, but no one has
calculated how much.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the recent cancellations were costly.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one Boeing 757 out of service can cost $25,000 to $30,000
in revenue for each lost flight, according to Darryl Jenkins, an
airline productivity expert and executive director of the Aviation
Institute at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually high number of cancellations not only
inconvenienced passengers but probably cost America West $8 million
to $10 million in lost revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not disclose how much the
cancellations cost the airline.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street analyst, Brian Harris of Salomon Smith Barney,
said that ``it's the same old story'' with America West's
operational problems, but the company's financial performance
remains fairly strong.
</P>
<P>
   America West has returned the 757 aircraft to service, and
Johnson said the company is prepared for the busy holiday travel
period, which kicks off today. &QL;

   America West spokesman Johnson said the outsourced maintenance
has saved the company a substantial amount of money, but no one has
calculated how much.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the recent cancellations were costly.
</P>
<P>
   Taking one Boeing 757 out of service can cost $25,000 to $30,000
in revenue for each lost flight, according to Darryl Jenkins, an
airline productivity expert and executive director of the Aviation
Institute at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually high number of cancellations not only
inconvenienced passengers but probably cost America West $8 million
to $10 million in lost revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials would not disclose how much the
cancellations cost the airline.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street analyst, Brian Harris of Salomon Smith Barney,
said that ``it's the same old story'' with America West's
operational problems, but the company's financial performance
remains fairly strong.
</P>
<P>
   America West has returned the 757 aircraft to service, and
Johnson said the company is prepared for the busy holiday travel
period, which kicks off today. &QL;

ORCHESTRA STRIKE FORCES CITY BALLET TO CANCEL OPENING

   NEW YORK _ The New York City Ballet canceled the opening-night
performance of its fall season at the New York State Theater on
Tuesday night when its 70-member orchestra went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, members of Local 802 of the American Federation
of Musicians, voted early Tuesday to strike, though they returned
to the bargaining table several hours before the curtain was
scheduled to go up. But no agreement was reached, and no date has
been set for the resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-to-2 vote to strike came after City Ballet rejected the
union's proposal to extend the previous contract by six months at a
4.5 percent increase in wages. ``That would have brought us to the
brink of the next gala,'' said Christopher Ramsey, the company's
director of external affairs, referring to the opening performance
of the spring season.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional holiday season performances of ``The
Nutcracker,'' which were scheduled to begin on Nov. 26, may also be
canceled. ``At this point we're taking it one day at a time,''
Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martins, the director of City Ballet, sent the musicians a
letter on Tuesday asking them to reconsider and suggesting that he
meet with them to explain the company's position. The dancers were
told to stand by at the theater until 6 p.m., when the musicians
began their picketing.
</P>
<P>
   Many ticketholders who arrived for the performance were stunned
when they found themselves facing a line of striking musicians,
many of whom were dressed formally for the performance and carrying
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cancellation of the performance, the ballet held its
annual black-tie opening night party, a benefit that was expected
to raise $1 million for the company. But the 800 guests who arrived
for cocktails and dinner were forced to cross the picket line,
something that evidently dismayed many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had begun three weeks ago. The chief issue was City
Ballet's demand for improved attendance by the musicians at
rehearsals and performances. Ramsey said that the company had
proposed a plan under which newly hired musicians would guarantee
attendance at six performances and two rehearsals a week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of their previous contract, which expired in
September, the musicians were required to perform six times a week
but were given unpaid leave when substitutes were available.
Orchestra members who voluntarily agreed to the the plan's more
stringent attendance rules would receive pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest issue is that we want to ensure the highest
possible level of quality for our performances,'' Ramsey said,
``and in order to do that, we want the musicians to rehearse what
they perform. The decision to strike came after the ballet rejected
the union's offer to extend the current contract for six months
while negotiations continued. At the same time, the musicians
turned down a proposal that would have made any benefits and wage
increases from a contract agreement retroactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to play and talk and we don't do that,'' said
Judy West, a spokeswoman for Local 802. ``There's a danger in that,
because you have no leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The average salary of current orchestra members is $66,000 for
26 weeks of work, according to the ballet company, with additional
money for seniority and other factors. The union disputed that
figure, saying the basic pay was $35,000.
