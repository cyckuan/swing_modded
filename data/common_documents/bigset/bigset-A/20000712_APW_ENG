<HEADLINE> US, N.Korea Missile Talks Near End  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Amid new hopes of progress, U.S.
and North Korean negotiators went into their final meeting
Wednesday in three days of talks on Pyongyang's development and
export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations follow new willingness by long-reclusive North
Korea to discuss defense issues and the latest failed test for a
U.S. missile defense system aimed at stopping strikes from North
Korea and other so-called countries of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Myong Gil, a North Korean negotiator, told reporters after
Tuesday's talks that ''the atmosphere was very sincere'' and the
chief topics were missile exports and compensation to North Korea.
An agreement was ''under negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants North Korea to halt the development and
export of ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang has said it will not negotiate on its sovereign right
to develop defensive missiles. There are hopes it may be more
flexible on its exports, though they are a vital source of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has in the past reportedly demanded annual
compensation of $1 billion for three years if it curbs missile
exports.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, chief U.S. negotiator, Robert Einhorn, had greeted
North Korean delegates with handshakes and smiles after saying the
United States was prepared to move toward fundamentally improved
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims North Korea is the world's top exporter
of missile equipment and technology, selling to such countries as
Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1998, Pyongyang rattled Asia by test-firing a missile
over Japan into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Einhorn said Monday that the talks
were being held in a positive atmosphere, largely due to a June
summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean
President Kim Dae-Jung.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also recently agreed to a moratorium on tests of
long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened official talks with Japan, moved to establish
diplomatic relations with many countries in Asia and Europe, and
joined a security forum of Southeast Asian nations.

<HEADLINE> Rescue workers search for victims in Brooklyn building collapse  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Nearly 200 fire and rescue workers in Brooklyn
combed through debris in Boerum Hill Tuesday night, looking for
three people in their 70s believed to be trapped inside a pair of
collapsed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A four-story brownstone apartment building at 420 State St.,
between Bond and Nevins streets, fell at 7:50 p.m. and took much of
an adjacent building with it. The buildings, on a quiet residential
street, collapsed into a pile of brick and wood about
one-and-a-half stories high.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs being used at the scene ''had a positive reaction for the
possibility of people being inside,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Six people lived in the two buildings; three had been accounted
for.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the first building collapsed without breaking,
making it more difficult for rescue workers to get underneath and
look for survivors, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said.
Cameras were also being used to see under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pretty flat pancake situation,'' Von Essen said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that witnesses reported seeing people enter the
buildings before the accident and that emergency personnel were
looking for two people in one building and one person in the other.
Workers at the scene said the missing people were the owners of one
of the buildings and a tenant in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters were treated at the scene for minor injuries.
No other injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause of the accident was not immediately known, the
mayor said a gas explosion might have caused it.
</P>
<P>
   KeySpan Energy workers examined pipes outside the buildings and
found no evidence of a gas leak, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had zero level of natural gas in the area,'' he said.
''We could find nothing to support that as a definite conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, witnesses like Kenneth Dinham, who works at a residential
drug treatment facility across the street from the collapse,
confirmed hearing an explosion ''just like a bomb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I came outside, all I could see was smoke in the air,'' Dinham
said. ''The windows moved, the place shook.''
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening the block was cordoned off as fire and
emergency personnel worked the accident scene looking for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Austin, a neighbor, said she knew a couple in their
early 70s who lived in the building that collapsed. She said a
firefighter confirmed her friends were inside.
</P>
<P>
   '''The question is whether they're alive or not,''' Austin
quoted the firefighter as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple of other neighbors and I just want to start pulling
rubble and calling their names to let them know people care,''
Austin said. ''We're sort of praying they wound up in the basement
or something, protected.''

Clinton Urges Compromise in Mideast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton brought together Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a renewed quest Tuesday for a
lasting Mideast peace. Insisting on compromise, Clinton said peace was a
''two-way street'' and that ''both sides must find a way to resolve competing
claims.'' Clinton opened the summit at the Camp David presidential retreat,
where in 1978 Israel and Egypt struck a peace deal, by meeting separately with
each leader. Arafat first, then Barak.

Congress May Receive Pay Raise
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no discussion, a House subcommittee opened the door
late Tuesday to giving members of Congress their latest cost-of-living pay
raise. Lawmakers' current $141,300 salaries would be raised by 2.7 percent, or
$3,800, and take effect next January, officials said. It would be their third
increase in four years. The first step toward approving the increase came as a
subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee approved a $29.1 billion
measure financing the Treasury Department and other agencies for the coming
fiscal year.

Negotiator Implicated in Massacre

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Bosnia's U.N. ambassador implicated top international
negotiator Carl Bildt Tuesday in the failure to defend the U.N. ''safe haven''
of Srebrenica. Bildt countered that Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey's recollection
of their meeting on July 11, 1995, as Srebrenica was falling was wrong. And he
reiterated that the U.N. Security Council was primarily to blame for not
providing enough troops to defend the enclave in eastern Bosnia. Starting on
that fateful July 11 Bosnian Serb forces overran Srebrenica, which was
designated a U.N.-protected zone.

marching past Catholic areas. In Portadown, a town southwest of Belfast that's
the epicenter of this month's violence, police fired plastic bullets and water
canon at the rioters. Police said eight people were arrested. One policeman, one

New Water Pollution Rules Imposed

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration Tuesday imposed new pollution

industrial pollution. ''This is the single most important program we can adopt
to address the remaining water pollution problems in this country,'' said Carol
Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. President Clinton
called it ''a critical, common-sense step to ensure clean, safe water for all
Americans.''

Tobacco Cos. Fight Back
</SUBHEAD>

   MIAMI (AP) -- A tobacco attorney said Tuesday a verdict of $154 billion in
punitive damages would bankrupt the nation's five biggest cigarette makers 10
times over. He spoke during closing arguments in a state case involving up to
700,000 sick Florida smokers. ''That's a request for a death warrant for each of
these five companies,'' said Dan Webb, who represents Philip Morris Inc., the
nation's No. 1 cigarette maker. The first smokers' class-action lawsuit to go to
trial represents what could be the gravest legal threat to the industry.

<HEADLINE> Duke: Maggette Took Cash From Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Former Duke player Corey Maggette admitted
he took cash payments from a summer league coach while he was still
a high school student.
</P>
<P>
   The sworn statement, announced by Duke officials Tuesday, was
sent to the U.S. Attorney in Kansas City and the NCAA, which could
order Duke to vacate its runner-up finish in the 1999 NCAA
tournament for using an ineligible player.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has not yet reviewed the statement, a spokeswoman said
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette, an all-state selection at Fenwick High School in Oak
Park, Ill., previously denied accepting money from Myron Piggie,
his summer league coach for a Kansas City-based team.
</P>
<P>
   The statement ''raises substantial questions about his
eligibility to play for the Blue Devils during the 1998-99
season,'' Duke executive vice president Tallman Trask III said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette left Duke after his freshman year and was selected by
the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round of the 1999 draft, and
later traded to the Orlando Magic. He was traded again last month
to the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Duke requested the statement to resolve questions about his
eligibility after allegations surfaced that he accepted $2,000 from
Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and faces 3-5 years
in prison for paying Maggette and four other players on his Kansas
City-based team $35,500 from 1996-98. The players were in high
school at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Duke officials said they were not aware of the payments, but the
admission jeopardizes the school's basketball program. In addition
to possibly forfeiting the second-place title, Duke also might have
to return up to $226,815 in tournament revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly this is not what we wanted to hear, but we are pleased
at least we have the facts now,'' Duke spokesman Al Rossiter Jr.
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the NCAA is to see if rules were violated, not
if Duke tried to cover up the payments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials had no comment Tuesday night about the statement,
but spokeswoman Jane Jankowski said there is a precedent for
situations in which an ineligible athlete played in a postseason
game and the university was unaware of the violations.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the university has to return 45 percent of its
game revenue and give up the title it won, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jankowski said officials were to review the statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly we weren't aware of it,'' Rossiter said. ''The issue
is was this in fact a violation of NCAA rules and what do they do
about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was told of the statement but had no
comment, sports information director Jon Jackson said. Krzyzewski
has also denied knowledge of the payments.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment against Piggie claimed he paid the
players in exchange for agreements that they would pay him once
they received pro contracts and signed endorsement deals. It also
said he used the players to secure money from a booster and Nike.
</P>
<P>
   The other players were JaRon Rush of UCLA; his brother, Kareem,
of Missouri; Korleone Young, who entered the NBA draft without
playing in college; and Andre Williams of Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   A federal hearing in the case was scheduled for Wednesday in
Kansas City. But U.S. Attorney officials said they expected it to
be canceled.

<HEADLINE> Missing All-Stars Disappoint Fans  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Five hundred dollars for this?
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Holcomb family of North Myrtle Beach, S.C., was
wondering as they milled around the plaza at Turner Field at
Tuesday's All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   They had plunked down $500 for four seats scattered all over the
stadium. And as they went over the list of players who backed out
of the game because of injuries, they said they felt cheated.
</P>
<P>
   The only mention of Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr., Cal Ripken
and Mike Piazza was a quick rundown of injured players announced
over the public-address system after the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really disappointing that the star players aren't here,''
Roger Holcomb said, gesturing to his 7-year-old son, Drew. ''He
can't see McGwire, Griffey, the players he knows. He doesn't know
Ivan Rodriguez, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   A record eight players who were selected as All-Stars missed the
game. Barry Bonds, Greg Maddux, Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez
all sat out.
</P>
<P>
   Holcomb said he understood that injuries are a part of the game.
But he wondered why Griffey, who finished second to Sammy Sosa in
the Home Run Derby exhibition Monday night, couldn't muster the
strength to play a few innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not to say any of these players aren't injured,'' Holcomb
said. ''But if he can hit in the Home Run Derby, he can hit in the
All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves fan Sandra Miller of Marietta, Ga., said she was pulling
for the National League, which lost to the AL 6-3. But she said
strong performances by Braves on the NL team made the game
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been here all three days -- the Futures game, the Home Run
Derby and now this,'' she said. ''That Chipper Jones home run was
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, fans in the crowd of 51,323 filing out of Turner Field
said the game was missing considerable star power because of the
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   James Ward, 17, of Chicago, was upset that McGwire didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least Barry Bonds showed up, and his thumb was hurting,''
Ward said. ''I think it was just because he wanted a vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Lindbergh and his 9-year-old son, Will, drove from
Anniston, Ala., with four family members to see the Home Run Derby
and the All-Star game -- at $900 a person. The tickets were a gift,
but Lindbergh said that didn't make the letdown any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should at least sign autographs during the game if
they're hurt,'' Lindbergh said. ''Don't they make enough money that
they could give us some autographs?''
</P>
<P>
   And power hitters weren't the only ones missing.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fan Will Bacic, 15, made the trip from Norfolk, Mass.
His team's signature player, Pedro Martinez, was the American
League's presumed starter until he was lifted a week before the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed about Pedro not pitching,'' he said as he and
six friends piled out of a limousine that one of their mothers had
rented for them. ''But I guess you've got to give the other guys a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the other guys was David Wells of the Toronto Blue Jays,
the AL starter. And that was fine with Scott Mackenzie of the
Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody, who wore a Blue Jays cap to the park.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that McGwire's absence allowed Atlanta's Andres
Galarraga, who missed all of last season with lymphoma, to start at
first base. And when catcher Piazza of the Mets was hit by a Roger
Clemens pitch in New York, it cleared the way for Jason Kendall of
the Pittsburgh Pirates, forced by injury to sit out most of 1999,
to start behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga ''deserves it with what he's done,'' Mackenzie said.
''It's fun in a way, and it's great for those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said this All-Star game, which has come to be called the
''All-Scar game,'' was something of a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame,'' he said, ''but it's also a great story.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nearly 200 fire and rescue workers combed
through debris Tuesday night, looking for three people believed to
be trapped inside two small collapsed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A building fell at 7:50 p.m. and took much of an adjacent

<HEADLINE> Philippines Garbage Slide Kills 108  </HEADLINE>
By PAT ROQUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Backhoes dug through mounds of
blackened, stinking refuse and workers pulled corpse after corpse
from the filth Tuesday, a day after a wall of garbage collapsed in
Manila's main dump, crushing a collection of shacks and killing at
least 108 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for survivors continued, relatives of the missing
sat weeping and waiting for their loved ones' bodies to emerge from
the acres of trash that buried them. Several black bags with
unclaimed bodies lay on an open basketball court. Estimates of the
number of people still missing ranged from 72 to 300.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have lost hope, but even if they are dead, I still want to
see them,'' said Gemma Espenilla, whose son, mother and grandfather
were buried in the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Wilson Carpio was awaiting word on his wife, two
children and seven nieces and nephews, all feared buried under the
garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the Land of Hell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were poor people who lived in an area called the
Promised Land -- a group of huts and lean-tos near Payatas, a
municipal dump with garbage piled as high as seven stories in some
places. Impoverished squatters, including many children, live in
the area and pick through the dump to collect items they can sell.
</P>
<P>
   A chunk of that mountain of garbage, weakened by a typhoon that
swept through the Philippines last week, thundered down onto the
shacks Monday, then burst into flame. The collapsed debris
apparently ignited from fallen power cables or stoves in the huts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the night and into Tuesday, rescuers dug through the
rotting trash using shovels and two backhoes. But they were
hampered by the stench and a lack of equipment, including reliable
lighting. Plastic and other non-biodegradable refuse also made it
difficult for the hundreds of volunteers and soldiers to dig
through the collapsed section of garbage, which covers an area the
size of four basketball courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost impossible to get anybody alive at this time,
after 24 hours,'' said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who also
heads the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six of the 59 people pulled alive from the debris earlier
were taken to hospitals with injuries, and more than 800 people
whose houses and shanties were destroyed or threatened were given
shelter in nearby schools and churches. At one shelter, Clarita
Garduque sat on the floor in shock, unable even to eat after losing
seven of her nine children.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada quickly promised a safer garbage system
for Manila, the Philippines' capital. He promised that bidding
would be held next week for a new city waste management system that
would no longer simply dump unprocessed garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's high time to come up with a national policy on solid
waste management,'' Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow people to live so dangerously under the shadow
of death in this dump site,'' Mercado said. ''We should have
implemented the law much more strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump, along with a former dump in Manila's Tondo
slum district called Smokey Mountain, have long symbolized the
wrenching poverty in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, ordered Smokey Mountain
closed in the mid-1990s and built apartment buildings at the former
eyesore. The Payatas dump site was to be closed permanently last
December, but the plan was postponed until later this year because
residents near a landfill in nearby Rizal province refused to allow
waste from metropolitan Manila to be dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have tried in recent years to relocate the
hundreds of scavengers living around the Payatas site, but most
have refused to move. On Tuesday, officials were considering
demolishing shanties along narrow streets around the dump to make
way for bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   The pope sent a condolence message to the families of the
victims, noting they were ''among the poorest of the world.'' He
expressed hope that the survivors would receive the assistance
''which their human dignity demands.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Milk Maker Halts Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's biggest maker of dairy products will
suspend production nationwide on Wednesday to inspect its factories
after thousands of people were sickened by tainted milk.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand Milk Products Co. will halt operations at its 21
factories across the nation, Executive Vice President Akihiko
Sasajima said at a news conference Tuesday night. The suspension
was expected to last for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand was forced to recall its milk products after more
than 11,000 people fell ill in Japan's worst case of food poisoning
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria accumulated in a production-line valve caused the
outbreak, which started when residents began suffering diarrhea and
vomiting after drinking lowfat milk.
</P>
<P>
   The staphylococcus aureus bacteria, or staph, can sicken people
with a weakened immune system but is usually not lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Snow Brand Milk President Tetsuro Ishikawa apologized to
consumers and said he would resign on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Police have begun investigating the possibility of criminal
negligence.

<HEADLINE> Liam Neeson Injured in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITHGOW, N.Y. (AP) -- Actor Liam Neeson suffered a broken pelvis
Tuesday when his motorcycle collided with a deer near his home,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, 48, was riding his 1989 Harley Davidson motorcycle
around noon when a deer jumped into the road, according to the
Dutchess County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, who was wearing his helmet, was thrown from the
motorcycle just before it ran into a tree about 70 miles north of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated Irish actor suffered a fractured right
pelvis, a chipped left pelvis, and multiple leg abrasions. He was
taken to a Connecticut hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told that he's in good condition and that he's resting
comfortably,'' said Alan Nierob, Neeson's publicist. ''We're
expecting a quick recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman Staats of Hyde Park was driving his truck when he spotted
Neeson lying on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   ''He managed to crawl his way up back to the road,'' Staats
said. ''He wanted me to drive him back to his house right up the
road, but I could tell his hips were bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of
Oskar Schindler in the 1993 epic ''Schindler's List.'' He has
starred in ''Stars Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace'' and ''Rob
Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson married actress Natasha Richardson in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies said the deer died shortly after the
accident.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Lisa Harrison scored a career-high 22 points to
lead the Phoenix Mercury over the Minnesota Lynx 64-54 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury beat the Lynx in the season series, 2-1, taking a
2&AMP;frac12;-game lead in the race for the final Western Conference playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Reed had 12 points, and Jennifer Gillom and Tonya Edwards
had nine each as the Mercury (12-6) won their third straight.
Gillom played 31 minutes in her first action since spraining her
left ankle July 2 at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Smith, who was 1-for-7 in the first half, scored 19 of her
24 points in the second, but couldn't prevent the Lynx (10-9) from
losing their season-high fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the WNBA's No. 2 scorer, hit a 3-pointer 33 seconds into
the second half. Midway through the half, she made three straight
baskets, one a 3-pointer, and the Lynx closed within 47-43 with
8:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mercury pulled away with free throws, including two by
Harrison, who was 12-of-13 from the line and 5-of-7 from the field.
Harrison also had a season-high eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury never trailed, using a 10-2 spurt to take a 29-17
lead with 3:30 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix maintained the 12-point edge, 36-24, at halftime when
Michelle Cleary made a 3-pointer with 59 seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Jeter Named MVP at All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Derek Jeter turned the All-Star game into just
another night of ''New York, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   After he doubled in the first inning for the American League's
first extra-base hit in two years, his two-run single off the Mets'
Al Leiter broke a fourth-inning tie, sending the AL on to a 6-3 win
Tuesday night over the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who went 3-for-3, became the first Yankee ever to win the
All-Star MVP trophy -- and he wasn't even supposed to start!
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not ready to be ranked alongside Ruth, Gehrig,
DiMaggio, Mantle and Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to play for a lot of years before you can be
considered a Yankee great,'' he said. ''I've only played four
years. This is my fifth. Hopefully, I can play for a few more
years, then start that debate.''
</P>
<P>
   He doubled in the first off Randy Johnson, singled in the third
off Kevin Brown and scored the game's first run, then got the
go-ahead kid in the fourth. His bat went straight to the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you mention his name, you got to think of the Yankees,''
said AL manager Joe Torre, also Jeter's manager in New York. ''If
there ever was a young kid that even the veteran players look to,
it's Derek Jeter. It's a very, very proud time for the New York
Yankees. Their future did a great job tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has three of the Yankees' 25 World Series rings, the
1996 AL Rookie of the Year Award and now this.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if he played here, he'd be the first player to hit
.500,'' said Atlanta's Chipper Jones, who also went 3-for-3. ''It's
good to see no one else in the National League can get him out
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last Friday, Jeter got a two-strike, first-inning single
off Leiter, scoring the first run in the Yankees' 2-0 win over
their crosstown foe -- a rivalry that turned bitter the next night
when the Yankees' Roger Clemens beaned Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter hit .407 against the Mets this year, going 11-for-27 with
six runs scored and is a .327 hitter (25-for-77) against them in
his career. The single off Leiter came on a first-pitch cut
fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does it every time I face him. I try to lay off it,'' Jeter
said. ''I didn't hit it well, I just hit it in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter didn't have any thoughts of brushing Jeter back in
retaliation for Clemens' pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeter didn't do anything,'' Leiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, neither did Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just the recipient,'' Leiter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, just 26, already is a three-time All-Star. In his
previous two All-Star at-bats, he struck out both times.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the start because Seattle's Alex Rodriguez sustained a
concussion last weekend, Jeter wanted to swing at first pitches and
not fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in his charmed life, he came through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's very proud, even though many times he doesn't show
much,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and the Yankees love playing in Atlanta, winning the first
two games of last year's World Series at Turner Field and sweeping
three games at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1996 as they
overcame a 2-0 deficit to win what turned out to be the first of
three Series titles in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played some very important big games here,'' Jeter said.
''I guess it's just good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year of struggle for both Jeter, who spent 2&AMP;frac12; weeks
on the disabled list with an abdominal strain, and the Yankees, who
lead the AL East by mere percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   They hope beating the Mets three times in four games started
their turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to win,'' Jeter said. ''We made it look kind of
easy three out of the last four years. But it's very difficult to
do year after year.''

<HEADLINE> AL 6, NL 3  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Midsummer Classic looked a lot like the Fall
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and Chipper Jones provided the pop in an All-Star
game missing most of baseball's marquee names, and the American
League beat the Nationals 6-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a duel they usually save for October, the Yankees shortstop
and the Atlanta third baseman both went a perfect 3-for-3. But just
like their meetings in the 1996 and 1999 World Series, Jeter's team
beat Jones' club.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing for the managers -- Joe Torre won again in his matchup
against Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ''That really is a shocker. Derek Jeter stealing all the
headlines,'' Jones deadpanned. ''It's good to see no one else in
the National League can get him out, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter became the first Yankees player ever to win the All-Star
MVP award. After the game, his bat was already headed to the Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played some very important big games here against the
Braves, obviously in the postseason, regular season, now this game
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team has been successful here. Maybe we seem to focus a
bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter hit .353 against the Braves in last year's World Series.
Last month, he tied his career high with four hits in a game at
Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   On a humid night that needed some juice -- and maybe a juiced
ball with the likes of Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike
Piazza sidelined -- the AL won its fourth in a row and for the 10th
time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   James Baldwin got the victory and Al Leiter took the loss as the
AL cut its overall deficit to 40-30-1. The AL broke open the game
with three runs in the ninth, highlighted by Matt Lawton's single.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, starting because good friend Alex Rodriguez was injured,
doubled off Randy Johnson in the first inning, then singled and
scored against Kevin Brown in third.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter's two-run single in the fourth put the AL ahead 3-1. That
hit came against Leiter of the Mets in a reprise of last weekend's
Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been watching that ever since he came to the big
leagues,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did his best to make the 51,323 fans forget that Barry
Bonds, Cal Ripken, Manny Ramirez and Greg Maddux also were
sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Jones became the 13th player to hit a home run in his own park
at an All-Star game, connecting off Baldwin in the third. He also
singled twice, one of them off starter David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Jones may get another chance to meet in October, as
both of their teams went into the break in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very, very proud time for the New York Yankees,'' Torre
said. ''Their future did a great job tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the All-Stars visited Atlanta in 1972, Hank Aaron
also homered for the hometown Braves. Aaron threw out the
ceremonial first ball this time, and received a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest ovation, by far, went to Andres Galarraga. The
Braves first baseman, who missed last season while recovering from
cancer surgery, got a standing ovation when he was introduced and
later rewarded his rooters with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a record seven starters unable to play, Maddux hurt
and 1999 All-Star MVP Pedro Martinez not even on the roster because
of an injury, this summer showcase was minus some sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The seven missing starters were batting a combined .301 with 160
home runs this season and had totaled 66 All-Star appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Big Unit himself, threw only eight pitches in
working a perfect first inning. Then again, he threw 121 Sunday
while striking out 13 as Arizona beat Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson finished off his third All-Star start by
striking out Jason Giambi, whom he faced two days ago in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Wells pitched two scoreless innings. And, unlike the games that
really count, there were no beanballs or brushbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The AL took a 1-0 lead in the third when Brown walked three
batters, including Carl Everett with the bases loaded. Jones tied
it with his opposite-field homer in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Barry Larkin set up Jeter's go-ahead single in the
fourth. Playing in his third All-Star game and making his first
start, Jeter had never gotten a hit in these affairs -- he had
struck out in his previous two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The AL tacked on three runs in the ninth off Trevor Hoffman on
Lawton's RBI single, Magglio Ordonez's sacrifice fly and Darin
Erstad's RBI grounder, a ball misplayed by second baseman Jose
Vidro for an error.
</P>
<P>
   An error set up Steve Finley's RBI single off Mariano Rivera in
the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Torre joined Tony La Russa and Tommy Lasorda as the only
managers to win their first three All-Star games. Cox is 1-4. ... A
total of 22 future Hall of Famers took part in the 1972 game at
Atlanta. Before that game, there was a hit, pitch and run
competition for kids. The winner? Jeff Hornacek, then 9, a future
NBA All-Star. ... This All-Star game originally was awarded to
Miami. But uncertainty over the Florida Marlins' franchise prompted
baseball officials to move it to Atlanta. ... Next year's All-Star
game will be at Safeco Field in Seattle. Miller Park in Milwaukee
and Comiskey Park in Chicago will play host to the following two
games. ... This also was the first All-Star game without league
presidents, those positions having been done away with. And there
were no AL or NL umpires this time, either. All umpires are now
considered major league umpires.

<HEADLINE> NBA Player Sam Mack Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX, Ill. (AP) -- Sam Mack, released by the Golden State
Warriors in March, was arrested Tuesday after officers said they
found 19 bags of marijuana in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, a 6-foot-7 swingman, ran a stop sign, prompting a
high-speed chase through Phoenix, Ill., a Chicago suburb, Lt.
Vernon Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, 30, refused to pull over and led police on a chase that
began at 7 p.m. EDT and reached speeds of 70 mph on city streets
where the speed limit is 25 mph, Mitchell said. After about six
blocks, police forced Mack to pull over his Range Rover and
arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana was found in Mack's vehicle, along with a
rock-like substance that will be analyzed to determine if it is a
drug, Mitchell said. A small weight scale also was found, along
with $2,800 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mack played six years in the NBA, including stints with San
Antonio, Houston, Vancouver and Golden State.

<HEADLINE> Big Moments Bring Out Best in Wells  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- David Wells didn't dominate the National League
like Pedro Martinez did a year ago in the All-Star game. Yet, he
was every bit as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Sent out to start a big game once again by Joe Torre, Wells met
the challenge, pitching two scoreless innings Tuesday night as the
American League beat the National League, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy the spotlight for the fact that I'm not afraid to
fail,'' said Wells, making his second All-Star start. ''I want to
be the hero. If I lose, I can accept that as well. When you go out
there, a lot of guys can't accept failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells doesn't fail often. He leads the majors with 15 wins at
the All-Star break for Toronto and has a 3.44 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't allowed a run in 4 1-3 innings in three All-Star
appearances and helped lead the New York Yankees to a World Series
title in 1998 by going 4-0 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   That was one reason why Torre, Wells' manager for two seasons in
New York, picked his former ace to start on the big stage.
</P>
<P>
   The two even chatted in the AL dugout about how Wells should
approach his at-bat. Torre told Wells, ''Just take three,'' so the
pitcher wouldn't hurt himself swinging for the fences.
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance to bat and left the game unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the second inning, I felt a wet kiss on my cheek,''
Torre said. ''It was Wells saying goodbye and thanking me for the
opportunity to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was his usual efficient self. He threw 23 of 27 pitches
for strikes, including the first pitch to all eight batters, and
was touched for just a pair of singles.
</P>
<P>
   It sure didn't rival Martinez blowing away the first four
batters and five of six overall last year at Fenway Park, but the
results were nearly the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get ahead in the count, you can throw anything up
there,'' said Wells, who has walked just 18 batters in 128 1-3
innings this season. ''If you show you've got command of your
pitches, they can't sit on a certain pitch. I had a good curveball
working tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He used that pitch to freeze two All-Stars for third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   One night after Sammy Sosa dazzled the Turner Field crowd with
his majestic shots hit to the farthest part of the stadium in the
Home Run Derby, he could only watch a third strike from Wells to
end the first.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to understand that you're facing some of the All-Star
pitching, too. Good pitches are going to stop good hitters,'' Sosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kendall went down the same way in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get these guys with their bats on their shoulders,
it's a nice feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' recent success has been especially sweet because the
Yankees gave up on him before the 1999 season. They traded him to
Toronto in a package for five-time Cy Young winner Roger Clemens in
spring training amid questions about his conditioning and
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was devastated by the trade, forcing him out of the city
that embraced him and the limelight he loved so much. All he's done
since is go 32-12 while Clemens is 20-16.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clemens is back home enjoying a three-day break, Wells
was once again back in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an adversarial relationship for a while,'' Torre said.
''We had our arguments, but it got to the point where we respected
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells' only disappointment on the day was not getting a chance
to take his hacks at the plate. He was on-deck when the top of the
second inning ended. But Travis Fryman struck out, and Wells was
removed for a pinch-hitter in the third.
</P>
<P>
   What would he have done if he got the chance to hit?
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably gone deep,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he thought better of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, probably struck out -- knowing me,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Braves Do Well at All-Star Game  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The home team gave the home fans plenty of
reasons to cheer at the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had three hits, including a homer. Andruw Jones
drove in a run. Tom Glavine pitched a scoreless inning. And, best
of all, Andres Galarraga made an emotional, triumphant return to
the midsummer classic as a cancer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was exciting to play in front of our crowd,'' said Andruw
Jones, appearing in his first All-Star game. ''We went out there to
do good. We didn't just go out there to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that didn't go according to plan was a
National League victory. Led by game MVP and perennial Braves
killer Derek Jeter -- of the hated New York Yankees, no less -- the
American League won 6-3 Tuesday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hometown players had no reason to be ashamed. They
accounted for five of the NL's nine hits and drove in two-thirds of
the runs. For good measure, Glavine cruised through a 1-2-3 fifth.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, manager Bobby Cox seemed justified in having
five of his own players on the NL squad, more than any other team.
The fifth, Greg Maddux, couldn't pitch because of a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''All week long, you hear people questioning Bobby's picks,''
said Chipper Jones, who became the 13th player to hit an All-Star
homer in his home park. ''There's not a guy out there tonight
wearing a Braves uniform that doesn't deserve to be on that club.
It just backs our manager's picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who was 1-for-2 before leaving the game for a
pinch-runner in the fourth, received the biggest cheers from the
51,323 fans, many of them adorned in red, white, blue and
tomahawks. The Big Cat has been one of baseball's most
inspirational figures after missing all of last season for
treatment of a cancerous tumor in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's persevered through a lot in his career and he's
persevered through a lot in life,'' Chipper Jones said. ''It all
came together tonight, standing on his own field at the All-Star
game. This had to be a defining moment for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman received a standing ovation when he was
announced as a starter in the pregame ceremony, accompanied by his
three children. The fans rose from their seats again when he came
to bat in the second, and still another after he lined out to left.
</P>
<P>
   The final salute came when Galarraga singled to center and was
replaced at the bag by Todd Helton. Each time, the 39-year-old
tipped his hat or helmet to the crowd, flashed his trademark smile
and struggled to cope with his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's probably no words to explain how happy, how excited I
am feeling today,'' he said. ''That's a great moment in my career
in baseball -- walk on the field with my kids, and the ovation they
gave to me, the fans here in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had played in four previous All-Star games, failing to
get a hit in six at-bats. This was his first start, albeit as a
replacement for the injured Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting my first hit today in the All-Star game makes it more
special,'' Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, meanwhile, followed in the footsteps of Hank
Aaron, who hit a hometown homer in the city's first All-Star game
28 years ago at the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, now a
parking lot beyond Turner's left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Jones jumped on a 2-0 fastball from James Baldwin
of the Chicago White Sox, lining it into the bleachers in deep
left-center field. Last year's NL MVP also singled in the first and
fifth innings before his night was done.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awesome,'' said Jones, the fan's choice as the starting
third baseman. ''I mean, it's every little boy's dream. I've said
it so many times this week -- it's not very often that a player gets
to play on his home field in the All-Star game, much less start.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, ''to go out there and hit a home run, it was just awesome.
I can't explain it. It was something I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones nearly matched his total from the Home Run Derby the
previous night, when he managed to hit only two homers out of the
park while being eliminated in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pretty relaxed,'' he said. ''The home run contest was a
lot more nerve-racking than the game. When you're out there playing
the game, that's your domain. That's where I feel most
comfortable.''

<HEADLINE> Two Buildings Collapse in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two small residential buildings collapsed
Tuesday night and rescue workers combed through a mound of debris
looking for three missing people.
</P>
<P>
   One dwelling fell and took much of an attached structure with
it. Both buildings are small, one- or two-unit homes. The
buildings, on a quiet residential street, collapsed into a pile of
brick and wood about one-and-a-half stories high.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs brought to the scene indicated there may be people trapped
inside, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. Giuliani said six people lived
in the two buildings; three had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cause of the accident was not immediately known, the
mayor said a gas explosion might have caused it. KeySpan Energy
workers examined pipes outside the buildings and found no evidence
of a gas leak, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the first building collapsed without breaking,
making it more difficult for rescue workers to get underneath and
look for survivors, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said.
Cameras were also being used to see under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a pretty flat pancake situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said witnesses saw people enter the buildings before
the accident. Rescue workers said the missing people were the
owners of one building and a tenant in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Dinham, who works at a residential drug treatment
facility across the street from the collapse, said he heard an
explosion ''just like a bomb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I came outside, all I could see was smoke in the air,'' Dinham
said. ''The windows moved, the place shook.''
</P>
<P>
   Two firefighters were treated for minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Shakes Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook Indonesia's
Java and Sumatra islands Wednesday morning, destroying dozens of
houses and causing many people to flee their homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of injury in the 8:10 a.m.
quake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 5.1.
</P>
<P>
   The temblor's epicenter was in the Sunda Strait between Java and
Sumatra islands, and 20 miles below the sea floor, according to the
state Meteorological and Geophysics Agency in Sukabumi town in west
Java.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said dozens of houses had been totally destroyed in
Caringin Kulon village and the surrounding region, several other
homes had been badly damaged and phone lines were down.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Sukabumi said hundreds of people fled their houses.
''It was very strong. Everyone ran out of their houses afraid,''
said Hindun, a housewife who like many Indonesians only uses one
name.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's temblor comes only a month after a massive 7.9
magnitude quake shook parts of Sumatra island, killing more than
100 people and leaving thousands homeless.

<HEADLINE> Population in Bombay Increasing  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- To Laxmi Annaya, Bombay was the answer to
her dreams. To people who live in this teeming city, India's
largest, migrants like her are the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of newcomers to Bombay are being blamed for driving up
the city's population, pushing it from the world's fifth most
populated city today to becoming the second by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son and daughter can speak English. They will work in an
office. That is my dream,'' said Annaya, 38, who works as a maid
and earns $70 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I work less than I would have in the fields at home, but I
earn more,'' she said. ''So what if I live in a slum?''
</P>
<P>
   Annaya came to Bombay as a bride 15 years ago and says her two
children would never have been able to attend English-language
schools in her hometown in southern India.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 million people as of 1995, Bombay ranks in population
behind Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York, and Mexico City, United Nations
statistics say.
</P>
<P>
   But Bombay's population will reach 27.37 million in 15 years,
placing it just behind Tokyo, which will have 28.7 million,
according to U.N. projections released during a Berlin conference
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations predicted that of 27 mega-cities, with 10
million or more people, 18 will be in Asia. In anticipation of
World Population Day, which was Tuesday, the report warns of the
urgency to manage space and improve transport systems in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the people who live in Bombay sleep on the
sidewalks or live in cramped brick and tin huts that line the
streets. Many are drawn to India's financial and entertainment
industry capital by an old migrant maxim: ''No one in Bombay sleeps
on an empty stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Most find jobs as daily wage workers at housing and road
construction sites or sell wares ranging from hair clips to potato
chips in crowded trains. Others beg.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's infrastructure is struggling to cope with
escalating demands for water, health, housing, transport and
education. Tankers carrying water trundle along potholed roads to
thousands of buildings where there is not enough public water.
</P>
<P>
   The situation worsens during the monsoon, when small lanes and
shanties built alongside high-rise buildings are flooded with
filthy water due to choked drains.
</P>
<P>
   The city has asked the federal government for a 10-year package
of $3.14 billion to upgrade Bombay's services, said the municipal
commissioner, V. Ranganathan.
</P>
<P>
   Land is a problem, as is maintaining sanitary facilities, ''due
to continuous migration into Bombay,'' Ranganathan said. The city's
100-year-old storm drains need to be urgently mended, he said, as
they clog during heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   More than 6.5 million people jostle for space in packed
state-run trains and buses, suffering through an average 3-hour
daily work commute. Plans by the administration to attract
corporations to satellite townships and suburbs failed due to
shoddy construction and an absence of amenities.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored family planning programs are hindered by
illiteracy and high infant mortality rates. Many people either
don't understand the information or aren't interested in limiting
the number of babies they have since so many die young.
</P>
<P>
   While municipal workers boast that 60 percent of Bombay's
residents are covered by family planning programs, they say the
rising population is the fault of the migrant slum population and
rural poor who flock to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Nitai Mehta, founder of Praja, a volunteer organization that
works with city officers, says migration is caused by lopsided
development that makes Bombay attractive and deprives countryside
dwellers of amenities and ways to earn their living.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do people live near sewage lines in Bombay? Because they
are driven out of their villages,'' said Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   He said friction between rich and poor is on the rise, as is
frustration. ''The smallest incident can spark a violent
reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanty dwellers resisted recent attempts to remove unauthorized
constructions from parks and near railway lines. Municipal
demolition squads are now accompanied by armed police for
protection against stone- and brick-throwing migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Some who work in the slums have a dismal view of the city's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''People come here to work because in Bombay they can do any odd
job anywhere and their stomach can be filled,'' said Vimal Bhagwat,
a municipal midwife. ''But in a few years there will not be any
place to walk on the streets. There will be so many people and
huts.''

<HEADLINE> Liam Neeson injured in motorcycle accident  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITHGOW, N.Y. (AP) - Actor Liam Neeson suffered a broken pelvis
after his motorcycle collided with a deer near his home,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, 48, was riding his 1989 Harley Davidson motorcycle
around noon Tuesday when a deer jumped into the road, according to
the Dutchess County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, who was wearing his helmet, was thrown from the
motorcycle and landed in an earth embankment just before it ran
into a tree about 70 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-nominated Irish actor suffered a fractured right
pelvis, a chipped left pelvis, and multiple leg abrasions. He was
taken to Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn., a nursing supervisor
confirmed, but she refused to release any information on his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm told that he's in good condition and that he's resting
comfortably,'' said Alan Nierob, Neeson's publicist. ''We're
expecting a quick recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman Staats of Hyde Park was driving his truck when he spotted
Neeson lying on the roadside and alerted emergency response crews.
</P>
<P>
   ''He managed to crawl his way up back to the road,'' Staats
said. ''He wanted me to drive him back to his house right up the
road, but I could tell his hips were bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson, who married actress Natasha Richardson in 1994 at their
Town of Washington home, is among Hollywood's top leading men.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of
Oskar Schindler in the 1993 epic ''Schindler's List.'' He has
starred in ''Stars Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace'' and ''Rob
Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies said the deer initially ran off, but died
nearby a short time after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson and Richardson are among a host of celebrities who call
Dutchess County home, including actors Mary Tyler Moore, Eddie
Murphy and James Earl Jones, as well as singers Natalie Merchant
and Pete Seeger.
</P>
<P>
   A former teenage boxer, Neeson was born in the town of Ballymena
in Northern Ireland on June 7, 1952.

<HEADLINE> Aerial Surveillance in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- On a moonlit night, British soldiers
on a hilltop near this northeastern Kosovo town peer into screens,
watching vehicles and people moving about dozens of miles away as
clearly as if it were day.
</P>
<P>
   Along with German and American forces, 22 Battery of the 32
Royal Artillery Regiment, based in Larkhar, England, operates one
of several unmanned airborne surveillance systems available to
NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British Phoenix system, like its U.S. and German
counterparts, allows the NATO-led Kosovo Force to watch for
violations of the June 1999 agreement, under which international
troops replaced Yugoslav soldiers and police following the 78-day
Allied bombing campaign of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   British officers refused to say whether the Phoenix, an
aluminum-colored aircraft with a 15-foot wingspan that looks like a
giant model plane, is used along the control zone that separates
Kosovo from the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at 70 mph at an altitude of about 2,300 feet, the
Phoenix is mounted with cameras that send back real time video from
as far as 1.2 miles from the plane itself, a capability that could
be used to keep track of any Yugoslav forces near the boundary.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pictures are real-time, the images can alert troops on
the ground to suspicious activity, such as ethnic Albanian
extremists trying to transport illegal weapons by night. The
cameras can make out individuals on the ground but not their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Crews operating from a truck at a remote hillside about three
miles from the boundary with Serbia can track the Phoenix's
location and provide precise grid coordinates of any suspicious
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Sebastian Heath, commander of 22 Battery, said the
real-time nature of the system means ground troops can respond
instantly. Heath said the Phoenix was used during last month's NATO
raids on secret ethnic Albanian weapons stockpiles in central
Kosovo, which NATO commanders described as the biggest illegal
weapons cache uncovered since the end of fighting last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see them moving about so that we could say 'in that
building there are people you need to get your hands on,''' Heath
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO obtained mixed results from unmanned surveillance aircraft
during the Kosovo war. Yugoslavia reported, and the alliance
confirmed, that a number were brought down by ground fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors on the Lynx or Gazelle helicopters are believed to be
more detailed than those on the Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, however, where the threat of hostile fire is minimal,
the aircraft expands NATO's ability to keep watch and serves as a
deterrent to those seeking to violate the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the unit during a night operation Tuesday,
reporters could see vehicles traveling down a darkened road west of
Pristina as well as people crossing a field on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy it,'' said Bombadier Andrew Friendship, a 12-year
veteran whose job is to track the aircraft's course. ''We had an
old drone system before which only produced pictures after two
hours. This is instantaneous, live.''

Russian Proton-K Rocket Lifts Off
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) -- The Russian Proton-K rocket that is carrying the
long-delayed International Space Station's service module into orbit lifted off
Wednesday from the Baikonur cosmodrome. At Mission Control outside Moscow,
Russian and U.S. space agency officials anxiously monitored a live feed from the
cosmodrome broadcast on their console video screens. A huge screen in front of
them displayed the countdown at the cosmodrome on the remote, windswept steppes
of Kazakstan. Technicians pulled back the launch tower from the huge rocket
about half an hour before the 8:56 a.m. liftoff.

new willingness by long-reclusive North Korea to discuss defense issues and the
latest failed test for a U.S. missile defense system aimed at stopping strikes

Congress May Receive Pay Raise

$3,800, and take effect next January, officials said. It would be their third

<HEADLINE> Death of Mexico's PRI Warned  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The party that has ruled Mexico for 71 years
is in danger of dying if it doesn't become more democratic, one of
the top candidates to take over the leadership of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party's dysfunctional state will turn to death if it tries
to foist off predisposed solutions on the membership,'' Roberto
Madrazo, a member of the party's old guard and governor of the Gulf
state of Tabasco, said in an open letter.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and others are pushing for a quick removal of current
leadership, and a return to the party's old, populist style.
</P>
<P>
   Another current within the party, known as the PRI, is pushing
to continue internal reforms that preceded its first defeat in a
presidential election since its formation in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader, defeated presidential candidate Francisco
Labastida, said Tuesday night in his first interview since the
elections, that he wouldn't seek the party presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Televisa TV network, Labastida was
conciliatory and upbeat, a stark contrast to his red-eyed
concession speech on election night.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say that he who spends his time looking backward ...
turns into a pillar of salt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said he planned to take some vacation, and perhaps
form ''some kind of foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo held a damage-control session with
about a dozen PRI governors to discuss the party's future Tuesday.
Traditionally, the president calls the shots in the PRI, but
Zedillo lost much of his influence after the electoral defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Current party President Dulce Maria Sauri pledged more democracy
-- including a secret ballot to elect congressional leaders -- but
urged a go-slow approach and said a national convention where
members could vent their frustrations would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and other old-guard party members are pushing for a
rapid convention and a new leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the party's traditional support groups -- unions,
neighborhood and farm groups -- say they have been locked out of
talks among the 21 PRI governors on how to reform the party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have really been sidelined. ... We want a more open
space,'' said congressman Carlos Sobrino, who heads the PRI's
Territorial Movement, a federation of low-income neighborhood
groups. ''We don't need a new leadership as much as a new party.''
</P>
<P>
   However, for some members of the PRI -- which gained a reputation
for corruption during its decades in power -- the defeat may bring
some benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get rid of some bad elements,'' former
ruling-party congresswoman Rosario Guerra told local news media,
because the party ''won't be giving out jobs, gifts or privileges
any more.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In 1994, John Shattuck, then the head of the
State Department's human rights bureau, was flying over Central
Africa and saw what he thought were hundreds of logs floating down
a river.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, he realized to his horror they were not
logs but corpses, victims of ethnic strife in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   What Shattuck saw on that spring day was merely the tip of the
iceberg of what may have been one of the fastest-paced genocides in
modern history -- some 800,000 dead in a matter of weeks, with Hutu
extremists preying on Tutsis and on Hutu moderates opposed to the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, questions persist as to whether the bloodshed
could have been halted or at least moderated. For the Clinton
administration, in particular, it is an issue that won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of finger-pointing is a report issued last
week by a seven-member panel created by the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the harshest criticism is directed at the United States.
The report acknowledges that the Clinton administration was wary
about involvement in Africa at the time because of the September
1993 debacle in Somalia, where 18 U.S. soldiers there on a
humanitarian intervention mission were killed in a firefight with
Somalis in downtown Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lewis, a member of the panel and a former Canadian
ambassador, said it was ''beyond belief that because of Somalia
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans needlessly lost their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how Madeleine Albright lives with it,'' he said.
At the time, the U.S. secretary of state was America's ambassador
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the report was released, Albright said she had
disagreed with White House policy during the genocide, while
refraining from saying what the policy was.
</P>
<P>
   In his newly published book, ''Madeleine Albright and the New
American Diplomacy,'' former Washington Post reporter Thomas
Lippman tries to shed light on where Albright and the White House
differed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House and many other people wanted the Security
Council to pass a resolution that would do something, anything,
toward stopping the killing,'' Lippman writes.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Albright knew that no American troops would be available
in the aftermath of the 1993 debacle in Somalia ... and that no
European countries wanted to contribute troops because of the
murders of Belgian peacekeepers at the outset of the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did not want to be a party to a hollow resolution that
would only expose the U.N.'s weakness, so she opposed any
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda genocide persisted through the spring of 1994 and
into early summer with no serious attempt to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, David Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for
war crimes, noted that what happened in Rwanda was far different
from the Nazi mass murders in Europe 60 years ago. It was a
victim-by-victim process, he recalled, ''with machete, club, hoe,
spear, automatic rifle or gasoline-fueled fire bonding executioner
and victim to within inches of one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether intervention by the United States or other countries
could have made a difference is not clear. But so determined was
the Clinton administration to avoid involvement that it refrained
from using the ''g-word'' -- genocide, to describe what was
happening despite evidence that the word was no exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department explained at the time that any acceptance
that ''genocide'' was occurring would require certain actions by
the United States to combat it under terms of the Genocide
Convention of 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The description embraced by the White House was that ''acts of
genocide may have occurred'' in Rwanda. Author Philip Gourevitch,
who has chronicled the Rwanda genocide, has written that avoiding
use of that word is among several ''shameless evasions'' to
describe administration circumventions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a contrite President Clinton who went to the Rwandan
capital of Kigali four years after the massacre to concede that his
policy of inaction was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''All over the world there were people like me sitting in
offices who did not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with
which you were being engulfed by this unimaginable terror,'' he
told Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that it was more than a case of ignorance.
''Never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> New Water Pollution Rules Imposed  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional critics accuse the Clinton
administration of conducting a ''power grab'' by moving to require
states to develop new pollution control plans for dirty waterways
just days before legislation blocking such regulations can go into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is whether Republicans can muster enough
bipartisan support to overturn the action by the Environmental
Protection Agency within 60 days, as provided by the law. Such a
prospect is slim in an election year when few lawmakers -- Democrats
or Republicans -- want to be labeled anti-environment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may fall to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, if he is
elected president, to decide whether to roll back the new rules
before they take effect late next year, some opponents of the
regulations conceded.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations issued Tuesday by the EPA require states to
examine more than 20,000 lakes, streams and other waterways,
establish which ones are most polluted and develop a cleanup
program to meet federal water quality standards. The new cleanup
requirements eventually could cost farmers, businesses and other
polluters billions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the new regulations ''a critical
common-sense step to ensure clean, safe water for all Americans''
and said the rules can be implemented ''in close partnership'' with
states and local communities.
</P>
<P>
   EPA Administrator Carol Browner issued the new regulations only
days before Clinton was expected to sign into law a must-have
emergency spending bill that contains a provision specifically
barring the EPA from issuing the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tremendous thumb in the eye to the United States
Congress,'' complained Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., echoing other
GOP lawmakers angered over what they viewed as ''a slap in the
face'' of Congress, which had wanted the rules delayed for 16
months.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules accused the Clinton administration of
pushing out the rules despite widespread concern from many
governors, the business community, farmers and lawmakers on Capitol
Hill about the requirements' costs and complaints that the EPA was
trying to thwart the authority of states in dealing with water
quality issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidential politics and not public interest are guiding the
administration's decisions at this point,'' complained Sen. Bob
Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although some believe the time allowed for waterway cleanup is
still far too long, many environmentalists said the EPA action
marks the first time the federal government has directly addressed
the problem of waterways polluted by runoff from agriculture,
industry, construction and other so-called non-point sources.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of such pollution, 40 percent of the country's
lakes and streams currently are so dirty people can't fish or swim
in them, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of requiring specific plants or businesses to reduce
pollution through restrictive permits, as already is done widely,
the EPA wants states to examine the waterways individually,
determine the maximum amount of pollution that each can sustain,
and craft a cleanup plan that brings the water within federal
health standards.
</P>
<P>
   The process could taken 15 to 25 years, but if states don't act
the EPA can develop a water pollution control plan for them. The
regulations follow numerous lawsuits that have been filed in recent
years by environmentalists, contending neither the states nor the
EPA has moved aggressively to develop cleanup plans as required by
the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''This requires for the first time comprehensive planning on a
river by river, lake by lake, bay by bay basis by local and state
governments,'' Browner said. ''It is the most important action in a
generation to clean up the nation's waters and beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   She said because of the rider tacked onto the spending bill
about to be signed into law, the EPA would not be able to enforce
the new rules until Oct. 1, 2001. But agency officials said the
delay should not cause a serious problem -- barring intervention by
a future president -- since states would not be required to submit
their first cleanup plans until April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new requirements include an array of powerful
interests from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the utility industry
and farm groups, as well as many governors. They argue the rules
infringe on states that already have waterway cleanup plans and
could cost as much as $3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates the cost to states at $20 million to $30
million a year, but senior agency officials acknowledge the overall
cost to industry, agriculture and others affected could be in the
billions of dollars.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Are Staying Put  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The South and West are still hot destinations
for people moving out of state, but for the past 15 years an aging
American population has increasingly been leaving moving boxes in
the attic and suitcases in the back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   New estimates released Wednesday by the Census Bureau show that
15.9 percent of the population, or about 43 million people, moved
between March 1998 and March 1999, slightly less than the 16
percent who moved in the previous one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of relocations last picked up between March 1984 and
March 1985 when 20.2 percent of Americans changed addresses, up
from 17.3 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy is good, analysts attribute the trend in large
part to the graying of the American population, including the baby
boom generation hitting middle age, and an increase in home
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers typically are defined as those born between 1946
and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, the median age of the American population was
35.5, compared with 32.8 in July 1990. The National Association of
Realtors said the median age of homebuyers jumped from 34 in 1989
to 39 in 1999
</P>
<P>
   ''The older you get, the less likely you are to move,'' Census
demographer Carol Faber said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 186 million homeowners in 1999, 26 million more than
in 1988, and homeowners are less likely to relocate than renters,
according to the Census Bureau. During the same time, the number of
renters increased just 5 million, to 81 million. The agency didn't
track that statistic before 1988.
</P>
<P>
   When people do move, they don't go far. Between March 1998 and
March 1999, 59 percent of movers relocated within the same county,
and 20 percent went to another county in the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen percent went out-of-state, and those people usually
went to warmer locales in the South and West, reflecting
decade-long shifts in the American population, Faber said.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast had the lowest moving rate among the nation's
regions (11.7 percent), followed by the Midwest (15.1 percent). The
South (17.1 percent) and the West (18.5 percent) were both above
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The South and West continue to attract people because of
corporate moves and retirement, said Kevin Roth, a senior economist
at the National Association of Realtors. The average homebuyer in
the South moved 259 miles, Roth said, while two-thirds of
homebuyers in the Northeast moved 10 miles or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   More people are still moving out of big cities than into them,
but the net migration into metropolitan areas was 1.4 million
people, the largest net gain since 2.4 million people moved into
metro areas between 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 3.7 million people moved into cities, while 6.2
million moved out. More than 6.5 million moved into suburban
communities last year, while 3.9 million moved out.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the metro area growth was due to 1.3 million new
residents classified by the Census Bureau as ''movers from
abroad.'' About 40 percent of all people who moved into the country
were non-Hispanic whites, and 32 percent were of Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the only thing that saved the Northeast -- persons from
abroad,'' Faber said. ''That seems to be what makes the difference,
because so many people from abroad settle in metro areas rather
than non-metro areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights from the report:
</P>
<P>
   --About 1 in 3 renters, compared with fewer than 1 in 10
homeowners, moved during the one-year period.
</P>
<P>
   --Moving rates declined with age: 32 percent of people in their
20s moved while only 5 percent of those 65 and over did so.

<HEADLINE> The Apollo-Soyuz Mission Hailed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A quarter-century after the U.S.-Soviet space
linkup that laid the foundation for the International Space
Station, American astronaut Tom Stafford still has a daring spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He showed it Tuesday at a commemoration ceremony by delivering a
heartfelt address -- in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo-Soyuz mission ''showed the whole world that if the
Soviet Union and America could work together in space, they could
work together on the earth,'' Stafford said at the Russian Space
Agency's headquarters, winning applause apparently both for his
sentiments and his linguistics.
</P>
<P>
   Included at the gathering were the mission's four surviving
spacemen -- Stafford, American Vance Brand and Russians Alexei
Leonov and Valery Kubasov. The fifth member, American Donald
''Deke'' Slayton, died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came a few days before the actual 25th anniversary
of the July 17, 1975, linkup of the spacecraft, and just a few
hours before the launch of Russia's Zvezda module, a key component
of the ISS project.
</P>
<P>
   The space station project has been troubled by a two-year delay
in getting the Zvezda launched -- first due to construction
problems, then because of crashes of Proton rockets, the type that
is to take the Zvezda into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But participants at the ceremony glossed over the problems in
favor of lauding U.S.-Russian cooperation in space both past and
future.
</P>
<P>
   Leonov praised the ''dear and intelligent people who decided to
show all of humanity that we are different ... but can work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony began with a film that captured the high spirits of
the Apollo-Soyuz linkup, showing the space travelers grinning in
the cramped quarters of their craft, swigging from a food tube
labeled ''vodka'' and batting playfully at spacecraft models
drifting in zero gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We laughed, we talked ... I became worried that they would
spend the night,'' one of the American astronauts said in the film.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, those memories were still vivid for
Stafford, but he admitted that he'd forgotten a few things.
</P>
<P>
   ''Formerly, I spoke Russian really well,'' he said, before
switching into English midway through his remarks.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs First Robot for Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's first robotic surgical device may
be headed for an operating room near you: The government has given
surgeons the green light to use a three-armed assistant named,
perhaps appropriately, ''Da Vinci.''
</P>
<P>
   The Da Vinci Surgical System on Tuesday became the first
surgical robot to win Food and Drug Administration approval, to
help surgeons more easily perform certain operations through tiny
cuts in the abdomen, known as laparoscopic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But consider that a first-generation use. The robot already is
being tested on trickier surgeries, including heart bypasses and
heart valve replacements performed through three incisions each
about the diameter of a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   And FDA experts say the robot's ability to perform precise
movements in tiny spaces -- without trembling like a tired surgeon
might -- could one day allow better microsurgery, such as for
nerve-related operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This system is the first step in the development of new
robotic technology that eventually could change the practice of
surgery,'' said FDA Commissioner Jane Henney.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of future uses, the Da Vinci robot is a ''powerful''
tool because it can give surgeons more control during today's
minimally invasive operations, said Dr. Barry Gardiner of the San
Ramon Regional Medical Center, who led clinical trials of the
robot.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you sit down and operate with this system, it almost
feels like you've climbed inside the space you're operating in,''
Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci, a $1 million device manufactured by Intuitive Surgical
Inc., was tested on laparoscopic gallbladder removals and
heartburn-relief operations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, surgeons do those procedures minimally invasively by
sliding a tiny video camera inside the patient's body and operating
with foot-long scalpels and other instruments stuck into two small
incisions. It looks like they're handling long, steel chopsticks
while looking up at a fuzzy videoscreen instead of down at the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Laparoscopic surgery is immensely popular and surgeons can do it
well, but they complain the instruments are clumsy at best and
prevent fine stitches and other micro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Da Vinci's camera uses multiple lenses to provide a
three-dimensional image from inside the patient's body. The robotic
arms replace those foot-long scalpels, and have a ''wrist'' built
in for more humanlike flexibility. The arms hold specially designed
surgical instruments that mimic movement of the surgeon's hands as
he or she operates the robot's joysticks from a computer next to
the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   ''The computer controls the instruments as if your fingers are
grasping the very tip,'' a sensation doctors usually get only in
open surgery, Gardiner explained. ''It's a very powerful
sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 113 patients who underwent robotic gallbladder or
heartburn surgery, they did just as well as 132 patients who got
standard laparoscopic surgery, said Neil Ogden, the FDA engineer
who oversaw Da Vinci's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the robotic operations took up to 50 minutes longer, in part
because surgeons weren't accustomed to the new technology, Ogden
said, who warned that the doctors had a learning curve spotted over
their first 20 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Already doctors are hunting new uses for Da Vinci. A colleague
at Gardiner's hospital is considering fertility surgery that now
can't be done minimally invasively. Colon and prostate surgeries
that now require fine suturing might become less invasive, too, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors must be specially trained by the Mountain View, Calif.,
manufacturer to use the robot, the FDA stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Five hospitals are trained to use the Da Vinci now: Henrico
Doctors Hospital in Richmond, Va., Baylor Medical Center in
Houston; Ohio State University in Columbus; East Carolina
University in Greenville, N.C.; and Gardiner's San Ramon Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A few other hospitals are conducting clinical trials of
robot-assisted heart surgery.

<HEADLINE> Landmark Middle East Talks Launched  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Hoping to live up to the legacy of Camp
David, President Clinton and the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
are plunging into intensive negotiations in a backwoods setting
whose informality belied the ''profound and wrenching'' questions
at hand.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat chatting alongside him, Clinton on Tuesday strolled
the winding paths of the rustic presidential retreat where Egypt
and Israel set themselves on a course for peace 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The back porch of the presidential cabin served as the venue for
separate talks with Barak and Arafat before all three leaders and
their aides gathered for 30 minutes at a long rectangular
conference table in a weathered cottage nestled in the Maryland
woods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held separate evening discussions with the two leaders,
and all three delegations, about 40 people, dined together at round
tables inside Laurel cabin, according to Clinton's chief spokesman,
Joe Lockhart. He said he would not release details about any
after-dinner meetings until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent the night at Camp David in preparation for another
round of talks in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional moments of lightheartedness, including some playful
jostling by Barak and Arafat as they ushered each other into their
initial meeting with Clinton, did little to dispel the sense of
urgency and seriousness hanging over the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remain far apart on all the key issues as they
approach a Sept. 13 deadline for arriving at a wide-ranging peace
accord. Once the clock runs out on that, Palestinian plans to
declare independence -- with or without a peace treaty -- raise the
specter of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''One shouldn't estimate the complexity, the difficulty (of the
talks) -- it's not for the fainthearted at all,'' Hanan Ashrawi,
spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said on the PBS
program, ''The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House for Camp David, Clinton spoke of the
difficulty of the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two leaders face profound and wrenching questions,'' he
said. In their quest to arrive at an agreement, he said, the two
sides ''have passed the point of no return.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of news leaks that have plagued Mideast summits in the
past, the White House stressed that no information would be
forthcoming about the substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention over the next few days to provide progress
reports,'' Lockhart told journalists. ''The delegations know each
other well; they know the issues well. ... And I think the best
thing to do is allow the parties to try to work through those
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart described the atmosphere in Tuesday's talks as ''good''
and the discussion as ''serious,'' but provided no details on the
substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after his joint meeting with Barak and Arafat, parried
reporters' questions by saying: ''We pledged to each other we would
answer no questions and offer no comments, so I have to set a good
example.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit caps months of shuttling among the parties by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the talks, the Palestinians said they were
pessimistic about whether gaps could be bridged, and Barak
acknowledged the odds of success or failure were about equal.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the disagreements are the status of Jerusalem, which
both sides claim as their capital, and the fate of several million
Palestinians and their descendants who fled or were driven from
their homes during Israel's 1948 war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who took office a year ago after being elected on a peace
platform, has been badly weakened politically by attacks from
rightist opponents who accuse him of being willing to make too many
concessions to the Palestinians. Three parties pulled out of his
governing coalition on the day before he left for the summit, and
early elections loom as a possibility, complicating peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While no deadline for wrapping up the summit has been set,
Clinton is scheduled to go to Japan on July 19 for an eight-nation
economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   There, an Israeli diplomat said, Clinton intends to appeal for
financial help to assist Palestinian refugees and to implement any
agreement he might reach with Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Israel and the United States appeared to be
making headway in a dispute over projected Israeli radar sales to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in contact, and I believe we are getting closer to a
solution of the problem,'' said Gadi Baltinasky, an Israeli
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, there were reports that Israel would propose selling
the advanced airborne warning system to China through a third
country in hopes of reducing U.S. pressure to drop the sale.

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A powerful car bomb exploded outside one of
Madrid's largest department stores early Wednesday morning,
injuring at least three people, emergency services said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of deaths.

shattered windows and caused extensive damage, the Samur emergency
service said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Basque
separatist group ETA has acknowledged similar bombings in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- the initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom -- has
killed some 800 people during a 30-year campaign for independence
of the Basque region of northern Spain. ETA is blamed for five
killings since ending a 14-month cease-fire late last year.

<HEADLINE> Nader Signs on With New Admaker  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man whose irreverent advertising helped
elect Gov. Jesse Ventura is signing on with Ralph Nader, the
consumer activist-turned-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   William Hillsman created a series of offbeat, funny and
ultimately successful ads for Ventura, although it was unclear
whether Nader will have enough money to follow the Minnesota
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the Green Party candidate, is not considered a serious
threat for the White House, but could help determine the November
outcome. National polls show him with about 6 percent support,
slightly more in some battleground states. Most of that appears to
come at the expense of Vice President Al Gore, the soon-to-be
Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Nader and Hillsman plan to formally announce Hillsman's role
Wednesday, said John Blackshaw, president of Hillsman's
Minneapolis-based company, North Woods Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Blackshaw cautioned that ads for Nader will not necessarily
feature the longtime consumer advocate rapping a tune or portrayed
as an action figure battling Evil Special Interest Man, as
Minnesota voters saw during Ventura's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody should expect they're going to be like
Ventura's last ads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman also created the funny TV ads credited with helping
liberal Minnesota Democrat Paul Wellstone win a Senate seat in
1990. In those spots, Wellstone frantically ran around explaining,
''I don't have $6 million, so I'm gonna have to talk fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman's company is also handling a pair of Senate races -- for
Mike Ciresi, a Minnesota Democrat, and Willie Logan, an independent
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Blackshaw said he didn't know what the advertising budget would
be, but offered: ''It ain't going to be as much as (George W.) Bush
and Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican candidates each get $67.6 million
in taxpayer money to run their fall campaigns. The Reform Party
candidate will receive $12.6 million, based on the party's
performance in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Nader's campaign has received about $100,000 in federal
money.

<HEADLINE> Fire 80, Sparks 77  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Sophia Witherspoon scored 29 points and
Vanessa Nygaard hit two free throws with 6.5 seconds left as the
Portland Fire ended the Los Angeles Sparks' 12-game winning streak,
80-77, Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With 8.5 seconds left, and her team trailing 78-77, Sparks
forward DeLisha Milton missed a lay-up. Nygaard made her free
throws two seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 61-57 with 11:25 to play, the expansion Fire (6-12),
who have won two in a row for the first time this season, took the
lead for good with a 15-2 run while Lisa Leslie, Los Angeles'
leading scorer and rebounder, was on the bench with five fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Portland increased its lead to 75-65 with 5:21 left, before the
Sparks went on a 7-0 run, making the score 75-72 with 3:38 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (16-3) pulled within two, 77-75, when Mwadi Mabika
made the second of two free throws with 1:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon made the first of two free throws, putting Portland
up, 78-75 with 1:00 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mabika put in a rebound with 42.7 seconds left, cutting the
deficit to 78-77. Witherspoon missed a lay-up and Leslie grabbed
the rebound and called time out with 19.5 seconds remaining,
setting the stage for Milton's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Nygaard scored 13 points for Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum crowd of 4,416 was the lowest in the Sparks' four-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   The previous low of 4,639 was set June 6, also against Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Portland reserve forward Alisa Burras did not make the trip
because of a slightly torn meniscus.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Michael Irvin Retires  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Ten minutes after he retired from football,
Michael Irvin was already making headway in his new job as an NFL
broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Making his way through the crowd at his farewell news
conference, Irvin shared a few moments with good pal and former
Dallas Cowboys teammate Deion Sanders. They whispered some
pleasantries, then Irvin got down to business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to call you,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give you your first exclusive,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin switched teams Tuesday, going from the Cowboys to Fox
Sports Net. It was difficult for the former All-Pro receiver to
leave the game he loved, yet he realized it was the right thing to
do after learning of a frightening spine condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''My doctor basically said I could play if I really wanted to,''
Irvin said. ''It became an emotional thing, a family thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He struggled with the decision for months. Then he was playing
with his kids one day and saw his wife crying. The tears came from
thinking that Irvin might return to football and suffer an injury
that would leave him paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   All football players face that risk every play, but Irvin
learned Oct. 10 that he was particularly in jeopardy. A herniated
disc that left him temporarily paralyzed in a game against
Philadelphia uncovered that he had a narrow spine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to rationalize it: 'Any hit can be your last hit.
You've been doing that all you're life.' But I've accomplished a
great deal of things that I wanted to accomplish, and at this
juncture there's no need to risk it and go on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, as his mother told him, Irvin is closing one door and
opening another. Rather than playing football, he'll be talking
about it, working primarily on the Sunday pregame show ''NFL This
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to watching him,'' Dallas quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ''Michael always has taken a shine to cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's high-profile hiring is an indication the public has
forgiven him for his bad-boy days.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching his on-field peak by capturing three Super Bowls
in four years, Irvin's image went in the gutter beginning with an
arrest at a motel room following a celebration of his 30th birthday
in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He went on trial that summer and settled by pleading no contest
to felony drug charges. He recently completed a four-year
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Late that year, he was falsely accused of sexual assault. In
1998, he cut a teammate's neck with a pair of scissors while
horsing around in a dormitory during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know fans were upset,'' Irvin said. ''But they got back to
loving me. I've been running into a great deal of fans and none
have been conflicted with it. I haven't had any negative vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was the kind of player only his team's fans could love. He
celebrated first downs as if they were touchdowns and touchdowns as
if they were Super Bowls. He dared other teams to put their best
cornerbacks on him and still succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ''People might think he's all show, but it's not. That's him,''
longtime teammate Daryl Johnston said. ''It can be irritating if
you're not on his team or rooting for his team, but that's a big
part of his success.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Irvin caught 750 passes for 11,904 yards. At the
time of his final play, both figures were ninth in NFL history. Of
the guys ahead of him, only Jerry Rice has as many Super Bowl
rings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've both got three. I'll take that,'' Irvin said, roaring at
his own joke.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Irvin had to stretch the rules to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can remember the competition committee changing the way
offensive pass interference is called because of this guy right
here,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, a member of that committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He figured out how to take his skills and intimidate and with
just a little push break open and get that pass from Troy. They had
to change the rule because they said it was unfair. It was the
Michael Irvin Rule.''

<HEADLINE> Panthers' Fred Lane Mourned in Tenn.  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Carolina Panthers fullback William Floyd
didn't shy away from the reason 1,800 people came to The People's
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in my heart that justice will be served,'' Floyd
said at the funeral of former teammate Fred Lane. ''The Lord said
'Vengeance is mine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Deidra Lane, 25, fatally shot her 24-year-old
husband Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., ending a troubled relationship
that was complicated by the birth of their first child two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed against Deidra Lane, who was
questioned and released by police.
</P>
<P>
   She did not attend visitation Monday at a funeral home in
Charlotte and she wasn't at Tuesday's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Lane's parents spoke Tuesday, and the elder Lane said he
had to say goodbye to his son. Anyone that knew his son was touched
by the joy he took in life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you didn't know my son, you missed him. If you knew him,
you loved him. And if you didn't love him, you didn't know him,''
Fred Lane Sr. said.
</P>
<P>
   The father recalled his son's smile and how he endured wearing
braces on his teeth for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daddy, when I'm on TV I've gotta look good,'' the father
recalled his son saying.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Lane said that he and his wife will be thanking
everyone eventually, but that he will be busy in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to close this chapter out and take care of some
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends wondering why Fred Lane was shot to death by
his wife should remember humans make mistakes, the Rev. Horace
Hockett told mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us all pray to his Father for his divine intervention for
a proper and thorough investigation so that truth can be known,
speculation put to rest and proper closure can be brought forth,''
Hockett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Humans are mistake-prone and we make bad choices and errors in
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners praised Lane during the services that lasted nearly
three hours. Most remembered Lane's joyful smile and loving
personality.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before the funeral, mourners were allowed to view the
open coffin, which was surrounded by flowers, Lane's Indianapolis
Colts and Panthers jerseys and photos from his NFL days.
</P>
<P>
   A banner reading, ''The Lane Family Is Proud Of You Fred Jr.'',
shared the stage with a large video screen projecting a verse from
Psalm 23: ''He makes me lie down in green pastures.''
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane released a statement through her attorney Sunday in
which she said she loved her husband and shared his family's grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''At his best, Fred could be very good,'' she said. ''At his
worst, Fred was very different. I choose to remember Fred at his
best. I want to help all of our children to remember Fred at his
best.
</P>
<P>
   ''Celebrity and the environment that comes with fame surrounded
our lives and was sometimes a destructive force.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Lane's ex-teammates have said they want to talk to
investigators about the couple's relationship. Floyd and Panthers
receiver Mushin Muhammad said they want to make sure that Lane, who
left behind two other daughters and a son, isn't forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see how the Lord was ready for him yet,'' Muhammad
said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Leads Tour de France  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   REVEL, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong is perfectly satisfied with
a second-place finish if it keeps him in the overall lead at the
Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who hasn't won any of the 11 legs of the 2000 tour,
is the favorite to win the three-week endurance race that ends in
Paris on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been second three times this year. Last year, I was
able to win the tour and win four stages,'' the 28-year-old Texan
said Tuesday after he maintained his 4-minute, 14-second overall
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is to win in Paris, and if that means
coming second five times, that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made his move on Monday, when a stunning late climb in
the Pyrenees gave him the yellow jersey for the first time this
year, and he was happy to stay alongside his main rivals for the
tour crown.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the winner of the 135-mile stage from
Bagneres-de-Bigorre to Revel in southwestern France was Dutchman
Erik Dekker - who has won two legs this year, but has no
expectations to catch Armstrong in the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker, who beat Colombia's Santiago Botero in a final sprint,
won Saturday's eighth stage.
</P>
<P>
   He is 47th in the standings, 20:40 behind Armstrong, but already
considers the 2000 tour a success.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who came back from cancer to win last year's race in
spectacular style, hopes that Americans won't be disappointed that
he hasn't won a stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the States, cycling is not a traditional sport,'' he said.
''We don't know the tactics, the ins and outs and the history. We
don't know the stories, the significance of winning a stage or of
the yellow jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The main objective is to win overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished in 24th place, 5:05 behind Dekker. But he had
the same time as second-placed rider Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, there are no back-to-back mountain stages
until the second half of the 2000 tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't sleep very well on (Monday) night, but I felt good
this morning. Normally there are two (mountain) stages, so I didn't
feel as fatigued as I did last year after the Alps,'' he said. ''I
was lucky enough to have my family, baby boy and in-laws with me.
That was good for morale.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there were big celebrations within the U.S. Postal
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone ordered champagne, but I didn't want any,'' Armstrong
said. ''If we win in Paris, I will have champagne, but that is a
long way from now.''
</P>
<P>
   France's Christophe Moreau remains third overall, 5:10 behind
Armstrong, with Marc Wouters of Belgium in fourth, another 8
seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th stage came as a relief to riders after Monday's
energy-sapping mountain climb in driving rain and cold
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures on the road to Revel hovered around a 59 degrees,
though occasional showers and wind made riding uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Riders left the small town of Bagneres-de-Bigorre in the rolling
foothills of the Pyrenees and headed east, passing lush sunflower
fields and quaint villages.
</P>
<P>
   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who lives in the region,
was among the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin peered out of the sun roof of the race director's car as
the front two riders sprinted through his home town of
Cintegabelle. In the manner of a team manager, he gave an interview
from his car window to a journalist riding a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Riders have a rest day on Wednesday before Thursday's 12th leg,
a 93-mile course that includes a tough climb up Mont Ventoux.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Hires Doherty As Hoops Coach  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Other college coaches promised starting
positions and offensive opportunities for Matt Doherty. North
Carolina's Dean Smith told the New York prepster he would be lucky
to play by his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When coach Smith told me that, I sat up in my chair and I said
to myself, 'I'll show you,''' Doherty said, recalling Smith's home
recruiting visit.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 Doherty did just that, starting as a scrappy
sophomore on a national championship team in 1982 with teammates
Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Sam Perkins and Jimmy Black.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty again finds himself in an underdog role, this time as
the new head coach of the Tar Heels. The 38-year-old Doherty is
part of the North Carolina family coaching tree, but clearly wasn't
the first choice to succeed Bill Guthridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought that Roy Williams, Eddie Fogler, George Karl or
Larry Brown would be here before me,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Nope. All four turned down or weren't allowed to talk to North
Carolina during a 12-day period, leaving Doherty as the top
candidate despite only one successful season at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just to be mentioned in the same breath with Roy Williams,
Eddie Fogler, George Karl and Larry Brown is very humbling, very
humbling,'' Doherty said late Tuesday night after accepting a
six-year contract with the Tar Heels. ''I have not done what those
men have done. They have done it for a long time at high levels. I
hope to achieve that kind of success here.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty began working on Wall Street out of college, but soon
was talked into coaching by Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''I encourage all our players to get into it who want to,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a bright young coach. Maybe we need a young coach here
now. We've had two old ones recently,'' Smith added, referring to
himself and Guthridge, whose combined tenures spanned 39 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fans complained openly that the Tar Heels often lacked fire last
season under the mild-mannered Guthridge, who retired June 30 after
two Final Fours in three seasons after replacing Smith, the career
Division I victory leader.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, on the other hand, comes with plenty of emotion. He
often wears it on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will play hard, we will play smart, we will play together.
That sounds familiar, huh?'' Doherty said. ''You've heard that
before, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team will play harder than any team in the country. That
I'll promise you. I can't ask guys to run faster or jump higher,
but I can ask them to play harder. I'll spoil them off the court if
they spoil me on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty steps into a good position. The Tar Heels return such
players as Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the year Joseph
Forte, 7-foot center Brendan Haywood, Kris Lang and Jason Capel.
North Carolina will likely be a preseason top 10 team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some good players back, and now we have someone who's
going to push us hard -- every day,'' Capel said. ''He's already
told us that he's going to push us and demand a lot out of us.
We've got to meet his standards, and we will.
</P>
<P>
   ''He struck me as a very confident person -- no nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White said Doherty had a
clause in his contract regarding North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect that when Matt came to Notre Dame, he hoped that at
some point he'd have an opportunity to have a conversation with
North Carolina, maybe five or eight or 10 years down the road. I
don't think he ever expected it would occur after year one,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone call to discuss the job came last Thursday night
when Doherty was in a Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to get into a private aisle, the tissue aisle, paper
napkins and stuff like that where there's not a lot of activity and
talk business,'' Doherty said of his initial talk with UNC athletic
director Dick Baddour.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an omen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was walking with my phone to my ear, trying to find an
aisle, and a kid walks at me with a North Carolina basketball shirt
on,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty was scheduled to sign a contract worth $350,000 a
season, Baddour said, adding that additional money would be coming
from a deal with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   But more than money, Doherty was pleased he could carry the
North Carolina coaching flame.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted someone who had played here or who had coached
here to be the head coach because this is a special place,''
Doherty said. ''Someone from the outside would not understand what
it means to have played here, they don't understand the effort it
takes to maintain the ties with the former players.''

<HEADLINE> 'Sports Can Build Up or Take Away.'  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a sad story, to be sure, about families and a town torn up
because two men didn't know when to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   But is it a sports story?
</P>
<P>
   The police who investigated Michael Costin's death aren't sure.
The priest who delivered the eulogy thinks so. Some of the other
people who knew Costin have no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pride and anger can be virtuous or vicious,'' the Rev. John
Farrell told 200 mourners at Our Lady of the Assumption Church in
Lynnfield, Mass. ''Sports can build up or take away.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it may have played a part in taking the life of
Costin, 40, a single father of four and part-time carpenter who
turned up at the neighborhood ice rink to watch his sons play
hockey whenever he could.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Junta, a 42-year-old truck driver whose son played
alongside Costin's, has been charged with manslaughter in Costin's
death. But the question that haunted the grownups at Tuesday's
funeral was how much responsibility all of us share for poisoning
the air around our kids' games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really have to take a look at sports,'' said Brian Mahoney,
who children played with Costin's as well, ''and the parents have
to take a good look at themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who hasn't seen organized youth-league sports in a while
would be surprised by the intensity surrounding them. This case was
unusual because neither Costin nor Junta were pushy parents; even
more unusual, they clashed after an informal practice.
</P>
<P>
   Junta felt there was too much rough stuff, considering most of
the kids were 10-year-old boys, and he told Costin, who was
supervising the practice. What began as verbal sparring moved from
the rink to a hallway, then escalated into a shoving match. It
ended tragically when Junta -- who outweighed Costin by nearly 100
pounds -- returned to the rink, pinned the victim to the ground, and
bounced his head off the floor until Costin lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like this happen with frightening regularity. Director
Richard Lapchick of the Center for the Study of Sports and Society
at Northeastern University said he hears at least once a month
about parents fighting with referees, coaches or other parents at
kids' games. They cut across boundaries of geography and class and
sport.
</P>
<P>
   In January, police in Kirkland, Wash., were called in after a
coach broke a parent's nose with a head-butt -- after a wrestling
match between 6-year-olds. In April, a former police officer in
Pennsylvania was convicted of soliciting assault for offering a
10-year-old Little League pitcher $2 to bean an opposing player. In
May, the father of a hockey player put an official in a headlock
during a high school tournament in Texas and had to be forcibly
removed from the rink
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished this latest episode, beyond the horrific
ending, were the troubled pasts both men brought to the
confrontation, and the sense that each, at long last, had settled
comfortably into his role as father.
</P>
<P>
   Costin went to prison seven times for crimes ranging from
assaulting police officers to breaking and entering. Family and
friends said most of his problems stemmed from Costin's battles
with alcohol and his ex-wife over custody of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   What made his death even more painful, those people say, was
that Costin had put his life in order. He had his kids, and
everything revolved around their activities, whether it meant
driving to movies, miniature golf or hockey games. A reminder of
how close the family had grown came at Costin's wake, when one of
his young sons climbed into the casket with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Junta, too, was described by those close to him as a model
family man. His wife coached swimming in Reading, and he helped
organize a girls' high school hockey team for his 16-year-old
daughter. Like Costin, Junta playing ball with kids was a familiar
sight on the tree-lined suburban streets. And like Costin, too, he
had a few skirmishes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Junta was charged with assault and battery as
recently as 1992, but there was no finding in the case. After he
entered a not guilty plea Monday, a judge set bail at $5,000,
agreeing with defense attorney Thomas Orlandi that Junta -- who
contend he acted in self-defense -- was neither dangerous nor a
threat to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how a seemingly harmless exchange became a fatal one in
a matter of minutes will be illuminated in a courtroom, if at all.
For the moment, those on the outside looking in are reluctant to
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked Reading police Det. Kevin Patterson if he could
imagine this much rage flowing from the same two men if they had
clashed over a parking place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Motivation?'' Patterson said, ''I don't want to guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quiet of the rectory at Our Lady of the Assumption,
Farrell pondered the same question.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen parental rage at hockey games before, but it always
seemed,'' he paused, searching for the right word, ''communal. Now,
it has a face.''

<HEADLINE> Black Church Appoints Female Bishop  </HEADLINE>
By TERRY KINNEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Preacher. Journalist. Author. Now add to
Vashti McKenzie's resume a position never before filled by a woman
in the long history of the nation's oldest black church: Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery church leader whose family has been active in African
Methodist Episcopal Church affairs in Baltimore for more than a
century has become the first female bishop in the denomination's
213-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of God's favor, the stained glass ceiling has been
pierced and broken,'' McKenzie said. ''My sisters, we've come a
mighty long way. But there's still a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie and three other new bishops were elected by the
church's General Conference on Tuesday night and were then
consecrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church made a major statement by electing the Rev.
McKenzie,'' said the Rev. David Jarrett of Grand Rapids, Mich.
''The laity of the church rose up and made a major statement about
the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the new millennium''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the church's members are women, and women
have long been accepted to the clergy. But the church had never had
a female bishop until McKenzie won election on her first try.
</P>
<P>
   Also elected to fill three other vacancies were the Rev. Richard
Norris of Philadelphia, the Rev. Gregory Ingram of Detroit and the
Rev. Preston Williams of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum had been building for a female bishop, even though
delegates last weekend rejected a resolution that would have
required a woman to be elected.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie was one of two women among 42 candidates. When no one
received a majority of votes on the first ballot, 15 candidates
withdrew and McKenzie and Norris were elected on the second ballot.
The other two bishops were chosen from 11 candidates who remained
for a third ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates cheered loudly and McKenzie was surrounded by
supporters when her election was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a wonderful thing,'' said Janie Franklin, a delegate
from Orangeburg, S.C. ''I'm very excited that a woman has been
elected, and I'm particularly glad it is the Rev. McKenzie. I liked
her the first time I met her.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie praised the pioneering work of women in the
denomination, saying they had ''sacrificed, cried, died and gave
their very best.'' She paid tribute to her mother and other family
members, and she thanked her husband, former pro basketball player
Stan McKenzie, for his support.
</P>
<P>
   ''God hand-picked a man just for me, and I thank God he picked
this one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie, a former broadcast executive whose family founded the
Afro-American Newspaper chain, has been pastor of Payne Memorial
AME Church in Baltimore for 10 years. During that time, the
congregation grew from 330 members to more than 1,700.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a book published in 1996 called ''Not Without a
Struggle,'' which examines female leadership in different cultures
and religions.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church, founded in Philadelphia in 1787, has more than
2.3 million members in the United States, Canada, England, Africa
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,800 delegates attended its sometimes contentious,
weeklong General Conference, where the selection of new bishops was
delayed several times because of disputes over rules.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, delegates discarded paper ballots and voted
electronically, and Jarrett said that may have helped McKenzie get
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voting electronically gave power to the people,'' Jarrett
said. ''It uplifted the conference, and I think it helped build
momentum for Rev. McKenzie.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats, GOP Differ on Ad Tactics  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oregon, where environmentalists are a force
and liberal isn't a dirty word, has voted Democratic in three
straight presidential contests. But that hasn't stopped the
Democrats from spending nearly $1 million on TV ads to shore up Al
Gore's support there.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand miles east, the checkbook is open even wider, with
more than $2 million spent in Pennsylvania, $1.5 million in
Michigan and about $1.4 million in Ohio and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of a 17-state advertising effort designed to
revive Gore's lagging campaign. Democrats already have spent $14
million to reach deep into the media markets of swing states while
protecting traditionally Democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Republicans buoyed by George W. Bush's strong
showing in polls, have been able to stay off the airwaves in
normally GOP states, conserving money and simply counterpunching
with $5.4 million, mostly in states where the vice president was
already on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has even forced the Democrats to spend some $200,000 to
defend Arkansas, President Clinton's home state. That's on top of
$600,000 in Iowa and $750,000 in Washington -- both strong
Democratic states that should be in Gore's column without the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some states that should just be a given,'' said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore campaign manager Bill Daley argued that, historically,
there are few states that Democrats can count on without hard work
and money.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to always get a Michigan to come back home, an
Illinois to come back home or Wisconsin, Minnesota,'' he said
Tuesday. ''That's why they call them battleground states and
Democrats have a lot of battleground states this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Public polls offer Gore little reassurance that the ads are
working, though polling by Jamieson's research team suggests they
are, and Democrats say their internal numbers show the same.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Gore aide explained the Democratic Party is using its
early money for states where research shows Gore's ad message can
change people's minds -- avoiding those areas where Bush has an edge
and can erase any gains with his own ads.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Georgia, normally considered a battleground, has
gotten only $234,000 in Democratic ads so far -- and only in
Atlanta. More Republican areas of the state have seen no Democratic
ads.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Democrats have spent more than $765,000 in all
seven markets in Louisiana, another Southern swing state.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluations go deep, down to decisions about markets within
a state. Ads are running across Ohio and Michigan, for instance,
but the buys are much smaller in Cincinnati and Grand Rapids, both
considered Republican towns.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have passed entirely on ads in California and New
York, strong Democratic states with expensive TV markets.
</P>
<P>
   The party is on track to top $20 million by the time it
nominates Gore at the Los Angeles convention next month. And by
this weekend, TV viewers in dozens of cities will have seen at
least 20 and, in many areas, more than 30 pro-Gore commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen them over and over and over again,'' said Ed
Renwick, director of the Loyola Institute of Politics in New
Orleans, where the typical TV viewer has seen close to 30 ads.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee has put up just a single ad
touting Bush's Social Security plan, and only for two weeks. With
Bush solid in the polls, the party has been conserving money but is
considering going back on the air as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been on the air for five weeks with positive ads
that star the vice president. Each flashes ''The Gore Plan'' across
the screen as specific points are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Most feature Gore speaking to a town hall meeting, where
advisers believe he's most relaxed and projects the best image.
</P>
<P>
   The topics are meant to appeal to Democrats and independents
alike. The first ad was about prescription drugs for Medicare. Next
was the patients bill of rights, then fatherhood, education and,
beginning Tuesday, crime victims' rights.
</P>
<P>
   There have been only a few polls released in target states. One
in Missouri released Tuesday showed no movement for Gore, and last
week, a Michigan poll found Gore losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   But nightly tracking polls by the Annenberg School suggest the
ads are working, with Gore gaining 10 percentage points versus Bush
in the states with the heaviest DNC spending. In states where no
ads have run, Gore's numbers are essentially flat.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats say that their internal polls find that people who
have seen the ads are more favorable toward Gore and Democrats in
general.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ads seem to be most directed at solidifying the Democratic
base,'' said John Green, director of the University of Akron's Ray
C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Union people are pretty irritated with the vice president. The
ads remind them that Al Gore and the Democrats are good on a lot of
other issues they care about.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Oregonians Killed in Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Four members of a family from
Oregon died when their single-engine airplane crashed on a remote
mountainside in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage of the Piper Cherokee airplane was spotted Tuesday by a
search team about 18 miles southwest of where it took off from
Monday at Chilko Lake, 135 miles north of Vancouver. Rescuers on a
helicopter confirmed there were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Family members identified the pilot as William Gildow, 74, of
Gales Creek and the passengers as his son Daniel, 42, of Scappoose,
his daughter Nancy Wicks, 49, and her husband Michael Wicks, 45,
both of Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   The family had stayed for three days at Tsuniah Lake Lodge on a
fishing holiday before leaving Monday, lodge manager Eric Brebner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was reported missing after taking off from a
high-altitude grass air strip. When it failed to radio its
location, a search began involving four military and five civilian
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the plane appeared to have flown into the side of
a mountain.

<HEADLINE> Gopher Star Turns Down All-America  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Like any college offensive lineman hoping for
a career in the NFL, Minnesota's Ben Hamilton is thankful for
national recognition. But there was one preseason honor he couldn't
accept.
</P>
<P>
   An All-American center after last season as a junior, Hamilton
turned down a spot on Playboy magazine's preseason All-America team
because he doesn't want his named linked with the publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Christian guy and I didn't feel comfortable being
associated with Playboy magazine,'' Hamilton said. ''It was really
hard because it is an honor, and playing offensive line, you don't
get too many honors and they don't come along too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Players posed for a picture in the magazine's October issue --
which hits newsstands in August -- but there are no bunnies in the
photo. Nor were half-dressed women hanging around when players
gathered for the photo shoot in Phoenix in May.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's decision was ''not a big deal for us,'' Playboy
spokesman Rob Hilburger said. He declined to comment further,
including on whether any other players had turned down a spot on
the team in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Wuerffel, who won the Heisman Trophy playing for Florida
in 1996, turned down the chance to be on the magazine's team
earlier that year, citing his religious convictions. In 1995,
Florida State center Clay Shiver also declined the magazine's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton knew the All-America team had little to do with the
magazine's reputation because Gophers coach Glen Mason assured him
it was a bona fide honor. Hamilton also discussed his decision with
former Playboy honorees such as ex-teammate Tyrone Carter and
Purdue quarterback Drew Brees.
</P>
<P>
   ''People would tell me things like that, but I guess for my
close friends, I didn't want to portray the wrong idea of the kind
of person I am,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The civil engineering major, who expects to graduate next
spring, said he worried a little about whether his decision would
affect his future, even though he's already on Street and Smith's,
Lindy's, Football News and other preseason All-America teams.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, son of former Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Wes
Hamilton, is 6-foot-5 and 285 pounds. He gave up one sack in each
of the last two years and anchored an offensive line that led the
Gophers to an 8-4 record and a place in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL officials think Hamilton's decision might actually
benefit his draft status in an era when personal behavior is highly
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a character standpoint, you know you don't have to worry
about Ben Hamilton,'' said Scott Studwell, Minnesota Vikings player
personnel coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obviously a big issue today and yesterday and in the
future. Character plays a major role in the evaluation process, so
that's certainly a benefit to Ben as far as his pro potential is
concerned,'' Studwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wants to follow his father, who played from 1976-85,
into the NFL, and he probably will get that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's intelligent, I know he's diligent,'' Studwell
said. ''He has some size potential, which for that position, to be
as tall as he is, is unusual. I know he's a pretty good athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   But if a pro career doesn't work out, Hamilton said, he won't be
devastated, in part because of his strong religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well I know, football wise, it'd probably be bad to turn down
something like this, but football is not the most important thing
in my life, so it came down to deciding how important it is to me
to be on that team or not be on that team,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Celebrate in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Thousands of hard-line
Protestants lit towering bonfires early Wednesday to celebrate a
victory from centuries past, but many worried whether they would
win this month's battle to keep marching past Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, a town southwest of Belfast that's the epicenter
of this month's violence, police fired plastic bullets and water
cannons at the rioters. Twenty-three people, mostly police, were
injured and 13 people arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In and around Belfast, rowdy fife and drum bands entertained
heavily drinking crowds at scores of bonfires -- stacks of wood
planks, discarded furniture and tires, some 100 feet high -- before
Wednesday's mass Orange Order parades across Northern Ireland.
Adding to the air of menace, masked gunmen fired volleys of shots
beside at least two bonfires.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a man was shot and killed Wednesday and his body was
found near a bonfire in Larne, County Antrim, about 20 miles north
of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate details of the shooting but crowds at
the bonfire briefly confronted police when they arrived to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week of rioting has caused widespread intimidation,
forcing businesses to close early and motorists off the roads, but
done little to sway authorities' determination to prevent Orangemen
from going near several hostile Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Police commanders said they hoped the turmoil would subside once
the Orangemen march through Belfast and more than a dozen other
towns Wednesday for the Twelfth, a profoundly divisive holiday that
commemorates the 1690 victory of Protestant William of Orange over
his Catholic foe, James II.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking nothing for granted, but the protests must run
out of steam sometime,'' said Chief Superintendent Brian McCargo of
the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's mostly Protestant
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 146 suspected rioters had been arrested, nearly
1,000 gasoline bombs seized, 88 vehicles hijacked and burned, and
57 officers and five British soldiers wounded since trouble first
flared July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Orange leaders urged their supporters Tuesday to behave ''in a
totally peaceful manner'' and ''to be constant in prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But menacing groups of Protestants blocked more than a dozen
major roads in Belfast as darkness fell, a scene repeated in at
least 10 other predominantly Protestant towns.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, some of the worst trouble was brewing in Portadown,
a stronghold of Orange loyalties, where more than 2,000 soldiers
and police have spent the week barring Protestants from the town's
surrounded Catholic neighborhood, Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Police used attack dogs, clubs and shields to force a 100-strong
crowd away from one heavily defended entrance to Garvaghy Road.
After dark, a mob of drunken youths left a bonfire to barrage
police and soldiers with bottles and rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The intimidation wasn't all one way. Anti-Protestant arsonists
struck a rural Orange hall with gasoline bombs while a meeting was
going on inside. All six Protestants inside were hospitalized for
smoke inhalation. And British army bomb-disposal experts examined a
series of suspicious packages at other Orange lodges that turned
out to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Twelfth has always served to deepen intercommunal tensions
between British Protestants and Irish Catholics, who generally
loathe the marches, which they see as provocative.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, founded in 1795 near Portadown during another
period of tense rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, was
crucial to Northern Ireland's foundation as a Protestant-majority
state in the 1920s, when the predominantly Catholic rest of Ireland
broke free of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, its marches stirred much loathing but little
violence, largely because Orangemen paraded the same routes year
after year without challenge. But ever since 1995, when militant
Catholic groups began blocking a few key parades that pass near or
through Catholic areas, July has become a sectarian battleground.
</P>
<P>
   To Orange fury, British authorities gradually have opted to
block the most controversial processions in Belfast and Portadown
rather than provoke Catholic riots.
</P>
<P>
   A government-appointed Parades Commission has ordered Orangemen
to steer clear of several predominantly Catholic villages
Wednesday, as well as Lower Ormeau, a Catholic enclave beside a
major south Belfast road. In response, Belfast Orangemen plan to
divert their entire city parade to a park across the Lagan River
from Lower Ormeau.

<HEADLINE> US, China Vow Better Military Ties  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's defense chief assured U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday that although China reserves
the right to use force against Taiwan it does not intend to attack,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Chi Haotian, the Chinese defense minister, gave the
assurance during talks with Cohen and other senior U.S. officials
in Cohen's first visit to Beijing since China broke off military
relations with the United States last year in response to the
errant U.S. bombing of its embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official told reporters that Chi ''indicated they
have no intent to use force'' against Taiwan, the island which
split from the mainland in the 1949 communist revolution. The
official discussed Chi's comments from the closed-door meeting on
condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Prueher, the U.S. ambassador, told reporters after the
meeting that the Chinese delegation was approaching the sensitive
subject of Taiwan in a more positive manner than in the past. He
said that they were willing to discuss more than just the core
issue of reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a shift in a willingness to resolve differences,''
Prueher said.
</P>
<P>
   At a signing ceremony for an accord on sharing information about
military-related environmental protection measures, Chi was asked
by a reporter why China has been building up its force of ballistic
missiles within range of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is entirely China's own business,'' he replied, after
reiterating China's view that although Taiwan could retain a
noncommunist form of government it must become part of a single,
sovereign China.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Taiwan our policy is all too clear,'' Chi told reporters.
''It is a policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems. We have also made it very clear that we do not undertake
to give up the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to reporters Chi did not say China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what happens, the one-China principle will always be
there,'' Chi said. He took issue with the premise that China is
building up its ballistic missile force near the Taiwan Strait,
calling it ''an exaggeration of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said China has been adding about 50
shorter-range ballistic missiles a year to the coastline opposite
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after an initial round of talks, Cohen
said, ''I did mention the fact that I thought there could be a
reduction in tensions by a reduction in the missile threat
itself.'' He said he told Chi that the greater the missile threat
to Taiwan, the more Congress will press for U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said the Chinese delegation expressed China's
well-known opposition to U.S. efforts to develop a national missile
defense, and the Chinese insisted they are living up to prior
agreements to limit their exports of missile technology to Pakistan
and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen began the first day of his three-day visit to China by
attending a red-carpet welcoming ceremony, with his wife, Janet,
outside the August First complex, China's plush, new Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Under a blazing midsummer sun, Cohen and Chi stood side by side
at attention, a military honor guard before them, as a People's
Liberation Army band played both countries' national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcoming remarks, Chi told Cohen he had high hopes for
U.S.-China relations at ''this historic juncture'' of a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary's trip will help maintain the momentum of
improved relations between the two countries and further deepen our
mutual understanding and inject vitality to the long-term growth of
U.S.-China relations,'' Chi told Cohen through an interpreter.

   Chi indirectly touched upon the embassy bombing in May 1999 --
which Washington says was a mistake -- and China's suspension of
military contacts in retaliation. He noted that Cohen had to
postpone a planned visit last year ''due to reasons known to all.''

<P>
   Cohen, too, emphasized the positive and made no mention of
controversial issues in his opening remarks to Chi.
</P>
<P>
   ''While there is a tendency to focus on issues that are in
contention, you and I and all our delegations agree that there are
many, many issues in which we have a mutual interest in working
together on a cooperative basis,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   China-U.S. military ties have made fitful progress from their
start in the 1980s. Since then they have been roiled by U.S. anger
over the Chinese military's quelling of the Tiananmen Square
democracy demonstrations in 1989, the embassy bombing last year and
periodic tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that throughout good times and bad that
we always maintain the ability to have constructive dialogue and to
be able to sit across from one another and discuss issues openly,
frankly and honestly,'' Cohen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Robert Runcie, the 102nd Archbishop of Canterbury
who led the Church of England through a decade of theological
turmoil, has died. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie died overnight after a long battle with cancer, said a
spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace, the official home of the
archbishops of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie presided at the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess
Diana in 1981, and later tried unsuccessfully to heal the growing
rift between them.
</P>
<P>
   During his time as archbishop from 1980 to 1991, the Church of
England was beset by controversies over the ordination of women and
the introduction of modernized liturgies. He also pushed the church
to take a more liberal line on remarrying divorced people, an
effort that bore fruit after his retirement.

<HEADLINE> China Assures U.S. on Taiwan Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's defense chief assured U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday that although China reserves
the right to use force against Taiwan it does not intend to attack,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Chi Haotian, the Chinese defense minister, gave the
assurance during talks with Cohen and other senior U.S. officials
in Cohen's first visit to Beijing since China broke off military
relations with the United States last year in response to the
errant U.S. bombing of its embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official told reporters that Chi ''indicated they
have no intent to use force'' against Taiwan, the island which
split from the mainland in the 1949 communist revolution. The
official discussed Chi's comments from the closed-door meeting on
condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Prueher, the U.S. ambassador, told reporters after the
meeting that the Chinese delegation was approaching the sensitive
subject of Taiwan in a more positive manner than in the past. He
said that they were willing to discuss more than just the core
issue of reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a shift in a willingness to resolve differences,''
Prueher said.
</P>
<P>
   At a signing ceremony for an accord on sharing information about
military-related environmental protection measures, Chi was asked
by a reporter why China has been building up its force of ballistic
missiles within range of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is entirely China's own business,'' he replied, after
reiterating China's view that although Taiwan could retain a
noncommunist form of government it must become part of a single,
sovereign China.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Taiwan our policy is all too clear,'' Chi told reporters.
''It is a policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems. We have also made it very clear that we do not undertake
to give up the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments to reporters Chi did not say China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what happens, the one-China principle will always be
there,'' Chi said. He took issue with the premise that China is
building up its ballistic missile force near the Taiwan Strait,
calling it ''an exaggeration of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said China has been adding about 50
shorter-range ballistic missiles a year to the coastline opposite
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after an initial round of talks, Cohen
said, ''I did mention the fact that I thought there could be a
reduction in tensions by a reduction in the missile threat
itself.'' He said he told Chi that the greater the missile threat
to Taiwan, the more Congress will press for U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said the Chinese delegation expressed China's
well-known opposition to U.S. efforts to develop a national missile
defense, and the Chinese insisted they are living up to prior
agreements to limit their exports of missile technology to Pakistan
and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen began the first day of his three-day visit to China by
attending a red-carpet welcoming ceremony, with his wife, Janet,
outside the August First complex, China's plush, new Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Under a blazing midsummer sun, Cohen and Chi stood side by side
at attention, a military honor guard before them, as a People's
Liberation Army band played both countries' national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcoming remarks, Chi told Cohen he had high hopes for
U.S.-China relations at ''this historic juncture'' of a new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary's trip will help maintain the momentum of
improved relations between the two countries and further deepen our
mutual understanding and inject vitality to the long-term growth of
U.S.-China relations,'' Chi told Cohen through an interpreter.

<HEADLINE> GOP State Leaders Hopeful For Bush  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Although George W. Bush leads Vice
President Al Gore in national polls, state GOP party leaders in
swing states remain cautious about Bush's chances, saying it's too
early to get overly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a large percentage of people haven't made up their
minds,'' said Alan Novak, chairman of the GOP in Pennsylvania,
where polls show Bush running neck and neck with Gore. President
Clinton won Pennsylvania by 9 percentage points in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Novak and about 150 other party leaders and worker bees convene
in Texas on Wednesday to get an update on the Bush campaign,
headquartered in Austin. While there's sure to be a lot of rah-rah
sessions to energize the troops, state leaders will be
concentrating on how to push Bush's poll numbers up into more
comfortable ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular focus are so-called battleground states like
Pennsylvania, where voters have a history of swinging between both
major parties.
</P>
<P>
   Novak says polls show Bush attracting swing voters and
conservative Democrats. ''Right now Bush is running strong, but
it's only July,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders in states that should be in Gore's pocket -- but
aren't -- say they're working hard on the grass-roots level to build
Bush's base of support.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Northwest, where for the first time in several years a
GOP presidential candidate is running a competitive race. The party
hasn't carried the region since the 1984 presidential election.
Yet, Bush and Gore are in a dead heat in Washington and Oregon,
polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has visited Oregon three times in the last 12 months,
talking up his education initiatives, said Molly Bordornaro, who
chairs the state's Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The visits have attracted independent voters, many of whom are
upper middle class people under 40 who are concerned about
education because they're starting to have children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visits have also galvanized grass roots organizing and
helped the party raise money for state candidates. ''I've never
seen so much organization for a presidential race,'' she said. The
Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, has been running TV ads
around the state featuring Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bordornaro sounded cautious. ''While we are confident
about Bush's vision and message, I still know this is a close
race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While party leaders concentrate on boosting support for the GOP
on Main Street, Bush will focus on affairs of state in a meeting
with Henry Kissinger, who is advising him on foreign policy
matters. It's the first time Bush and former secretary of state
will have met one-on-one, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger and other foreign policy notables appeared with Bush
in May when he proposed a unilateral cut in U.S. nuclear arms.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Environment Cleanups  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) -- Using the NAACP convention as a
backdrop, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday was expected to
contrast his record on minority issues with his Republican
presidential opponent, George W. Bush, and to call on the Texas
governor to break a stalemate with the GOP-led Congress on cleaning
up abandoned industrial property.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking before the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People's annual convention in Baltimore,
planned to focus on how his agenda to increase the minimum wage,
create more empowerment zones, provide prescription drug benefits
for seniors would help all Americans, senior aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who is expected to receive the Democrats' presidential
nomination next month, also planned to discuss his efforts to end
racial profiling -- where police target minority drivers for traffic
stops -- and to pass a law increasing punishment for hate crime
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, broke
with recent traditions and spoke to the civil rights organization
on Monday. While he acknowledged his party's history with black
Americans was not good and he promised to do better, he did not
specify how to combat racism.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also did not address the controversy over the Confederate
battle flag nor the death penalty, despite hecklers in the audience
upset over the execution of Texas death row inmate Gary Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Gore's support comes from blacks -- particularly in the
South -- in part because of his link to President Clinton and also
because of the civil rights record of his father, the late Sen.
Albert Gore Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also planned to discuss how Baltimore and other urban areas
could be helped by revitalization of so-called ''brownfields,''
patches of land contaminated enough that developers are unwilling
to buy them, but not polluted enough to qualify for cleanup under
the federal Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   After the NAACP speech, Gore planned to tour a former soap and
detergent plant that will be remade into an office complex through
a $67 million renovation by a private company.
</P>
<P>
   He supports a bipartisan bill announced last month to remove
obstacles that have kept similar private businesses from buying and
restoring the land.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately pollution has some pretty powerful allies,''
Gore said in remarks prepared for Wednesday's tour.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has spent the week trying to tie Bush to GOP congressional
leaders, saying they're stalling popular legislation to aid special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   However, in April, Bush visited a Pennsylvania brownfield to
challenge the vice president's perceived strength as an
environmentalist with plans of his own to clean up contaminated
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   And their plans sound similar. For example, both say a
brownfield cleanup tax credit that is scheduled to expire Dec. 31
should be extended permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, which would require $4.2 billion over the next 10
years, also calls for :
</P>
<P>
   -- Legislation providing revolving loan accounts, grants and
relief from liability for companies rehabilitating industrial
sites.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bonds for state and local governments to clean up abandoned
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has suggested:
</P>
<P>
   --Directing the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards
for brownfield cleanups that are more flexible than existing
Superfund rules.
</P>
<P>
   Superfund was created under 1980 legislation aimed at cleaning
the most contaminated sites in the country. The GAO, Congress'
investigative arm, said fewer than half have been cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   -- Taking the intended use of a site into account, enforcing
strict standards if an old factory is slated to become a school,
but being more lenient if it will be demolished, capped or turned
into a new factory.

<HEADLINE> Russian Proton-K Rocket Lifts Off  </HEADLINE>
By MIKHAIL METZEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAIKONUR, Kazakstan (AP) -- The Russian Proton-K rocket that is
carrying the long-delayed International Space Station's service
module into orbit lifted off Wednesday from the Baikonur
cosmodrome.
</P>
<P>
   At Mission Control outside Moscow, Russian and U.S. space agency
officials watching a live broadcast applauded as the module went
into orbit 10 minutes later and again when solar panels and then
several antennas unfolded on the module. A huge screen in front of
them tracked the flight from the cosmodrome on the remote, win
dswept steppes of Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians pulled back the launch tower from the huge rocket
about half an hour before the 8:56 a.m. liftoff. A large logo
advertising Pizza Hut had been placed about halfway up the rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States have invested high hopes in the
Zvezda module, which will be the core of the 16-nation space
station project. The module will contain flight controls, the
sewage system and sleeping quarters for the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russia says that the 22-ton, 43-foot-long segment cost about
$320 million to build. It has severely taxed Moscow's meager
financial resources and thrown the U.S.-led space station project
more than two years behind schedule, casting doubts on Russia's
reliability as a major partner.
</P>
<P>
   The launch could have come sooner if not for two crashes of
Proton rockets. Russia insisted problems with the rocket have been
worked out, and it has put several satellites into orbit with the
help of Proton rockets since the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great joy that our Russian module is in orbit but we
still have some worries,'' said Vladimir Lobachev, director of
Mission Control. ''If the docking goes successfully, then we'll
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zvezda module went into orbit unmanned, and will dock July
26 by computer with two other space station components that were
launched in 1998. The first crew could go to the station by
October, NASA has said.
</P>
<P>
   Two cosmonauts will be prepared to immediately launch to Zvezda
aboard a Soyuz rocket if the automatic linkup goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A failed launch would have been a major setback for the project
and Russia's attempts to retain its image as a leading space power,
which it gained by putting the first satellite and the first man
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Delays on the Zvezda -- which means ''star'' in Russian -- have
already cost the project an estimated $3 billion, and some members
of the U.S. Congress are questioning whether to fund NASA's
spending projections on the $60 billion project, particularly after
the failed launches of two Mars missions last year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has also been irritated by a Russian decision
to keep the 14-year old Mir space station aloft.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of cosmonauts returned in June from a successful
two-month stint on the station, whose resiliency after hundreds of
breakdowns and accidents gives Russian space officials considerable
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting office has accused Russia of failing
to meet NASA safety standards in building Zvezda, saying the
module's magnesium and aluminum skin may not adequately protect
against collisions with space junk and that equipment will fail if
cabin pressure is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Russia insists that Zvezda is reliable and that the ISS is a
priority, and President Vladimir Putin has promised that the
country will meet its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Zvezda launch costs were partly defrayed by U.S. pizza chain
Pizza Hut, which put a giant advertisement on the side of the
Proton rocket. The ad was not visible Tuesday, with the rocket
mostly covered by scaffolding from the launch tower.
</P>
<P>
   The station is still nowhere near complete. Dozens more modules
have to be built, and the station is expected to be finished by

<HEADLINE> Penn.'s Cell Phone Ban Thrown Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A town ordinance banning motorists from
using handheld cell phones has been overturned by a judge who said
it bucked state traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
   Common Pleas Judge David Heckler granted a motion Tuesday to
dismiss the charge against a man cited in February for using his
cell phone while driving through Hilltown Township, near
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Young, 42, argued that the law should be uniform statewide,
saying he did not know about the ordinance and had not been aware
he was in Hilltown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very concerned about safety. I think this is just kind of
punitive,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Hilltown's ban was enacted in December, a month after 2-year-old
Morgan Lee Pena died when a driver who was using a cell phone
allegedly ran a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance carries a $75 fine. Exceptions are allowed for
dialing 911, ''hands-free'' phones or for people using phones while
their vehicles are parked.
</P>
<P>
   Heckler declared the rule ''null and void,'' saying it was
''pre-empted'' by portions of the state motor vehicle code dealing
with careless driving.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bennington, chairman of the Hilltown's board of supervisors,
said officials had not reviewed the decision or decided whether to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   No state bans the use of wireless phones in automobiles, and
only California, Florida and Massachusetts have laws limiting cell
phone use in moving vehicles, according to the National Conference
of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries have banned the use of cell phones while
driving. A 1997 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found
that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of an
accident and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the
wheel.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Suggest Settlements  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The nation's leading cigarette maker would rather
pay millions than billions if a jury decides the tobacco industry
should pay punitive damages in a case involving up to 700,000 sick
Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dan Webb, who represents Philip Morris Inc., doesn't
want jurors to award punitive damages at all. But he suggested
during closing arguments Tuesday that $75 million would be ''a fair
amount'' for his company, based on ready cash and the percentage of
customers living in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The amount would average to $150 per person if split among a
mid-range estimate of 500,000 sick smokers covered by the landmark
class-action lawsuit. Philip Morris is being asked to pay the most
money among the five tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have argued that they should not be required to
pay any more than their combined net worth of $15.3 billion, the
difference between their assets and liabilities. The smokers have
asked for $123 billion to $196 billion, with a suggested amount of
$154 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a request for a death warrant for each of these five
companies,'' said Webb, the lead tobacco attorney in the case.
''That amount will destroy each of these companies, not once, but
10 times over.''
</P>
<P>
   The four other tobacco companies -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown
&AMP; Williamson Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and Liggett Group -- were to
give their closing arguments Wednesday and Thursday. The jury could
get the case by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury already has decided that the industry makes
a deadly, defective product and awarded $12.7 million in
compensatory damages to the three representative smokers. The jury
must now decide how much to award in punitive damages, which are
intended to punish and deter misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The key tobacco defense is that the industry has changed its
ways since states began suing in 1994, and that $257 billion in
settlements with the states is punishment enough.
</P>
<P>
   The case -- the first smokers' class-action lawsuit to go to
trial -- represents the gravest financial threat to the industry
since the settlements. Any decision will be appealed and could take
at least two years to move through Florida's courts.
</P>
<P>
   Under Florida law, a punitive damages verdict cannot put a
company out of business, and judges are required to reduce any
award that would. In addition, some tobacco states in recent months
have passed laws to protect the tobacco companies from having to
post a ruinous amount of money while they appeal.

one of the country's most recognized figures.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Detroit native came to the Caribbean country a
year ago on a lark and stumbled into stardom as a sidekick
character on the Caribbean country's most popular afternoon radio
program. She became instantly recognizable by her distinctive voice
and American accent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the first time I went on the program, people have been
like, 'I heard you on the radio!''' she said. ''People treat me
like a princess.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinges is the foil for Jochy Santos on Rumbo Radio's ''Botando
El Golpe'' -- which roughly translates as ''Letting off steam'' --
which rules the airwaves from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. with Dominican
meringue, 1970s Motown, and a host that is part Jerry Seinfeld and
part Howard Stern. Dinges' job is to provide the curious American's
perspective, and much of the humor derives from her charmingly
rendered innocence about Dominican ways and lingo.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent show, Dinges called a woman who reads fortunes
from coffee grinds. People on the show chatted about ways to
predict the future, including the popular Dominican way of reading
someone's urine. Jokes flew back and forth and by the end of the
day, half the country seemed caught up in speculation about how to
predict political leaders' fortunes this way.
</P>
<P>
   On another show, Santos was astonished to discover Dinges had
never sampled a beloved local cocktail mixing Clamato -- a tomato
juice-based punch -- and the powerful local beer.
</P>
<P>
   ''What? With beer?'' Dinges exclaimed. ''We don't usually mix
anything with beer.'' Santos wasted no time. ''The American must
try Clamato! Would the grocery please send up a can?''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes the Clamato was dispatched from across the
street. As national honor hung in the balance, Dinges sipped.
''It's good,'' she conceded. ''But I'm not sure I'd like it in
beer.'' Her popularity survived the delicate episode undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   Dinges graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor,
where she majored in literature and worked at the college radio
station as a disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Santo Domingo thinking it would be a good way to
learn Spanish -- a little adventure in a developing country before
settling down to a real job.
</P>
<P>
   She started teaching English and met Santos through one of her
students.
</P>
<P>
   The radio star was immediately struck by Dinges' perspective on
Dominican culture -- which is Latin but at the same time very
connected to the United States, with whom it shares a love of
baseball and to whom it has sent as many as a million immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has a way of seeing things that's interesting, and she's
very good on the air,'' said Santos, who has also hosted his
protege on his Saturday afternoon television variety show. ''Amy is
already a personality here. ... She could go far with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinges isn't in a hurry to go back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I could be a DJ here. But if I'm going to do
something, it's got to involve me thinking, not just ... Amy being
cute.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she's looking for a local cause to promote -- possibly
literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Dinges has run the show herself when Santos was late, taking
calls from Dominican men who wanted to meet her. She even has a
following among Dominicans in the United States, who listen to her
show on the Internet -- where she is pictured and identified simply
as ''La Americana'' -- and send her e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fame thing, I just think of it as kind of cool. It's given
me a great way to learn about Dominican culture ... People here
have really made me feel welcome, everywhere I go.''
</P>
<P>
   After doing the show twice a week for about six months, her
Spanish is now almost fluent, laced with local phrases only a
Dominican would understand. Petite, with fair skin and reddish
hair, she stands out in a country where African ancestry is
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   People approach her at fast food restaurants, in malls, on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   One taxi driver recognized her by a sentence fragment before she
even entered his cab.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're Amy, aren't you?'' he exclaimed, pushing open the door.
''I always listen to you!''
</P>
<P>
   The cab ride was free.

<HEADLINE> FTC Cracks Down on Web Pharmacies  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a crackdown on Web sites offering Viagra
and other drugs targeting sexual dysfunction, several online
pharmacies agreed to stop current business practices to settle
charges that they made untrue claims about their facilities and
charged customers unfairly, the Federal Trade Commission said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC made similar complaints against 10 defendants: Sandra L.
Rennert and Philip Rennert of Las Vegas, International Outsourcing
Group, Focus Medical Group, Trimline, Affordable Accents, Worldwide
RX, WorldWide Medicine, PSRenn and Doctors A.S.A.P.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC alleged that the Web sites claimed they had ''full
service clinics'' with a ''full time staff,'' and that their
doctors ''network with an organization of physicians throughout the
United States and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''network of physicians'' consisted of one doctor in a
distant state, according to the agency, and none of the sites had
onsite pharmacies. The prescriptions were filled at a local drug
store.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers were asked to answer questions about their medical
history on a ''Secure Viagra Order Form,'' and paid $75 for the
medical consultation. According to the FTC, the information was
faxed to a doctor who reviewed it and approved or denied a Viagra
prescription -- but the doctor was only paid his $10 fee if he
approved the request.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also stated that 11,000 customers received
unsolicited e-mail informing them that their credit cards would be
billed $50 for ''Y2K remediation.'' It is illegal to charge a
person's credit card without prior authorization.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Worldwidemedicine.com Web site announces the
creation of a new company, Doctors2000.com. That company, which
also provides Viagra, Propecia and other prescription drugs, is
taking orders for Worldwidemedicine.com, focusmedical.com,
doctorsasap.com and worldrx.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Doctors2000.com site says it is owned by Capital Placement,
based in the British West Indies, though on public registration
records its Web address belongs to Capital Placements in Henderson,
Nev. Sandra Rennert, who was named individually as a defendant by
the FTC, is listed as the contact for the address.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements, which do not constitute an admission of guilt
by the defendants, bar the companies from their current trade
practices and prohibit the defendants from passing on customers'
personal information.

<HEADLINE> Calls To Identity Theft Hotline Soar  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calls to the Federal Trade Commission's
identity theft consumer hotline have doubled since March, the
agency told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is handling about 850 calls per week, twice the number
of calls taken the last time Congress held a hearing on the subject
of identity theft. FTC representatives counsel victims on how to
check with credit reporting agencies to protect their credit
histories and finances.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's Web site also provides information on identity theft,
and the agency will soon begin working with the top credit
companies to streamline the complaints process.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of identity theft has gripped the public as few
consumer issues have,'' Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's
consumer protection bureau, told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the calls made to the FTC's phone number,
1-877-ID-THEFT, were to report credit card fraud, where an account
was opened in the victim's name or an existing account was taken
over by another person.
</P>
<P>
   Victims also complained of utility accounts, like telephone or
cellular service, opened in their name, bank fraud and fraudulent
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 60 percent of the callers knew the thief's name, address
or phone number, and a quarter reported that they knew the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The reported costs of identity theft varies widely. About 18
percent of callers reported a theft of over $10,000, but most
reported losses of under $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC plans a workshop on how to help victims of identity
theft in the fall, and is working with other federal agencies to
combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Heightened awareness by consumers and businesses will help
reduce the occurrences of this fraud,'' Bernstein said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose in early trading Wednesday, fueled
by strength in technology shares after Internet giant Yahoo!
reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 16.98 at 10,744.17.

<P>
   Broader stock indicators also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

to $46.688.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed

   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the
country's improved productivity, which analysts took as a sign that
inflation may be in check.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been signs that the pace of the
economy is slowing down, and without any inflationary pressures,
investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates
after six rate hikes in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, however, were still watching their moves ahead
of another speech from Greenspan on Wednesday night at a conference
organized by the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 139.28 million

   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.76 at 533.50.

<HEADLINE> Jeweler Sues Michael Jackson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- A Beverly Hills jewelry store is
suing Michael Jackson for more than $1.4 million, claiming he
agreed to buy a rare diamond watch, used it for nearly four months
without paying for it, then returned it damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that Jackson made a verbal agreement in
December with Rodeo Drive retailer David Orgell to purchase the
King Kalla Vacheron Constantine watch originally valued at $1.9
million, reduced by $450,000 through bartering.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court in
Santa Monica, also seeks $15,000 owed on other items purchased at
the store this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson spokesman Howard Rubenstein said in a statement Tuesday
that the singer never made a final decision to purchase the watch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employees of David Orgell delivered the watch to Mr. Jackson
for his approval,'' the statement said. ''Those same employees
engaged in repeated conversations in which they were advised that a
final decision had not been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Soltani, vice president of David Orgell, said that Jackson
returned the watch with scratches and unknown particles between the
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that it came to a head in court,'' Soltani
said.

<HEADLINE> Perfection From Yves Saint Laurent  </HEADLINE>
By SUZY PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Yves Saint Laurent did it again. On Wednesday he
came up with a fall haute couture collection that was just about
perfect: elegant, opulent, beautiful, clean. No showy stuff
cluttered up this master's work.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Laurent has toned down his lifestyle in recent years, but
this new sobriety does not hurt his work. He has cut down to fine
lines, pared away to show the best without forgetting a taffeta
puff or sable trim for party variety.
</P>
<P>
   The daytime wear was terrific. Pleated-front gray pants with a
tiny bolero and little velvet vest introduced the show in the
Intercontinental Hotel ballroom,
</P>
<P>
   There were umpteen suits with fitted jackets and swirly,
knee-length circle skirts. Gray and lichen green flannels were
outstanding here, shown with the new t-shirt blouse, in cloque
fabrics and dark velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Some may criticize Saint Laurent's return to squarely padded
shoulders in jackets. ''But they make your hips look smaller,''
said Annick Huet, a longtime Saint Laurent fan.
</P>
<P>
   The soft suede brick-pink straight tunic-dress with large short
sleeves and convenient pockets is original and a good travel
number.
</P>
<P>
   From raspberry or blue-flecked tweed skirt suits to a straight
mink coat with a sweater and skirt, everything looked top quality.
This is a Saint Laurent hallmark, undoubtedly noted by Tom Ford in
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the fashion head of Gucci, which has taken over Saint
Laurent's ready-to-wear and accessories, has much to mull over, as
he ponders how to follow an act like Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son will definitely keep on with couture, until he wants or
needs to quit,'' said Saint Laurent's elegant mother, Lucienne,
after the show.
</P>
<P>
   In a bow to his beloved Moroccan home, Saint Laurent showed a
few beautiful ethnic-looking hooded draped crepe gowns. In petrol
blue, brown and black, they were shown without jewels, but were
more elegant than on the streets of Marrakesh.
</P>
<P>
   Velvet long gowns with tulle gussets at the flared hems, daring
numbers where the ruffled or feathered coat came off to reveal
nearly nude torsos, covered mainly in pearls, romantic iridescent
taffeta ball dresses showed the total Saint Laurent look.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot see couture more perfect than this,'' said Bettina
Graziani at an after-show cocktail. And she should know. She's been
a fashion watcher since starting as Givenchy's top model in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing is that even rich, fashionable women don't much
want to wear such clothes today. You have to be daring, and nobody
is anymore,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Lacroix had his own way with dressy haute couture,
putting on a fabulous display in the neo-classic hall of the Beaux
Arts school.
</P>
<P>
   He called it ''high attitude,'' and it was definitely high
priced. Luxury began with the sleeveless puffy orange mink coat and
short ivory jersey dress trimmed in blond fur and went zipping
right along in rainbow colors and a million details.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a short silvery suit embroidered in copper buttons,
re-embroidered with little chains and I.D. bracelets. The lily
might have been over-gilded, but it looked fine, in a nice,
feminine cut.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix's opulent show of sensual fabrics and clothes was so
eclectic that the moment seemed to lack focus. There were slim
pants, full pants, fur trims, ostrich-feather boas, slim skirts,
full ballerina styles, a plethora of choice, but aimed like
scattershot, something for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best fantasies was the short siren-red faille dress
with its asymmetric skirt, its black feathered trim, its bows and
an enormous black rose.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the details-overload and exuberant incoherence, this
is a great collection, wearable by the true -- and very rich --
couture lover.
</P>
<P>
   Hanae Mori's presentation was an example of delicate simplicity.
Her black alligator blouson over the ruffled tulle skirt with
snakeskin-printed blouse was subtle and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Stained-glass embroideries on a black tuxedo suit were just
perfect for little elegant dinners.
</P>
<P>
   After some lovely evening clothes -- such as a white satin long
gown with an outsized rose motif on the skirt - this successful
Japanese went back to her roots. There were none of her romantic
butterflies this time, but she did parade a fabulous gold tunic
handpainted with Japanese scenes over a bright pink skirt.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rises 76, Dow Up 32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Wednesday, fueled by strength in
technology shares after Internet giant Yahoo! reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 32.18 at 10,759.37.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 6.70 at 1,487.58, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 75.69 at 4,032.11.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-quarter earnings season just getting under way,
a strong showing from Yahoo! helped boost the technology sector,
which had been battered in recent weeks on fears that
second-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s shares rose $14.688 to $120.188. CMGI was also higher,
rising $3.625 at $30.125, as was eBay, which gained $3.625 to
$47.563.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed
better-than-expected reports from International Paper and Alcoa
earlier this week, which helped give a lift to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While individual earnings reports have boosted stocks in recent
days, analysts said that the market still lacks direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, a strong day for value-biased stocks because of
International Paper's earnings. Today, we have Yahoo! pulling up
the tech stocks,'' said Brian Belski, vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ''But the question is: What will tomorrow
bring? There is still a lot of indecision in the market and the
performance has been very varied.''
</P>
<P>
   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the

<HEADLINE> Blind Musician Plays the Road  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA R. MOSES
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Robert Bradley is on the road again -- but it's
sure not like it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Back before there was Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise,
before the MTV video and the national tour, there was the blind man
with the guitar and stool riding the Greyhound from city to city
for 18 years. Bradley would hop off the bus, hang out on street
corners and play songs he made up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   He hung a cup from his neck so he could feel the weight of the
coins that people dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever I hear people walking I just start to play. Play for
an hour, make a hundred bucks and get back on the bus,'' Bradley
says of his street-playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's the gravelly-voiced lead singer of Robert Bradley's
Blackwater Surprise, a mix of blues, rock, funk and soul that has
yielded two albums, an MTV video and an appearance on ''Late Night
With Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 copies of the band's first, self-titled album were
sold. The band is now on tour promoting its second album, ''Time to
Discover.''
</P>
<P>
   Its sound relies on the rolling, soulful singing of Bradley,
whose voice can move from raspy to falsetto. It's what
Entertainment Weekly called
''old-fashioned-soul-meets-pop-rock-synthesis.'' Blackwater
Surprise bassist Andrew Nehra calls it classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past you had real stars making real music. They were
timeless,'' Nehra says. ''We're interested in making music that is
timeless.''
</P>
<P>
   The band was created in the third-floor studio of a virtually
abandoned downtown Detroit building after Nehra and his brother
Mike heard Bradley playing on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an acoustic thing it was great, but it needed a band,''
Andrew Nehra says.
</P>
<P>
   Knee-deep in their own projects, the Nehra brothers weren't
thinking that they might be that band. And Bradley wasn't
interested anyway. Playing informal venues was his thing -- he'd
been doing it since he was about 11 and sang in churches with some
of his eight sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Then they started playing together.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally, it just had the magic to it,'' Nehra says. ''And
that day we just knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's first album came out in 1996. Many of the songs came
from Bradley's cache of material from half a life spent on the
road, a place where the stories in the songs just came to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''People would sit down, talk to you, tell you their problems,''
says Bradley, who at age 50 figures he's probably written 1,000
songs. ''I had guys come up to me and tell me they killed people
and what should they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his songs are about other people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just writing about how someone else told me they were in
love. ... I like to write about other folks. It seems like their
life more interesting than mine. You get bored with yourself,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The song ''Tramp 2'' could be the story of Bradley's life, with
lines like ''I was born on a farm in Alabama'' and ''Rollin' down
the road in the Motor City.'' But he insists it's mostly the
stories that 1960s ''tramps'' or hitchhikers used to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandfather had a little store and they'd stop and get a
pop and they'd tell these stories,'' Bradley says. ''It was
basically about people traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was born in Evergreen, Ala., one of 14 children living
on a 500-acre farm. ''Some folks said we were poor, but I never
knew it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He sang and played piano in churches, getting paid sometimes
with money the congregation donated. His musical influences then
included Otis Redding, Hank Williams Sr. and Ray Charles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just amazing to me that this was a blind person and he
was doing this,'' Bradley says of Charles.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 16, his family moved to Detroit. He stayed for a
year, went to California for awhile, got married and moved back to
Alabama with his wife, whom he eventually divorced. He ran a state
store for the blind and played locally. But the quiet, home life
just wasn't for him.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to be on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He started traveling in 1974, settling in Detroit in 1977 and --
when not on the road -- often playing at the city's Eastern Market,
a farmer's market where he says he could make $700 a day. But that
came to an end in 1991, when the city started cracking down on
people who hung out in the streets. Bradley headed out West for
awhile, but then returned to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1992 that the Nehra brothers heard his voice floating
up through their studio window. When they jammed together, Nehra
says, the sound was ''real untried and effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it's his blindness, but he has a vision in a
way, an interpretation that's just different,'' the bassist says.
''The songs are real simple, real moving. The music is real
visual.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bradley's years on the road, or his time in California
going to see stars like James Taylor, Led Zeppelin and Johnny Cash
at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go, have helped him find his sound. Or maybe
it's just his love of the song.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise is catching
on. The latest album features fellow Detroiter Kid Rock on two
tracks and is selling at the rate of 1,000 to 2,000 copies a week
since its March release. The band is on a 5&AMP;frac12;-week tour in cities
including Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just going to be a party, with a little work mixed in,''
Bradley says. ''But it ain't work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be. From the churches of Alabama to the streets of
Detroit, his life's been spent singing for the love of music and
playing to an audience he couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ''They make you feel like more than what you are ... but you're
just like them. We're all the same.''

<HEADLINE> 'X-Men' Marks the Spot  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There are mutants among you. They may look
the same as everyone else, dress the same, walk and talk the same.
</P>
<P>
   But they share one notable difference. They are ''X-men'' fans,
and their day has finally come.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sometimes have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
that the X-men movie is actually coming out next week!'' read a
recent Internet posting last week, one of tens of thousands of fan
messages floating around the Web about ''X-men,'' which opens
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the wildly popular Marvel Comics series, the X-men are
outcasts whose genetic mutations give them such powers as
telepathy, rapid healing and shape-shifting. Fans have awaited a
big-screen treatment of their favorite comic heroes and villains
for as long or longer than audiences yearned for a new ''Star
Wars'' flick.
</P>
<P>
   Countingdown.com, which sets up Web sites for hotly anticipated
movies, has found ''X-men'' fans' eagerness ''leap years ahead'' of
that for other big films, according to site co-founder Phillip
Nakov.
</P>
<P>
   About 71,000 ''X-men'' notes had been posted on
Countingdown.com's message board in the past month and a half,
compared with just a few hundred for movies like ''Mission:
Impossible 2'' and ''The Perfect Storm,'' Nakov says.
</P>
<P>
   The real question for ''X-men'' is whether the story of genetic
mutants living among bigoted ''normal'' humans will have crossover
appeal for mainstream moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel, which launched ''X-men'' in the early 1960s, has
embarked on a merchandising blitz pegged to the movie, counting on
its potential beyond comic-book readers.
</P>
<P>
   Avi Arad, chief executive of Marvel Studios, said the thoughtful
themes of discrimination and alienation should help attract movie
viewers who have never read the comic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all felt like outcasts in one way or another,'' Arad
says. ''Being smart or stupid, too tall or short, the feeling of
'Oh, I'm different.' We're all mutants in our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's based on powerful, universal themes of people trying to
make their place in a world that to a certain extent doesn't want
them,'' says Chris Claremont, a longtime writer for the ''X-men''
comic books. ''It's about the search for family and identity and
making a home.''
</P>
<P>
   To broaden the movie's appeal, filmmakers lined up a diverse
ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry,
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin, an Academy
Award-winner for ''The Piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Costume designers also dispensed with the characters' gaudy
comic-book attire, developing more low-key, realistic outfits. That
understated approach should help attract non-comic fans, says Rob
Worley, who runs the Web site Comics2Film.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't set out to make a campy adaptation, like the
'Batman' TV series. They didn't put a canary yellow suit on a guy
with blue underwear on the outside, like in the comic book,''
Worley says.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to widen the audience, however, have led to Internet
criticism from die-hard fans, who have complained about the
characters' look, the casting and the exclusion of many comic-book
mutants from the film.
</P>
<P>
   Some have griped that Janssen's hair and eyes do not match those
of her character, Jean Grey, who had flaming orange locks and green
eyes in the comic books. One fan last week suggested that drag
queen RuPaul would have been a better choice than Berry for the
mutant Storm. Another would have preferred Tom Cruise to Australian
actor Hugh Jackman for the mutant Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise is ''short and stocky just like Wolverine,'' the fan
wrote. ''Just add sideburns and that interview with a vampire
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ''X-men'' fans are passionate, says Bryan Singer, the movie's
director. ''The sheer volume of what they've posted about the movie
is what I find fascinating,'' he says. ''There will always be some
who will have trouble divorcing themselves from their perception of
the comic book.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer said a live-action carbon copy of the comics would be
impossible, but that the movie is faithful to the ''X-men'' world
and philosophy -- ''the concept of being outcasts and surviving and
being productive in a world that at times can be oppressive.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, who plays the mutant Magneto, has his own ''X-men''
site, where he posts information about the movie. In a fantasy way,
he says, ''X-men'' mutants are standing in for ethnic groups, gays,
women or others who have been involved in civil-rights movements.
The conflict between the rabble-rousing Magneto and his more benign
mutant friend Professor X (Stewart) reflects the different
approaches of black civil-rights leaders in the 1960s, McKellen
says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you forcibly insist upon your rights or quietly work for
change?'' McKellen says. ''Bryan Singer pointed out when we first
met that in a way, Professor X is like Martin Luther King and
Magneto is Malcolm X.''
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox, which is releasing the movie, has tried to
incite ''X-men'' mania with the whimsical Web site MutantWatch.com.
The site is ''sponsored'' by Senator Kelly, a politician in the
comic books and movie who preaches racism and McCarthyism against
the mutants.
</P>
<P>
   If Internet users fail to notice the ''paid for by the stop the
X-men campaign'' in tiny type at the bottom of MutantWatch.com,
they might think they were viewing a hate site set up by a wacko
who really believes mutants walk among us.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kelly (played in the movie by Bruce Davison) campaigns
for his ''mutant-registry'' bill, which would encourage teachers to
finger disruptive students whom they suspect are genetically
enhanced. The site also includes a ''genetic-purity'' quiz and
allows Internet users to report friends as ''mutants'' in jest.
</P>
<P>
   Countingdown.com set up a Web site dedicated to stopping the
''maniacal ravings'' of Senator Kelly. The group also plans an
anti-Kelly rally in Los Angeles on Thursday, the day before the
movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just letting everyone know who this man really is, what
his issues are, and allowing mutants around the world to talk about
their experiences with discrimination and being different and being
persecuted,'' Nakov joked.
</P>
<P>
   While such efforts are all in good fun, fans take the ''X-men''
very seriously, debating the tiniest detail with the same devotion
''Star Trek'' enthusiasts show for their universe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the comic books, this is the most important,'' says
Denmon Sherman, 30, of Los Angeles, an ''X-men'' fan since
childhood and creator of his own fan Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's got the best message, and it's a lot deeper. It's not
just about superheroes,'' he says. ''These people didn't ask to be
what they are. It's about judging people based on who they are
rather than what you think they are.''

<HEADLINE> BOOKS AND AUTHORS: Africa Love Story  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   GISENYI, Rwanda (AP) -- Love brought Rosamund Halsey Carr to the
heart of Africa half a century ago, and it is love that now holds
her in this breathlessly beautiful place that is as volatile as the
simmering volcano that looms nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What anchors her is the love she has for the children whose
parents were hacked and shot to death in Rwanda's killing frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This country that I love has given me much. Its people are my
strength, and its children my greatest joy,'' Carr writes in the
prologue to ''Land of a Thousand Hills: My Life in Rwanda,'' her
ode to the tiny central African nation whose name most often
conjures up the awesome death and destruction of the 1994 genocide
in which at least half a million people were slaughtered on the
orders of an extremist government.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, an elegant, energetic 87, first arrived in Rwanda from New
York City in 1949, a newspaper fashion illustrator hoping to shore
up her seven-year marriage to English explorer and big game hunter
Kenneth Carr, a man many years her senior who had enthralled her
with his stories of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage didn't survive, but 52 years later, Carr is
knee-deep in children, orphans of both the minority Tutsis and
majority Hutus who died since the genocide was unleashed on April
7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted it to be a sort of love story,'' she says. ''But the
fact that there is no reconciliation in sight here is heartbreaking
to me. ... There has to be reconciliation in this country for the
people who lost everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr was among the foreign nationals evacuated from Rwanda four
days after the genocide began. In August 1994, she was one of the
first to return -- to her beloved home in Mugongo, 12 miles
northwest of Gisenyi in the foothills of the Virguna mountains
where she first grew pyrethrum, a flower that produces a natural
insecticide, and later raised flowers for export.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Hutu rebel attacks in northwestern Rwanda again forced
Carr, the last of the foreign plantation owners in the country, to
leave Mugongo, but this time she also had Imbabazi, the orphanage
she and her longtime helper and colleague, Sembagare, set up in a
shed she had used for drying flowers. The orphanage has since found
temporary quarters in Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
   She is desperate to return to her stone cottage in Mugongo that
has been sacked and burned several times by rebels and government
soldiers, but everyone says it would be mad to take the 100
children with her.
</P>
<P>
   Hutu militiamen known as Interahamwe carried out much of the
orgy of killing that took place over 100 days in 1994. When Tutsi
rebels overthrew the extremist Hutu government responsible for the
genocide, the militiamen fled west into the then-Zaire. Tens of
thousands remain in today's Congo, many now in the Congolese army.
Their presence is a gnawing threat to Rwanda and a key ingredient
in the region's volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Imbabazi, which is still looking for a permanent home, has 20
longtime supporters, including the primate section of the zoo in
Columbus, Ohio, which Carr first knew when it funded research on
the mountain gorillas that live in the foothills above her farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the genocide, they were ashamed to send money to
gorillas, not people,'' she says over lunch in her temporary home
in Gisenyi on a boulevard of faded elegance that runs along Lake
Kivu.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all those who have written about Rwanda since 1994 -- and
their numbers keep growing -- have approached it as a case study,
attempting to decipher how one part of a society could turn on
another with such fury. Many of the authors had never heard of
Rwanda before the genocide, and few had set foot there.
</P>
<P>
   Carr's story, published by Viking, is about the long-term love
affair between a woman and a country. But it is also a fascinating,
forthright historical account told by one who lived it, with an eye
for nuance and detail.
</P>
<P>
   It might never have happened had it not been for her niece, Ann
Halsey, who vaguely remembered Carr's departure for Africa when she
was a little girl. Forty years later, she traveled to Rwanda in
1989 for the first time, and as she got to know ''Roz,'' she knew
her aunt had to write her story.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time the orphanage opened, everything was upside down
in her life, and it was obvious she was never going to have time to
sit down and do this,'' says Halsey, who quit her job and became
her aunt's Boswell. ''She never dreamed in a million years the book
would be published, but she gave me free rein to go and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Carr had tried writing about Rwanda. She had a story
published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1952, but Coronet
rejected another one about elephants, arguing that it had ''no
dramatic ending.''
</P>
<P>
   People would repeatedly ask Carr why she liked living in Rwanda
and why she stayed. Now that the names of Congo and Rwanda usually
signify only death and destruction, it's often hard to explain.
</P>
<P>
   The region was -- and still is -- incredibly beautiful and
fertile, blessed with rich volcanic soil, generous rainfall and a
temperate climate. A band of minor European nobility had ended up
in the area in the 1940s and '50s on large plantations growing
pyrethrum or raising cattle. They hunted, loved, raised children
and held elegant dinner parties -- and didn't know what hit them
when the Congo gained independence in 1960, and they were forced to
flee.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when Mademoiselle de Gallberg, a Russian
orphan adopted by a French marquis, fell in love with a Belgian
marquis who built the house in which Carr now lives, back when
Gisenyi was the keystone in what the Belgians hoped would be a
major tourist destination centered on the volcanic lakes that form
the western edge of the Great Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was fortunate to be living in the Belgian trust territory
of Ruanda-Urundi, which gained independence in 1962 as Rwanda and
Burundi. Despite a great social upheaval that resulted in the mass
expulsion of the Tutsis, sowing the seeds for future disaster, the
few foreigners living in Rwanda went about their business
unmolested.
</P>
<P>
   Her plans to return to Mugongo on hold, Carr is now in the
process of moving her 100 children plus 22 staff and their families
to new, 17-room quarters for Imbabazi, whose name means ''the
generous one'' in the national language, Kinyarwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In her spare time, she is active in the Unity Club, an
organization of the wives of Rwandan government officials,
diplomats and other women working for reconciliation between Hutus
and Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, when she returns from work at the orphanage,
which needs paint, fencing, latrines and a kitchen, the sky over
Lake Kivu glows with the last traces of the setting sun. She
surveys the scene from her garden and considers herself one of the
happiest women in the world.

<HEADLINE> BOOKS AND AUTHORS: Confederacy Thorn  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The newly formed Confederacy was ready to
go to war if the Union tried to reinforce Fort Pickens, defended by
only 47 soldiers and 30 untrained sailors, at the mouth of
Pensacola Bay in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements had arrived on Feb. 6 but remained aboard a
warship anchored in the Gulf of Mexico, unable to disembark under
terms of a truce.
</P>
<P>
   Secret orders to reinforce Pickens despite the truce arrived
with an unwitting assist from a Confederate general more than two
months later after being delayed by Union blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight Union soldiers and 110 Marines finally landed on
April 12 only hours after Confederates bombarded another fort in
South Carolina. The Civil War had begun at Fort Sumter, not
Pickens. Pensacola's role in the conflict and the events leading up
to it was largely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ''If word had gotten down here 36 hours before, the war would
have started here,'' historian George F. Pearce says. ''That
reinforcement would have been the declaration of war without a shot
being fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of West Florida professor emeritus has tried to
bring Pensacola out from the backwaters of Civil War history with a
book published this year by the University Press of Florida. Its
title is ''Pensacola During the Civil War: A Thorn in the Side of
Confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearce contends the South's failure to capture Pickens helped
the North maintain a naval blockade that strangled the Confederacy.
Blockade runners could have used Pensacola's excellent harbor, but
they never would have gotten past Pickens' guns.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Confederates abandoned Florida's largest city
in May 1862, 13 months after the war began. Pensacola's population
went from 2,867 to 83 as citizens fled to Montgomery and
Greenville, Ala., where officials set up a government in exile,
Pearce says.
</P>
<P>
   Union Adm. David Farragut then based his blockading squadron at
the Pensacola Navy Yard, now Pensacola Naval Air Station. In August
1864, Farragut led his ships to victory in the Battle of Mobile
Bay, giving the famous order, ''Damn the torpedoes! Full speed
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Union cavalry conducted raids into Alabama that disrupted
railroads between Mississippi and Georgia. Federal troops
eventually advanced to the shore of Mobile Bay, winning a major
victory at Blakely, Ala., on April 9, 1865, the same day that Gen.
Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Pensacola never would have been such a thorn, if the
Confederates had been bolder in the beginning, Pearce says.
</P>
<P>
   They did quickly seize the city, navy yard and two forts --
Barrancas and McRee -- after Florida seceded in January 1861. Union
troops, however, got across the bay to Santa Rosa Island aboard a
ship and beat the rebels to Pickens, unoccupied since the
Mexican-American war.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. William Chase had a vastly superior force of about 800
Florida, Alabama and Mississippi troops under his command but never
attacked Pickens, agreeing instead to the truce.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce says he suspected that Chase, who oversaw construction of
forts across the Gulf Coast, did not want to see one of his
creations destroyed. Brig. Gen. Braxton Bragg replaced Chase in
March, but he, too, held back, possibly intimidated by the arrival
of more Union warships.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had five or six ships out there with hundreds of guns,''
Pearce says.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate commanders got little encouragement from political
leaders. Future Confederate president Jefferson Davis said,
''Pickens is not worth one drop of blood,'' Pearce recounts in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   The fort, however, was vulnerable as none of its guns faced the
island's interior. Six months after the war began, the Confederates
finally landed east of Pickens.
</P>
<P>
   By then, New York Volunteers had camped in their path and
repelled the Southerners in the Battle of Santa Rosa Island. The
South almost certainly would have won the battle if it had been
fought before Pickens was reinforced, Pearce says.
</P>
<P>
   An Army reinforcement order had arrived by ship on March 31,
nearly two weeks before the attack on Sumter, but the Navy
commander was afraid to break the truce without Navy orders.
</P>
<P>
   An officer went by land to Washington for such an order. It was
sent by train with another officer, Lt. John Worden, who later
commanded the USS Monitor in the first battle of ironclads. Bragg,
the Confederate general, let him deliver his secret message to the
Union ships. The next day the reinforcements landed undetected
until after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce wrote that Bragg later said he let Worden deliver his
message only because he falsely claimed it was of a ''pacific
character.'' Worden was arrested in Montgomery as he tried to get
back to Washington and held prisoner for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Historian James J. McPherson called Pickens ''something of a
sideshow,'' but Bruce Catton stated it potentially ''offered a case
that was fully as explosive as that of Fort Sumter.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady McWhitney, another historian Pearce quoted, concluded
''war came at Fort Sumter only because the Confederates were
neither subtle enough nor strong enough to begin it at Fort
Pickens.''

<HEADLINE> St. Thomas: Birth of Impressionism?  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Camille Pissarro is
considered the father of Impressionism, a painting style that won
huge popularity and influence with its celebration of life, beauty
and color, and a style generally associated with France.
</P>
<P>
   But the 19th-century master's great-grandson says the key to
Pissarro lies in his little-studied origins a world away from the
drawing rooms and gardens of Paris. It was here, on the Caribbean
island of St. Thomas, where an impressionable young man of Jewish
descent came to know the island blacks who greatly influenced his
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''St. Thomas had a huge impact on his life and on his art,''
says Joachim Pissarro, an art historian at Yale University. ''The
role of the Caribbean in Pissarro's early career was much more
important than we think.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeply affected by the arduous living conditions of fellow
islanders -- many still slaves -- Pissarro developed a ''dedication
to unglamorous human reality. ... All he cared about were people of
very simple, very ordinary backgrounds,'' Joachim says.
</P>
<P>
   That sensibility is evident in ''Two Women Chatting by the Sea''
(1856), which depicts two dark-skinned women -- one carrying a
basket, the other balancing a tray on her head -- on a barren beach
front hardly recognizable as today's stunning, yacht-filled bay at
Charlotte Amalie.
</P>
<P>
   Since Pissarro's time, the island has shifted from Danish to
U.S. rule, and the town itself has been transformed into a mecca of
duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Pissarro's childhood home still stands -- a three-story beige
building that was sold by the artist's family in 1914 and today is
owned by a local realty agency. It is unknown to most tourists
despite a small sign above its doorway declaring: ''Camille
Pissarro Building: Birthplace of the famous Impressionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors pass through a tunnel-like hallway of brick and stone
leading to an open-air courtyard. The ''Camille Pissarro Gallery''
on the third floor offers original works by local artists and
prints of some Pissarros, including ''Coconuts by the Sea'' (1856),
depicting the current site of a luxury hotel. An accountant's
office occupies rooms where the Pissarro family lived. Jewelry and
crystal stores are on the first floor, where Pissarro's father,
Frederic, ran a haberdashery and young Camille counted inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dozen tourists and locals visit the gallery each day,
a small fraction of the masses scouring the town for T-shirts,
watches and trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was in France, I know this would be a shrine,'' says
gallery owner Randall Wombold.
</P>
<P>
   The Tourism Department does not mention the house in its
brochures. ''There are much more significant aspects of a Virgin
Islands vacation,'' Tourism Commissioner Rafael Jackson says.
''(But) that is not to say that is not important.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Pissarro was originally of Sephardic Jewish ancestry
and had moved to St. Thomas from Bordeaux, France, in the first
half of the 19th century. Less is known about the artist's mother,
Rachel Manzana, who hailed from what is now the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage was opposed by St. Thomas' Jewish elders because
Rachel was the recent widow of Frederic's uncle and had already
given birth to his child. The four Pissarro children were deemed
illegitimate, and because of this Camille attended an all-black
primary school run by Moravian pastors instead of the white
community's school.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pissarro began drawing, he portrayed blacks, something
few white artists did.
</P>
<P>
   He drew dozens of drawings of blacks before he left for
Venezuela with Danish artist Fritz Melbye in 1852. He returned to
the island in 1854 but soon left again, for Paris. There he made
his name -- establishing Impressionism along with Paul Cezanne,
Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir -- and he never came back.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the one hand, Pissarro ran away like crazy, like he was
almost in prison on St. Thomas,'' Joachim Pissarro says. ''What he
could not stand were the constrictions, the pressure, the family
establishment conventions. ... He could not do what he wanted to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you really wanted to be an artist, you couldn't do it in
St. Thomas. ... You had to go to where it all happened -- and that
was Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Pissarro's Caribbean connection also explains his attraction to
political anarchy, says Ivan Gaskell, a curator at Harvard
University's Fogg Art Museum. ''In that anarchist literature of the
later 19th century there is no distinction among the races drawn.
... There is a rather wonderful idealistic conception of humanity
as a totality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaskell agrees that Pissarro's paintings are extraordinary in
their humanism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although you can see them predominantly as landscape works,
most of the time you are reminded of the presence of how that
landscape is a setting for human labor and human activity,'' he
says. ''Whereas some of his fellow Impressionists concentrated more
on leisure activities in the landscape, Pissarro seems consistently
to concentrate on how the landscape is a setting for necessary
human labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was painting garden workers and field laborers in
France, the influence of the island persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were not slaves, but they were people working for their
bread and butter,'' Joachim Pissarro says. ''What he saw in St.
Thomas was desperately unglamorous and he decided to make it the
ongoing subject of his art for the rest of his life.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 98, Dow Rises 37  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Wednesday, fueled by strength in
technology shares after Internet giant Yahoo! reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 36.77 at 10,763.96.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 7.73 at 1,488.61, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 98.13 at 4,054.55.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-quarter earnings season just getting under way,
a strong showing from Yahoo! helped boost the technology sector,
which had been battered in recent weeks on fears that
second-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s shares rose $17.875 to $123.375. CMGI was also higher,
rising $4.75 at $41.25, as was eBay, which gained $5.312 to $49.25.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed
better-than-expected reports from International Paper and Alcoa
earlier this week, which helped give a lift to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While individual earnings reports have boosted stocks in recent
days, analysts said that the market still lacks direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, a strong day for value-biased stocks because of
International Paper's earnings. Today, we have Yahoo! pulling up
the tech stocks,'' said Brian Belski, vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ''But the question is: What will tomorrow
bring? There is still a lot of indecision in the market and the
performance has been very varied.''
</P>
<P>
   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the
country's improved productivity, which analysts took as a sign that
inflation may be in check.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been signs that the pace of the
economy is slowing down, and without any inflationary pressures,
investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates
after six rate hikes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, however, were still watching their moves ahead
of another speech from Greenspan on Wednesday night at a conference
organized by the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New York investment bank PaineWebber rose $15.75 to
$65.688 after it announced that it was being purchased by Swiss
banking group UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The merger set off a rally in banking and financial services
stocks. Lehman Brothers rose $4.50 to $110.938 and Merrill Lynch
gained $2.313 to $131.313.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 462.54 million
shares, up from 441.21 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 6.06 at 535.80.

<HEADLINE> Life and Times of Gloria Estefan  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ROGERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- First there was the big bridge. Then the big
tunnel. Then the canyon of gigantic buildings. She has no idea,
Gloria Estefan says, what could have knocked out her cell phone
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Everything looks relatively normal, she says, peering out the
window of a car that is winding its way through New York City while
she talks rapidly from the back seat to a reporter in Los Angeles.
She is trying to make every second count.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, she's racing across Manhattan for a taping of
David Letterman's show and then one with Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   ''This must be hard on you,'' the now-familiar voice, filled
with embarrassment, had said moments before, when the conversation
was re-established for the fifth time. ''Because I know,'' she
giggled sheepishly, ''it's killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an occupational hazard, it seems, for someone who must be
in too many places at one time.
</P>
<P>
   And she has been everywhere in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Since late May, she has been at the top of the Latin music
charts with her new Spanish-language album ''Caribbean Soul''
(Epic), her 20th album and her third in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, she was frequently seen on the network
news, and not always to positive reaction. That was when she
appeared outside the Miami home of the relatives of Elian Gonzalez
in support of an asylum hearing for the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan's father spent time in prison for taking part in Cuba's
Bay of Pigs invasion, and she has never been shy about expressing
her dislike for Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But Estefan said she went to the home where Elian was staying
only because Attorney General Janet Reno told her an appearance
there might make Elian's father feel more comfortable that
Cuban-Americans had his son's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   She's happy, she said, that Elian was reunited with his father,
but she's not happy that the boy was taken from his Miami relatives
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a shame, that should not have happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, who was a baby when her family fled Cuba, would like to
return to do a concert, but not until Castro is out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that would be my dream,'' she said. ''We've done so
many things, and I've been so fortunate to perform for so many
years at such a vast array of big events. But to perform in a free
Cuba, that would be the celebration of it all for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this, Estefan had a European concert tour to
complete and a PBS special. Now there is a U.S. concert tour to do,
and soon HBO will show the movie she produced about Arturo
Sandoval, the great Cuban jazz trumpeter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a cool story,'' she said excitedly. ''Because it's got
great music, of course. And a real love story, between him and his
wife. And very diverse political views, with him getting out of
Cuba and all.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a killer on my schedule, but it was wonderful to be a
part of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan, 42, is an electrifying performer whose work encompasses
a range of styles from salsa to dance, American pop to Afro-Cuban
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Although her family has many gifted musicians -- and she loved
music from the start -- ''I never thought I'd be a performer because
I was so shy.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed after she met her husband Emilio. Five years her
senior, he was already a successful bandleader when he came to her
high school to offer students some musical advice. Sometime later,
she saw him again at a wedding reception.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I remember you. You want to sing with the band?' My
mother said, 'Oh, of course she'll sing with your band.' So I sat
in,'' she recalled with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   He offered her a job on the spot, but she turned him down
because it would interfere with her college studies and her job as
a translator for U.S. immigration officials in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Estefan promised her it would be part-time, more like a
hobby than work.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I said OK. I thought it was great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained just that through the first half of the 1980s, as
Estefan renamed his band Miami Sound Machine and the group became a
favorite on the city's club circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1985, the infectious, upbeat ''Conga'' came out, the
first of a string of hits for the Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Estefan says just about every day has been wonderful since that
awful one in March 1990 when a truck rear-ended her tour bus on a
snow-covered highway in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The accident nearly took her life, nearly left her paralyzed,
nearly ended her career. Even now, there is not a day she isn't
reminded of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I sit in a hardback chair, it's a big reminder,'' she said,
noting ruefully that there is no ignoring the metal rods and screws
that hold her back together.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's a wonderful reminder,'' she quickly added, regaining
her trademark enthusiasm, ''because it allows me, it reminds me, to
live my life to the fullest. And I've always been very thankful for
that.''

<HEADLINE> Sam Phillips Recalls Sun Records Days  </HEADLINE>
By WOODY BAIRD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- ''We were starting from scratch
together,'' recalled Sam Phillips, who enjoys the role of an elder
statesman of American rock 'n' roll -- though he doesn't much like
the ''elder'' part.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, Phillips, then 27, opened a small recording
studio in Memphis. He went on to cut the first records for Elvis
Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seventy-seven is young if you think right,'' said Phillips,
the subject of a recent two-hour biography by the A&AMP;E cable TV
network, ''Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of his Memphis Recording Studio (motto: We
Record Anything -- Anywhere -- Anytime), Phillips worked mostly with
black musicians, including B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Roscoe Gordon
and Memphis mainstay Rufus Thomas, to bring what was considered a
''black'' sound to white-owned radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;E show told its story through interviews with many of the
artists who worked with Phillips during those days of racial
segregation, when white radio stations refused to play so-called
''race music,'' with its hot, upbeat rhythms and lyrics considered
too heavy on sexual innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Even gospel music and blues spawned by the hard lives of
Mississippi Delta sharecroppers were considered off-limits for
white stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, who grew up in Florence, Ala., with blues and
gospel, was convinced he could change the tastes of white radio
audiences if he could get them to listen to what he wanted them to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   His plan, before and after he started the Sun Records label in
1952, was to let artists with no formal training play their music
as they felt it, raw and full of life.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's future, and pop music in general, took a major turn
in 1954, when a young Memphis truck driver made his first record
for Phillips. Elvis Presley wanted to sing ballads and had a good
voice for them, but Phillips wanted him to start off by recording
the rocking music he favored so much.
</P>
<P>
   Presley's first single for the Sun label was ''That's All Right
(Mama).'' He continued to record for Phillips for the next two
years. ''Baby Let's Play House,'' his first national chart entry,
hit No. 10 on Billboard's country chart in the summer of 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt you would have heard of Sam Phillips or Elvis Presley
or any of the rest of them'' if Presley had recorded a ballad
first, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   After Presley made a splash, other hungry, would-be rockers
showed up at Phillips' door.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took my guitar and went down there and sat on the steps of
his studio,'' said Cash on the A&AMP;E biography. ''I told him my name
was John Cash and I think he'd be happy he listened, if he did. And
he did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cash released his debut single ''Cry Cry Cry''/''Hey
Porter,'' Phillips billed him as Johnny because it sounded more
commercial. The name initially upset Cash because he believed it
sounded too young.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who came along later, recounted a similar experience. ''I
just read it in a magazine about Sam Phillips. ... I said, 'Man, I
need to see that guy. That's the guy I need to see.''' He went on
to record ''Great Balls of Fire'' and ''Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin'
On'' on the Sun label.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips got out of the recording business in 1962 and sold Sun
Records in 1969. His sons now run the family studio, the Sam
Phillips Recording Service, and a music publishing company in
Nashville, while he concentrates on radio stations he owns in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll never retire. I'm just using up somebody else's oxygen if
I retire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Branson Performer Smokes Up Stage  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- As the curtain goes up on Doug Gabriel's
show, the Mufftar leans on its stand at center stage patiently
waiting for its moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through his act -- when audience curiosity is
piqued -- Gabriel saunters over to the metallic device covered with
nicks and duct tape, throws a guitar strap around his neck and
straps it on.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the heck is that thing?'' an older man in the crowd
whispers to his wife, straining to get a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ''This,'' Gabriel proudly proclaims, ''is one of the world's two
existing Mufftars -- it's a Midas muffler from a '69 Thunderbird
made into an electric guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   An endless waft of jokes follows:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exhausting to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Does this baffle you?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the Midas touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughs politely but wants to know if this thing can
really be played. That's when Gabriel grabs his guitar pick and
smokes up the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny resort town crowded with musical acts, it doesn't
hurt to have a peg, something to differentiate you from the guy in
the theater next door. Gabriel's peg just happens to double as an
automotive part.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mufftar can be like a Catch-22. It has worked for us, but
almost too well,'' the stout 37-year-old musician said. ''People
come to see the guitar, but sometimes we would rather be remembered
for our show and music.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel began playing the guitar when he was 10. He and brother
Donny formed a band in the back of their father's Midas Muffler
shop in Cedar Springs, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew we needed something to draw attention to our band, and
someone thought of using a muffler as a guitar. Everyone laughed it
off, but my dad took it seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel's father began pulling all kinds of mufflers from the
shelves until he found one that worked.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some reason, the '69 Thunderbird was just the right size
and sounded great. It was the same size as my Stratocaster,''
Gabriel said. ''Dad went over to a music shop next door and bought
the neck off a broken guitar and put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   His father built a second Mufftar for Donny from a '72 Buick
muffler and patented the design.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' band, The New Relations, was an instant hit with their
odd new instruments. They later scored opening gigs for big-name
country performers Mel McDaniel, Ronnie McDowell and Conway Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   Their Mufftars were featured in People and Hot Rod magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The mufflers proved to be a good gimmick, but left much to be
desired as instruments. They weigh nearly 40 pounds each and can be
played only for about 10 minutes before needing to be retuned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used it as my special act,'' Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
   Donny gave up music for a career in the motel business, turning
his muffler-guitar over to his brother, who headed for Branson.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a natural place to be for me,'' Gabriel said. ''I have
always had family down here. In fact, my great-grandfather was
circuit county judge here before Branson was much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel played for Jim Stafford and Roy Clark through the late
1980s, and in 1993 got his own show. He currently performs at the
Starlite Theater, playing a variety of country, gospel and pop
tunes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Cliff Leads Reggae in N.M.  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TESUQUE, N.M. (AP) -- It was a night of high-spirited reggae in
the New Mexican desert.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jimmy Cliff and his supercharged Jamaican band were
reeling off the last refrain of ''You Can Get It If You Really
Want,'' he had won over the Camel Rock Casino's capacity crowd of
1,300, which sang along in unison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peace! Justice! Freedom! Equality!'' was Cliff's closing
message, and the one chanted back by the ethnically mixed audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is unity in diversity,'' Cliff said in an interview
after the show.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his performance, the 52-year-old Cliff, wearing a
white bandanna, African motif shirt, cargo pants and white Reeboks,
was a lithe, nonstop dancing machine. His flurry of spins, kicks,
Rastaman shuffle and T'ai Chi was a rousing display of agility and
relentless energy.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff delivered raw renditions of Neil Young's ''Southern Man,''
Cat Stevens' ''Wild World,'' Cliff's own reggae protest song
''Vietnam'' and his biggest hit, ''The Harder They Come.''
</P>
<P>
   As the show was ending, he picked up a white Fender --
left-handed, Jimi Hendrix-style -- and relaxed the pace with simple,
softly strummed, solo versions of ''Third World People'' and ''No
Justice'' that segued into a rollicking rendition of ''I Can See
Clearly Now'' with the band kicking in behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The music that I do is where my feelings are, and that is my
message,'' he said, referring to his enduring faith in humanity
reflected in ''Wonderful World, Beautiful People.'' It was one of
the songs that Cliff and his band -- a tightknit, dreadlocked crew
that evoked the sultry, syncopated musical urban landscape of
Kingston and Montego Bay -- performed as an encore.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff and company are on a four-month tour that will take them
to New York, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, California,
Massachusetts, Missouri and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is grueling. On average, they perform five shows a
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Cliff is still passionate about his life's work, four
decades after he cut his first record.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an artist, in terms of music, film, composing, directing,
producing, there are many areas yet that I have to cover -- to
satisfy my soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff was born James Chambers on April 1, 1948, in St. James,
Jamaica. In 1962, he moved to Kingston, the country's commercial
center, where he recorded his debut single, ''Daisy Got Me Crazy.''
He was introduced to music producer Leslie Kong, recorded
''Hurricane Hattie,'' which hit No. 1 on the island, and followed
that up with ''Since Lately,'' ''King of Kings,'' ''My Lucky Day''
and ''Miss Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next few years, his musical career took flight. He
toured the United States in 1965, then moved to Britain where he
worked as a backup singer. He also continued recording his own
music -- ska, R&AMP;B and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reggae caught on in the U.K. because (Jamaica) was a British
colony and many people from the islands migrated there,'' Cliff
said.
</P>
<P>
   He released his first British album ''Hard Road to Travel'' in
1967. Two years later, his single ''Wonderful World, Beautiful
People,'' reached No. 6 on the British chart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vietnam'' -- his reggae polemic that Bob Dylan called ''the
best protest song ever written'' -- quickly became a hit in England
in 1970. That same year, he made it onto the U.S. chart with ''Come
Into My Life'' and into the Top 10 of the British chart with his
own reggae cover of Cat Stevens' ''Tea for the Tillerman.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Cliff starred in the Jamaican film ''The Harder They
Come,'' directed by Perry Henzell. The title song became a reggae
classic.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s -- after the release of his ''Brave Warrior,
Follow My Mind,'' ''Give the People What They Want'' and ''Give
Thankx'' albums -- Cliff had performed in venues around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jamaicans, he considers himself a descendent of Nubia
-- an ancient African empire that once included parts of Egypt and
Ethiopia. He views his life and his music existentially.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many schools that I went through -- like
Christianity, like Islam, like Rastafari, like Buddhism -- all of
these are classrooms, but I've graduated from all of them now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Cliff offered his perspective on the association
often made between marijuana and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think any philosophy or doctrine that comes up that is not
mainstream -- like Islam or Christianity or Judaism -- the
establishment fights it,'' he said. ''So Rastafari was one of such
movements, and Rastafarian and reggae music has one affinity --
definitely with ganja.
</P>
<P>
   ''But rock 'n' roll has an affinity with cocaine, blues has an
affinity with alcohol, jazz has an affinity with heroin, and so on.
Every music form has some affinity with some kind of drug.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Roy Hargrove  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Trumpeter Roy Hargrove is anything but
predictable. His new all-ballads CD ''Moment to Moment'' (Verve)
offers what he calls ''a stark contrast'' to his previous release,
the upbeat, rhythmically sizzling ''Habana'' of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For ''Habana,'' Hargrove's American-Cuban band Crisol (Spanish
for ''crucible'' or ''melting pot'') won an unexpected Grammy (Best
Latin Jazz Performance). Inspired by a visit to Cuba, Hargrove
updated the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition that goes back to Dizzy
Gillespie's collaborations with percussionist Chano Pozo and other
Cuban musicians.
</P>
<P>
   On ''Moment to Moment'' -- the 30-year-old Texas-born trumpeter's
11th album as a leader since 1990 -- Hargrove draws on another
tradition, citing such influences as the ballads-with-strings
albums by Clifford Brown and Charlie Parker as well as John
Coltrane's classic ''Ballads'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove (on trumpet and flugelhorn) puts the emphasis here on
the melody rather than the rhythm to create a lush, dreamily
romantic mood, with his regular quintet backed by the strings of
the Monterey Jazz Festival Chamber Orchestra. The 12 tracks --
recorded at a studio owned by Al Jardine of the Beach Boys in
California's picturesque Big Sur region -- feature several
standards, including the Henry Mancini-Johnny Mercer title number,
Antonio Carlos Jobim's ''How Insensitive'' and Ray Noble's ''The
Very Thought of You.'' The CD also has three original ballads by
quintet members, including Hargrove's ''Natural Wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone peg him strictly as some jazz neo-traditionalist
-- the trumpeter was discovered by Wynton Marsalis in 1986 at a
Dallas performing-arts high school -- Hargrove identifies with the
hip hop generation. His recent side projects include leading the
horn section on D'Angelo's hit ''Voodoo'' CD and tour, recording
with Common on the rapper's ''Like Water for Chocolate'' CD, and
backing up his Dallas ''home girl'' Erykah Badu on her next
release.
</P>
<P>
   1. What inspired you to do an all-ballads album?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove: I had always wanted to do a ballad album because I
have an affinity toward playing ballads. When we play live, people
always respond to the ballad that we play during the set. So, I
figured it would be a good idea to make a whole album with this
kind of sensitivity. ... These are just some of my favorite songs
as far as lyrical quality and a strong melody.
</P>
<P>
   2. As a trumpet player, what is the challenge of playing a
ballad?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove: Well, the old saying goes that less is more. It's a
real challenge to try to pick the right notes and place them in the
right place. I learned from people like Miles Davis and others in
that regard, where you can make one note mean as much as a whole
flurry of notes. ...
</P>
<P>
   I had a couple of books with the words written in the studio.
... I think it's really important if you are going to play a song
from the standard repertoire to know the words. It definitely gives
you a different spin as far as interpreting the melody. You know
what the song is about so it can put you in a certain mood as well
as being able to phrase the melody correctly.
</P>
<P>
   3. Why did you choose to record ''Moment to Moment'' in Big Sur?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove: That whole area along the Pacific Coast Highway, Big
Sur and Monterey, is just really beautiful. It's sort of spread out
in the middle of nature. There's the ocean and all these trees, and
just being there gives you a chance to reflect. ... It made for a
very relaxed atmosphere. We were able to really focus on the task
at hand rather than being cluttered with all of the things that you
have to do when you're in the city. ... This was far enough away
from the rat race that it made for a nice atmosphere for recording.
</P>
<P>
   4. What was the experience like working with D'Angelo?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove: This was like a stepping stone for me because
eventually I'm going to do a funk thing in the vein of people like
Roy Ayers or Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire. ... I found that D was really easy
to work with, a real down-to-earth kind of cat. ... I had to make
some adjustments as far as certain things I'm used to in the jazz
world. I didn't do a lot of improvisation because this music
doesn't call for that. ... But I was able to apply my jazz
sensitivity. I got into the inside voicings and was able to create
something different every night on tour as far as the harmony was
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   5. You seem at home in different musical genres -- Afro-Cuban,
straight-ahead ballads, R&AMP;B and funk. How do you fit it all
together?
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove: I'm called a jazz player and I take that respectfully.
But ever since I started playing the trumpet, music has been my
world. ... I've never been one to just be in one particular area of
music. The whole world of music fascinates me. I believe that if
you are a musician you should be a complete musician and explore
all the different areas.

<HEADLINE> Southern Rocker Scores With Ballad  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT JULIET, Tenn. (AP) -- In a trailer park east of Nashville,
Clay Davidson shows off his two newest possessions: a mounted
plastic fish that sings ''Take Me to the River'' and a gold record
given to him by the hit country music duo Montgomery-Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, 29, an amiable, unaffected country singer from rural
Virginia, is on the verge of country music stardom with his No. 3
hit ''Unconditional.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big money isn't rolling in yet. Davidson and his wife
Frances have been living in the trailer for almost five years. It's
not the nicest one on the lot, and the furnishings are well-worn.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson seems content there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been broke into a few times,'' he said with a shrug.
''But we're still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Davidson's current surroundings fail to tell his full
story, there's a lot more to the singer than ''Unconditional,'' a
sentimental ballad about the power of fatherly love.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the album reveals Davidson as a topflight Southern
rocker and honky-tonk singer. But he said he's happy to introduce
himself to fans with the hit, which was written by Liz Hengber,
Deanna Bryant and Rivers Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unconditional'' tells the story of a father who declares that
his love for his child has no conditions, even when the son lashes
out at him.
</P>
<P>
   The song has connected with country music fans, some of whom
share similar stories with the singer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them start crying out of the blue,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the song's protagonist, Davidson never said ''I hate
you'' to his father as a rebellious teen-ager. ''I probably danced
all the way around it, but I never said it. Those words are so
strong, but that's an awkward age and a lot of situations may
actually go that far.''
</P>
<P>
   With his long hair, cowboy hat and leather jacket, Davidson
looks like a long-lost member of rebellious Southern rockers Lynyrd
Skynyrd.
</P>
<P>
   That's on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I discovered a Lynyrd Skynyrd album one day just out of the
blue,'' the singer-writer-guitarist said of his boyhood. ''It
wasn't my era, but it was so relatable to the way I live and the
way I see things.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a song in that vein for Montgomery-Gentry. The duo put
''Didn't Your Mama Tell Ya'' on its best-selling ''Tattoos &AMP;
Scars'' CD, and gave Davidson the gold record after it became
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said Montgomery-Gentry paved the way in mainstream
country for his own success.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have notched open that door for me and other people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson was raised in the small town of Saltville, Va. His
father Mac Davidson worked as a club musician and favored the music
of Elvis Presley, Don Williams and Merle Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Davidson was a big influence on his son, who gave his
first performance singing a Presley song for about 40 relatives at
his grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   He followed his father into the clubs, eventually building the
band Southern Grace into a regional success. The band played
throughout Virginia and parts of Tennessee, opening for Billy Ray
Cyrus, Pirates of the Mississippi and Tom T. Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Davidson won a talent competition endorsed by country
star Charlie Daniels. That gave him the courage to move to Daniels'
hometown of Mount Juliet, 15 miles from Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson got work singing on tapes made by music publishing
companies to pitch their songs to singers. His voice helped sell
the hits ''Lonely'' to Tracy Lawrence and ''Steam'' to Ty Herndon.
</P>
<P>
   His song ''My Best Friend and Me'' led to a recording deal with
Scott Hendricks of Virgin Records.
</P>
<P>
   With ''Unconditional,'' Davidson may soon have the resources to
upgrade his lifestyle. But he's not contemplating a move to
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, I think we'll stay right here in Mount Juliet,'' he said.
''Maybe I'll get a house. Maybe I'll get a doublewide (trailer).''

<HEADLINE> AIDS Experts Cite Common Spermicide  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- The widely used spermicide
nonoxynol-9, long recommended as a way to stop the spread of AIDS,
may actually increase the risk of catching the virus, at least
among women who use it frequently, according to the surprising
findings of a large study.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, health officials said condoms used solely to
prevent disease should not be coated with nonoxynol-9, although a
condom with the spermicide is certainly safer than no condom at
all. And they said the spermicide should also not be used for birth
control by anyone at high risk of catching HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Nonoxynol-9 is widely used around the world for contraception,
and about one-third of lubricated condoms sold in the United States
are covered with it. Nonoxynol-9 is a detergent formulated to kill
sperm, but in the test tube it also wipes out HIV, and many have
long assumed it helps protect people from the virus.
</P>
<P>
   However, a study on prostitutes released Wednesday at the 13th
International AIDS Conference showed just the opposite: Women using
a nonoxynol-9 gel increased their risk of contracting HIV rather
than lowering it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an understatement to say that we were extremely
disappointed,'' said Dr. Lut Van Damme of the Institute of Tropical
Medicine in Antwerp, the study's director.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers now assume that nonoxynol-9, or N-9, increases
the risk by irritating the vaginal lining, causing tears that give
the virus a way to enter the body.
</P>
<P>
   The prostitutes in the study applied N-9 up to 20 times a day,
and there is no evidence that women who use it once or twice a day
increase their risk of HIV. Nevertheless, Van Damme recommended
that N-9's long-term safety as a contraceptive be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   The study began in 1996 on 990 prostitutes in South Africa,
Benin, Thailand and Ivory Coast. They were randomly given either an
N-9 gel called Advantage-S or a similar-looking but inactive
vaginal moisturizer. The women were also urged to use condoms and
given a free supply.
</P>
<P>
   The study ended May 31, and the researchers were surprised by
the results. Fifteen percent of the women using the N-9 gel had
become infected with HIV, compared with 10 percent in the

   ''This convincingly shows this product is not a good idea in a
high-risk population,'' said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who heads
microbicide research at UNAIDS. ''If you use nonoxynol-9, you are
wasting your money, and you may be wasting your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ann Duerr, HIV chief in the reproductive health division at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the
effects of the low amounts of N-9 on condoms are unclear. But given
a choice, people who want to protect themselves from HIV should
select those without the spermicide, even though condoms with the
spermicide are safer than avoiding condoms entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ''For sexually transmitted disease prevention, our
recommendation has been to use condoms with or without
nonoxynol-9,'' Duerr said. ''Now it's clear that N-9 does not add
protection and may be harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage-S spermicide is sold in the United States and China
and manufactured by Columbia Laboratories of Miami. Howard Levine,
its research director, said the company's work shows the product is
safe when applied up to four times a day. He attributed the study's
results to the prostitutes' high use.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widely held assumption that N-9 stops HIV, earlier
research raised doubts. The most recent, a study of 1,170
prostitutes in Cameroon, found a spermicide film did not prevent
infection, although it offered no hint that it increased the risk,
either. An earlier study found a higher infection rate in Kenyan
prostitutes using an N-9 sponge, but the increase was not
statistically meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Van Damme said two other large studies involving an N-9 gel
called Conceptrol, being done on non-prostitutes in Africa, may
have to be stopped. The CDC said Wednesday it had halted a study
involving N-9 in Miami and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an HIV-killing lotion is a major goal of AIDS research,
since it would offer an alternative to condoms. Several novel
products are in early-stage human testing. Among these are PC-515
and Pro2000, both derived from seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation, started by the Microsoft
founder, said Wednesday it would donate $25 million to develop and
test products to prevent the spread of AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases.

<HEADLINE> Disabled Kids' Health Care Mulled  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Air Force Staff Sergeant Gordon Fay
learned he would receive a promotion, he was elated -- until he
realized the extra pay meant his disabled daughter would no longer
be eligible for Medicaid. Now he's wondering if he can afford
thousands of dollars in new health costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear that I might lose Medicaid . . . will now be a
reality in approximately six to eight months because the promotion
will take me above the income threshold,'' said Fay. His daughter
Lauren has a rare chromosome disorder called Angelman's Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ''The extra money that I would gain from the promotion would not
come close to offsetting the costs of necessities for Lauren --
diapers, medicine, medical equipment, therapies,'' said Fay, now
stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Fay and other parents recounted their struggles before the
Senate Budget Committee, which is considering legislation that
would allow working parents who have a child with special needs to
keep working and still have access to Medicaid for their child.
Parents would pay for Medicaid coverage on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, families have a strict income limit to
qualify for both Medicaid and federal disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation has been introduced in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''These families are forced to make impossible choices that no
parent should have to make,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. and
sponsor of the measure with Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who is sponsoring the
House version, told the committee of his experiences as a parent of
a son with Down's Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our family has been fortunate in that Alex has been able to
receive the care that he has needed,'' Sessions said. ''However,
many families face similar situations, without the ability to
access the critical health care coverage that their child's
disabilities require.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican, told the committee
the measure ''places government on the side of the people where it
should belong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is not about the politics of any of us,'' he said.
''It's about the people we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, one of the Senate sponsors, said the bipartisan
support bodes well for the bill's passage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would receive $150 million over five years,
including $25 million the first year. Funding for the bill was
included in a budget resolution Congress agreed to earlier this
year.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 75, Nasdaq Up 119  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Wednesday, fueled by strength in
technology shares after Internet giant Yahoo! reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 74.96 points at 10,802.15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 118.69 at 4,075.11, putting the index into positive
territory for the year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 11.23
at 1,492.11.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-quarter earnings season just getting under way,
a strong showing from Yahoo! helped boost the technology sector,
which had been battered in recent weeks on fears that
second-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s shares rose $18.875 to $124.375. CMGI was also higher,
rising $5.375 at $41.875, as was eBay, which gained $9.063 to $53.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed
better-than-expected reports from International Paper and Alcoa
earlier this week, which helped give a lift to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While individual earnings reports have boosted stocks in recent
days, analysts said that the market still lacks direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, a strong day for value-biased stocks because of
International Paper's earnings. Today, we have Yahoo! pulling up
the tech stocks,'' said Brian Belski, vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ''But the question is: What will tomorrow
bring? There is still a lot of indecision in the market and the
performance has been very varied.''
</P>
<P>
   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the
country's improved productivity, which analysts took as a sign that
inflation may be in check.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been signs that the pace of the
economy is slowing down, and without any inflationary pressures,
investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates
after six rate hikes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, however, were still watching their moves ahead
of another speech from Greenspan on Wednesday night at a conference
organized by the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New York investment bank PaineWebber rose $16.375 to
$66.313 after it announced that it was being purchased by Swiss
banking group UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The merger set off a rally in banking and financial services
stocks. Lehman Brothers rose $5.563 to $112 and Merrill Lynch
gained $2.75 to $131.75.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 671.58 million
shares, up from 663.19 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.03 at 536.77.

<HEADLINE> Av's Sakic Might Choose Arbitration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Joe Sakic might go to arbitration to reach a
contract agreement with the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Don Baizley, Sakic's agent, thinks his client will return to the
Avalanche next year, either with a one-year contract reached
through arbitration or a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday is the deadline for requesting arbitration. If Sakic
proceeds, he would end up with a one-year deal that would allow him
to be an unrestricted free agent after next season, Baizley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not so much that we want that to happen, but it's a tool
that's sitting there,'' he said of arbitration. ''From the
perspective of both parties, it would get things settled a long
time before training camp. Joe's preference still would be a
long-term deal in Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Francois Giguere said the team and the
player may continue negotiations even if arbitration is requested.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that once a player requests arbitration, he no
longer is a free agent, which virtually guarantees his return to
the team the next season.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitration period is Aug. 1-15.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic, 31, became a restricted free agent July 1 and is eligible
to receive an offer sheet from any other NHL team. The New York
Rangers made a bid for Sakic three years ago, but the Avs matched
it and retained their center with a $21 million contract over three
seasons. Sakic received a $15 million signing bonus, then $2
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   The team's other restricted free agents who are eligible for
arbitration include Adam Deadmarsh, Jon Klemm, Stephane Yelle and
the recently acquired Nolan Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent out the qualifying contract offers,'' Giguere said,
''and we're slowly talking to guys, although nothing is really
moving. The key date is July 15, because of the deadline to elect
arbitration.''

<HEADLINE> Genes of Plant Disease Mapped  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, scientists have reported mapping the genes
of a plant disease, an advance that could lead to new approaches to
fighting a bacterial scourge that ravages orange groves and other
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The work also sheds light on the way bacteria infect both humans
and plants and thwart their defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sort of information is going to open up crop protection
strategies the way genome sequencing is opening up new
pharmaceutical strategies to control infectious diseases'' in
people, said Charles J. Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson
Institute at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the State of Sao Paolo Research Foundation in
Brazil, 200 scientists in 34 molecular biology labs worked for two
years to sequence the genome of the bacteria Xylella fastidiosa.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reported in Thursday's issue of the journal
Nature that they were able to identify the function of 47 percent
of the bacteria's 2,904 genes, offering researchers targets for
developing cheaper ways of controlling the disease, known as citrus
variegated chlorosis, or CVC.
</P>
<P>
   Joao Carlos Setubal, who led the study as coordinator of the
Bioinformatics Laboratory at the University of Campinas in Brazil,
said the project made Brazil a new force in the international
genome arena, after starting from a position of practically no
local expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also reported finding at least 83 genes in
Xylella fastidiosa that came from other bacteria, including some
that help fight off a plant's natural defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the strongest story we have had in the plant biology
area or non-human medicine for gene transfer across bacteria,''
Arntzen said. It gives scientists a better understanding of how
germs and evolve along with the plants they infect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also sheds light on how bacteria that cause human
diseases develop resistance to antibiotics, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is fascinating to see how many similarities there
are between plant and human pathogens,'' Arntzen said. ''That is
what is coming out of a lot of genome sequencing. We can study one
organism and learn something about another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Carried by insects called sharpshooter leafhoppers, the bacteria
infest the xylem, the tubes under the bark of a tree that transport
water. By blocking water absorption, the disease causes the fruit
to be small, hard and commercially worthless. Related strains of
the bacteria attack coffee, almonds, pecans, grapevines, alfalfa,
peaches and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   The disease was first identified in Brazil in 1987 and causes
$50 million a year in damage to orange groves there, which produce
half the orange juice concentrate in the world, Setubal said.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of bacteria was chosen for the genome project because
it is expensive to combat with current means, which include
insecticides, pruning and replacing trees.
</P>
<P>
   With this new knowledge of the genetic processes in the
bacteria, it may be possible to create a simple drug that would
either kill it or make it harmless to the plant, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Though 23 other bacteria genomes have been mapped, this marks
the first time scientists have publicly reported sequencing a
free-living type of bacteria that causes disease in plants, Michael
Bevan of the John Innes Centre in England wrote in an accompanying
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the importance of plant pathogens limiting our food
supply, it is really quite shocking that this is the first time a
complete genome sequence has been produced,'' Arntzen said. ''When
you consider how many human pathogens have been completely
sequenced, it tells us where we put our priorities in terms of
research investment.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Seeks Drug Benefit Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prescription drug costs would be shared by
people on Medicare and the government and hospital benefits would
be enhanced under an effort to reach compromise on an issue that
has sharply divided Republicans and Democrats in this election
year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Sen. William Roth, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, was greeted Wednesday by cautious optimism among
Democrats and the White House -- and some grumbling from Republicans
concerned about potentially huge new government costs and
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth, R-Del., said the differences could be resolved in time
for a Senate vote before Congress ends its session this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a real effort to bring together a bipartisan
program,'' Roth told reporters prior to a closed-door Finance
Committee meeting. ''We're all in agreement that Medicare is one of
our most important domestic programs, but it has to be brought into
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft measure is an attempt to find middle ground between
the 10-year, $250 billion government-run Medicare drug proposal
advocated by President Clinton and a House-passed Republican bill
based mainly on subsidized private insurance. Clinton has offered
to sign a GOP tax cut for married couples if Congress sends him an
acceptable Medicare drug measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The move in the Senate to have a prescription drug program
within Medicare should provide momentum for what the president's
been proposing,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He
called the Senate move ''a sharp repudiation of what the House
Republicans proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Roth's plan, Medicare recipients would have a choice between
the traditional program, which has no drug benefit, and a new
''Expanded Option'' program.
</P>
<P>
   For people who opted for the new system, the government would
share prescription drug expenses above a not-yet-finalized
deductible amount. One deductible being discussed was $500.
</P>
<P>
   Above that deductible, the government would pay half of all drug
costs up to another level -- one preliminary figure was $3,500 -- and
as much as 80 percent of the costs above that. This appeals to
Republican conservatives interested in holding down costs, but many
Democrats say it would leave out millions of people with modest
drug costs and could still impose a steep burden on others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the ones with the highest drug costs would be in the
program,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. ''That's almost a
nonstarter with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit would be administered by a new government
office that would contract with private companies to negotiate drug
purchases and provide other benefits. There also would be
unspecified subsidies for low-income people to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   People who took the new ''Expanded Option'' Medicare choice
would get a new hospitalization system as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Medicare recipients must pay a $776
deductible per hospitalization and a $100 deductible for services
under Part B such as home health care and skilled nursing. They
sometimes have to pay the hospitalization deductible up to three
times a year because of restrictions on the length of time of each
hospital stay per illness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Roth plan, both deductibles would be combined into one
-- the amount hasn't yet been decided, but $500 has been used as an
example -- and people on Medicare would get a full 365 days of
hospitalization with no further co-payment. Again to hold down
costs, some new co-payments of about 20 percent could be required
for services under Part B.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is likely to cost more than the $40 billion over
five years envisioned under the budget the Republican-led Congress
passed this year, prompting conservatives to warn against rushing
to pass the bill simply to appease voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't solve the problem by saying, 'Here's a great big
expensive program,''' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the Senate's
No. 2 Republican. ''I don't want to do what's politically
expedient. I want to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he has
given the Finance Committee a ''green light'' to work on the
measure and said he hoped to bring a Medicare drug measure to the
floor this year. Clinton adamantly opposes the House-passed private
insurance plan and the GOP won't pass Clinton's government-run
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, Roth's proposal is ''a distant light at the end of
the tunnel, but it's a light nonetheless,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Bill To Buy N.M. Land  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
a plan to spend $101 million to purchase land known as the
''Yellowstone of the Southwest,'' despite criticism that the price
was too high.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters exulted, saying the 95,000-acre Baca Ranch is a
natural jewel that should be protected and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were more bumps and wiggles in the road than I
expected,'' said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., the sponsor. ''It's
been a long slog, but it's done, and I'm very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 377-45 for the bill, which passed the Senate in
April. President Clinton supports the purchase, and Rep. Tom Udall,
D-N.M., said White House officials told him the president may visit
the ranch later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the federal government is paying far too much for
the ranch northwest of Santa Fe, which the late Texas oil tycoon
James P. Dunigan bought for $2.1 million in 1962. During House
debate Tuesday, Rep. John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., called the purchase
''a colossal rip-off of the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the measure were 44 Republicans and one
independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Baca Ranch is almost completely surrounded by federal land,
including the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National
Monument. It includes the Valles Caldera, a 1-million-year-old
collapsed volcano measuring 14 miles across. It's also home to one
of the largest elk herds in the country, as well as fishing
streams, hot springs, forested mountains and broad, grassy valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the federal government would buy the ranch and
open it to the public. A nine-member board of trustees, at least
five of them New Mexicans, would manage the Baca as a working ranch
and try to make enough money to cover maintenance and operations
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is known as the Yellowstone of the Southwest. I think
anybody in the country that is familiar with Yellowstone would
appreciate what a treasure it is,'' said Udall, whose district
includes the ranch. ''We have now protected that treasure for
future generations.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 1892.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Terror Verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran on Wednesday rejected a U.S. court
verdict that held it responsible for a terrorist bombing in Israel
that killed two Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This court, from an international legal point of view, is not
qualified to study this kind of case and the verdict is completely
political. The charges against Iran are sheer lies,'' the official
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi as saying.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court on Tuesday awarded the parents of Matthew
Eisenfeld, 25, a rabbinical student from West Hartford, Conn., and
Sara Duker, 22, of Teaneck, N.J., a total of $327 million in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The two died in a Feb. 25, 1996, bus bombing in Jerusalem that
killed 22 others and injured 80.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' families had sued Iran under a federal law that
allows victims to seek damages from nations that sponsor
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's judiciary also criticized the verdict, saying it will
pave the way for lawsuits to be filed against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other terrorism victims have won similar court judgments, only
to be stymied by the U.S. government in their efforts to collect
the money. The Clinton administration maintains that frozen assets
and diplomatic properties of foreign nations cannot be used to pay
off the judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The families each had asked for punitive damages of $500
million. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth awarded $300
million, divided equally between the families.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth also awarded wrongful death damages exceeding $1.4
million for Eisenfeld and $1.2 million for Duker; pain and
suffering damages of $1 million each; and individual damage awards
of $5 million for Mrs. Duker, $5 million each for Eisenfeld's
parents, and $2.5 million each for Duker's two sisters and
Eisenfeld's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, former American hostage Terry Anderson won a
$341 million judgment against Iran for orchestrating his seven
years of captivity in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Witnesses Refuse Testimony  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The Lockerbie trial was forced to
adjourn Wednesday after a group of witnesses refused to testify
against the two Libyans accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Court spokesman Richard Bailey said the witnesses from the
Mediterranean island of Malta ''refused to come after quite lengthy
negotiations.'' The special Scottish court adjourned until Friday,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said the witnesses had been summoned to discuss events at
Luqa airport on Malta, but declined to give their names or
elaborate. A prosecution official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the witnesses were airport workers. The Scottish
judges cannot compel non-British witnesses to testify.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest development in the trial of Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who prosecutors allege planted
the Lockerbie bomb in a suitcase on an Air Malta jet departing from
Luqa on the morning of Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principle prosecution witnesses is a Libyan defector,
now living in the United States under the federal witness
protection program, who allegedly saw one of the defendants
introduce the bag onto the Air Malta flight. The bag was placed on
the Pan Am flight in Frankfurt as unaccompanied baggage.
</P>
<P>
   All 259 people on board Flight 103 and 11 residents of
Lockerbie, Scotland, were killed when the bomb exploded inside the
hold of the airliner.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Megrahi and Fhimah went on trial May 3 before the court in
Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base 25 miles from Amsterdam, on
charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and endangering aircraft
safety.
</P>
<P>
   They have pleaded innocent to the charges, which carry a maximum
life sentence in a Scottish prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Maltese shopkeeper said he recognized Al-Megrahi
as the man to whom he sold clothing found in the suitcase that held
the bomb.

<HEADLINE> Congress Decries Council on Religion  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER ANDES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members lambasted the District of
Columbia Council on Wednesday over what one congressman called
''bigotry'' toward the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The council ''damaged itself immensely'' in its debate Tuesday
over whether to require health insurers to pay for contraceptives,
said Rep. Ernest Istook, Jr., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee's panel on the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The council unanimously approved the measure, 13-0, sending it
to Mayor Anthony A. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Istook, R-Okla., criticized council members for ''their failure
... to speak up from the bigotry expressed in the council.'' The
issue has created a ''buzz in the Capitol'' that is likely to
''linger in the memory of a lot of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In defense, Council Chair Linda W. Cropp said the council
debated the issue for more than three hours and should not be held
accountable for one member's discussion of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a disservice to label the council as bashing any one
religion,'' said Cropp, who identified herself as Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church objects to contraception and had urged
parishioners to lobby council members to include a conscience
clause exemption.
</P>
<P>
   The council rejected the exemption.

<HEADLINE> Honeymoon's Over for Pakistan Gen.  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Nine months after seizing power in
Pakistan, the honeymoon is over for military strongman Gen. Pervez
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Many Pakistanis are now wondering why they so openly welcomed
him on Oct. 12, the day a bloodless army coup swept Premier Nawaz
Sharif -- disgraced as corrupt and power-hungry -- from office.
</P>
<P>
   And Musharraf has learned a few lessons of his own. In an
interview with The Associated Press, he said Pakistan is one of the
most difficult countries in the world to govern.
</P>
<P>
   His country has all the resources and people it needs to run
well, Musharraf said. But, he said, this promising recipe has been
poisoned by a string of corrupt and incompetent leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get our own act together. We have all the
potential,'' the military leader said in the interview Tuesday. ''I
am confident that we will get our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all his countrymen share his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   When Musharraf came to power, Abdur Rahim had a good job as a
clerk in a bank, a modest home and very high hopes that something
good was about to happen in Pakistan. Today Rahim's hand trembles
as he wipes beads of sweat from his brow. He has stood for hours in
the baking 104-degree sun hoping for a day's work at a construction
site.
</P>
<P>
   He barely stops to catch his breath as he rattles off his woes:
Wheat prices are up; sugar prices are up; there are no jobs. He has
seven children, all of them school age. He squeezes his eyes to
stop the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I wonder where am I going to get money for food, for
school, for everything. I have nothing,'' Rahim said. ''When I lost
my job they called it a golden handshake, but I didn't get any
money. This is how this government is helping the poor man.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 10 people for every one job waiting in line as a day
laborer,'' he said. ''The army has done nothing to make things
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts here say it was a naive military that took power on
Oct. 12, unaware of the level of corruption here, the disastrous
state of the economy and the power of Pakistan's vested interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They completely underestimated just the facts of the problem
and it has since dawned on them that they face a much larger
problem than they thought,'' said Riffat Hussain, international
relations professor at Qaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   But Musharraf said he knows the problems -- sectarian strife, a
troubled and potentially dangerous relationship with neighbor
India, a proliferation of armed groups, a militant and powerful
religious right, corrupt politicians and bureaucrats and an economy
in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you, there are thousands of issues in Pakistan.
There is a sea of problems in Pakistan, so you have to pick out
from that sea and decide, what do you focus on?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's army-led government has chosen economic revival,
improved governance, interprovincial harmony and development of a
political culture. The Supreme Court has told Musharraf he has
three years to return democratic rule to Pakistan. It will be a
tight schedule, but Musharraf says he can meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   His government points to some economic indicators that show
signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Investor confidence is up slightly. In Musharraf's nine months
of rule, the Karachi Stock Index has increased by almost 300
points. That compares to a plunging index for much of the previous
year of Sharif's rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Musharraf faces another tough fiscal battle -- trying to get
Pakistanis to pay their taxes. Barely 1.2 million of Pakistan's 140
million people pay taxes. The wealthiest, many of them former
politicians, pay only a few hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to collect taxes. This is our lifeline,'' Musharraf
said.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance has been stiff, particularly from businessmen who
have operated on a cash-only basis and fear a deeply corrupt tax
department. They have been calling weekly strikes and joining hands
with religious right-wing groups in what could be a lethal
combination for Musharraf's government: Religious conservatives
have been telling rebellious businessmen that the only tax God
requires is 2.5 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are a military government and have the power, yet they
have been very reluctant to wield that power and instead have come
across as a bunch of nice guys who can be taken for a ride,''
Hussain said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Board To Hear Free Burger Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBI, France (AP) -- A labor board began hearings Wednesday in
the case of a 23-year-old Frenchman who says he was fired from
McDonald's for giving free hamburgers to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Remi Millet lost his job in January at a McDonald's in Lescure
d'Albigeois in southern France. He complained to the labor board
that the restaurant sacked him for handing out the burgers to a
poor woman last November.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of the McDonald's, Pierre Loiret-Fournier, said the
charge was false, and his lawyer said he had a list of 32 errors
allegedly committed by Millet that justified his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Millet's lawyer, Mireille Servieres, said during the hearing
that the firing was ''illegal and abusive.'' She asked the board to
award Millet one year's salary in damages.
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, Millet cast himself in the role of David versus a
corporate Goliath. ''I want to show that a young person who is 23
and who has been fired by a big company can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn a lot of attention in France, and lawmakers
from the Communist and Green parties showed up at the hearing to
give Millet their support.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is increasingly a target for discontented French
people who blame the company for destroying France's food heritage.
The American fast food giant has also become a symbol here of the
evils of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, farmer Jose Bove led a group in vandalizing a
McDonald's in Millau, a town not far from Lescure d'Albigeois.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it will issue a ruling in the Millet case Oct.
25.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 97, Nasdaq Up 134  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices surged Wednesday, fueled by
strength in technology shares after Internet giant Yahoo! reported
better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 96.53 points at 10,823.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 134.45 at 4,090.87, putting the index into positive
territory for the year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 14.30
at 1,498.18.
</P>
<P>
   With the second-quarter earnings season just getting under way,
a strong showing from Yahoo! helped boost the technology sector,
which had been battered in recent weeks on fears that
second-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s shares rose $20.375 to $125.875. CMGI was also higher,
rising $6.563 at $43.063, as was eBay, which gained $9.437 to
$53.375.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed
better-than-expected reports from International Paper and Alcoa
earlier this week, which helped give a lift to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While individual earnings reports have boosted stocks in recent
days, analysts said that the market still lacks direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, a strong day for value-biased stocks because of
International Paper's earnings. Today, we have Yahoo! pulling up
the tech stocks,'' said Brian Belski, vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ''But the question is: What will tomorrow
bring? There is still a lot of indecision in the market and the
performance has been very varied.''
</P>
<P>
   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the
country's improved productivity, which analysts took as a sign that
inflation may be in check.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been signs that the pace of the
economy is slowing down, and without any inflationary pressures,
investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates
after six rate hikes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, however, were still watching their moves ahead
of another speech from Greenspan on Wednesday night at a conference
organized by the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New York investment bank PaineWebber rose $16.375 to
$66.313 after it announced that it was being purchased by Swiss
banking group UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The merger set off a rally in banking and financial services
stocks. Lehman Brothers rose $6.625 to $113.063 and Merrill Lynch
gained $2.375 to $131.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 799.2 million shares,
up from 785.54 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 7.98 at 537.72.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Policy Accused of Payoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy has
been accused of paying $1,000 to fix a criminal case for one of his
clients in 1985, according to an FBI report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rich, a prosecutor convicted of racketeering, told two
FBI agents and a federal prosecutor that Policy paid the money to
help Tom O'Nesti, a close friend of mobster Joseph Naples,
according to court documents filed Tuesday in Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   Policy, who was a defense attorney in Youngstown in the 1980s,
called the accusation false.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I can say is that I have never, throughout my
entire professional career as an attorney, participated in or
directed any kind of payoff to any public official to influence the
outcome of any case I've had,'' he said during training camp. ''I
don't know how to say it any simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by FBI agent Robert Kroner on mob-related activities
was part of the documents filed for a separate case.
</P>
<P>
   Rich has been a government witness since he pleaded guilty to a
federal racketeering charge in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, an assistant prosecutor at the time, recommended to a
judge that O'Nesti receive probation for a charge of receiving
stolen property, according Kroner's report.
</P>
<P>
   Kroner's report stated that Rich told him he received the money
during a party at Policy's home attended by Edward Flask Jr.,
Policy's law partner at the time, and Edward DeBartolo Jr., who was
owner of the San Francisco 49ers and at one time Policy's best
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report was obtained by attorney Sherman Miles who is
representing a police officer from the Youngstown suburb of
Campbell in a lawsuit against Rich and former Youngstown mob boss
Lenine Strollo.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that Strollo and Rich, who was law director
and prosecutor for Campbell, conspired to fix a civil service test
given for the police chief's position in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Miles refused to say how he obtained the report. He noted that
the accusations against Policy were just two paragraphs of Kroner's
16-page report on mob-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   Messages were left Wednesday for FBI spokesman Bob Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Kroner's report also includes accusations by Rich that Policy
told him he gave money to then-Mahoning County prosecutor Gary Van
Brocklin to fix O'Nesti's case. O'Nesti pleaded guilty to a charge
of receiving stolen property and received probation.
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment was left with a woman who answered the
phone at Van Brocklin's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Policy was named legal counsel for the 49ers in 1983 but
maintained his Youngstown practice. He became team president in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned from the 49ers in July 1998 and teamed with
billionaire Al Lerner in a bid to own the expansion Cleveland
Browns.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Offers Drug Benefit Compromise  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prescription drug costs would be shared by
people on Medicare and the government and hospital benefits would
be enhanced under an effort to reach compromise on an issue that
has sharply divided Republicans and Democrats in this election
year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Sen. William Roth, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, was greeted Wednesday by cautious optimism among
Democrats and the White House -- and some grumbling from Republicans
concerned about potentially huge new government costs and
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Roth, R-Del., said the differences could be resolved in time
for a Senate vote before Congress ends its session this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a real effort to bring together a bipartisan
program,'' Roth told reporters prior to a closed-door Finance
Committee meeting. ''We're all in agreement that Medicare is one of
our most important domestic programs, but it has to be brought into
the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft measure is an attempt to find middle ground between
the 10-year, $250 billion government-run Medicare drug proposal
advocated by President Clinton and a House-passed Republican bill
based mainly on subsidized private insurance. Clinton has offered
to sign a GOP tax cut for married couples if Congress sends him an
acceptable Medicare drug measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Clinton urged lawmakers to continue
working in a bipartisan fashion to provide the drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased that there is growing momentum on Capitol Hill to
provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit, not a flawed
insurance model,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart went further, calling Roth's
proposal ''a sharp repudiation of what the House Republicans
proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., an architect of the House bill, said
he welcomed the Senate's entry into the debate but said there
weren't enough specifics to comment in detail. He accused the White
House of ''working to divide and destroy, not to try to reach a
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In Roth's plan, Medicare recipients would have a choice between
the traditional program, which has no drug benefit, and a new
''Expanded Option'' program.
</P>
<P>
   For people who opted for the new system, the government would
share prescription drug expenses above a not-yet-finalized
deductible amount. One deductible being discussed was $500.
</P>
<P>
   Above that deductible, the government would pay half of all drug
costs up to another level -- one preliminary figure was $3,500 -- and
as much as 80 percent of the costs above that. This appeals to
Republican conservatives interested in holding down costs, but many
Democrats say it would leave out millions of people with modest
drug costs and could still impose a steep burden on others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the ones with the highest drug costs would be in the
program,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. ''That's almost a
nonstarter with a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit would be administered by a new government
office that would contract with private companies to negotiate drug
purchases and provide other benefits. There also would be
unspecified subsidies for low-income people to buy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   People who took the new ''Expanded Option'' Medicare choice
would get a new hospitalization system as well.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Medicare recipients must pay a $776
deductible per hospitalization and a $100 deductible for services
under Part B such as home health care and skilled nursing. They
sometimes have to pay the hospitalization deductible up to three
times a year because of restrictions on the length of time of each
hospital stay per illness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Roth plan, both deductibles would be combined into one
-- the amount hasn't yet been decided, but $500 has been used as an
example -- and people on Medicare would get a full 365 days of
hospitalization with no further co-payment. Again to hold down
costs, some new co-payments of about 20 percent could be required
for services under Part B.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is likely to cost more than the $40 billion over
five years envisioned under the budget the Republican-led Congress
passed this year, prompting conservatives to warn against rushing
to pass the bill simply to appease voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't solve the problem by saying, 'Here's a great big
expensive program,''' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the Senate's
No. 2 Republican. ''I don't want to do what's politically
expedient. I want to do what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he has
given the Finance Committee a ''green light'' to work on the
measure and said he hoped to bring a Medicare drug measure to the
floor this year. Clinton adamantly opposes the House-passed private
insurance plan and the GOP won't pass Clinton's government-run
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, Roth's proposal is ''a distant light at the end of
the tunnel, but it's a light nonetheless,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont.

<HEADLINE> Dozens Hurt in Austria Crash Landing  </HEADLINE>
By ROLAND PRINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- An Airbus 310 with 150 people aboard ran
out of fuel Wednesday and crash-landed at Vienna's Schwechat
airport, slightly injuring 26 people.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian media said the plane ''glided'' toward the rough
landing with the engines turned off, but that the force of impact
ripped off an engine and badly damaged one wing. After touching
down just short of the runway, passengers were evacuated by
slipping down emergency slides.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 26 injured people were hospitalized, doctors
said. Most of the injuries were slight, such as cuts and bruises,
they said, and most of those hospitalized were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, which was chartered by the German company
Hapag-Lloyd, was traveling from western Crete to Hanover, Germany,
the Austria Press Agency reported. It was carrying 142 passengers
and eight crew.
</P>
<P>
   Before the emergency landing, the pilot reported the 10-year-old
plane's engines had stopped functioning, said Heinz Sommerbauer, a
spokesman for air traffic control in Austria. Though the cause of
the problem was unclear, officials of Hapag-Lloyd said the pilot
could not retract the landing gear after takeoff. Such a
malfunction leads to increased fuel consumption, pilots and airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After the landing gear failed to retract, the pilot decided to
make a stopover in Munich, then changed his mind and headed for
Vienna, said Wolfgang Hubert, press spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert said reaching Vienna ''would have been easily possible
according to the (fuel) gauge.'' But the plane suddenly ran out of
fuel on the approach to Vienna, necessitating the emergency
landing.
</P>
<P>
   In an Austrian state television interview, Austrian pilot
Manfred Laa praised his colleague aboard the Airbus, whose name was
not released.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certainly a great achievement of the colleague to land
such a big aircraft without engine performance,'' Laa said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency landing closed the airport for about 30 minutes.
One runway remained closed later in the day.

Sabres general manager Darcy Regier said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed, but it
probably is considerably less than the $800,000 he was scheduled to
make under his old deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's agent, Roland Thompson, said Ray wants to play at least
two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although it turned a little sour at the beginning, I think it
was wonderful process for everybody because Robby's pumped up and I
think the Sabres are,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, 32, was out of town Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   He is the team's longest-serving current player.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, the Sabres' fifth-round selection in the 1988 draft, made
his NHL debut a year later and his 714 games rank seventh with the
team. Ray's 2,687 career penalty minutes are the most by any player
with one team, and 11th on the league's career list. He has 34
goals and 75 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ray won the 1999 King Clancy Memorial Trophy for leadership and
humanitarian contributions to the community. He works closely with
the March of Dimes, Make-A-Wish program and Buffalo-area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ray appeared in 69 games last season but his ice time diminished
down the stretch, and he did not appear in Buffalo's first-round
playoff loss to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres coach Lindy Ruff put Ray behind the bench as an extra
assistant coach in the playoffs.

<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Dominique Canty returned from injury
to score 15 points, 10 in the first half, as the Detroit Shock beat
the Seattle Storm 61-56 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canty had missed three games with a groin strain, but she helped
Detroit build a 33-28 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Palmer, named to the Eastern Conference All-Star roster
before the game, added 12 points for the Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shot just 35 percent from the floor, but stayed in the
game with a team-record 10 3-pointers. Jamie Redd led the Storm
with 17 points, including four 3-pointers, and Sonja Henning scored
all 12 of her points from beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock expanded their lead to 38-30 early in the second half,
before Seattle scored the next eight points to tie the game with
13:49 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The score again was tied at 46 with 7:20 left, when Anna
DeForge's three-point play put Detroit ahead. Canty's two free
throws increased the margin to five.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle went scoreless for nearly three minutes, allowing
Detroit to take a 52-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Redd scored the next five points, including her final 3-pointer,
to pull Seattle within one with 4:44 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Shock answered with a 7-2 run to settle the game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Canty, Detroit got Claudia Maria das Neves back
from an ankle injury. But the team put forward Olympia
Scott-Richardson (ankle) on the injured list before the game and
activated Barbara Farris.

<HEADLINE> Arab, Jewish Americans Express Hope  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In shops and on street corners, in full-page
newspaper ads and e-mailed statements, Arab and Jewish Americans
expressed hopes and fears about the outcome of the Camp David
summit on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In Dearborn, Mich., home to many Arab-Americans, clothing store
manager Kamal Bazzi said he was praying for peace and advised the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to look beyond the immediate issues
to the value of peace itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''To name this land for me, this land for you -- it doesn't make
any difference, you're still going to live together ... You can
live in peace. That's important in life,'' said the Lebanese-born
Bazzi, 63.
</P>
<P>
   Full page ads in The New York Times on Wednesday showed that he
was not alone in hoping the Camp David talks might lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Overwhelming Majority of American Jews Support This Peace
Initiative,'' read an open letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak signed by 384 people, including high-ranking officials from
many American Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to Camp David, Welcome to Peace at Last!'' read
another ad, taken out by the Center for Middle East Peace &AMP;
Economic Cooperation, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton,
are meeting at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland
to grapple with obstacles to peace.
</P>
<P>
   As they approach a Sept. 13 deadline for a final accord, the two
sides remain far apart on key issues, including the future of
Jerusalem. The Palestinians want traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
as the capital of their would-be state, but Israel insists the
entire city should be under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by representatives of several major Muslim
organizations said that the sanctity of Jerusalem and its Al-Aqsa
Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam, is ''not open to
negotiation at the upcoming Camp David summit and that no
individual has the right to sign away Islamic rights in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Given Israel's track record, we believe that it is
fundamentally inappropriate for President Clinton to pressure the
Palestinians into any further compromise on Jerusalem,'' read the
e-mailed statement.
</P>
<P>
   And Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on
American-Islamic Relations, a national advocacy group based in
Washington, said ''I don't think there's much optimism at all that
any agreement good for Muslims will come out of Camp David,''
citing Jerusalem as a particularly tough problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, said he believed it would be a ''deal-breaker'' if Arafat
held out for east Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak ''couldn't sell that to the Israeli public,'' said Hier.
</P>
<P>
   A full-page ad in the New York Post dubbed the summit
''Clinton's Attempted Swindle of the Century.'' The Jewish people
''do not want Barak to represent them in any negotiation with
Yasser Arafat,'' said the ad placed by the Wheaton, Md.-based
Concerned American Citizens for Peace and Security in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought nothing at all would come of Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Manal Makhlouf, 18, a recent immigrant from Lebanon living in
Dearborn, said in Arabic through a translator, ''They're talking
too much and not doing anything ... It's going to be like the other
peace talks.''

<HEADLINE> Cubans Condemn U.S. Migration Law  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Communist lawmakers on Wednesday unanimously
condemned a U.S. law they say encourages Cubans to migrate
illegally to the United States, putting their lives and those of
their children at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Adjustment Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966,
allows illegal Cuban immigrants who reach American soil to remain
and apply for legal residency after a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a perverse policy, deliberately conceived to destabilize
and suffocate Cuban society, cynically calculated to provoke death
and suffering, shamelessly manipulating the tragedies that this law
causes,'' said the proclamation approved by the National Assembly
as it opened its two-day session.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro presided over the morning session. He
noted that in the week after 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez returned to
Cuba, several large groups of illegal Cuban migrants started out on
the same dangerous journey that cost the boy's mother her life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the killer Cuban Adjustment Act,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's mother and 10 others perished in their attempt to reach
U.S. shores last November, and Elian was set adrift. Two men on a
fishing trip found him floating on an inner tube off the coast of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a case last week, the U.S. Coast Guard found 36 Cuban
migrants, including four children, stranded on a deserted island in
the Bahamas without food or water. Four of the migrants -- a
pregnant woman, a man complaining of abdominal pain, an unconscious
14-year-old girl and her mother -- were taken to hospitals in the
Florida Keys. The other 32 were turned over to Bahamian authorities
for repatriation to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans picked up on the high seas once also were given the
chance for legal American residency. But under 1994 and 1995
Cuba-U.S migration accords designed to stem an exodus of boat
people, the U.S. Coast Guard now returns them to the island unless
they have reached U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities blame the 1966 law for the international
custody battle over Elian, who returned to Cuba with his father on
June 28 after a seven-month battle with relatives who fought to
keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban leaders also says the law gives ammunition to their
political enemies in Florida, who describe the migrants as
desperate boat people fleeing their communist homeland for freedom.
Havana maintains that the vast majority of Cuban migrants are
simply seeking the same economic opportunities sought in America by
Haitians, Dominicans and others from across the Western Hemisphere.
Migrants from those countries who are caught in the United States
without visas are not allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a colossal operation of falsification of acts and promotion
of lies, they have tried to present Cubans as people who want to
'escape' to North America, and that the United States as a
'generous' nation receives them,'' Wednesday's proclamation said.
That argument ''doesn't contain an atom of truth,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation also said the U.S. policy admits criminals who
never could have gotten visas and encourages immigrant smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Complain of Russian Troops  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAIRTUP, Russia (AP) -- Chechen women selling cigarettes, beer
and vodka outside this Russian-held village in Chechnya told on
Wednesday of drunken Russian soldiers shooting in the air, beating
women and emptying houses of valuables.
</P>
<P>
   ''Previously, our concern was to earn a little money to buy
bread. Now we think how to earn money and remain alive,'' said
Yakha Mirzoyeva, one of about eight women clad in black dresses and
kerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The women sell cheap cigarettes, beer and nuts, vodka and
pharmaceutical alcohol from their makeshift wooden tables. Alcohol
and Russian Ochakovo beer, they say, are the items of choice among
the soldiers, who are the main buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But relations with the army are rough in this village 19 miles
southeast of the Chechen capital Grozny. The women describe
continual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soldiers get drunk frequently, they shoot in the air,
threaten and humiliate us,'' said Mirzoyeva. ''I'm not sure that I
will be alive tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Maret Maskhadova, whose family name coincidentally is that of
Chechnya's separatist President Aslan Maskhadov, said she was often
questioned and beaten by troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once in the winter, I was so badly beaten that I couldn't walk
for a week,'' Maskhadova said. ''My husband has become a cripple
with kidney problems and concussion. This is what the soldiers did
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Zara Dadayeva, said soldiers have emptied Chechen
homes in the village of most valuables during raids in search of
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Mairtup has been quiet in recent days but troops stationed here
are tense, fearing rebel attacks such as the nine skirmishes
reported elsewhere in the breakaway republic overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks usually don't inflict heavy casualties but have put
a constant strain on the Russians. They reflect how Moscow can't
keep even keep the two-thirds of Chechnya it controls free of
violence despite beefing up security and imposing a curfew.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight attacks targeted the capital Grozny and its
outskirts, and two servicemen were wounded, a spokesman with the
Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Dagestan, the target of a rebel invasion last
year, security agents thwarted a major bomb attack by discovering
10 containers filled with explosives under railway tracks, Russia's
security service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The service, or FSB, said in a statement that the foiled attack
was planned on a high ''professional level,'' and the security
service again warned ''the citizens of Russia about the reality of
the threats by Chechen and international extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   A rebel leader said the militants recognized such attacks were
their most effective weapon against the federal troops, who far
outnumber them and have far more arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider it a large-scale operation when small groups of
our fighters are involved in the combat actions throughout the
entire territory of Chechnya,'' field commander Mumadi Saidayev
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces kept up their air and artillery raids, with
Russian jets flying 50 sorties in the last 24 hours, the military
command said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Officer Sentenced for Spying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Moscow court has sentenced a Russian military
officer to four years in a penal colony for photographing
top-secret documents and trying to sell them abroad, the Federal
Security Service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer in the Defense Ministry's scientific research
institute used his security clearance to photograph papers that
detailed developments in Russian military aircraft electronics, the
service said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the suspect, identified as Lt. Col. Sergei Avramenko,
tried to take the documents to an unidentified foreign country in
May 1996 and sell them, but was foiled by a counterintelligence
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's RTR television reported that the secret service found
proof of Avramenko's intentions some two years after seizing the
documents from him. It said Avramenko had worked at the research
facility for 15 years and decided to photograph the documents
before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The service called the documents ''the object of primary
aspiration of foreign secret services, whose leaking out beyond the
borders of the country could have posed a serious threat to the
security of the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   Avramenko was convicted of state treason and sentenced to four
years at a maximum-security penal colony, the Federal Security
Service statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In footage shown on RTR, Avramenko, clean-shaven and wearing a
white shirt, said he disagreed with the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not true,'' he said. ''They talk of disclosing state
secrets (but) there was no damage whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has gone through several spy scandals in recent years,
expelling alleged spies from other countries and arresting Russian
citizens it accused of espionage. It has held an American
businessman in a Moscow jail since April on charges that he tried
to buy information about submarine-launched torpedoes.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Front-page photos of the good-natured
tussle at a doorway between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders
trying to usher each other into their joint meeting with President
Clinton got some chuckles Wednesday at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the subject of a lot of laughing around the breakfast
table,'' White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said about the
''You first!'' ''No, you!'' exchange by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But underscoring the gravity of the Mideast peace talks in a
briefing, Lockhart repeated the word ''difficult'' eight times,
''serious'' five times and ''struggle'' four.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are very SERIOUS issues,'' Lockhart said. ''We have
known all along that this was going to be a STRUGGLE and it is. The
discussions are SERIOUS, but the positions that both parties bring
here represent what they see as vital interests to their people,
and have been DIFFICULT issues that we've worked on now for many,
many years.
</P>
<P>
   ''So to the extent that we went into this knowing it would be a
STRUGGLE, we have not been disappointed by that. This is a very
DIFFICULT process in a short time frame with very DIFFICULT issues,
and they are working in a very SERIOUS way, but we certainly know
that this effort, from the beginning, will be a STRUGGLE.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Getting quality time with dad this week means hanging out at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance for President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, to
witness history-in-the-making -- and watch America's favorite
pasttime on TV.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday
evening, Clinton retired to Aspen Lodge for the evening and spent
time with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president, for his part, went back and watched the end of
the all-star game with his daughter Chelsea,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said he wasn't sure what Chelsea was doing during the
talks. When she celebrated her 16th birthday at the camp with
classmates from Sidwell Friends School in Washington, the
activities included skeet shooting, a capture-the-flag game with
paintball guns, a video scavenger hunt and movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''She had a chance to meet both leaders yesterday,'' Lockhart
said. ''The president introduced her to both. ... I think she's
both getting a chance to witness and important event and also
enjoy, you know, something she's grown to enjoy, the atmosphere at
Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bowling alley at Camp David hasn't exactly been the ''in''
place to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I checked this morning,'' Lockhart said. ''No one entered the
bowling alley yesterday. ... But I certainly have personal plans to
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, though, that the laid-back, recreational
atmosphere at the presidential retreat was facilitating the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are meetings going on both formal and informal all over
the place. At breakfast, the delegations are sitting together in
small groups and having discussions,'' he said. ''You see people
walking around, you see members of the delegations driving around
together in golf carts, which is the mode of transportation out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But while President Carter took Israeli and Egyptian leaders on
a day trip to a nearby civil war battlefield during the Mideast
summit here in 1978, Lockhart said he didn't expect the leaders to
wander off the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, given the fact that we have an enormous task in front
of us and that time is not unlimited, that they'll stay
concentrated on the issues at hand,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Begay Leads Loch Lomond Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Notah Begay, winner of two straight
tournaments in the United States, shot a 6-under-par 65 Wednesday
for a share of the first-round lead at the Loch Lomond
international.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only player this year to win U.S. tour events in
consecutive weeks and the first since Tiger Woods won three
straight at the end of last season. He has won four tournaments in
10 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't shot a really low score this year and I thought I
could shoot one today,'' said Begay, who shares the lead with South
Africa's Retief Goosen. ''I felt pretty lucky to shoot what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Begay had an eagle at the 505-yard third hole and birdies at the
fifth, seventh and ninth for a front-nine score of 31. He added
birdies at the 12th and 13th to go 7-under but bogeyed the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Begay won his last two starts at the St. Jude Classic and
Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to get to the weekend and put myself as close to
the lead as possible,'' Begay said. ''If I happen to be near the
top, it's great. I don't want to get too happy about things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Loch Lomond event is the last European event before next
week's British Open at St. Andrews. Woods, who is not playing this
week, is seeking a British Open title to complete a career Grand
Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Begay, the only American Indian on tour, was a college teammate
of Woods at Stanford. They played together on the Walker Cup team
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Begay was arrested on a drunken driving charge in
his hometown of Albuquerque, N.M., and spent a week in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Goosen began with two bogeys but birdied five of the next seven
and birdied three more coming home including the 16th and 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman was one shot back at 66, along with 19-year-old
Australian Adam Scott, playing in his fourth tournament as a pro,
and another Aussie, Stephen Allan.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, who flew into the Scotland the day before, made
68 to be three off the lead but at one stage was 6 under. A double
bogey six at 16 pulled him back.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Colin Montgomerie shot a 70, as did David
Duval on his first look at the course after arriving from Ireland
the previous evening.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo, still feuding with former European Ryder Cup captain
Mark James, shot a 67. James had a 73.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo thinks James should have resigned or been disciplined for
revealing in a book that he tossed a good luck letter from Faldo
into a trash can before last year's Ryder Cup in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, James received the unanimous support of the
European PGA Tour's tournament committee to continue as assistant
to new Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now I really want to concentrate on the golf,'' Faldo
said. ''But if what he said (in his book) was not a breach of the
tour's code of conduct or bringing the game into disrepute, I don't
know what is.''
</P>
<P>
   Faldo said he would he happy to meet James after the British
Open to discuss their differences.

<HEADLINE> Israel Calls Off Radar Sale to China  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel called off a planned military sale to
China, heading off more American criticism of the deal, as it
entered the second day of U.S.-brokered peace talks with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak informed President Clinton at the
Mideast summit in nearby Maryland that he was canceling a planned
quarter-billion-dollar sale of an advanced airborne radar warning
system to China, officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it was pleased, and a U.S. congressman
dropped his plan to ask the House later Wednesday to punish Israel
by withholding some of its aid money.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was a wise move by Israel to get the
contentious issue out of the way and improve chances for continued
American good will during the difficult peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the decision,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart. ''We are pleased to see they have taken our security
concerns into account in making this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said the prime minister had
''expressed sorrow'' in a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin
that the sale had been scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is right now together with the United States in the
midst of an effort to achieve historic decisions relating to her
vital interests,'' Baltiansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Baltiansky did not say explicitly that Israel had yielded
to U.S. pressure, he said the step was taken against ''the
background of American objections'' to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a very, very smart thing for them to do,'' Brookings
Institution Middle East fellow Shibley Telhami said of Israel.
''There's no question that even aside from the summit, this has
been a huge contentious issue that Israel would have had to resolve
sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting it out of the way now, Telhami said, was important to
maintain ''American good will'' as Israel attempts to complete a
peace plan that now depends on U.S. diplomatic help and later could
depend on U.S. economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had insisted that Israel scrap the sale of the
radar plane, called PHALCON, pointing to tensions between China and
Taiwan and expressing concern that China could use the plane to
track American planes should hostilities erupt.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, representatives from both parties had threatened to
cut U.S. aid to Israel if the deal went through.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who had proposed cutting military
aid to Israel by $250 million if the sale to China proceeded, said
Wednesday there was now ''no need to do that'' because of Israel's
''very wise decision'' to cancel the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my entire mission ... to send them a very strong
message that this was a very serious concern'' to many Americans,
Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The military deal represented a major effort by Israel to
improve its relations with China and expand its diplomatic and
business contacts worldwide. But Israel decided that its unique
relationship with the United States had to take highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration eager to stop the sale, there
were reports last week that Israel would modify arrangements by
proceeding with the transaction through a third country.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltiansky told The Associated Press the deal was off in all
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The radar system and the modified Boeing 707 on which it is
mounted are valued at an estimated $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some Israeli officials have noted that U.S.
sales to Saudi Arabia -- technically at war with Israel and
vulnerable to a takeover by anti-Western Islamic militants -- have
included advanced radar systems and combat aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Villagers Bury Pipeline Fire Victims  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVIRI-COURT, Nigeria (AP) -- Firefighters attempted to douse
burning pools of gasoline Wednesday, struggling to extinguish a
pipeline fire as villagers whisked away charred bodies and hastily
buried them to avoid retribution from police.
</P>
<P>
   While exactly what set off Monday's explosion remains unclear,
oil company officials blamed a fuel smuggling ring for puncturing
the pipeline to siphon off gasoline. Witnesses have counted more
than 100 bodies, but the true death toll may never be known as
relatives sneak away with corpses to keep police from identifying
the vandals and searching their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The flames flared up again Wednesday after dying down during
overnight rains. Clouds of black smoke hung over the area, near the
villages of Adeje and Oviri-Court, north of the port of Warri in
the oil-rich Niger Delta. The pipeline was carrying gasoline from a
refinery in Warri to northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Many bodies, burned beyond recognition, lay in the field next to
the inferno. Buildings within a one-mile radius of the blast were
destroyed or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the reported 100 injured were taken to the
hospital. Many others were being treated at home by traditional
doctors because they feared arrest. In the past, the government has
prosecuted and even threatened to shoot pipeline vandals on sight.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy closely resembled a similar accident in nearby
Jesse, where more than 700 people were killed in October 1998.
Since then, the government has tried to educate villagers about the
danger of ''scooping,'' the illegal practice of scavenging fuel
from pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Edebia, a 14-year-old resident of Adeje, said his
brother was killed collecting fuel despite numerous warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother had been telling him to stop the petrol business but
he would not hear. The money he was making used to help us in the
family. But now that he is dead that money is gone,'' Edebia said.
</P>
<P>
   The price paid by the victims was visible in human remains
smudged black by fire. Visiting government officials who toured the
disaster scene with journalists on Wednesday stopped at one charred
corpse, unrecognizable except for a necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Delta State Governor James Ibori stared in silent disbelief
before finally uttering: ''This is not acceptable.'' Later he
called on the national government to boost security and education
efforts to prevent another disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Edorah Agbah, a state petroleum company spokesman, blamed the
tragedy on villagers who, he said, cut open the pipe. The vandals
were part of an organized smuggling network that sells scavenged
fuel, Agbah said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline has been sabotaged seven times since January in
exactly the same spot, he said, explaining that many poor villagers
in Oviri-Court had large fuel tanks behind their huts to store the
stolen fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the smuggling is well organized, you will be
shocked,'' Agbah said. ''They actually bring in vehicles to come
and load up.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the pipeline had been punctured days earlier.
Children and adults flocked to the area each day from surrounding
villages to gather the gasoline and sell it along roadsides, the
witnesses added.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokesman, Doyin Okupe on Tuesday
said greedy business operators were encouraging pipeline vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is driven by poverty and greed,'' Okupe said. ''They know
the risks. It is very difficult for us to (convince people to stop)
when people already know the risks.''
</P>
<P>
   A local police official, Supt. Musa Kimo, said his men had
repeatedly shut down the operation only to see it start up again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a vehicle to move into the area and my unit is
understaffed,'' Kimo complained.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cases of pipeline sabotage are reported each year in
Nigeria. Some are carried out by militant activists trying to force
the government and oil companies to give compensation to
communities for land use and alleged pollution. In other cases,
villagers collect the gushing fuel to make a crude mixture of oil
and gasoline for generators and other motors.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of the oil imported by the United States.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Vermeer' Opera  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blood, flood, a lynch mob -- in ''Writing to
Vermeer,'' more goes on visually on stage than in any other 10
operas put together, and the brilliant, dazzlingly original effects
serve this Dutch opera well, even while hogging the attention.
</P>
<P>
   It all gets a bit much in the second to last scene of this one
hour and 40-minute intermissionless opera, when 18 women smear
their hands and aprons in fake blood, remove their aprons and don
gold frames over their black dresses.
</P>
<P>
   But that should be no surprise, considering that the libretto
was written by Peter Greenaway, the famously inventive maker of
such avant garde movies as ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' and
''Drowning By Numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera, which opened the three-week Lincoln Center Festival
on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater, is a contemporary
work by Dutch composer Louis Andriessen. The libretto consists of
letters to Vermeer from three women -- his wife, mother-in-law and a
model -- when the painter traveled from Delft to the Hague in 1672.
The trip actually happened but the letters are fiction, invented by
Greenaway to show the harmonious home life that Vermeer depicted in
his paintings -- women playing the lute, writing with quill pens,
pouring milk or striking pensive poses.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer isn't in the opera, and all solo and chorus parts are
taken by women.
</P>
<P>
   Andriessen's music is by turns melancholy and cheery, its lines
short and lyrical. Sometimes it sounds baroque, other times
syncopated. There are many orchestral interludes, with lots of
movement on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Women scrub the stage, carry tables on and off, sit on the edge
of the stage and dangle their feet in water. One flew and spun for
a long time in aerial harness. Screens project movies or Vermeer
paintings. One movie pictures Cornelia, one of the 11 Vermeer
children, with a cake on her 9th birthday. Costumes are lowered
from above for on-stage changes.
</P>
<P>
   Ominous electronic music by Michel van der Aa heralds several
bad moments in Dutch history, explained in big letters on the back
wall. First the tulip market crashes. Then, in the final image,
things get really dramatic as 7,000 gallons of water deluge the
stage to symbolize Holland breaching its dikes to fend off a French
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Narucki sang Catharina, the wife, in a clear soprano.
Barbara Hannigan's soprano was youthfully sweet as the model,
Saskia. Mezzo-soprano Kathryn Harries sounded confident singing
Maria, Catharina's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Reinbert de Leeuw conducted. Saskia Boddeke directed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Letters to Vermeer'' was premiered Dec. 1 in Amsterdam by the
Netherlands Opera, which performed it at the Adelaide Festival in
Australia in March and here.

<HEADLINE> Former Archbishop of Canterbury Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Robert Runcie, whose tenure as archbishop of
Canterbury was marked by divisions over the ordination of women and
the introduction of modernized liturgies, has died. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie died Tuesday at his home in Hertfordshire after a long
battle with cancer, said a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace, the
official residence of the archbishops.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie led a Church of England that was sometimes at odds with
the government, and his aide Terry Waite was taken hostage in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I can persuade the church to loosen its stays a bit,
and perhaps rock the boat a little,'' Runcie said just before he
became the 102nd archbishop in 1980, embarking on a momentous
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie sometimes appeared as the leading critic of Margaret
Thatcher's government. He antagonized Thatcher, who had appointed
him, through his criticism of the government's tactics in beating a
strike by coal miners and through his prayers for all the dead of
the Falkland Islands war.
</P>
<P>
   ''War springs from the love and loyalty which should be offered
to God being applied to some God substitute, one of the most
dangerous being nationalism,'' he said at the official thanksgiving
service after the Falklands conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie knew the terrors of war firsthand, as a decorated tank
commander in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never doubted his conviction, never doubted that he spoke
his mind as he believed about things,'' said Norman Tebbitt, a
member of Thatcher's Cabinet. ''But, you know, being an archbishop
doesn't necessarily make you any more right than being a Cabinet
minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher saluted Runcie on Wednesday as ''a warm, good, brave
man and, though we sometimes differed, a friend for more than 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Waite, who was a hostage from 1987 to 1991, remembered Runcie as
''a witty, good-humored man who got on with people easily.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the two men did not always see eye to eye. Runcie once
described Waite as a ''grandstander,'' while Waite complained of a
lack of support from his boss.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, who was Runcie's assistant for matters within the
worldwide Anglican communion, was drawn into Lebanon in 1985 by a
letter from four hostages: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press; the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, a
Roman Catholic priest; David Jacobsen, director of the American
University Hospital in Beirut; and Thomas Sutherland, the
university's dean of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Runcie initially supported Waite's efforts to free the hostages,
but came to believe Waite was being manipulated by the U.S.
government and wanted him to return to church work.
</P>
<P>
   Waite thought otherwise. ''What would it say to men who were in
prison if we said, 'Sorry, we're pulling out because it's too
tough,''' he told Runcie's biographer, Humphrey Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Waite praised Runcie as ''a good man in every
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was exceptionally kind and supportive to my family during
that time, though of course I did not know anything about it until
my release,'' Waite said.
</P>
<P>
   In Runcie's time, the Church of England was divided over the
ordination of women, which was finally approved in 1993. He also
pushed the church to take a more liberal line on remarrying
divorced people, an effort that bore fruit after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Though Runcie was not personally opposed to ordaining women, he
feared welcoming them into the priesthood would split the church
and hamper its ecumenical overtures to Roman Catholics and Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody thinks that it is easy and it doesn't cost very
much to your personal soul to pursue the middle way, if anybody
thinks that it's simple trying to please everybody like a
chameleon, let them come and try and ponder the Scripture and say
their prayers and try to hold the church together,'' Runcie told
The Guardian newspaper at the end of his time as archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Rosalind, son James and daughter
Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral service will be held at the cathedral in St. Albans on
July 22.

<HEADLINE> Madrid Car Bomb Injures 10  </HEADLINE>
By KERNAN TURNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Fifteen minutes after a warning from a
caller claiming to be a Basque separatist, a car bomb exploded
Wednesday outside a major Madrid department store, injuring 10
people.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the injured were policemen who rushed to the scene after
learning of the warning. Two others were homeless people who had
been sleeping outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous caller to the fire department said the bomb would
go off in 30 minutes and claimed responsibility on behalf of the
Basque separatist group ETA, said Javier Ansuategui, an Interior
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   The car bomb detonated at 6:30 a.m., 15 minutes after the
warning. Police chief Juan Cotino said this meant ETA had intended
to kill bomb disposal experts and police.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb went off outside the Corte Ingles department store in
the Plaza Callao business and shopping district in the heart of the
capital. Businesses in the area normally open at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The blast gutted the entrance of the popular department store,
destroying a concrete awning over the doorway and shattering
windows all the way up the building's nine stories.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Montes, who was sleeping in a nearby hostel at the
time of the blast, said: ''I'd never heard a car bomb before but
when I heard this I knew exactly what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza Callao is several blocks from the city's central
square, the Plaza Mayor. Police blocked access to the area and
searched for other bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the blast, hundreds of people gathered a few blocks
from the site of the attack and stood in silence protest for 10
minutes. Previous killings claimed by the ETA sparked outraged
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- the initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the
Basque language -- has killed some 800 people during a 30-year
campaign for independence of the Basque region of northern Spain.
ETA is blamed for five killings since ending a 14-month cease-fire
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, ETA set off a bomb in the same area, killing a
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesman Pio Cabanillas said security cameras
scanning the area had filmed the car being left at Plaza del Callao
Wednesday. The stolen white Renault contained an estimated 35
pounds of explosives. Cabanillas called the attack ''an absolute
barbarity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basque regional government called the blast ''absolutely
unjustifiable and unacceptable.'' Spokesman Josu Jon Imaz said:
''The road of violence leads absolutely nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basque government is led by a moderate Basque nationalist
party, which advocates further autonomy and eventual independence
for the Basque region, but says it opposes ETA.

<HEADLINE> Hog Producers To Vote on Promotion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog producers will vote Sept. 19-21 on whether
to keep paying a fee that funds the ''other white meat''
advertising campaign for pork, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Votes will be cast at local offices of USDA's Farm Service
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first referendum on the pork program since it was
created 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the program, which pays for research as well as
advertising, say it has done little to stimulate pork consumption
and mostly benefits meat processors and large, corporate farms.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Johnson, a Minnesota producer who is leading a campaign to
keep the program, said it has been ''a phenomenal success at what
it was designed to do, build demand and address issues that
individual producers couldn't do on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting is open to farmers who will have sold at least one
hog from Aug. 18, 1999, through Aug. 17 of this year. Importers of
hogs and pork also will be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Absentee voting will take place Aug. 18 to Sept. 21. Absentee
ballots will be available Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The fee requires payment of 45 cents for every $100 of a pig's
value when it is sold. The money goes to the National Pork Board,
which contracts promotional services through the producers council.

<HEADLINE> Violent incidents down in New Jersey schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Total reported incidents of violence,
vandalism, weapons and substance abuse are down in New Jersey
schools, a new report says.
</P>
<P>
   Total incidents dropped 7 percent, from 27,872 in the 1997-98
school year to 25,969 in the 1998-99 school year, according to the
state Department of Education report.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down, violent incidents, such as fights, declined 7
percent, from 14,152 in 1997-98 to 13,320 in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   However, a subset of violent incidents, those involving school
staff members as victims, soared 30 percent. Many of those involved
only verbal threats, however.
</P>
<P>
   Education officials attributed the rise in violent incidents
involving staff to schools' increasing use of zero-tolerance
policies and to a heightened awareness of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, vandalism reports decreased by 12 percent. Weapons
offenses climbed 8 percent, an increase officials say was largely
driven by a rise in bomb scares.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of firearms possession dropped by 36 percent, and
substance abuse incidents declined by 5 percent, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   The report relies on voluntary reporting compliance by school
districts, some of which have differing interpretations of the
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always going to be gray areas, such as when do you
call a fight a fight,'' said department spokesman Richard Vespucci.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certain aspects of the report have always been subjective, but
we've tried to tighten it up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cells May Restore Sight to Blind  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scores of blind people in California and Taiwan are seeing again
through eyes refurbished in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental technique -- which involves transplanting
lab-grown cells to replenish the cornea's surface -- offers hope to
hundreds of thousands of people around the world blinded by fire,
chemical burns or certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the transplants are working for about 60 out of more
than 90 patients operated on at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Taipei and 11 of 15 at the medical school at the University of
California at Davis. Doctors do not yet know if the repair is
permanent, but the patients' improved sight has lasted up to 15
months so far.
</P>
<P>
   A report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine describes
the results in the first six patients operated on in Taiwan by Dr.
Ray Jui-Fang Tsai. Results from UC-Davis are described in the July
issue of the journal Cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors already transplant cells directly from one person's eye
to another to refurbish the cornea. But when that is done, the
donor must give about half of the cells from the limbus, the circle
where the clear cornea turns to white.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach requires only a tiny sliver from the donor's
limbus; those cells are then grown in a laboratory dish until ready
for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long term, what's going to happen to the donor eye 20 or 30
years from now? We don't know,'' said Dr. Edward Holland,
ophthalmology professor at the University of Cincinnati and
director of cornea services at the Cincinnati Eye Institute. ''This
lets us take less than 5 percent of the cells from the donor eye
and potentially -- this is very early -- but potentially get the same
results.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique could help perhaps tens of thousands of people in
the United States, as well as hundreds of thousands in developing
nations where a disease called trachoma is common, said Dr. Neil F.
Martin of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Trachoma is one of
the world's leading causes of blindness.
</P>
<P>
   It will not help people who are blind from birth or those who
lost their sight because of damage to the nerves or the retina. Nor
is it for the totally blind; it is only for people who can still at
least distinguish light and dark.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the patients who underwent the procedure had been burned
by fire or chemicals. Others had eyes scarred by disease or
reactions to eye drops. Standard cornea transplants had not worked
because the people did not have cells needed to grow a new
protective covering over the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who could see only fingers or hand motion at about
16 inches could see well enough to drive after the transplants.
Others could see clearly at a distance of a few inches. Other
patients could see well from the start, but the white of the eye
was growing toward the pupil, a condition that can cause blindness
unless it is corrected.
</P>
<P>
   For his first patients, and about 40 eyes in all, Tsai took
cells from the patient's own healthy eye to repair the diseased
eye. Virtually all of those transplants worked. He has also used
cells from cadavers and from patients' relatives to create
transplants for 54 eyes. About half of those worked.
</P>
<P>
   The approach relies on what are known as epithelial stem cells --
which grow replacements for the cells that cover the body's surface
and line most of its hollows, such as the inside of the digestive
system and lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal eye, epithelial stem cells in the limbus create new
cells to replace dead corneal cells. If those stem cells are
destroyed, the cornea can become scarred and opaque. The white of
the eye may grow over the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai's team took a slice eight-hundredths of an inch long from
the limbus and put it in a lab dish on top of a piece of amniotic
membrane, the thin film which holds the fluid around a fetus until
birth. When the corneal cells had grown to about an inch across,
Tsai removed the patient's damaged eye tissue and replaced it with
the membrane and the new eye cells.
</P>
<P>
   The UC-Davis team used a slightly different technique. Some of
the UC-Davis patients also got transplanted corneas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. R. Rivkah Isseroff, the cell biologist in charge of the lab
work at UC-Davis, said the only bioengineered replacement tissues
now commercially available are skin, which is used to treat burns
and chronic skin wounds, and cartilage, used for some knee
injuries. Corneal surface tissue could become the third type
available, she said.

<HEADLINE> GMO Lineup Short on Stars  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Whenever anyone asks Steve Stricker why he
plays the Greater Milwaukee Open every year, he tells them about
the galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker is a successful touring pro, but by no means a
superstar. Practically the only time he gets special treatment is
at the GMO. Last year, hundreds of vocal fans followed him and Skip
Kendall around Brown Deer Park as they played their final round.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Stricker and Kendall are Wisconsin natives, but
Stricker says every pro who skips an extra week of preparation for
next week's British Open can expect a similarly warm response at a
tournament that emphasizes the personal touch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crowd was phenomenal,'' Stricker said. ''I get chills just
thinking about walking up 18. That's the way this tournament is.
People really care about you.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which begins Thursday at Brown Deer Park,
features an eclectic field of working-class pros. The closest thing
to a headliner is Carlos Franco, the 1999 rookie of the year who is
back to defend his title.
</P>
<P>
   He is featured in a humorous tournament commercial describing
his journey from Paraguay to Milwaukee as a long par-4 hole, with
the flight from Asuncion to Miami described as ''a long carry over
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who last month successfully defended his Compaq Classic
title in New Orleans, has a chance to become just the 10th player
in tour history to defend two titles in the same year. At 15th on
the tour money list, he's also the highest-earning player in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   With his self-taught swing and eccentric practice habits, Franco
is not the typical tour player -- something that makes him a good
fit for an atypical tournament that is played on a generous public
course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like this course. I love this course,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was held around the Labor Day weekend until last
year, when it was moved to the week before the British. In years
when players are trying to accumulate Ryder Cup points, the move
improves the field. Last year, Tom Lehman was a last-minute entry,
and he got both the Ryder Cup points and a check for second place.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there's no such incentive, but the field still boasts
a number of quality tour veterans like Mark Calcavecchia, Scott
Hoch and Loren Roberts. Most say they feel loyalty to the
tournament and its organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Selling the city and the event isn't difficult,'' tournament
director Dan Croak said. ''It's the timing that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison native Jerry Kelly is back in the field after his
final-day collapse last year allowed Franco to run away with a
final-round 66. Franco, who beat Lehman by two strokes, had the
lowest tournament score since the GMO moved to Brown Deer Park in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin will play, as will Wisconsin natives Stricker, J.P.
Hayes and Kendall, who would dearly love to post his first tour
victory in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little extra emotional,'' Kendall said. ''You always
think about how much you'd like to win here. It would be almost too
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The purse has been increased to $2.5 million this year, with the
winner pocketing $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   The course was waterlogged earlier this month, but it's back in
good shape after 13 inches of rain fell on it in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''It drains very well, and we have good people working on it,''
Croak said. ''We're going to be more than ready.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Genes Blamed for Some Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Genes cause more than one-quarter of three major types of cancer
-- more than previously thought, but not enough to sustain hopes
that the cracking of the human genetic code could eliminate the
disease, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian researchers concluded that genes account for 42
percent of the risk for prostate cancer, 35 percent for colorectal
cancer, and 27 percent for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cases are caused by what people do, such as
smoking and diet, or what happens to them, such as on-the-job
hazards, random genetic mutations or viral infections, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, exceeds earlier estimates that genes account for 10
percent to 20 percent of all cancer, said Paul Lichtenstein, an
epidemiologist who led the study at the Karolinska Institute in
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conclusion runs contrary to the widespread belief
that scientists ''will find solutions or cures to all diseases in
the genes,'' Lichtenstein said. ''That won't be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is the largest of its kind yet, said Heather Spencer
Feigelson, senior epidemiologist for the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein and colleagues studied 44,788 sets of twins in
Sweden, Denmark and Finland. They looked at both identical twins,
who have the same genes, and fraternal twins, who are no more
closely related than any other brothers and sisters, to analyze the
importance of genetics in each type of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, genes probably account for 30 percent of various
cancers, Lichtenstein estimated in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the figures do not mean that someone whose
identical twin has prostate cancer has a 42 percent risk of
developing it, too. The identical twin of someone with breast,
colorectal or prostate cancer had an 11 percent to 18 percent risk
of developing the same cancer before age 75, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk was only 3 percent to 9 percent for fraternal twins.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures should go a long way toward dismissing the
widespread belief ''that if your sister has cancer, you're
doomed,'' said Dr. Robert N. Hoover, a director at the National
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someone with the identical set of genes has a much greater
chance of not developing cancer than of developing it,'' he said.
''I think that's a useful piece of information.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Scandinavian study, only breast, prostate and colorectal
cancer were common enough for full analysis. Lichtenstein said he
expects enough information over the next 10 to 20 years to analyze
10 more types of cancer.

<HEADLINE> Studies: Tests May Save X-Ray Money  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Proposed new checklists to rule out spine and brain
injuries
could save emergency rooms millions of dollars on X-rays and tens
of millions on CAT scans each year, two new studies say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each checklist uses simple criteria such as intoxication, lack
of alertness, or seizures to rule out the need for an X-ray or CAT
scan. The list for possible spinal injury includes five items; the
one for brain damage seven.
</P>
<P>
   If a patient has even one indicator, the doctor should order a
test for a clear picture of what has happened, doctors at UCLA and
Louisiana State University wrote in separate studies in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Because brain and spinal injuries can be devastating, doctors
are likely to order the tests just to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 X-rays of the upper spine are taken each year, and
less than 3 percent find problems, Dr. Jerome R. Hoffman of UCLA
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's screening test for spinal injuries was checked out on
more than 34,000 patients at 21 emergency centers across the
country, and worked as well at community hospitals as at major
trauma centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said it would have ruled out about one-eighth of the
X-rays taken -- a figure which, on a national scale, would cut about
100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It found 810 patients who had spinal injuries. It did miss
eight, but only one of them needed more than a collar to support
the head and neck for a while, and he had shown warning signs that
should have led doctors to order a test, Hoffman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That test could be used immediately, Drs. John A. Marx, chairman
of emergency medicine at Carolinas Medical Center, and Michelle H.
Biros, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of
Minnesota, wrote in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's head injury study was well done but needs confirmation on
a larger scale, they wrote.

<HEADLINE> Cable TV Eagerly Awaits Conventions  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After viewing a report on the reluctance of
broadcast networks to pre-empt prime-time entertainment for the
national political conventions, CNN's Bernard Shaw let it be known
that things were different on cable.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, he said, ''will cover the Republican and Democratic
conventions until the lights burn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's a promise or threat will be better known in a
month. Cable news networks are planning exhaustive coverage,
because the same economic factors that punish ABC, CBS and NBC for
covering politics reward the cable stations for every hour on the
air.
</P>
<P>
   CNN vows to spend nearly 100 hours on each gathering, nearly a
third more time than in 1996. Fox News Channel will devote about 10
hours a day to its first conventions. MSNBC, in its infancy in
1996, also promises to increase the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are meeting in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 3.
Democrats gather in Los Angeles from Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're really interested in the political process, you're
not going to get enough from the broadcast networks,'' said Rick
Kaplan, CNN USA president. ''In fact, the broadcast networks
themselves will be watching CNN when they're not on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nominations of Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Democrat Vice President Al Gore a certainty, the broadcast networks
are expected to devote an hour or two a night to the conventions --
and maybe less. ABC has consigned opening night coverage for both
conventions to halftime of exhibition football games.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks can get more viewers and advertising
revenue by showing ''Survivor'' and ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The more news that they have that forces them to pre-empt
their entertainment, the more money they lose,'' Kaplan said.
''With us, the more news we have, the better things are for us.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN, whose ratings are down dramatically in a slow news year,
has learned that the hard way. The network recently slipped behind
CNBC in viewership for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions offer hope: in 1996, CNN's viewership increased by
about 10 percent above the day-to-day average during the
gatherings, more in prime-time. Key political nights this year also
saw a viewership bump. More than 1 million households tuned in to
watch the Super Tuesday primary results in March, double CNN's
prime-time average of 513,000 households this year.
</P>
<P>
   CNN will charge roughly 20 percent more for advertisements
during the conventions, said Larry Goodman, the network's vice
president of sales. Advertisers believe it's a good opportunity to
reach an affluent and educated audience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With worries that the nightly convention sessions will be
programmed to look like infomercials, the networks say they will
frequently break away from the podium. The convention will be a
platform for in-depth stories on where the candidates stand, who's
financing their campaigns and how the parties define themselves,
Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News Channel, aggressively competing with CNN to be the
destination channel for political junkies, also expects more
viewers, said Marty Ryan, executive producer of its political
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an opportunity for us with the broadcast networks not
doing as much as they used to,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC was basically happy to be on the air four years ago. This
year's coverage, with the full resources of NBC News, will be more
focused and extensive, said Steve Capus, executive producer of the
network's political coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''NBC has to make the same kind of commitment they've always
made, the only question is what platform it will be on,'' he said.
''The cable and Internet platforms are naturally more appropriate
for extended coverage. On the broadcast network, you pick and
choose your spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the cable networks, the conventions should actually
see more airtime than any others. Critics say, however, that with
much of the time consigned to niche networks, casual viewers will
have less of an opportunity to learn about the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Burstein, executive producer of ABC's political coverage,
said his network makes its coverage decisions independently from
what's happening on cable. But, he said, ''you can never discount
the fact that all of the broadcast networks are aware that there
are many more outlets than there were in previous cycles.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tries Reshaping Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His term dwindling, an activist President
Clinton is frequently circumventing Congress and using his power to
dramatically reshape federal policy on the environment, the
workplace and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Republicans and business lobbies are battling
back, trying to kill some of Clinton's moves or delay them until
next year, when they could be stifled by what they hope will be a
GOP White House.
</P>
<P>
   By issuing a raft of orders, Clinton is achieving agenda items
he could not push through Congress. He is also energizing his
supporters and daring lawmakers to challenge him to an
election-season political fight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bet is that with the November elections looming, many
legislators will be reluctant to be seen as anti-environment or
anti-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect a continued high-level push on all kinds of
regulations right up to Clinton's last days in the White House,''
said Dan Danner, a senior vice president for the National
Federation of Independent Business, the small business lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents routinely use their legal and regulatory authority to
affect changes late in their terms. Presidents Bush and Reagan did
so relatively sparingly, but President Carter issued so many that
upon taking office, Reagan reversed or temporarily blocked dozens
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, analysts say Clinton's actions are striking for their
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, he has used a 1906 law to add 2 million acres
to the country's protected national monuments. And he reached an
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson that has led the nation's largest gun
manufacturer to begin using childproof locks and other safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal agencies are rushing to complete numerous
rules by year's end that would, among other things, limit truckers'
driving hours, restrict coastal pollution, require nutrition
labeling for meat, bar snowmobiles from most national parks, and
ban new logging roads in 43 million acres of national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Down-to-the-wire fights are continuing over rules the Clinton
administration proposed years ago to reduce workplace injuries and
improve air quality. Just Tuesday, the Environmental Protection
Agency issued rules requiring new state plans for cleaning up
waterways -- days after Congress sent Clinton still unsigned
legislation that would have blocked the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their objective is pretty clear -- to enact as much of their
agenda as they can, by any means possible,'' said Fred Nichols,
political director for the National Association of Manufacturers,
which opposes some of the Clinton initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This desperate attempt to get some kind of legacy would be
probably relatively easy to undo'' with the election of Republican
George W. Bush, said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a critic of many
of Clinton's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Bush is elected, he could risk blemishing his
self-declared ''compassionate conservative'' label by undoing
environmental or safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's plans have been challenged in court, such as
his clean air rules and roadless policy for forests. Lawmakers who
oppose Clinton's moves complain that he is improperly bypassing
Congress, but the White House is unbowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make no apologies for acting to protect the environment or
workers when Congress has failed to act,'' said White House
spokesman Jake Siewart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton administration allies are reveling in many of
the president's actions and hoping for more.
</P>
<P>
   In the environmental community, for example, rumors abound that
after the November elections, Clinton will declare all or part of
Alaska's 19-million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a national
monument. That could end longtime attempts by oil companies and
their supporters to begin drilling there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, there is a huge opportunity this year for historic
conservation victories on a whole range of issues,'' said Robert
Dewey, lobbyist for Defenders of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, lawmakers have tried to reverse several of
Clinton's plans with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, abandoned an effort to
block Clinton's plan to ban logging roads on 43 million of the 192
million acres of national forests. Last month, Westerners
decisively lost a House effort to curb Clinton's ability to protect
lands by designating them as national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   But the House voted to block tight air quality standards that
would fine communities that do not comply, and to delay proposed
restrictions on the use of federal lands in the Northwest's
Columbia River Basin. Both chambers have also voted to block
Clinton's planned rules for reducing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions lawmakers have approved, however, are on bills
that face veto threats, making their fates uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's opponents know that he can take actions
until noon next Jan. 20, when he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's after the election I'm concerned about, because this guy
loves to be a king,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont.

<HEADLINE> Officials hope to take advantage of convention spotlight for battleship towing </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - As a veteran of four military conflicts, the
USS New Jersey is no stranger to strategy. Now it looks like it'll
be used one last time in a large-scale maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   But this battle won't be for democracy or freedom. It will be
for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Southern New Jersey officials are hoping to take advantage of
the spotlight that will be focused on the region during the
Republican National Convention by having the vessel towed then from
Philadelphia to Camden, its final berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's most highly decorated warship will be converted there
into a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be media descending from around the country and
around the world during the convention,'' Jeff Sagnip, spokesman
for U.S. Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, said Wednesday. ''To have
it towed at a time when so many members of the media will be in
town would be ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 reporters are expected to cover the convention,
which will run from July 31 through Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, said in an interview
last week that the towing would likely occur during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton said the ship will be towed to Pier 4 at the Beckett
Street Terminal. Once it is converted to a museum, it will be
moored by the Sony E-Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Sagnip said there are still details to be worked out for the
ship to be towed during the convention, but officials are
optimistic that arrangements can be made. ''It's an ambitious time
frame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeing a battleship being towed is a once-in-a-lifetime
thing,'' he said. ''There are no more being built, and others are
slated for retirement. It's one of those moments in history that
won't be relived for most of us. It seems like a good time, if it's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One snag is that the ship's mast is 23 feet too tall to fit
under the Walt Whitman Bridge, Saxton said. The mast must be
dismantled and reassembled after it is berthed in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy and the Home Port Alliance, the group that will
run the museum, still need to sign a contract to turn the ship over
to the alliance. Saxton said Wednesday that the contract could be
signed by next week.
</P>
<P>
   The USS New Jersey arrived at the former Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard in November, after being towed from the Puget Sound in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig in January announced that the
battleship would spend its retirement off Camden. The ship was
built at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard early in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from southern and northern New Jersey had disagreed
over whether the USS New Jersey should be permanently berthed in
Camden or Bayonne. Both cities sought the tourist revenue that
would come from hosting a battleship museum.

   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood, in March asked the General
Accounting Office to review the Navy's decision to berth the ship
in Camden. Saxton on Wednesday said the GAO, in a briefing with his

moored in Camden.

<P>
   ''They said there are no showstoppers, which is what we wanted

Navy should proceed with this process.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a July 11 story, The Associated Press
reported erroneously that cruise ship companies oppose installing
smoke detectors in crew and passenger quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The companies favor the use of detectors that sound an alarm
only in a central monitoring location. The National Transportation
Safety Board wants the industry to install detectors that will set
off an alarm that can be heard in the immediate area where there is
smoke.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Wins After Drug Ban Lifted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUORO, Sardinia (AP) -- Nine days after being cleared of
accusations that she used steroids, Merlene Ottey returned to
competition Wednesday and won a 100-meter race in a regional meet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt good to get started again,'' the 40-year-old five-time
Olympian said. ''My goal now is to get to Sydney and reach 20 years
of Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, competing against regional runners, won in a slow time of
11.42 seconds in chilly weather on this Italian island.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican sprinter, a double silver medalist at the 1996
Games, likened the drug ban that had kept her from international
competition for 12 months to being ''sentenced to life in prison
for something you didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Track and field's world governing body reinstated Ottey last
Monday after concluding that a Swiss lab had improperly tested her
urine sample when she came up positive for the steroid nandrolone
at a meet in Switzerland in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, who lives in Slovenia, said her training has been
irregular over the past year as she fought to clear her name and
lift the two-year ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to concentrate when you're trying to find
evidence to prove your innocence,'' Ottey said. ''You don't know
whether to go at 60 percent, 50 percent or 20 percent, or if you're
just wasting your time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottey said the past week has been a whirlwind, since learning of
her reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of the best pieces of news of my life,'' Ottey
said. ''Now I have to step up my training and focus on the mental
element.''
</P>
<P>
   Her next competition will be the Jamaican national championship,
July 20-22 where she will run the 100 and 200 meters, seeking to
qualify for her sixth Olympics. Ottey has won 34 individual medals
in major international championships and is a former world
200-meter champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey was accused of using nandrolone, which is easily
detectable in standard drug tests. However, there have been a spate
of positive nandrolone cases the past year, prompting speculation
the drug is contained in nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Among the athletes embroiled in nandrolone cases is Linford
Christie, the 1992 100-meter Olympic and world champion from
Britain. He was suspended after testing positive for the steroid
and his hearing was postponed earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Former insurance agent pleads guilty in major fraud case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A former Metropolitan Life Insurance agent
has admitted to bilking dozens of elderly clients out of $5 million
by convincing them to make high-risk investments in a company he
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis McNerney, 53, of Williamsville could be sentenced to 2
1-3 to seven years in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to a
single count of scheming to defraud and two counts of third-degree
grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   A state Supreme Court hearing for co-defendant, Michael Ferguson
of Williamsville, was scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life last month paid $1.25 million in restitution
to 28 Buffalo-area residents who lost money by investing in World
Wide Capital Funding, McNerney's debt collection company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said McNerney and Ferguson solicited investments
from mostly elderly clients while working as Met Life agents.
</P>
<P>
   The pair allegedly pitched the investments as safe, but the
money went into a high-risk venture to collect on debts owed to
stores and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, state officials said, the scheme evolved into a
Ponzi scheme, where money from new investors was used to pay the
dividends owed to other investors.
</P>
<P>
   Met Life was unaware of the scheme but agreed to pay restitution
to those victimized while the two worked for the company.
</P>
<P>
   In all, prosecutors said, 45 people were victimized between 1993
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very significant plea,'' Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said Tuesday. ''We will be suggesting to the judge at
sentencing that he serve the maximum.'' McNerney is scheduled to be
sentenced Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   McNerney's attorney, John Jordan, said his client did not keep
any of the money for his own gain.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no proof he pocketed a nickel off this investment,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   What he did do, the lawyer said, was fail to explain the full
risk to the investors and then got involved in some bad business
deals. ''It's not a case where he intentionally took the money and
put it into his own bank account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Dennis Rosen said he would ask Judge Michael D'Amico
to order McNerney to make restitution to the residents who were not
reimbursed by Met Life.
</P>
<P>
   McNerney left Met Life in 1995. Ferguson, who allegedly received
commissions from McNerney for referring investors to him, was fired
in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's attorney, Paul Murak, did not return a telephone call
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> CDC teams to reassess local strategy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The reappearance of the West Nile
virus - found in 13 dead birds - is bringing state and federal
health experts to the metropolitan area this week to take another
look at local disease-fighting strategies and to try some new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately, we want to prevent human cases,'' said Tom
Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. ''The primary purpose of this field study is
to assess what control measures have been taken to date and to
determine if any different or additional measures are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven New Yorkers, along with hundreds of birds and several
horses, were killed by the virus last year in its first known
appearance in the Western Hemisphere. Extensive measures, ranging
from pesticide spraying by helicopter to dropping larvicides in
catch basins, have followed.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reported cases of West Nile virus in people
this year - or even in mosquitoes - and local officials still hope
to avoid more spraying. But birds killed by the virus have been
found in Westchester, Rockland and Suffolk counties in New York and
in Bergen County, N.J. The unlucky 13th, a red-tailed hawk found in
Westchester's Pound Ridge last month, was reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The CDC is interested in doing further research here because
it appears that West Nile is established again,'' said Kristine
Smith of the state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   She said two CDC teams of scientists - one starting in New
Jersey, one in New York City - will join with local health
departments for the project. The first team will eventually move
into New York's northern suburbs and the second group to Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammirato, spokesman for Bergen County Executive William
''Pat'' Schuber, said a CDC team would meet Friday in Paramus with
health leaders from Bergen, Morris, and Passaic counties to
exchange information and develop strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC is planning to trap some ordinary house sparrows, which
seem unaffected by the mosquito-borne virus, to see if their blood
has antibodies that might be useful in combatting the disease,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The sparrows could also be useful in the search for infected
mosquitoes, which transmit the virus to birds as well as people.
Given the dead birds, public health officials have been somewhat
perplexed by the absence of any virus in the tens of thousands of
mosquitoes tested so far at the Wadsworth Laboratory in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Birds, like humans, get the disease from mosquitoes. But because
crows and hawks can fly long distances, a bird could have been
infected far from where it dies.
</P>
<P>
   The omnipresent, non-migratory sparrows don't travel very far -
about five miles - and if their blood reveals any infection,
officials could narrow the search for infected mosquitos. Smith
said the birds will be snared in fine-meshed nets, tested, banded
and released.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Landrigan, spokeswoman for the Westchester County Health
Department, said there was no way to tell if the various
anti-mosquito measures, which include urging residents to get rid
of old tires and take good care of swimming pools, had reduced the
insect population.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the things we've been doing have been tried and have been
shown to be effective in the past, but there's no background to
check the numbers against,'' she said. ''We don't know how many
mosquitoes we've had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms. In the most
serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of
the brain. Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune
systems, are most at risk.

<HEADLINE> State relicenses hydroelectric power plants  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Five hydroelectric power plants along the
Upper Hudson and Sacandaga Rivers will be relicensed under an
agreement reached with the state, the Pataki administration
announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement called for restoring water levels in the rivers
and the Great Sacandaga Lake, all popular recreational sites in
eastern New York.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the amount and timing of water releases from the
five plants in Warren, Fulton and Saratoga counties will be set to
optimize ecological, recreational and power generating conditions,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Orion Power New York, which acquired the facilities from the
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. in 1999, has filed the settlement with
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which issues the
licenses. Jerry Sabattis, Orion's hydrolicensing coordinator, said
it would take at least two years for FERC to review the settlement
and conduct its own evaluations before 40-year licenses can be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The plants have been operating on year-by-year licenses since
their original longterm licenses expired in 1993 and will continue
to do so until FERC reaches a decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's one of the most significant agreements to
date,'' Sabattis said. ''This one was also the most complicated
because it had so many issues - lake levels, flow levels, flood
protection, hydrogeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, said the deal will ''provide
much-needed electricity ... and ensure that water levels in the
lake remain stable during recreational periods and help protect the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The five plants are: E.J. West (20 megawatts) and Stewarts
Bridge (30 megawatts) on the Sacandaga River and Spier Falls (47
megawatts), Sherman Island (29 megawatts) and Feeder Dam (5
megawatts) on the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said target lake levels and river flow levels will
dictate the water releases. That will preserve aquatic habitats and
prevent fluctuations in average water levels, they said.
</P>
<P>
   A mile-long section of the Hudson that was previously left dry
because water had been diverted to and stored at the Sherman Island
facility will now see year-round water flow. Sabattis said the
plant will now release a set amount of water into the river even
when generators are not at work. The Sacandaga plants will also
adhere to similar requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, spacing in trashracks, which keeps large floating
debris from going into the plants' turbines, will also be narrowed
to prevent fish from entering.
</P>
<P>
   Orion estimated that overall generating capacity will be reduced
by 2 percent as a result of the settlement. During peak times, that
capacity will be down by 5 percent, Sabattis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Sacandaga Lake serves as a reservoir to control
down-river flooding in the spring and increase river flow during
dry summer months. It is popular among campers and boaters, who had
complained that too much water released downstream results in water
levels which are too low for recreational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Upper Hudson, environmentalists wanted sufficent and
constant water flow to sustain fish populations and other acquatic
life and whitewater canoeists favored the release of water at a
time when they can take the most advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 100 meetings over five years for the state,
Orion and 40 other parties representing various interests to come
to an agreement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very balanced and reasonable compromise,'' said Neil
Woodworth, counsel for the Adirondack Mountain Club. ''The
ecological health of the river takes precedence over power
generation.''

<HEADLINE> West Bank Settlers Divided  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAALEH ADUMIM, West Bank (AP) -- In this bedroom suburb of
Jerusalem, a real estate agent's walls are lined with architects'
plans for new neighborhoods. Farther east, residents of rustic
Vered Yeriho despair of plummeting property values.
</P>
<P>
   Both are West Bank Jewish settlements, both theoretically on the
table at Camp David this week, where Israeli and Palestinian
leaders are working through the toughest issues under the watchful
tutelage of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has made it clear he favors keeping
settler concentrations close to the Israeli border -- leaving the
future of some 50,000 of the 200,000 settlers unclear.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a division has arisen in the settler
movement -- between those who know they are likely to keep their
homes, and those likely to move.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea of one settlement movement is over,'' said David
Zohar, a settler pioneer already planning his future after Vered
Yeriho, a hilltop palm-treed village overlooking
Palestinian-controlled Jericho, is handed back. ''We're split.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his top aides have told settlers it would be
impractical for Israel to demand isolated settlements bordering
populated Palestinian areas, such as Vered Yeriho, which translates
as ''Rose of Jericho.''
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, a Cabinet minister and a confidant to the prime
minister, listed settlements Barak will insist on annexing at his
Camp David meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The four
he named -- including Maaleh Adumim -- are heavily populated suburbs
of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are still demanding all the land and the
dismantling of the settlements -- but off the record, some concede
they will give up the bedroom communities, perhaps in exchange for
some Israeli land.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the painful dichotomy between the suburban Israeli
pursuing creature comforts and the Spartan pioneer has extended
into the settlement movement, dividing suburbanites from
ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Small settlements, 10, 20 families, were created as
provocations,'' said Shmuel Bar-Shalom, dining with his son and
grandchildren at the Burger King at the mall in Maaleh Adumim.
''They have no right to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all settlers in the isolated settlements are ready to
concede -- in Kiryat Arba, town leaders have set up a high-tech
business incubator in the shadows of the mosques of the neighboring
Palestinian city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing funding from the government and from overseas investors,
director Menahem Livni acknowledges that the aim is to reinforce
the Israeli presence in the area. ''We encourage the businesses to
stay here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One startup, Dr. Fluency, dominates the market for programs that
helps stammerers control their disability, and founder Aryeh
Friedman, working out of a tiny Kiryat Arba apartment, is
contemplating launching an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ran Zamir, backing an environmentally friendly scheme to
recycle rubber, is grateful to Kiryat Arba for enabling the startup
but says once the business is under way, it will operate from
within Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision is based on economics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has said which settlements will go, but Vered Yeriho fits
the ''out'' specifications to a T -- isolated, small and virtually a
neighborhood of a crowded Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
   Ettie Ahituv said she is searching for homes in Maaleh Adumim's
new projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look for homes, and I see apartments that are like cages,''
she said, watching her four children playing in Vered Yeriho's
swimming pool. ''I can't see it -- living with the highways and the
perverts and the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahituv and others moved here to buy the roomy, red-roofed homes
that are the Israeli ideal -- but out of range of their lower-middle
class incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, property values are plummeting. Billboards along the
Jerusalem-Jericho highway tout a new development in Vered Yeriho --
but only four families have paid deposits for the 41 lots for sale.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Maaleh Adumim is undergoing a real estate boom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are new projects all the time,'' says Kinneret Ofra,
interrupting a busy day at her real estate storefront in the
settlement's shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one's running away from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement leadership has pleaded with those who do not
necessarily support its absolute opposition to any concessions to
at least remain silent -- to little avail.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, another settlement invites one of Barak's ministers
for a tete-a-tete, to determine where it stands. In a statement
last week, the Settler Council decried such meetings as ''dialogues
of the deaf.''

<HEADLINE> Stars Sign Van Allen and Tabarracci  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars signed center Shaun Van Allen and
goalie Rick Tabaracci to two-year contracts Wednesday and agreed to
one-year deals with defenseman Sami Helenius and goalie Mike Bales.
</P>
<P>
   Van Allen, 32, who played for the Ottawa Senators the past four
seasons, will fill the void after the retirement of Guy Carbonneau.
His contract reportedly is worth $550,000 a season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Van Allen had nine goals and 19 assists in 75
games.
</P>
<P>
   Tabaracci, 31, played for Atlanta and Colorado last season. He
has a career record of 93-125-30 with a 2.99 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Bales, 28, spent the last two seasons with Dallas' top farm
club. He is 2-15-1 with a 4.12 GAA in 23 career games with Boston
and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Helenius, 26, split last season between the Colorado Avalanche
and the American Hockey League's Hershey Bears. The 6-foot-5,
225-pound native of Finland did not have a point in 33 games with
Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Coach Accused of Punching Umpire  </HEADLINE>
By AMANDA RIDDLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- A youth baseball coach turned himself in
Wednesday to face charges he broke an umpire's jaw. The arrest
comes a week after a coach was fatally beaten by a father during a
youth hockey game in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, parents and sports administrators say the cases
highlight a nationwide increase in youth sports violence,
particularly against game officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a definite trend toward more violence and more
pressure on the game officials,'' said Ron Allen, an assistant
commissioner with the Florida High School Activities Association.
''I'm talking about players, I'm talking about parents and
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Lago, 36, an assistant baseball coach with the Hollywood
Police Athletic League, was charged with aggravated battery. Police
say he broke umpire Tom Dziedzinski's jaw during a game against
Flanagan Connie Mack PAL. Both teams are comprised of top high
school players.
</P>
<P>
   The June 19 fight stemmed from a disputed call by Dziedzinski.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Burk, Lago's attorney, said his client didn't provoke the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels terrible that the incident took place,'' Burk said of
Lago, who was released on $5,000 bond without entering a plea.
</P>
<P>
   In the Reading, Mass., case, a father of four died Friday two
days after a brawl with another father.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Costin, 40, was beaten unconscious in front of young
hockey players he was coaching. Thomas Junta, 42, pleaded innocent
to manslaughter in Costin's death. Junta's lawyer said his client
was acting in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   That fight apparently started after a dispute over rough play on
the ice during a game that was supposed to be non-contact.
</P>
<P>
   In the case here, a player for Lago's team was called out by
Dziedzinski attempting to steal third.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Lago argued with Dziedzinski near the
pitcher's mound, saw Dziedzinski draw his hand back to signal that
he was ejecting him and thought the umpire was going to punch him.
That's when he swung.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't see this coming or expect it,'' Dziedzinski said
Wednesday, his jaw still wired shut. Dziedzinski said the assault
was his first while umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   Dziedzinski declined to comment further, referring all questions
to his attorney, Kevin Kuliz.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Sports Officials in Racine, Wis.,
receives two or three calls a week from officials assaulted by an
angry parent or spectator, spokesman Bob Still said.
</P>
<P>
   The cases range from name-calling and pushing and shoving to
officials' vehicles being run off the road by irate parents. He
said even the verbal abuse has gotten more vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always had 'four-eyes,''' he said. ''The tenor of the
type of abuse we're receiving nowadays has become much more
personal, much more physical, and highly violent.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the agencies that monitor sports violence could provide
comparisons with past years.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are being made to stop the violence before it starts.
</P>
<P>
   The association this year published ''When They're In Your Face
And How To Deal With It,'' a brochure to help officials handle
out-of-control parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Tequesta Athletic Association, located 15 miles north of
West Palm Beach, requires parents to take a sportsmanship class and
sign an ethics code before their kids can play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states, including Massachusetts, have laws that allow
for stiffer penalties if an official is assaulted, Still said.
Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes signed a similar bill into law July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Florida state Rep. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood, plans to sponsor
similar legislation next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''At local ball fields, parents are getting out of control.
Winning is everything,'' Sobel said. ''The psychological impact on
the kids is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the key is making the public aware of the danger
umpires and referees face on the field and after they leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''Awareness is crucial, letting people know that we have a major
problem in sports and our sports are in jeopardy because of the
violence,'' Allen said.

<HEADLINE> Tall ship festival sails into Connecticut  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - A postcard-perfect row of tall ships
with billowing sails blew into this historic city Wednesday, as a
21st century crowd cheered the balletic grace of ships from days
gone by.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one ships from the United States, South America and Europe
are participating in OpSail 2000. They paraded up the Thames River
past applauding crowds. Bobbing pleasure boats filled with
spectators looked tiny compared to the massive sailing vessels,
some more than 350 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   At the four piers where the ships docked, thousands more
spectators craned their necks to see crewmen in the rigging, 150
feet above the deck.
</P>
<P>
   As each ship docked, crowds applauded and waved to the crews,
lined up on the decks with their hands clasped behind their backs.
Some crew members couldn't help but wave back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a lovely trip,'' said Lt. Manuel Ibanez of the
Chilean barquentine Esmeralda. ''Everyone gives us such a happy
welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The boats are open for tours at scheduled times and days
throughout the festival, which ends Saturday with a giant fireworks
display.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was estimated at at least 100,000, with hundreds of
thousands more expected for the four-day spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   People lined the sand at Ocean Beach Park and other beaches
along the parade route to see the ''Parade of Sail.'' Leading the
parade was a homegrown favorite: the U.S. Coast Guard barque Eagle,
the training ship for the Coast Guard Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such an awesome, gorgeous sight to see,'' said Karen
Fienman of South Windsor as she and her 9-year-old son Josh gazed
at the tall ships through binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered again for the next boat in line, the Amistad,
a replica of a ship that was the scene of an 1839 slave rebellion
that eventually led to freedom for captive Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad means a lot to American blacks, who see the ship's
story as a turning point in the history of Africans brought to this
country as slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Conyers of Windsor brought her two daughters and a niece
to the event, especially to see the Amistad and to see what
conditions were like for the Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I think about is the history of it,'' Conyers said.
''This is really an opportunity for people to see what it was
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Nucci of Old Saybrook, who watched the ships sail by,
said it gave her a good feeling to see such a turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tells of the spirit of America - that we're still
involved,'' she said. ''It gives you a good feeling that people
still come to an event like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was heavy, but sail fans gladly traded the aggravation
for the once-in-a-lifetime sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hundred times worth it. This is a piece of history,''
said Lenny Tubbs of Bristol as he strained to see the ships through
his camera's viewfinder.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 cars were parked at satellite lots so spectators
could use the park-and-ride system, which had almost 200 buses to
bring people in and around the site.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, as people rushed to see the 10 a.m. start of
the parade, the bus system got bogged down, leading to long lines
and hourlong delays.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Manning, the transportation planner for the
festival,said bus service was in high demand much earlier in the
day than expected, and that the flow took a time to recover. Twice
as many buses will be rolling for the Saturday fireworks finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been successful in terms of what we wanted to do
- keep the bulk of the traffic out of New London,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other 21st century realities about the event
including year 2000 prices - $3 for a lemonade and $5 for a plate
of fish and chips.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or damage to ships were reported.
</P>
<P>
   New London is the smallest of the cities to host OpSail, which
also has visited San Juan, Puerto Rico; Miami; Norfolk, Va.;
Baltimore; Philadelphia; and New York. The ships will leave
Connecticut for Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy established Operation Sail in 1961 to
promote international relations and cultural affairs. In the past,
OpSail marked the 1964 World Fair, the 1976 U.S. Bicentennial, and
the centennial of the Statue of Liberty in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing selling Frontier's local phone operation for $3.65 billion </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Global Crossing Ltd., which bought
Frontier Corp. last year, is selling the New York-based telephone
company's local calling business to Citizens Communications of
Stamford, Conn., for $3.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Wednesday would create the nation's 10th
largest local-exchange carrier business with more than 3 million
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Frontier business would account for about 1 million of those
lines, with about half of them located in its primary market of
Rochester, N.Y. Frontier also provides local service in 33 other
markets in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, a 3-year-old industry upstart based in Bermuda,
paid $8.1 billion worth of stock last September to acquire
Frontier, which was founded in 1899 as Rochester Telephone.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier stock offer of $10.9 billion had to be renegotiated
when investor worries about telephone rate wars put downward
pressure on industry stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's nationwide long-distance network provided a U.S.
foothold for Global Crossing, which is building a worldwide
fiber-optic network to carry voice, data, video and Internet
traffic. But with losses ballooning as it invests heavily in that
network, Global Crossing has been evaluating potential asset sales
since May.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Communications, which owns about 300,000 access lines
in New York state, is an emerging player on the local phone market.
It has snapped up millions of local lines from companies such as
GTE Corp. to build a national network.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is their most significant deal ever, and their largest
market is going to be Rochester with over 560,000 access lines
alone,'' said Frontier spokesman Tor Constantino.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have signed a definite agreement and the buyout is
expected to be completed within nine months, Constantino said.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier employs about 3,100 people in Rochester, including
2,100 at its local telephone business here.
</P>
<P>
   ''Citizens Communications is the right buyer for these assets,''
said Leo Hindrey, Global Crossing chief executive. ''It serves the
best interests of our customers and our communities to combine the
strong results of our Frontier employees with the team at
Citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rises 143, Dow Ends Up 57  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices surged Wednesday after
better-than-expected quarterly earnings by Internet giant Yahoo!
sent investors scrambling for technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The re-emergence of the technology sector helped push the
tech-focused Nasdaq Stock Market back into positive territory for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.57 at 10,783.76,
after being up nearly 100 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index closed up 143.17 at 4,099.59 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 12.04 at 1,492.92.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to have shed long-held concerns over interest
rate hikes, analysts said, and instead embraced an optimistic view
toward second-quarter earnings reports, which are starting to
trickle in.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are those who feel the Federal Reserve Board may have
done its job -- for now,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president
at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   With the season for second-quarter earnings reports just getting
under way, a strong showing from Yahoo! helped boost the technology
sector, which had been battered in recent weeks on fears that
second-quarter earnings may be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just goes to show that the market has bounced back from
its lows and appears ready to start retracing the upward trend we
saw earlier this year,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!'s shares rose $19.438 to $124.938. CMGI was also higher,
rising $6.938 at $43.438, as was eBay, which gained $8.687 to
$52.625.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly solid quarter from Yahoo! followed
better-than-expected reports from International Paper and Alcoa
earlier this week, which helped give a lift to blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While individual earnings reports have boosted stocks in recent
days, some analysts believe the market still lacks direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday, a strong day for value-biased stocks because of
International Paper's earnings. Today, we have Yahoo! pulling up
the tech stocks,'' said Brian Belski, vice president at U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ''But the question is: What will tomorrow
bring? There is still a lot of indecision in the market and the
performance has been very varied.''
</P>
<P>
   The market continued to benefit from comments made Tuesday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Speaking before the
National Association of Governors, Greenspan talked up the
country's improved productivity, which analysts took as a sign that
inflation may be in check.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there have been signs that the pace of the
economy is slowing down, and without any inflationary pressures,
investors hope that the Fed may be done raising interest rates
after six rate hikes in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors, however, were still watching their moves ahead
of another speech from Greenspan on Wednesday night at a conference
organized by the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of New York investment bank PaineWebber rose $16.937 to
$66.875 after it announced that it was being purchased by Swiss
banking group UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The merger set off a rally in banking and financial services
stocks. Lehman Brothers rose $5.187 to $111.625 and Merrill Lynch
gained $2.563 to $131.536.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 3-to-2 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 994.65 million
shares, up from 976.14 million shares on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 10.51 at 540.25.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell .93 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 0.89 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.66 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.71 percent.

<HEADLINE> Utah Not Done Paying for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two days after declaring the Olympics
won't cost taxpayers as much as expected, state Olympic officer
Lane Beattie said he will ask the Utah Legislature for more public
money.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie told a legislative committee Wednesday that public
safety and other government costs for the 2002 Winter Games will
fall well below a previous estimate of $31 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Senate leader said Utah will have to pay a bigger
share than it has already pledged. The Legislature has committed
$13 million to help cover policing, snow plowing, garbage pickup
and other government services during the games.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie wasn't ready to offer a new estimate but will disclose
the figure in a financial report on the Olympics later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie will tuck a supplemental request in the next state
budget that Gov. Mike Leavitt will prepare this fall for the
2001-2002 fiscal year covering the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie's appearance before the legislative Revenue and Taxation
Committee was his first official duty as the newly appointed state
Olympic officer.
</P>
<P>
   He was required to report on a public-safety plan under
legislation signed by Leavitt in March that waives the sales tax on
Olympic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie stepped down a month ago as president of the Utah Senate
to monitor Olympic finances for the governor and Legislature. He
was a senator since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Beattie announced that state agencies won't need all
$31 million originally estimated to cover public safety and related
expenses for the Winter Games. State money would cover only a
portion of that.
</P>
<P>
   He provided the reality check on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''So you're not coming back to us for more money?'' asked Rep.
Ray Short, R-Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am coming back to you for more money,'' Beattie replied,
saying the $13 million won't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The government services are not included in the $1.32 billion
Olympic budget covered by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Former Olympic officer John Fowler estimated last year that the
Legislature would need to find $31 million for everything from
paying police overtime to building new roads.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC later came up with a plan to raise $15 million for
government services. The plan involved exempting Olympic tickets
from sales tax, freeing $13 million that SLOC President Mitt Romney
offered to shift into a public safety fund.
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed to contribute another $2 million to the fund and
ask the federal government for more.
</P>
<P>
   That assures Utah of $15 million but leaves millions more
unaccounted for and Congress has yet to contribute to this effort.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers, meanwhile, plan to announce Thursday how
they will sell 730,000 tickets to the Winter Games. The plan
involves a ticket lottery running from Oct. 10 to Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic sponsors, VIPs and national Olympic officials are
expected to snap up their full allotment of 900,000 tickets.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Seeks Mobilization vs. AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- The AIDS scourge is the greatest
health crisis facing the world's children today, the chief of
UNICEF said Wednesday as she called for ''the largest mobilization
of resources in history'' to combat the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund,
told a news conference at the 13th International AIDS Conference in
Durban: ''Our only hope of stopping HIV/AIDS hinges on the
willingness of nations to fight back with everything they have.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What is required here is the largest mobilization of resources
in history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF's annual Progress of Nations report, released Wednesday,
said the virus, which infects more than 10 million young people
worldwide, was badly hurting even those who are not infected.

<HEADLINE> Thomson sells Connecticut Post to MediaNews Group  </HEADLINE>
syhoflsrh
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The Thomson Corp. on Wednesday
announced a deal to sell the Connecticut Post and five local,
nondaily newspapers to MediaNews Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group, parent company of The Denver Post and 46 other
daily and 83 non-daily newspapers in 12 states, said Wednesday its
deal to purchase the Connecticut Strategic Marketing Group from
Thomson Newspapers should close Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thomson Newspapers has taken great pride in publishing the
Connecticut Post as its U.S. flagship newspaper, and we look
forward to carrying on their tradition for quality as we enter this
impressive marketplace,'' said William Dean Singleton, president
and chief executive officer of MediaNews Group.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said no management or staff changes are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our staff members are deeply committed to community
journalism and to meeting the needs of our local advertisers,''
said Robert H. Laska, president and chief executive officer of
Thomson's Southern Connecticut Strategic Marketing Group. ''That's
what made us a successful business for Thomson and that's what made
us an attractive acquisition for MediaNews Group.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Post, an 80,000-circulation daily, Thomson's
Brooks Community Newspapers has newspapers in Westport, Fairfield,
Norwalk and Darien and several niche publications. The nondaily
newspapers have a combined paid circulation of 36,526.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Thomson's operational headquarters based in Connecticut,
this newspaper group is close to our hearts,'' Thomson President
and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Harrington said. ''I am very
pleased that they will be going to another fine newspaper
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto-based Thomson, which has its main U.S. office in
Stamford, announced in February that it would sell all of its
newspapers in the United States and Canada except The Globe and
Mail, published in Toronto and distributed throughout Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it wanted to concentrate on Internet businesses
led by its legal and financial information services.
</P>
<P>
   During the last several weeks, Thomson announced the sale of 21
papers to Gannett Co. Inc.; 17 to Community Newspaper Holdings
Inc.; five to Media General Inc.; three to Freedom Communications
Inc.; and one each to The Copley Press Inc. and Cooke
Communications LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson also agreed to buy Primark, a leading financial
information provider, and completed purchases of Prometric, Wave
Technologies and Dialog's online business.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the newspaper sale has netted Thomson $2.44 billion,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based MediaNews Group said it will finance the purchase
with proceeds of last week's sale of four New Jersey-area daily
newspapers and 40 non-daily newspapers to Advance Publications.

<HEADLINE> View to a fill: Beachfront property owners squawk about replenishment </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTNOR, N.J. (AP) - From his dining room, Marc Miller can look
out a picture window and see ocean, beach and boardwalk. At night,
he goes to sleep listening to the waves lapping against the shore.
</P>
<P>
   For 25 years, his two-story brick house on South Pittsburgh
Avenue has been his summer paradise. Now, he says, it is being
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to erect dunes on the beach as part of a $60 million
beach replenishment would block ocean views for Miller and dozens
of other property owners.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials say the work would
provide protection for homes and businesses and ensure the economic
vitality of Absecon Island communities that rely on beaches to
bring tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a 71-year-old retired life insurance salesman, doesn't
see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''You take away the seashore view from the street, from the
boardwalk, from the houses, you destroy the seashore feeling,'' he
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always had a dream of living by the seashore. I worked
Saturdays, Sundays, nights to make a success of my business. Now,
I'm here, but it won't be the same. If I can't see or hear the
waves, it's not going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing the 8.1-mile fill
project for the beaches of Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and
Longport. If approved, construction would begin in the fall and
continue through late 2001, with a dredge sucking sand off the
floor of Absecon Inlet and pumping it onto the island's eroded
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The work would triple the width of some beaches.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, the Corps wants to build dunes to
protect homes like Miller's from storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dunes would be up to 4 feet above the Boardwalk in Atlantic
City and 1 foot above it in Ventnor. In Margate and Longport, which
don't have boardwalks, the dunes would rise up about 2&AMP;frac12; feet above
the bulkheads, according to Rich Chlan, a spokesman for the Corps
of Engineers in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and two other beachfront property owners have formed a
citizens group called DUNE (short for Don't Upset the Natural
Environment) to fight the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the dunes are like an urban blight,'' said Marvin
Levin, 73, a co-founder of the group. ''They'll ruin the look of
the beach, take away the sounds, sights and breezes of the beach.
We've lived here 25 years. Yes, we've seen beach erosion. We're 100
percent in favor of beach replenishment. But do it without the
dunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are in the minority, according to city Business
Administrator William Thomas, who estimates that 99 percent of
Ventnor's residents favor the beach fill plan even in spite of the
$1 million it would cost the city government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our whole economy is based on the beach,'' Thomas said. ''If
we lose the beach, it won't matter. There won't be a view to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Beachgoers interviewed Wednesday said protection is more
important than aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather lose a little bit of view than lose miles of
beach,'' said Tricia Green, 36, of Ventnor, who was sunning
herself. ''This beach has gotten smaller and smaller over the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I lived right here, I'd be upset, too,'' said Judie
Kriegler, 32, of Ventnor. ''But if it's got to be done to preserve
the beach, it's got to be done. It's more important than the
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Farrell, a marine science professor at the Richard
Stockton College of New Jersey, dismisses the complaints by
beachfront property owners as shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't care. They've got enough money. They've got federal
flood insurance and they think (storm damage) won't happen anyway.
The view and the scene in front of them is more important than even
losing the house. If we have a 50-year storm event, that view
they're looking at, they'll be eating it,'' said Farrell, director
of the college's Coastal Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   State officials must endorse the project before the Corps will
begin work, and they will do so only if the affected communities
approve of it. Ventnor officials have yet to formally take a
position on the plan, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Public hearings will be held in Longport on July 21, Ventnor on
July 22 and Margate on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose home has never sustained serious storm damage,
says the beach replenishment is unnecessary. He says taking away
views of the beach will drive property values town and hurt
everyone who lives in Ventnor.
</P>
<P>
   The Press of Atlantic City, in an editorial last week, called
the DUNE group selfish.
</P>
<P>
   ''The dune critics say they will take their chances with the
rising sea. But they have no right to make others take that
chance,'' the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Robot Performs 1st Surgery in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A woman had her gall bladder removed by a
robot Wednesday in the first operation in the United States to be
performed by the newly approved da Vinci Surgical System.
</P>
<P>
   The da Vinci, approved for use at five U.S. hospitals on Tuesday
by the Food and Drug Administration, enables surgeons to operate by
manipulating joysticks at a computer terminal. Lenses inserted in
the patient's body give the surgeon a 3-D view of the person's
insides.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William E. Kelley Jr. performed the gall bladder surgery
Wednesday on 35-year-old Kimberly Briggs at Henrico Doctors
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very pleased. I think it went very smoothly,'' said
Kelley, who had been trained on the da Vinci but had used it to
operate only on pigs and cadavers before.
</P>
<P>
   Also pleased was Briggs, who was wheeled into a news conference
less than four hours after her surgery was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' she said, adding that the less invasive
procedure would allow her to be home in time for her son Mario's
sixth birthday party on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With wrist-like devices at the end of the robotic arms giving
surgeons a full range of precise movement, the da Vinci is a
significant advance on laparoscopic surgery, a decade-old
breakthrough that already had made much surgery less invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Katz, a cardiac surgeon, said using a computer screen
to view the area magnified by 10 times and having a robot do the
work with precision are ''incredibly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives you the ability to get your instruments where they
need to be,'' said Katz, who is trained to use da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said, da Vinci could make operations involving
large incisions virtually obsolete, allowing patients instead to
cover their incisions with ''a few Band-Aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery using the da Vinci has been approved only for abdominal
operations in the United States, but the $1 million robot is being
more widely used in Europe, Kelley said. FDA approval for da Vinci
on cardiac surgery could come this year, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   Five hospitals are trained to use the Da Vinci now: Henrico
Doctors Hospital in Richmond, Va., Baylor Medical Center in
Houston; Ohio State University in Columbus; East Carolina
University in Greenville, N.C.; and the San Ramon Medical Center in
California.
</P>
<P>
   A few other hospitals are conducting clinical trials of
robot-assisted heart surgery.

<HEADLINE> Water deal may prove costly for Camden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A $20 million loan from a Chicago-based
water company may end up costing Camden $45 million, due to
unusually high interest rates and $1.8 million in previously
undisclosed ''transition fees,'' according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday that the $1.8
million, detailed in a document called an ''amortization
schedule,'' is the latest surprise yielded by a $215 million deal
with U.S. Water to operate the city's water system.
</P>
<P>
   The city has not received the $20 million loan, which was to be
used to upgrade its dilapidated water and sewer infrastructure. The
city sued U.S. Water and its subsidiary, Camden Water LLC, last
year demanding the payment. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The state on Wednesday approved a $23.5 million loan to the city
from the state Environmental Trust, said Ulrich ''Al'' Steinberg,
director of the state Division of Local Government Services.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said, though, that the city cannot take both the loan
from the state and the one from U.S. Water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camden can take one loan or the other. If the loan with U.S.
Water is entered into because of litigation, the money would be
used to pay off the Environmental Trust loan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the loan from the state would have an effective
interest rate of less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Water loan would have to be repaid over 20 years at
interest rates of 7.1 percent on the first $17 million and 15
percent on the remainder, The Inquirer reported. The city also
would have to pay the same rate on the $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney John A. Misci said the amortization schedule is
not a payment schedule, but calculation of what the city would pay
U.S. Water if either side is found in breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   He also said city and state officials received financial details
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But city and state officials told the Inquirer that when they
approved the deal they were not aware of the extra $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that the $1.8 million was to cover
''transition fees.'' They include $1.2 million that U.S. Water
incurred when, as part of the contract, it hired city employees
after the water system was privatized, and about $600,000 that the
city paid for lawyers and financial advisers to help negotiate the
$215 million deal, the largest contract in city history.
</P>
<P>
   When they were defending the contract, which was approved in
September 1998 despite an outcry from hundreds of residents,
members of Mayor Milton Milan's administration said U.S. Water
would pay for transferring the employees and for the city's
consultants' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Camden Water LLC took over operations of Camden's water and
sewer systems in January 1999. The $20 million was to be paid when
the company began running the systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer reported last week that Milan, without the
knowledge of state or city officials, signed an alteration to the
contract with the company in December 1998, giving the company more
time to pay the $20 million.

<HEADLINE> Long-Distance Charges Confuse Many  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer complaints to state regulators about
long-distance phone bills for the top two carriers nearly tripled
over the past two years, according to data released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The information, collected by the National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners, shows that customers of AT&AMP;T and
WorldCom filed more than 37,000 complaints with 28 state regulators
in 1999. That compares with about 14,000 complaints in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Together, AT&AMP;T and WorldCom's MCI brand control about 80 percent
of the total long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said that many of these complaints dealt with
consumer confusion over charges on bills and advertising. In some
cases, consumers said they thought they were signing up for a plan
at a certain rate, but were surprised by some of the charges that
appeared on their bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't understand the advertising or read the fine
print,'' said Bill Gillis, chair of NARUC's Committee on Consumer
Affairs and a regulator in Washington state. While the
long-distance market might be the most competitive segment of the
telecommunications industry, ''consumer complaints have increased
at an alarming rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a separate study being released Thursday by AARP,
the nation's largest organization of older adults, not all
consumers may be aware of the best long-distance calling options
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of all respondents in a survey of 1,908
long-distance callers had shopped around for the best long-distance
price before signing onto a plan. Only 61 percent were aware that a
company's ''basic rates'' are not always their ''cheapest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Americans are uninformed or misinformed about
long-distance calling costs and could save as much as several
hundreds dollars by choosing a better calling plan,'' said
Christopher Baker, senior policy adviser with AARP.
</P>
<P>
   The NARUC data reveals that in all but a handful of states,
consumer complaints to regulators about the two companies increased
during the span. Complaints about the nation's largest
long-distance carrier, AT&AMP;T, increased from 8,125 in 1997 to 19,534
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen said the raw numbers have to be
placed in context, given that the company has 60 million
residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   A plan recently adopted by federal regulators and endorsed by
AT&AMP;T will consolidate some of the myriad of line-item charges on
phone bills, helping to reduce customer confusion, Cohen said. The
company also eliminated its monthly minimum charge for basic rate
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already taken steps to make phone bills simpler,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer complaints to regulators about WorldCom increased from
5,629 in 1997 to 18,316 in 1999. But the figures from the first
half of 2000 -- about 7,200 complaints -- point to a possible decline
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials credit a new customer service initiative
implemented in December 1999. That plan established a mandatory
code of conduct for all phone sales representatives, with a
disciplinary system for violations. WorldCom also upgraded its
third-party verification system and boosted by 10 percent its
service staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that quality, courteous service is as important
as low rates if a carrier is going to be successful,'' said
WorldCom spokeswoman Claire Hassett.
</P>
<P>
   NARUC said it is working with the two companies on ways to
address consumer concerns, including developing a template so phone
bills are clearer and more understandable.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP report also recommends such policy measures as uniform
disclosure of monthly charges to help consumers comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   International Communications Research of Media, Pa., conducted
the telephone survey of long-distance callers above age 18. The
margin of error is plus or minus two percentage points.

<HEADLINE> First lady joins Vallone to complain about Con Ed  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton joined City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone on Wednesday in blaming the metro area's
largest utility for a possible price hike and the rising threat of
power outages.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York's consumers face the potential of skyrocketing
electric bills, environmentally damaging old power plants and power
outages,'' Vallone said at a City Hall news conference where both
he and the first lady pinned the problems on Consolidated Edison
and the state Public Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about ''Con Ed's outrageous price hikes,'' Clinton
noted that New York's utility rates are the nation's second highest
after Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   She added that responsibility lies with the PSC, which ''entered
into a deal with Con Ed that set no limits, that basically was a
total market-driven arrangement. Other utility companies in the
state were willing to accept fixed rates so that they wouldn't try
to pass on to consumers all the costs they claimed to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   To ease the problem, Vallone proposed tax breaks for businesses
that become more energy efficient and programs to shift energy
usage away from peak hours. He also suggested offering rebates to
consumers who buy new refrigerators and air conditioners that use
less power.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vallone said the PSC should institute an energy
price cap of $500 per megawatt, compared to the $1,300 cost now
prevalent in New York. Other states, like California, already have
price controls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Criticizing Con Edison for higher electric bills demonstrates
a fundamental misunderstanding of today's energy industry,'' Con Ed
officials said in response. ''The market, not Con Edison, sets the
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation has forced Con Ed to sell its power generating
plants to other companies, but the utility still distributes power
and maintains the system. Local electric steam and gas plants are
now owned by KeySpan Energy, Orion and NRG.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing Tuesday, PSC chairwoman Maureen Helmer said Con Ed
made a $200 million profit from selling its Queens power plants,
money others suggested might be used to curb electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the PSC warned that electric rates could rise 30 percent
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   PSC spokesman Dave Flanagan said Wednesday that the state's
failed energy policies of the '80s and early '90s are responsible
for many of today's problems in the power industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, this administration and commission have done more
to reduce energy rates in the past five years than any in recent
memory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed officials have said that unless new power plants are
built, aging infrastructure and increased demand could result in
power shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Washington Heights suffered a lengthy blackout and
on June 26 of this year, Upper East Side customers suffered a
brownout.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that if elected to the Senate, she would push to
have the federal Department of Energy require utilities to provide
rate information in a way that enables consumers to comparison
shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have the information they need to get the best
possible deal,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Secret Groups Must File With IRS  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Political groups that organize under a
once-obscure part of the tax code have until the end of July to
file paperwork with the government, the Internal Revenue Service
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, which is implementing the new disclosure rules,
released copies of the first of several forms these political
groups will have to submit for public inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, signed into law on July 1, require tax-exempt
groups that organize under section 527 of the tax code to disclose
their officers, address and other identifying information, along
with donor names, size of donations and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting these new rules in place poses a major challenge for
the IRS given the short time frame available,'' IRS Commissioner
Charles Rossotti said. ''However, we are committed to serving
taxpayers by implementing this important new law in a timely and
convenient manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizing under section 527 has proven to be an attractive
option for political organizations across the political spectrum.
Like groups that register under section 501(c), these groups are
nonprofit and tax exempt. Until now, they have not been required to
disclose even the most basic information -- address or phone number,
for instance -- about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While 501(c) groups face limits on their political activity,
527s are inherently political and face no such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Section 527 was written with political parties and political
action committees in mind -- groups that file detailed disclosures
with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Many 527s insist that while they are political for tax purposes,
as far as the FEC is concerned, they are engaged in a discussion of
the issues.
</P>
<P>
   These groups -- some of which have bragged about not having to
disclose names of donors -- now must decide whether to reveal
details about themselves and their donors or reorganize under
another section of the tax law.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and Peace Action, two liberal groups that have
527 components, said Wednesday they would remain 527s and file the
required disclosures. The same is true for the Coalition to Protect
Americans Now, a group pushing a national missile defense, and the
conservative Club for Growth.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 15, the IRS said, it will make available on its Internet
site a list of the 527 organizations.

<HEADLINE> Orangemen March Across N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- To the beat of pounding drums,
Protestant hard-liners marched by the tens of thousands across
Northern Ireland on Wednesday, vowing to protest until they regain
the right to parade past Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80,000 members of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's
once-dominant Protestant fraternal group, paraded through Belfast
and 17 other towns to commemorate the triumph of the Protestant
King William of Orange over a Catholic foe on July 12, 1690.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Twelfth demonstrations always bring rivalries between
British Protestants and Irish Catholics to the boil. But with
several parades blocked this year from going through or near
Catholic areas by British security forces, Protestant anger turned
against Protestant lawmakers over whom to blame for the past 10
days of widespread rioting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We meet here today under extremely difficult circumstances.
Our city and our country are being ravaged by terrorism and
lawlessness,'' Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councilman, told fellow
Orangemen in a city park.
</P>
<P>
   Several militants in the audience heckled Rodgers when he
appealed for the riots to end immediately because they were
self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those that are suffering are people in our own areas. We are
destroying our properties, we are hitting our churches, we're
taking people's cars and burning them,'' Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   He had to shout above the insults flying from a few who accused
his Ulster Unionist Party of caving in to Irish Republican Army
supporters to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   IRA supporters are prominent in all the anti-Orange protest
groups, and the Ulster Unionists and IRA-linked Sinn Fein party are
uncomfortable partners in Northern Ireland's power-sharing
government.
</P>
<P>
   Many Orangemen oppose negotiations with the protesters on the
same grounds that they reject sharing power with Sinn Fein: The
belief that their enemy will never be satisfied no matter how many
compromises are made, so no compromises should be made.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that the turmoil might finally be subsiding,
police reported all of the most volatile Protestant areas quiet as
the Orangemen's marches ceased and darkness approached.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 police and soldiers have been wounded during the
rioting. The worst clash came overnight Tuesday in Portadown, where
a mob burned an effigy of a policeman on a bonfire -- then threw
gasoline bombs, firecrackers and at least one homemade grenade at
joint police-army forces protecting the town's surrounded Catholic
district.
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen insisted their demonstrations should be treated as
inoffensive, colorful pageants. The lodges march with hand-painted
banners portraying important events in Protestant history and
mythology: King William on his white horse; the Harland and Wolff
shipyard and its most famous product, the Titanic; Protestants
dying on World War I battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   But across the Lagan River from the Orange demonstration, the
Catholics of the Lower Ormeau neighborhood were savoring a respite
from this pageantry, thanks to a British army blockade that
prevented a small Orange parade from passing their area that
morning.
</P>
<P>
   They said the sound of the Orangemen's rowdy bands of fife and
drum sent shivers down their spine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thankfully we can't see them. But just listening to these
god-awful bands in the distance reminds people here of the pure
hate involved. We just don't want any part of it,'' said John
Gormley, who has helped organize anti-parade protests since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Several Orange speakers noted bitterly Wednesday that the
British government and Royal Ulster Constabulary -- the province's
predominantly Protestant police -- had decided this year to confront
Orangemen rather than Catholic protesters. In 1996 and 1997, the
protesters were violently forced off disputed streets to make way
for Orangemen. Intense Catholic riots followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Orange Order will not be surrendering its culture, its
history and its tradition to the demands of Sinn Fein-IRA or any of
its residents groups,'' said Denis Watson, the senior Orangeman in
County Armagh, where the order was born in 1795 following a
sectarian gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   The order's anti-Catholicism was underscored at several rallies,
which adopted motions calling for Anglican, Methodist and
Presbyterian churches to end all ecumenical cooperation with
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Hoey, an Anglican minister, claimed that all
Catholic politicians supported the republican movement of the IRA
and Sinn Fein, and so Protestants should defeat them, not
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no peace in this land as long as republicanism
calls the shots and gets away with what they want to do,'' he told
the 200 Orangemen blocked from marching past the half-dozen side
streets constituting the Lower Ormeau.
</P>
<P>
   ''They accept nothing unless it is done to their agenda,'' he
said through a bullhorn in front of a 20-foot-high steel wall
erected across a bridge. ''So we say to the government: Take them
on and put them down once and for all.''

<HEADLINE> Analysis of a new TV ad from state Democratic Party  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of the new state Democratic Party issue
ad
criticizing Rep. Rick Lazio's position on prescription coverage for
older Americans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Make''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: David Axelrod.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Upstate.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT:
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mormile: ''Between her and I, we take a total of about 34
pills a day. At the age of 72, I went back to work to help pay for
the medication that I need. Where I should be enjoying my life,
which they call our golden years, forget those words, its not our
golden years any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice-over: ''New Yorkers are struggling with soaring
prescription costs. Yet in Congress, Rick Lazio voted against
guaranteed prescription coverage for seniors under Medicare. Bowing
to the drug companies, Lazio voted for a plan that would leave
millions without affordable coverage. Tell Lazio: Next time, vote
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Frank and Ann Mormile, who are not professional actors,
are seen in their Albany home. Mrs. Mormile places pills in an
organizer; her husband looks at the pills. The words ''Lazio voted
no to guaranteed drug coverage Medicare,'' appear on the screen,
followed by the words ''Lazio plan would leave millions without
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   With a phone in the background, the ad then flashes: ''Call
Lazio. 202-225-3335.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad features two elderly New Yorkers, which may
catch the attention of older voters and also invoke sympathy from
voters in other age groups.
</P>
<P>
   The ad does not mention Hillary Rodham Clinton by name, but she
has made improving health care a theme of her campaign and supports
a Democratic proposal to provide prescription drug benefits to
Medicare recipients. Lazio supported a competing Republican
approach to providing prescription drug insurance for older
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The ad does not detail the complicated differences between the
two plans. While the Democrats' plan appears more generous because
it gives consumers a bigger benefit for the amount of money they
pay upfront, some experts believe the GOP plan will stimulate
competition among insurers and ultimately lead to a 25 percent
reduction in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Clinton's plan would cost retirees about $312 a
year in premiums to get 50 percent off the cost of their
prescriptions covered until they collected a maximum of $1,000 in
basic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, typical drug coverage under the GOP plan would cost

<HEADLINE> Investigator who admitted killing rabbi's wife loses license  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Saying he had demonstrated ''bad moral
character,'' the state has revoked the license of a private
detective who has admitted that he and an accomplice killed the
wife of a Cherry Hill rabbi at the rabbi's behest.
</P>
<P>
   State Police revoked Len Jenoff's license on May 8, a week after
he was charged in connection with the killing. In a letter to
Jenoff that was released Wednesday, the department said it was
revoking his license because he had shown himself to be
''untrustworthy,'' and had demonstrated ''bad moral character,''
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, and Paul Daniels, 27, of
Pennsauken, have admitted that they beat Carol Neulander to death
in November 1994 in the Cherry Hill home she shared with her
husband, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said that Neulander planned the murder because
Philadelphia radio host Elaine Soncini, with whom he had been
having an affair, was threatening to end it if he didn't leave his
wife. Neulander was worried that a divorce would cost him his job
as senior rabbi at Congregation M'kor Shalom, the Cherry Hill
synagogue he and his wife had founded.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff said the rabbi had promised to pay $30,000 for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who has pleaded innocent, was awaiting trial on
murder and conspiracy charges when Jenoff confessed. Camden County
Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon upgraded the charge against the rabbi to
capital murder, and Neulander is now being held without bail until
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels have pleaded guilty to aggravated
manslaughter and have said they will testify against Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Jenoff's license would
have been valid until July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's lawyer, Francis J. Hartman, told the Inquirer that
Jenoff accepted the department's decision.

<HEADLINE> State Leaders Agree on African Union  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOME, Togo (AP) -- African leaders signed a draft treaty
Wednesday seen as a step toward a new African Union and an eventual
continent-wide partnership overseeing defense, foreign affairs and
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, loosely modeled on the European Union, was endorsed
unanimously by 36 heads of state attending the annual Organization
of African Unity summit in Lome, Togo, OAU officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some leaders -- including the presidents of South Africa and
Nigeria -- left before the signing ceremony. In all, 27 leaders
signed the text, which still has to be ratified by two-thirds of
the 53 nations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The African Union would replace the 37-year-old OAU, which led
the ideological battle against South Africa's former minority-white
regime but often failed to resolve wars and civil conflicts
dividing the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how much authority the African Union would have
over individual states. The document stops short of removing a key
OAU tenet protecting the sovereignty of individual states above all
else.
</P>
<P>
   That principle is seen by observers as a major stumbling block
to the OAU's efforts to resolve African disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Although some African leaders were believed to be wary of
curtailing national sovereignty, there were no open signs of
dissent. National parliaments still can propose new amendments and
additions to the text.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a green traditional robe, Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi smiled broadly as he signed. The Libyan leader, who was a
driving force behind the agreement, said it gave Africa the chance
to come out of Europe's shadow after centuries of slavery and
colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   ''This African Union is not just in name,'' Gadhafi said,
vigorously waving his fist in the air. ''It will give us an
enormous chance to show the world that ... Africa is a place which
retains its humanity, dreams, hopes and rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft provides for a council of African heads of states and
the eventual establishment of an African parliament, courts,
central bank and common currency.
</P>
<P>
   The document also gives the Union the right to intervene in
affairs of member states to restore peace and security in extreme
cases like war or genocide.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING TO FIX SLUG LINE  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL BECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Robin Burns may be redefining the term beauty
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy businesswoman, a powerful player in the beauty
business for more than 20 years, has been behind some of the
best-known names in the industry including Calvin Klein Eternity
and Obsession fragrances and Estee Lauder cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's developing a line of upscale perfumes, lotions and
makeup for Victoria's Secret, the retailer known for its sexy
lingerie. Already, she's found great success in her new role.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robin has a track record in the beauty industry that few other
people come close to comparing with. She knows this business inside
out,'' said Jeff Stinson, a retail analyst at Midwest Research in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It's been two years since Burns joined Intimate Brands Inc.,
which runs the Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body Works chains. She
now leads a new division, Intimate Beauty Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been charged to create a new line of brands.
Eventually, Intimate Beauty hopes to look much like Estee Lauder,
which has an array of brands including Clinique, MAC and Bobbi
Brown in its portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Intimate Beauty, however, will also pair its brands with stores
it develops and operates, something Estee Lauder does on only a
very limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I look at who was winning in the business today, those
that can control all dimensions of their brands, from creating it
to selling it, are winning. They have more agility to move and move
fast to keep their brand alive in the public eye,'' said the
47-year-old Burns. ''I wanted to be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' first goal has been to overhaul Victoria's Secret Beauty,
which sold mostly low-cost scented creams and body gels. The new
prestige line will target women who usually buy their beauty
products in department stores.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at Victoria Secret Beauty come as the lingerie chain
transforms into a more sophisticated retailer. In recent years, it
has become more focused on keeping up with fashion trends, cut back
on the number of discounts it offers and raised prices to attract a
more upscale customer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Victoria's Secret was a lower, moderate, fairly promotional
place to shop for many years, but in the last few years they wanted
to build the brand into something more,'' said David Ricci, a
research analyst at William Blair &AMP; Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Dream Angels Heavenly was the first collection under the new
Victoria's Secret Beauty brand to reach the stores. Launched in
October, it includes creams, perfume, mist and body wash. The
smallest perfume costs $25, while a bottle of lotion sells for $27
- compared with $8 for some of the chain's earlier beauty products.
</P>
<P>
   Burns allotted a mere $2 million for marketing Heavenly, well
below the millions that many manufacturers throw into a launch. She
mostly used existing Victoria's Secret stores to promote the new
products, hanging ads in front windows and placing salespeople at
store entrances to offer a sample of the new fragrance to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Within four months, Heavenly had rung up $42 million in sales,
making it one of the most successful fragrance launches in retail
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I knew about fragrances, how to sell them and what
worked to be successful,'' said Burns, a petite, elegant woman.
''But never in my career had I seen such a huge response in such a
short amount of time. It almost caught me off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavenly's success proved to Burns the power of the Victoria's
Secret brand and its potential given its vast reach in the retail
marketplace with its nearly 900 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But she was surprised again this spring with the brisk sales
that came with the launches of the next fragrance in the Dream
Angels line, called Halo, and Pure Reflection Lipstick, which comes
in 25 colors for $13 each. Sales were not only strong in stores but
also through the Victoria's Secret catalog and Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And she's seen a tremendous response already from beauty editors
and Wall Street analysts for its new Laundry Collection, which
includes pricey detergents and softeners in packaged in pink
candy-striped containers. It will reach stores this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' experience at Victoria's Secret is the culmination of
three decades in the beauty business.
</P>
<P>
   She first worked in retailing at Bloomingdale's, where she was a
buyer of men's fragrances and eventually rose to head the beauty
department.
</P>
<P>
   By age 30, she became president of Calvin Klein cosmetics. She
built the brand from $6 million to $600 million in sales over her
seven years there, and oversaw the launches of the still-popular
Calvin Klein Obsession and Eternity fragrances.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, she was tapped by cosmetics powerhouse Estee Lauder to
be president and CEO of its namesake brand, which dominates the
selling floors of most department store chains.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Intimate Brands wooed her away, dangling the
opportunity to build her own brands and develop new retail
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burns is building freestanding Victoria's Secret Beauty
stores with chrome fixtures, soft lighting and hints of pink on the
walls. She is using the same look to renovate areas for beauty
products within the lingerie stores. She also is working to educate
salespeople on how to sell beauty products, even organizing
seminars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Women want to buy cosmetics by brands, just like they buy
clothing by brands. They align themselves with that image or aspire
to be that image,'' Burns said. ''We want to have a collection of
brands that they want.''

<HEADLINE> Anthrax Vaccine Supplier Sought  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A shortage of anthrax vaccine and huge
increases in the cost of buying it from a single private source are
spurring support for direct government production of anti-bacterial
warfare drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A government-owned plant would be operated by a contractor ''to
manufacture a variety of vaccines to address the most likely and
deadly spectrum of threats to our soldiers, sailors, airmen,
Marines and Coast Guardsmen,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy de
Leon told a Senate panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such a facility would take five to six years to set up, de Leon
told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. Getting a second
commercial source could take from two to four years, and getting
approval for vaccine that has already been produced will take
several months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Top Pentagon civilian and military officials will consider
government vaccine production at a budget meeting later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a vaccine shortage, the Pentagon has reduced its
inoculations against the deadly anthrax by 80 percent after
spending close to $100 million to fully protect only a small
fraction of the force from the odorless, colorless bacterium the
military fears will be used as a weapon by America's enemies. For
now, the only shots are for those considered most at risk: soldiers
in Korea and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he generally opposes
government taking over private enterprise, but government control
over vaccine production may be needed since private production has
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're leaving our men and women in the military vulnerable by
scaling back this program,'' Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money spent thus far is going to BioPort Corp., a
Lansing, Mich., company with 210 employees that has failed to meet
Food and Drug Administration requirements and has yet to
manufacture a single dose that can be used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   The company tends a dwindling stockpile of the vaccine, and it
has produced up to 3 million new doses it hopes to make available
when the FDA approves its work, possibly later this year, said
spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA recently refused to clear 800,000 doses of the
stockpiled vaccine because of irregularities in potency tests. The
company also failed to meet FDA requirements for its refurbished
plant. It plans to resubmit its license application by the end of
August.
</P>
<P>
   With BioPort running out of funds, the Pentagon agreed last year
to amend its original $29.1 million contract, giving it $24.1
million in ''extraordinary contractual relief,'' including an $18.7
million interest-free advance payment for vaccine. The number of
doses it must provide was cut in half and the price per dose
doubled for the first year and more than quadrupled for the second
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite all the challenges, we are confident ultimately the
FDA will license our facility and we will be back in the business
of manufacturing a safe, pure and effective vaccine for the U.S.
military,'' said Rossman-McKinney in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a possible government takeover of all
manufacturing, Rossman-McKinney said the company was prepared to
discuss anything that would meet military needs for the vaccine.
She said the company now operates without a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said it is unlikely
another private manufacturer will want to get into the business
because it may not be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The military still plans to inoculate all 2.4 million of its
employees worldwide with the full course of six doses and annual
boosters of the anthrax vaccine. So far, about 1.8 million doses
have been given to some 455,000 men and women. Some soldiers have
been disciplined for refusing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., called for immediate suspension
of all mandatory anthrax vaccinations and a review of any
disciplinary cases stemming from them.

<HEADLINE> GAO Criticizes Gov't Land Deals  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has lost millions of
dollars from land exchanges, often buying land for more than it is
worth and giving up land for less than its market value,
congressional auditors reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, recommended that lawmakers halt land exchanges by the
government's two principal land agencies -- the Bureau of Land
Management and the U.S. Forest Service -- because, according to the
report, the swaps often do not serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the two agencies said the exchanges often are the
way to obtain desirable property near federal land when owners are
unwilling to sell unless they get other land in return.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies said they had taken steps to improve the monitoring
of land exchanges and address some concerns about land values
raised by auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said the GAO
findings were ''very disturbing'' and sought a moratorium on
exchanges of land between federal agencies and private parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Land deals are being cut behind closed doors with tremendous
special-interest pressure and limited public input,'' he said. The
two agencies ''are failing to protect the public's wallet and their
environment,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Rem Hawes, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, said
the report ''makes some points that we think are warranted,''
especially on the need for closer monitoring of land exchanges.
But, he said, exchanges are ''very critical to effectively manage
the public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They allow us to improve ownership patterns of public lands in
the West'' where private land often is mixed with federal land in a
checkerboard pattern, Hawes said. He said the agency conducts 60 to
70 land exchanges a year and most are without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO examined 25 of an estimated 2,000 or more exchanges the
two land agencies have conducted since 1989. Altogether, the
agencies acquired an additional 1 million acres from land exchanges
during that period, valued at well over $1 billion, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited a case in which a person obtained 70 acres of
federal land in Nevada as part of an unidentified land exchange for
$763,000 and on the same day, according to land records, sold the
property for $4.6 million. The GAO said the case was investigated
by the Interior Department's inspector general, but gave no further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases, all in Nevada, cited by the GAO included:
</P>
<P>
   --Three exchanges in 1998 in which the land acquired by the
government appeared to be overvalued by a total of $8.8 million
because the appraisals ''did not meet federal standards'' and
''were not supported by credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   --A land exchange on Lake Tahoe where the BLM obtained 47 acres
of private land valued at $38 million, or $10 million more than
auditors later determined. The initial appraisal did not take into
account that the Forest Service actually had management interests
on the land, reducing its value.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the GAO questioned whether land exchanges served
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited one case near Elko, Nev., in which the BLM gave
up 140 acres of land that included prime winter habitat for
antelope. In return the BLM received land near its field office for
additional parking and storage areas. The GAO report noted that the
BLM's own policy said that unimproved lands should not be exchanged
for land for administrative purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While both agencies have made improvements, the GAO concluded,
''There is reason to question whether land exchanges remain a
viable tool for acquiring nonfederal land, especially in rapidly
developing real estate markets.''

<HEADLINE> Erving's Son Remembered at Service  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- The youngest son of basketball Hall of
Famer Julius Erving was remembered Wednesday as a fun-loving
teen-ager whose smile could make everyone around him feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities, family and friends packed Heartland Community
Church for a 90-minute memorial service for Cory Erving, the
subject of a nationwide search that ended with the discovery of his
body and car in a pond less than a mile from home.
</P>
<P>
   Patti LaBelle sang ''The Lord's Prayer,'' close family friend
and longtime Oprah Winfrey boyfriend Stedman Graham delivered
personal remarks to more than 1,500 well-wishers, including current
and former NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to tell you about Cory. You already know he would
give you the shirt off his back ... and he didn't have a mean bone
in his body,'' Graham said. ''We know he was trying to find himself
as many young people do at that age.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary tests indicate the 19-year-old might have been using
cocaine just before his death, although the medical examiner
stressed the early results are ''not completely reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory had struggled with a drug habit for most of his teen-age
years, but his family believed he had turned his life around.
</P>
<P>
   Three friends recalled him as a prankster who loved to play
practical jokes on friends and teachers at school. Oldest brother
Cheo, 27, apologized for sometimes setting a bad example and sister
Jazmin, 23, sobbed as she talked about ''the only little brother I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I took Cory's life for granted. I promise I won't take anyone
else's life for granted,'' a second brother, Julius III, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You looked up to me,'' Cheo added. ''I apologize for some of
things I showed you that were not the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory, last seen alive at a bakery May 28, when he was buying
bread for a family cookout, was found dead in his submerged car in
a pond near the family home last week. His body was discovered more
than a month after Julius Erving appealed to the public for help in
locating his son.
</P>
<P>
   A test for cocaine on water in Cory's bladder was positive, but
further tests on his liver, lung, heart, kidney, brain and skeletal
muscles are needed before anything can be determined conclusively,
said Dr. Thomas Beaver, Volusia County's medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking the results of the test with a very large grain
of salt,'' Beaver said. ''The test is not completely reliable and
must be viewed skeptically.''
</P>
<P>
   The test is normally conducted on urine in the bladder but had
to be done by washing the bladder with water since the body had no
urine. Decomposition of the body also might have affected the test,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an autopsy showed there was no trauma to Cory's
body and Cory most likely had been in the pond since the day he
disappeared, Beaver said.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing is conclusive until a report by a forensic
pathologist is complete, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Touched by the response of Central Florida during the search for
Cory, Julius Erving and his wife, Turquoise, opened Wednesday's
service to the public. A reception followed in an adjacent
gymnasium, where the overflow was able to watch on large-screen
television
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities attending were current and former NBA
players and executives Rod Thorn, Billy Cunningham, Pat Croce,
Moses Malone, Maurice Cheeks, Clyde Drexler, Darrell Armstrong,
Corey Maggette, Ben Wallace, Gerald Henderson, Artis Gilmore and
Jack Givens and sportscaster Bob Costas.

<HEADLINE> Braves Get Ashby From Phillies  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves, trying to bolster their
once-dominant starting rotation, traded for right-hander Andy Ashby
on Wednesday, sending a former top prospect and a minor leaguer to
the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, holding a slim lead in the National League East,
traded away Bruce Chen and minor league pitcher Jimmy Osting hours
after the New York Yankees got former Braves pitcher Denny Neagle
in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 33, has a 76-81 career record and a 4.10 ERA in nine
years. His ERA ballooned to 5.68 this season, but he has allowed
just three earned runs in his last 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ashby's ability and experience are very appealing to us, and
we believe he's shown signs of returning to his form of old,''
Atlanta general manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies general manager Ed Wade said the team was close to
trading Ashby to the Yankees, but made the deal with Atlanta after
the Yankees-Reds trade. A third team made an offer for Ashby that
was unacceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the opportunity came to try and extend our relationship
with Andy, we were going to do that,'' Wade said. ''But that never
presented itself,'' Wade said. ''We didn't want to get to the end
of the season and possibly get zero value in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, a two-time All-Star, is in the final year of a $15
million, three-year contract. He is making $5.9 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 23, has been one of the Braves' top prospects for several
years, but has never established himself as a major league starter.
He was 4-0 with a 2.50 ERA in 22 appearances for Atlanta this
season, mostly in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was eager to join the Phillies, who are in last place
in the NL East, 12 games behind the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't view the Phillies as a losing club,'' he said. ''Guys
like Scott Rolen, Mike Lieberthal and Bobby Abreu are all good
young players. I think they have good young ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, a left-hander, struggled as the Braves fifth starter for
part of 1999, going 1-2 with a 4.95 ERA in seven starts. He is
making $207,500 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was again a candidate for a spot in the Braves' rotation
this year after John Smoltz was sidelined by a season-ending elbow
surgery. But manager Bobby Cox filled the last two spots in his
rotation with veterans Terry Mulholland and John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Braves' rotation has been shakier than usual. Kevin
Millwood has been unable to regain the form that made him Atlanta's
top pitcher in 1999, and Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine have lost some
of the dominance that made them Cy Young winners.
</P>
<P>
   Both were selected as All-Stars. But their ERAs have risen
considerably since early this season -- Maddux's from 2.16 at the
end of May to 3.32 now, and Glavine's from 2.29 in mid-May to 3.61
at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who won 35 games for the Braves in 1998 and 1999, is
just 5-8 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Braves signed right-hander Scott Kamieniecki to
help their injury-riddled bullpen, which is missing Luis Rivera,
Kevin McGlinchy and Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   Wade said the Phillies envisioned Chen as a starter as a No. 3
or 4 starter. He is likely to pitch Saturday against the Toronto
Blue Jays in what would have been Ashby's turn in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said he was surprised by the deal but looked forward to
pitching on a more consistent schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was in Atlanta, I didn't know when I would pitch,'' he
said. ''I could go 7 or 8 days without pitching. To know that
Philadelphia will give me an opportunity to start is very good for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby left a start in late June in a heated exchange with fans
upset after a poor outing.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing six runs in six innings against the Milwaukee
Brewers, Ashby exchanged words with fans behind the dugout when he
left the game and yelled several obscenities at one fan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating,'' Ashby said. ''It's not the place
(Philadelphia), it's how I'm pitching. It's the same thing every
start. I can't figure it out. Maybe I should try throwing sidearm
or left-handed. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But he pitched eight strong innings Saturday against Baltimore.
In front of scouts from at least seven teams, he allowed just one
earned run to win his second straight start.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, signed by the Phillies in 1986, was traded back to the
Phillies from San Diego in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was named minor league pitcher of the year in 1998 as he
rose from Double-A to the majors. After being called up to the
Braves in September, he went 2-0 in four starts with a 3.98 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Osting, 23, was a combined 4-10 this year with three minor
league teams. He missed the entire 1998 season after undergoing
surgery to repair a torn ligament in his pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He led the Class A South Atlantic League last year with 14 wins.
He had a 2.88 ERA and 131 strikeouts in 147 innings.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Shut Out of All-Star Voting  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA MURPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Phoenix Mercury will play host to the second
WNBA All-Star game without a single player of its own in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury were shut out of Monday night's game when Brandy
Reed was left off the Western Conference team Wednesday. Reed leads
the Mercury in scoring (16.8), rebounding (5.7) and steals (2.4).
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller was angry that Mercury fans won't
have anyone to cheer at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an absolute travesty,'' Miller said. ''How do you not
vote in a Brandy Reed? How do you not have an All-Star when you are
hosting the game?''
</P>
<P>
   Fans selected the starters, with Houston Comets star Sheryl
Swoopes finishing as the top vote-getter (171,576) for the second
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches in the Eastern and Western Conferences selected the six
reserves for each team.
</P>
<P>
   The West reserves are Katie Smith and Betty Lennox of Minnesota,
DeLisha Milton and Mwadi Mabika of Los Angeles, Natalie Williams of
Utah and Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith, last season's most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   Van Chancellor, coach of the Houston Comets and the West
All-Star team, expected to see Reed on his roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be frank, I'm surprised Brandy Reed didn't make the team,''
said Chancellor, who voted for Reed. ''She's a player. I'm glad I'm
not the next game she has. She's going to have about 35 points.''
</P>
<P>
   New York coach Richie Adubato, who will guide the East
All-Stars, won't have to worry about containing Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brandy Reed has had an exceptional year,'' Adubato said of the
21-year-old forward. ''Politically, it's always good to have
representatives of the team hosting, but that's life sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The East reserves are Wendy Palmer of Detroit, Tari Phillips of
New York, Andrea Stinson of Charlotte, Nykesha Sales and Shannon
Johnson of Orlando, and Merlakia Jones of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad the coaches saw the improved play of Phillips,''
Adubato said. ''She is very deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes will be joined in the Western Conference starting lineup
by teammates Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson, along with Lisa
Leslie of Los Angeles and Ticha Penicheiro of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest goal is we want to win, we want to defend our
title,'' said Swoopes, whose West team won 79-61 last July in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The West, which boasts six players on the U.S. national team,
will face a smaller East squad. Chamique Holdsclaw and Nikki McCray
of Washington will lead the East starters along with Sue Wicks and
Teresa Weatherspoon of New York and Taj McWilliams of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Adubato was pleased three Liberty players were selected, the
same number as the three-time defending champion Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York fans love the way Spoon and Wicks play with such
emotion,'' Adubato said. ''Their hearts are on their sleeves.''

<HEADLINE> Reds Deal Neagle to Yankees  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The New York Yankees wanted Denny Neagle and
they got him, giving up highly ranked prospects to fill in the gap
in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees traded minor league third baseman Drew Henson,
outfielder Jackson Melian, right-hander Brian Reith and left-hander
Ed Yarnall on Wednesday to the Cincinnati Reds for Neagle and minor
league outfielder Mike Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We like these guys, but we've made the decision to go for
it,'' general manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade represented a turning point for two franchises headed
in different directions as the season resumes after the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending World Series champions are trying to
patch holes in the roster that have left them in a three-way
contest for the AL East. By contrast, the Reds have gone back to
rebuilding only a few months after winning 96 games, trading for
Ken Griffey Jr. and becoming a favorite to win the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Neagle deal is similar to the one the Reds made in 1998,
trading top starter Dave Burba to Cleveland on the eve of the
season opener, and similar to a move the Chicago White Sox made in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox traded for prospects that year even though they
were 3&AMP;frac12; games out of first, a move that has paid off in the AL
Central lead this year. Cincinnati trails St. Louis by eight games
in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know this deal's going to be unpopular for the present,''
general manager Jim Bowden said. ''The White Sox took a lot of
grief when they made a similar trade a few years ago. But in the
end, that's how you win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees knew they needed another run producer and another
starting pitcher to elbow their way into the playoffs again. They
tried to get Juan Gonzalez -- he was too expensive -- and missed out
on Sammy Sosa -- the Cubs' trade demands were too steep -- before
getting David Justice from Cleveland two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to address the rotation, they reached for the
top shelf. Neagle, a free agent after this season, is 14-2 with a
3.143 ERA since last August.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what late-season pressure is like. He has pitched in 10
playoffs games, including two World Series starts for Atlanta
against the Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denny Neagle is the guy we wanted,'' Cashman said. ''We feel
he was the best pitcher available on the market. He has postseason
experience. He's healthy. He's been successful. And a left-hander
at Yankee Stadium -- all those attributes played a part in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he likes New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there's been players throughout their careers that
don't necessarily like to play in New York, whether they say the
fans or the media can be tough on them,'' Neagle said. ''You've got
to have fun with it. That's right up my alley, to go there with
some of the most crazy, wildest fans in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, 31, knew there was a good chance he would be traded
after he turned down a below-market offer from the Reds -- three
years, $18 million -- to keep free agency an option.
</P>
<P>
   He was afraid that if he signed an extension before the July 31
trading deadline, Bowden would trade him anyway. That's what Bowden
did with closer Jeff Shaw in July 1998, shortly after he signed a
below-market extension.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be in a situation where I was locked into a
new contract and did get traded and didn't have any say-so where I
got to play,'' Neagle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees now assume that risk, although Neagle said he would
be willing to sit down and listen to an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely open-minded,'' said Neagle, who makes $4.75
million. ''I would be foolish not to entertain offers from the
Yankees. Let's put it this way: They were on my short list of teams
I would consider in free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Reds get back to rebuilding toward a new stadium in
2003, the Yankees will try to elbow their way into the playoffs
with a rotation that includes Neagle, Roger Clemens, David Cone,
Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to get another World Series start and be on that
mound in the ninth inning,'' Neagle said. ''It would be a dream
come true for me to be able to finish out a game for the Yankees in
the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal was Henson, who hasn't decided whether to
play baseball or go into the NFL. He's expected to be the starting
quarterback at Michigan this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Henson is the wild card in the deal,'' Bowden said. ''If in
the future he plays major league baseball, I think in the end this
is a real good deal for the Reds. If he does play football, I still
think it's a good deal considering the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Henson is hitting .287 for Double-A Norwich. Melian, 20, hit
.252 with nine homers in 81 games at Norwich this season. Reith,
22, went 9-4 with a 2.18 ERA for Class A Tampa. Yarnall, 24, was
2-1 with a 4.56 ERA in 10 starts for the Yankees this season.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, 25, played in 28 games for the Reds in 1998, hitting
.225, and has been at Triple-A since.

<HEADLINE> Air Force, Rescue Group End Feud  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's premier volunteer rescue agency
ended a four-year feud with the U.S. Air Force on Wednesday by
signing a formal operating agreement -- the first in the auxiliary's
59-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Air Force and the Civil Air Patrol, which has been
loosely under its control since the Truman administration, said the
agreement will ease tensions that escalated last summer when
federal agents seized computer files out of the CAP's Alabama
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Air Force had sought to crack down on alleged
mismanaged funds at CAP, but the auxiliary lobbied for more
autonomy on the grounds it is a volunteer organization that saves
taxpayers millions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the new cooperative agreement, the Air Force strengthens its
oversight, but the Air Patrol's basic functions of search and
rescue, cadet programs and aerospace education are formally
recognized. That could lead to more federal funding down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more or less an inevitable thing,'' said the CAP's
national commander, Brig. Gen. James C. Bobick. ''You're operating
under obsolete guidelines, and finally it became a reality that,
whoops, we need to revise these.''
</P>
<P>
   The CAP, with a main hub at Maxwell Air Force Base near
Montgomery, Ala., was established in December 1941 as a civilian
volunteer rescue organization for World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Truman declared it an official auxiliary of the
Air Force, but the relationship was a loose one -- relying only on a
memorandum of understanding rather than a firmer cooperative
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   CAP volunteers participate in more than 85 percent of the
nation's inland rescue attempts, hauling their own equipment and
sometimes using their own aircraft to search for lost persons on
land and in water. Bobick said the taxpayer expense for a typical
rescue mission is $60 an hour, compared to more than $1,500 an hour
if a military helicopter is commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes CAP helps out in high profile searches, such as last
summer's recovery of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s fallen plane off the
Massachusetts coast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big winners should be the CAP cadets and leaders in the
field,'' the Air Force said in a statement about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the Air Force and Civil Air Patrol didn't
come without a little congressional nudging. U.S. Sens. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, and Wayne Allard, R-Colo., helped lay the groundwork for
talks. Both were present for Wednesday's signing.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also was attached to a defense authorization bill,
which the Senate may approve as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to push very hard to get both parties to sit down and
work together,'' said Allard, whose home state houses the Air Force
Academy. ''Once they saw we were interested in a cooperative
agreement being worked out, both parties got much more serious in
their negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office first suggested the Air Force and
CAP should formalize their agreement in a preliminary report to
Congress. The final version of that report is still pending, but it
is expected to address a probe of mismanaged funds in Alabama and
at other CAP offices.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, a 15-member Air Force team found what it said were
questionable travel expenses, missing inventory items and
substandard safety policies at the CAP headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after federal agents sieged computers and documents
out of the Alabama office, CAP's executive director, Paul J. Albano
Sr., resigned. Albano said the resignation was unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   ''These investigations actually are a benefit to us,'' Bobick
said. ''The ultimate result was they have identified areas that
need to improve. I don't care how good an organization is, it is
nice to have outside eyes look at it.''

<HEADLINE> Man accused of hacking NASA computers used for interplanetary missions </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A New Rochelle man authorities believe has a
knack for stealing secret computer passwords was arrested Wednesday
on charges that he broke into two NASA computers and hosted an
Internet chat room devoted to hacking.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Raymond Torricelli, 20, prompted U.S. Attorney
Mary Jo White to say in a statement that the Internet is ''no safe
haven for criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli was arrested early Wednesday at his home, where he
allegedly used his personal computer to break into two computers
belonging to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court papers that Torricelli installed a
program on a computer used by NASA to perform satellite design and
mission analysis concerning future space missions. He then
allegedly used the program in chat-room discussions with other
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also was accused of hacking into more than 800 other
computers and using some of them to send unsolicited advertisements
about a pornographic website. He earned $300 to $400 per week from
the process, called spamming, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they found 76,000 passwords on Torricelli's
computer, including passwords and usernames from computers owned by
San Jose State University and Georgia Southern University.
</P>
<P>
   White said people who gain access to restricted government
computers ''are not harmless pranksters - they are criminals and
will be dealt with vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA laboratory Torricelli allegedly hacked into is the lead
center for exploration of space with robotic spacecraft, having
launched missions to every planet in the solar system except Pluto.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Murrill, a spokeswoman for the lab, declined to
comment on the case but said security has since been improved.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a computer security system like any other large
organization but we don't discuss it. We never discuss matters that
involve computer security,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Murrill said the lab, which employs 5,000 people on a 200-acre
campus just outside Los Angeles, is managed by the California
Institute of Technology, though its computers belong to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli was released on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the most serious charge, he faces up to 10 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Senatorial candidate seeks court help to face Clinton in primary </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A retired New York City police lieutenant who
wants to challenge Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary
for U.S. Senate filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking help from the
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Ruane, of Suffern, said he was filing the lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan to force the state Democratic
Party to authorize a primary without the 15,000 signatures
ordinarily required to place a candidate on the ballot. Ruane said
collecting the signatures in just a few weeks would be an
''insurmountable barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While they're saying you can do this, the power lies in the
hands of a few powerful party leaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit named the state's Board of Election as well as
various board commissioners and members of the New York Democratic
State Committee as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with the Albany office of the state Board of
Elections was not immediately returned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, Ruane said the effect of the state's election
law was to force senatorial candidates to collect 15,000 signatures
within 37 days and also undertake a massive and costly effort to
obtain signatures in 16 of the state's 31 separate congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   He said the difficulty of getting on the ballot for national
political office in New York state is legendary, causing many
second-tier presidential candidates to skip the state all together.
</P>
<P>
   He described a massive attempt by Patrick Buchanan to get on the
ballot in 24 of the state's 31 congressional districts in 1996,
saying Buchanan later concluded that the enormous expenditure of
money was ''the biggest strategic blunder of their campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates, he said, got on the ballot through court
order.
</P>
<P>
   Ruane said he lacks the ''support of the existing party
apparatus'' and cannot be expected to collect 15,000 signatures at
the height of the summer vacation season.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was much harder to collect signatures than in
the past because town squares have been replaced by privately owned
shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was denied access to two major malls in Rockland
County when he studied the prospects for collecting signatures.

<HEADLINE> Many of Mexico's PRI Leaders To Quit  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Most of the ousted Mexican ruling party's
executive committee will resign as part of a reorganization
following the party's first presidential election loss in 71 years,
the party president said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is intended to maintain unity in the badly
fractured Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. But it could
wind up provoking an internal split: Some party members are
impatient with the slow pace of change.
</P>
<P>
   Only PRI President Dulce Maria Sauri and a finance secretary
will remain from the dozens of members of the National Executive
Committee. Sauri and a committee of former PRI presidents will lead
the reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Sauri said the move does not come at the insistence of outgoing
President Ernesto Zedillo, but at the suggestion of the state
governors who form the party's largest remaining bastion of
support. Traditionally the president calls the shots in the PRI,
but Zedillo faces unprecedented opposition within the ranks after
his party lost to opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this new form of internal rule, we can engage in
introspection and debate,'' Sauri said in an interview with the
Televisa television network. She said the changes would provide
more democracy in the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   However, the move doesn't appear to go far enough to please some
party members. One faction is calling for a national convention, an
immediate and complete change in leadership and a return to the
party's old populist strategies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the leader of that faction, Tabasco Gov. Roberto
Madrazo, wrote an open letter to Sauri saying ''the party's
dysfunctional state will turn to death if it tries to foist off
predisposed solutions on the membership.'' A half-dozen other PRI
state governors could reportedly endorse Madrazo's challenge. Most
are from the PRI's old guard and oppose Zedillo's free-market,
reform policies.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo is eager to assume leadership because his term as
governor of Tabasco will end in early 2001. But Sauri -- apparently
with Zedillo's backing -- is adopting a go-slow approach that could
frustrate Madrazo.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said Wednesday he didn't oppose the new leadership
proposal, but said he would issue details of his own plan in a few
days. In an interview with local media, he downplayed possibilities
of an immediate split, saying ''it's important not to have
disputes'' within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo held a damage-control session with 21 PRI governors to
discuss the party's future Tuesday, and was able to line several of
them up behind the transition plan.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the PRI's losing presidential candidate, Francisco
Labastida, appeared for the first time in public since conceding
defeat July 2. In a live interview on Mexico's top-rated national
newscast, Labastida spoke in a conciliatory tone, making no
reference to the often harsh words he exchanged on the campaign
trail with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said he wouldn't seek the leadership of the PRI. He
denied that there was ''rebellion'' in party ranks, and said he
would work to build the PRI into a healthy opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Reds Call Up Luebbers, Bell  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds called up right-hander
Larry Luebbers and infielder Mike Bell from Triple-A Louisville on
Wednesday, filling holes created by a trade and an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Luebbers took the roster spot opened when the Reds traded
left-hander Denny Neagle to the New York Yankees for four minor
leaguers. Luebbers was 7-6 with a 3.53 ERA in 17 starts and one
relief appearance for Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Bell replaced third baseman Aaron Boone, who went on the 15-day
disabled list Wednesday with a sprained knee. Boone aggravated the
injury Sunday in a 5-3 loss to Cleveland.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Red Light Running Kills 800  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drivers who make a split-second decision to
try to beat a red light are to blame for the deaths of more than
800 people and an estimated 200,000 injuries in the United States
each year, according to a study of government figures.
</P>
<P>
   The study to be released Thursday by the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety found that between 1992 and 1998, almost 6,000
people died in such crashes, and more than half of them were
pedestrians and occupants of other vehicles hit by red light
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,779 deaths occurred in the vehicles running the red
lights. During the same period, about 1.5 million people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red light running is more than just a form of aggressive
driving. People are dying and getting hurt needlessly because of
it,'' said Ed Rust Jr., chairman of the institute and chief
executive of State Farm Insurance, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the nonprofit institute studied data from the
Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System
and found that fatal crashes at traffic signals increased 18
percent from 1992 and 1998, more than three times the rate of
increase for all other fatal crashes during that time.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, the researchers examined the rate of red light
running deaths per 100,000 residents and determined that the states
with the highest death rate were Arizona, with a rate of 7.1
deaths; Nevada with 3.9; Michigan with 3.7; Texas with 3.5; and
Alabama with 3.4.
</P>
<P>
   Among cities, the rate was highest in Phoenix, with 10.8 deaths
per 100,000 people, followed by Memphis, Tenn., with a rate of 8.0;
Mesa, Ariz., with a rate of 7.8 deaths; Tucson, Ariz., and St.
Petersburg, Fla., both with a rate of 7.6 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the data, the institute endorsed the use of red
light cameras, which photograph vehicles running red lights and
ticket violators by mail. Such programs, used in about 40 U.S.
communities, reduce red light running by about 40 percent,
according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   However, privacy advocates, including the American Civil
Liberties Union, have said they are wary because of privacy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't opposed cameras for the specific use enforcing
traffic violations,'' said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. ''We are concerned about
mission creep, that these cameras will be used for other purposes,
and it's classically true that surveillance techniques created for
one purpose are rarely restricted to that purpose.''

<HEADLINE> Camden residents angered by governor's pat-down of man  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - People who spend time on the streets here
say pat-downs by police are a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Even a frisk by the governor is not unimaginable, some city
residents said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But most are outraged by the 1996 photo that captured Gov.
Christie Whitman's search of a black male in Camden. They are
particularly angered by the fact that Whitman appears to be smiling
in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's insulting. Her being the governor, coming into a city as
poor as Camden and doing this,'' said Ira Sapp, who showed the
picture to friends in a corner grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody felt the same way. It's not right. It's not fair and
why is she smiling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph obtained by the Associated Press shows Whitman
standing behind the man, who has his arms spread and palms pressed
up against a wall. The governor is wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, a
baseball cap and black gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Dupree said he is familiar with the man's position in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I've been patted down by the cops. It's not a good
feeling and it's not something to laugh about,'' said Dupree, who
works in a local barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   Water ice vendor Ray English said he was disgusted by the
governor's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thinks it's funny. This woman has no sense. One thing, she
won't be vice president now,'' English said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman defends the search, and says her experiences touring
with the State Police twice in 1996 helped push her to address
Camden's dire social ills. In the months before her visit, the
state's poorest city logged a record number of homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said now the crime rate is down dramatically, a new
county prosecutor is in place, federal authorities have targeted
municipal corruption and the state is attempting to take over city
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the picture became widely public, Whitman has repeatedly
rejected critics who say it is an example of racial profiling.
Troopers offered her a suspect to search and she did, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago the detail of State Police troopers targeted the
Whitman Park section of Camden. City police said the neighborhood
still features open air drug markets and violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first reaction to this is she's having fun,'' said Whitman
Park resident Derrick Price.
</P>
<P>
   Price and others on the corner said police officers would
probably have stopped them Wednesday afternoon, except for the
presence of a reporter and photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It happens over and over. It don't matter where you're at,
what you're doing, they pat you down,'' said LaFahr Dacoup. ''But
the governor has no business doing that. And she's smiling and
she's violating his civil rights.''

<HEADLINE> OPEC, Saudis Fail To Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ABDULLAH AL-SHIHRI
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- A meeting between the president of
OPEC and Saudi Arabia's oil minister ended Wednesday without an
agreement on a planned Saudi production increase.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued after the meeting said Ali Rodriguez,
president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,
and Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi noted that ''the current situation
and the near future outlook for products point to an imbalanced
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers agreed to continue working within OPEC and with
other producers to bring stability to the market, the statement
said. They also ''noted that price volatility ... is not in the
interests of the producers or consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who has criticized a recent Saudi plan to raise
production to bring prices down, said in Kuwait earlier Wednesday
that he did not think any OPEC member would increase production
unilaterally. He has said the cartel must act in consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came after Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
producer, said last week it plans to pump an additional 500,000
barrels in an effort to bring down oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   While in Kuwait, Rodriguez spoke with Kuwaiti oil minister Sheik
Saud Nasser al-Sabah, who said his country prefers to wait until
the end of July before considering whether it will increase crude
oil production.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to wait until the end of July to see how the market
will do,'' al-Sabah said. If there is an unjustified increase in
oil prices by then, ''we will act accordingly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sabah said there is ''plenty'' of crude in the market, but
there is a shortage of product, and ''that's not our problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's announcement of the planned increase unleashed a
wave of protests from other OPEC producers, who only last month
agreed to pump an additional 708,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   But prices have continued to hover around $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has been under pressure from the United States, the
world's largest oil consumer and a close ally, to bring prices
down. U.S. consumers had been demanding relief from soaring
gasoline prices in the summer driving season, with prices soaring
above $2 a gallon in some regions.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, which meets next in Vienna, Austria, on Sept. 10, delivers
about one-third of the world's oil supply. Its official output is
25.4 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the cartel's most
influential member, produces almost a third of that.

<HEADLINE> United Way benefit canceled because it's considered gambling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - A rubber ducky regatta that raises money
for the United Way won't be held here this year because it violates
an anti-gambling ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The event, held for the last four years at Gillian's Wonderland
Pier, allows contributors to pay $5 for a numbered plastic duck.
The ducks are dumped into the park's Lazy River water ride and the
people whose ducks cross the finish line first win prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a disappointment to the kids,'' said United Way
spokeswoman Ronnie Town. ''People enjoyed going to the races.
Children would wave signs rooting on their ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, $18,000 was raised.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Legalized Games of Chance Control Commission
recently notified the city that the race violates a city ordinance
that bans raffles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a form of gambling, but nobody really thought about it,''
said park manager Jay Gillian. ''It's just one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council President Frank McCall said the ordinance may have
to be amended to allow for nonprofit organizations that raise money
through raffles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only ones who suffer by this are the beneficiaries of
United Way fund raising,'' McCall said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Place Spencer on 60-Day DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shane Spencer, the New York Yankees' outfielder
who will miss the rest of the season because of a knee injury, was
placed on the 60-day disabled list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, 28, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee Sunday night while fielding a ball in left field at Shea
Stadium against the crosstown Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was hitting .282 with nine homers and 40 RBIs in 73
games this season. He rose to quick prominence with the Yankees in
1998 when he homered 10 times and drove in 27 runs in only 67
at-bats late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Todd Erdos, designated for assignment by the
Yankees on July 2, was claimed off waivers Wednesday by the San
Diego Padres. He had one save and a 5.04 ERA in 14 relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   New York also optioned RHP Darrell Einertson to Triple-A
Columbus. Einertson has been with the Yankees three times this
season. He has no decisions and a 5.40 ERA in six games out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were made after the Yankees acquired left-hander Denny
Neagle and minor league outfielder Mike Frank from the Cincinnati
Reds for minor league third baseman Drew Henson, outfielder Jackson
Melian, right-hander Brian Reith and left-hander Ed Yarnall.

<HEADLINE> Stronger Online Privacy Sought  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are seeking ways to shore up online
privacy following reports of businesses selling customers' personal
information and an FBI system that hunts for suspects by scanning
citizens' e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
introduced legislation that would bar the sale of personal
information kept by a defunct company if the sale would have
violated privacy policies in effect when the company was in
business.
</P>
<P>
   The bill responds to the case of Toysmart, a former online toy
retailer that put all its assets, including its customer records --
such as names, addresses and credit card numbers -- up for sale
despite a privacy policy that assured customers the information
would remain private.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission filed a suit against Toysmart this
week to stop the sale from taking place. Rep. Spencer Bachus,
R-Ala., has already announced plans to introduce a similar bill in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong to use our nation's bankruptcy laws as an excuse
to violate a customer's personal privacy,'' the senators said in a
letter to colleagues asking for support for the bill. ''Customers
have a right to expect a firm to adhere to its privacy policies,
whether it is making a profit or has filed for bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislators say they will try to include the bill in a
larger bankruptcy reform package.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe, an organization that gives its seal to Web sites that
meet its privacy principles, blew the whistle on Toysmart in June.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Walt Disney, the majority owner of Toysmart,
said it has offered to purchase the company's lists and assure
their confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   In a related action, two legislators are going after
''Carnivore,'' a system in use by the FBI to monitor suspected
criminals' e-mail. Carnivore is installed at a suspect's Internet
provider and scans through all incoming and outgoing mail, looking
for messages belonging to the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and
the Electronic Information Privacy Center, and some Internet
providers object to the system because Internet companies have no
control over the ''black box.'' They say it infringes upon the
rights of individuals not involved with the FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU sent a letter to Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., detailing
its concerns. Canady will announce Thursday the date for hearings
on Carnivore, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey sent a letter Wednesday to
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh blasting
the agencies and the Clinton administration for the
''cybersnooping'' system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The federal government has the power and the authority to
collect and maintain vast amounts of private personal
information,'' wrote Armey, R-Texas. ''This administration
continues to demonstrate a cavalier attitude with that
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., will introduce a bill Thursday
aimed at stopping identity theft. The bill would prohibit the sale
of Social Security numbers, which can be used to get credit card
numbers, bank loans and accounts in another person's name. The FTC
announced Wednesday that calls to their identity theft hot line are
on the rise, at about 850 reports per week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Identity theft is a terrible problem that has literally
destroyed people's lives and it must be stopped,'' said Shaw, who
heads the House Social Security subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Kean favors donor disclosure by gubernatorial PACS  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, N.J. (AP) - Former Gov. Thomas H. Kean testified
Wednesday in favor of a campaign reform measure that would require
gubernatorial candidates who want public financing to disclose the
donors and amounts given to their advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, pending in the state Senate and Assembly, is aimed
at opening the books on so-called ''527'' groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a sense, these 527s are like termites that are getting at
the roots of our democracy,'' said Kean, who in 1981 became the
first governor to accept matching funds as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and observers believe such groups are pouring
increasing amounts of money into ads and mailings aimed at
influencing elections, often portraying themselves as
''grass-roots'' organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Their actual membership, as well as the number of such groups
and the amount of money involved is not known, since they do not
have to disclose where their funding comes from.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are barred from urging a vote for or against a
particular candidate, but state Sen. William L. Gormley said that
provision is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   ''When my name is in their (ads) negatively 23 times, that's not
issue advocacy,'' said Gormley, R-Atlantic, who is sponsoring the
measure in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bills, A-2647 and S-1468, would require that when a person
who helped form or operate a 527 group ran for governor, the group
would have to disclose the names and amounts given by all donors,
and the group's expenditures, from the date the group was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley and Kean testified before the Assembly's state
government committee on an identical measure introduced in that
house by Assemblyman Joel Weingarten and Kevin J. O'Toole, both
Republicans from Essex County.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, a two-term governor and former assemblyman, lent the panel
a chandelier-lit room at Drew University, where he is president,
for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had some rough campaigns in my time. And some things were
said about me that I didn't appreciate. But I knew who was saying
them,'' Kean said. ''If someone wants to attack you, if someone
wants to attack me, fine. Let them sign their name.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged lawmakers to consider broadening the measure to apply
to other state offices: ''No one should be subject to anonymous
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley agreed, but said the bill is an achievable first step
because it has a ''hook,'' the matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether gubernatorial PACS would be affected
by a federal law signed July 1 by President Clinton closing a
loophole that permitted unlimited secret contributions to groups
trying to exert anonymous influence over elections and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The law addressed an increasingly popular provision of the U.S.
Tax Code known as Section 527, which permitted tax-exempt groups to
use undisclosed donors to pay for advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said the federal law ''will be litigated forever'' and
if New Jersey does not act now, ''You would be turning the state
over to faceless, nameless cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman appears to support the disclosure concept
for advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor feels the public has a right to know who they are
and where their money comes from,'' said spokeswoman Steffanie
Bell, reached in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman still has to evaluate the bill before taking a position,
Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick M. Herrmann, executive director of the state Election
Law Enforcement Commission, told the panel that ''stealth PACS''
skirt requirements imposed on candidates that are ''essential for
open and honest government.''
</P>
<P>
   ELEC members have not yet studied the bill, but have
historically supported disclosure measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ELEC's only suggestion is that the bill should
require that only donors of more than $300 be disclosed, to mirror
current state disclosure rules, Herrmann said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey may be among the first states seeking to expose the
''sinister nature'' of 527 groups, said Steven C. Weiss, spokesman
for the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, a
nonpartisan, non-advocacy research group that tracks campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The electoral process best serves voters when there is a
maximum disclosure, when voters are privy to as much relevant
information about the candidates as possible,'' Weiss said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign Foreign Aid Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton will sign an $11.2
billion measure that helps finance Colombia's war against drugs,
U.S. military construction projects and disaster aid for Americans,
White House aides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, host of a Mideast peace summit at the Camp David
presidential retreat, was expected to sign the bill Thursday during
a brief return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to attend a Capitol ceremony where former University
of Notre Dame president Rev. Theodore Hesburgh was being presented
with the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is pleased to sign this bill, which will provide
long overdue relief for victims of Hurricane Floyd and in
particular will help our efforts to stem the tide of illegal
narcotics from Colombia,'' deputy press secretary Jake Siewert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the bill on June 30. The House passed it the
day before, 306-110.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between Clinton's $5.2 billion version
and Congress' was that lawmakers more than doubled his defense
request to $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators also included hundreds of millions for
election-year, home-state projects ranging from New York City's
proposed Second Avenue subway to the crabbing industry in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The measure includes money to help equip and train Colombian
forces battling cocaine and heroin producers, complete U.S.
military construction, pay for U.S. peacekeeping troops in Kosovo
and reconstruct lost White House e-mails that congressional
investigators are hunting.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes money to help New Mexico recover from blazes
and North Carolina and other states hit by last September's
Hurricane Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Children's Health Bill Proposed  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican Bill Frist, the only physician in
the Senate, has joined Democratic colleague Edward M. Kennedy, a
longtime health care advocate, in offering a bill to expand federal
spending on children's health.
</P>
<P>
   The bill calls for spending about $1 billion on research and
education initiatives to prevent various illnesses and injuries.
Frist said the measure, similar to legislation approved by the
House in May, should pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does affect every single family,'' said Frist, of
Tennessee. ''There aren't going to be many United States senators
that are going to want to get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes new grants to identify ways to
prevent head injuries, which affect approximately 1.5 million U.S.
children each year. New grants would be provided to states to
improve the health and safety of children in day care settings.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would:
</P>
<P>
   --Give money to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
set up a new department to collect and distribute data on birth
defects.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish a national folic acid education program. Scientists
say birth defects can be prevented if women of childbearing age
consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily.
</P>
<P>
   --Increase funding for studies and prevention programs that
address autism, asthma, childhood obesity, lead poisoning and oral
health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coordinated attention in all of these areas can lead to
significant benefits for all children,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Another co-sponsor, Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., said the bill's
success ''will be measured not only in the number of children we
help, but also in the number of children that avoid serious health
problems later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   A World Health Organization study released in June found that
the United States spends more per person on health care than any
other in the world, yet ranks 37th in the overall quality of care
provided. It was the first attempt to compare the world's health
systems.

<HEADLINE> Rivals Laud Tour Leader Armstrong  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARPENTRAS, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong's rivals give the
impression that the Tour de France is already won, 11 days and
1,100 miles from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   The American leads the three-week race by 4 minutes, 14 seconds
after 11 stages and his stunning performance in the mountains that
earned him the leader's yellow jersey seems to have knocked the
confidence out of the race's other top riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armstrong is on another planet,'' 1998 Tour winner Marco
Pantani said. ''He pushed me to the limit when I wanted to follow
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Jan Ullrich is seen by Armstrong's U.S Postal Service
team as his main challenger, but even the 1997 Tour winner's own
teammates on Deutsche Telekom don't hope for any more than a
second-placed finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''For our team, it has been a really good Tour de France,'' said
Erik Zabel, one of Telekom's top riders. ''Ullrich is doing well to
be second and we are happy. We are four minutes behind, but
Armstrong is a great champion and is really impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich said that he ''didn't have the force to stay with
Armstrong,'' on the mountain route at Lourdes-Hautacam on Monday.
''I am still trying to find my rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Tour began, Armstrong has been incredibly focused on
his goal of retaining the Tour championship he won last year after
recovering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other top riders casually chat with fans and the media before
each stage. The 28-year-old Texan waits until the very last second
to leave U.S. Postal's trailer, ignores the autograph hunters and
heads for the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Many European cycling fans were skeptical about Armstrong's
success in 1999, when the field was weakened in the absence of
previous champions Pantani and Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong has seen the 2000 Tour go according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   He preserved his energy until the 10th stage, when a stunning
climb to Lourdes-Hautacam saw him storm past Pantani, Ullrich and
Alex Zulle to take the yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was enjoying a rest day Wednesday and preparing to
climb what he calls a ''mystical'' mountain in the next stage of
the famed race.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour's 12th leg, a 93-mile course from Carpentras to Mont
Ventoux, is perhaps the most eagerly awaited of the three-week
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Team managers say the rider who emerges as leader at Ventoux, 62
miles north of Marseille, will be wearing the yellow jersey on the
final dash along the Champs Elysees on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is under no illusions about the challenge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the hardest climb of this year's Tour,'' he said. ''It
is very special, very mystical. It is so hard that if you are good
you can make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's climb will be unforgiving. Just 14 miles from the
finish line, riders are only 1,000 feet above sea level; by the
end, they are at an altitude of almost 6,300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong insists that he doesn't have a specific strategy for
the ascent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might have to improvise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mont Ventoux's special place in Tour history adds spice to
Armstrong's quest.
</P>
<P>
   The peak has witnessed some of the 97-year-old race's greatest
climbing -- and one of its greatest tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, British cyclist Tom Simpson, roared on by fans under a
burning sun, collapsed and died near the peak. Tests found his
blood contained amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   A keen student of the sport's history, Armstrong is awaiting the
special stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have heard the stories of Ventoux. I know about how Tom
Simpson lost his life there, and have been there many times in
training,'' Armstrong said. ''The place doesn't look like anything
else. It looks more like the moon than the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strangest thing is that it feels different than other
climbs at 1,900 meters. There is no air, perhaps because there is
no vegetation. It is a strange place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mont Ventoux was no doubt a subject of conversation as the U.S.
Postal team drove 3&AMP;frac12; hours east from the Pyrenees early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team spent the day resting, but still found time for a
gentle 2&AMP;frac12;-hour road session around Carpentras.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Suit Ban Provokes Grievance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A swimsuit manufacturer plans to
file a grievance with the U.S. Olympic Committee over the ban of
high-tech bodysuits in the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Tyr Sport of Huntington Beach sent a letter to the USOC
inquiring about the process of filing a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we have not received a grievance or a formal
complaint from Tyr or any other athletes,'' Darryl Seibel, USOC
associate director of media and public relations, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Wilmoth, public relations manager at Tyr, said the company
planned to file a detailed grievance late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a review by the USOC, if both parties cannot come to a
resolution within 48 hours, there would be a hearing before the
American Arbitration Association no later than July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will put on documentary evidence and witnesses on why the
ban should be reversed,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyr Sport wants USA Swimming to allow the suits in the Olympic
trials Aug. 9-16 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming's board of directors voted 16-3 on June 22 not to allow
use of the suits because it felt they were not readily available to
all of the 1,300 swimmers qualified for the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Swimmers have already qualified for the U.S. trials in this
suit and they can wear it at the Olympics, so why can't we showcase
this at the trials?'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tyr Sport will have ''well over 2,000 suits'' produced
for swimmers to use at the trials if the ban is overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the three other leading manufacturers -- adidas, Nike
and Speedo -- have no plans to protest the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The revolutionary suits, credited in part for the recent spate
of world records, will be allowed in the Olympics and all other
meets.

<HEADLINE> It's Back to Business for Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams would love to
visit Turner Field later this year. So would David Wells and Carlos
Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, Andres Galarraga and Tom Glavine would welcome
them.
</P>
<P>
   Once their All-Star fun was over, players began to focus on
another topic Wednesday: What's on tap for the second half?
</P>
<P>
   Probably pennant races for the surprising Chicago White Sox and
improved St. Louis Cardinals, and home run chases by Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa. And surely lots of rumors as the July 31 trading
deadline approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday produced two trades with direct impact on pennant
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees sent four minor leaguers to Cincinnati for
Denny Neagle, the Reds' best starter and one of the top pitchers on
the market. The left-hander with the $4.75 million contract is a
free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves traded for right-hander Andy Ashby, sending
former top pitching prospect Bruce Chen and minor league pitcher
Jimmy Osting to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and the hometown Braves hope this season means holding off
the New York Mets in the NL East and making a ninth straight trip
to the NL championship series. Maybe even a repeat matchup with the
Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Braves and Yankees come out of the break in first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the lead right now. Hopefully we can stay there for
75 more games and give ourselves another opportunity to get
there,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be fine with Jeter and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time champions would like a chance to win their fourth
crown in five years. And if it means returning to Atlanta, that's
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been fortunate here. We played some big games,'' Jeter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter did it again Tuesday night, getting three hits as the
American League beat the Nationals 6-3. He became the first Yankees
player to be MVP of the All-Star game, although the award was not
handed out until 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, leading the majors with 15 wins, is trying to pitch
Toronto into postseason play for the first time since 1993. The
Blue Jays begin the second half only three percentage points behind
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Yankees are right there, we're right there. There's a
couple of teams that are close, and I think that the best pitching
wins,'' he said. ''I think with the young staff that we have, these
guys don't know what they have yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it. It's a matter of these guys putting it together,
because they have tremendous arms. This could be a good year for
Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox also are close in the AL East, and they
should get a boost when ace Pedro Martinez returns from the
disabled list. He's scheduled to pitch Thursday night when Mike
Piazza and the Mets visit Fenway Park to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, sidelined by an injured muscle in his side, and
Piazza, out with a concussion after being beaned by Roger Clemens,
were among several top names missing at the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Minus seven elected starters, the game was a bit short on star
power -- and power, period. In a year full of flying baseballs,
Jones hit the only home run -- there were seven foul popups for
outs, however.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez could not start at shortstop for the AL because
of a concussion and an injured knee. He's expected to miss at least
the rest of the week for the AL West-leading Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was out because of tendinitis in his knee. The St. Louis
slugger leads the majors with 30 home runs, while Sosa, now saying
he wants to remain with the Chicago Cubs, is at 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to go out there and try to finish strong,'' Sosa
said. ''You have to understand that in the first half, I was kind
of like really, really not happy. But I believe now that I'm
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who won the All-Star home run derby, still has to pass Ken
Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds. Both have 28 homers, and neither felt
well enough to play Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The final week of interleague play this season starts Thursday
and features a matchup of first-place teams that hold the biggest
division leads -- Cardinals-White Sox at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Players on those two teams got to see plenty of each other at
Turner Field, even though winning pitcher James Baldwin did not
face Jim Edmonds, whose over-the-shoulder catch in center field was
the play of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Magglio Ordonez hit a double off Darryl Kile, while
St. Louis' Edgar Renteria grounded into a game-ending double play
turned by second baseman Ray Durham.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge clears way for sex offender notifications to resume  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A federal appeals judge in Philadelphia has
given state authorities the green light to resume warning neighbors
about sex offenders who live nearby and who might pose a risk of
committing new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on Wednesday set aside an April court order freezing all
Megan's Law notifications until a dispute over how these
notifications were being conducted could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Barry and two other federal judges heard arguments in the case
Wednesday, then she promptly ruled the notifications could resume
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am gratified that this afternoon the court granted our
motion to lift the stay,'' Attorney General John Farmer said late
Wednesday. ''My office will notify the 21 county prosecutors today
that they can restart the notification process.''
</P>
<P>
   While the move is no official indication of how the federal
panel will ultimately rule on Megan's Law, it suggests that at
least a majority is comfortable that the guidelines presented by
Farmer will be adequate to prevent illegal leaks of sex-offender
information to residents who are not supposed to be getting it.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Megan's Law requires sex offenders, whether they
are coming out of prison or moving to a new home, to register with
authorities. Officials then evaluate the level of risk they pose.
Based on this evaluation, which is reviewed by a state judge,
limited notifications are made to area schools and daycare centers,
or of all neighbors in a carefully defined community.
</P>
<P>
   If a person receives notification that a sex offender is living
or working nearby, they are under a court order not to tell anyone
else or circulate the information in any way. Violating this
requirement subjects a person to contempt of court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys with the state Public Defender's office in their
latest lawsuit on behalf of sex offenders said these
confidentiality rules were being routinely ignored, and that the 21
counties had scattershot procedures on how to enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Defender's office also complained that the warnings
being given to residents to keep the information quiet were
inconsistent from county to county, with many counties issuing no
warnings at all.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas agreed last year and ordered
Farmer to impose tighter, more consistent rules statewide. In
April, Irenas ruled that Farmer's updated regulations were adequate
to protect the security of the sex offender information.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for sex offenders promptly appealed, and federal
Appellate Judge Dolores Sloviter issued the order to freeze
sex-offender notifications while the appellate court had a chance
to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Sloviter was not among the judges who heard oral arguments
Wednesday shortly before Barry's decision to lift the three-month
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and Gov. Christie Whitman in June approved a
change in the New Jersey Constitution to clear the way for listing
sex offender information on the Internet, and providing published
registers in the mail for those who request it. The amendment must
be approved by the voters in November and if they do so, the
Internet program will certainly lead to a new round of legal
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the question currently before the federal court is much
narrower, focusing on the question of the right of all residents,
including sex offenders, to have some privacy protection of their
home addresses against unlimited dissemination by government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems technical, the dispute touches on the larger
question of whether sex offender notifications under Megan's Law
can ever be implemented within the confines imposed by state and
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Under Farmer's new guidelines, residents who do not consent to
the confidentiality rules are still given some information about
sex offenders, such as the street or apartment building where they
live, but are not given a specific address.
</P>
<P>
   Public Defender Ed Barocas, who argued in federal court
Wednesday, said this was still too much of an intrusion since such
residents could easily discover the specific address, or could seek
out the sex offender according to his photo.
</P>
<P>
   But Farmer argued that this limitation was reasonable. ''I
reiterated to the court that the (freeze) was unwarranted given two
factors: The extra protections against improper disclosure that the
state's revised guidelines provide, and more importantly the
compelling state interest in continuing to provide community
notification to protect those at risk.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect acquitted in robbery of delivery man later found dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn man was cleared Wednesday of charges
he robbed a Domino's pizza delivery man whose decapitated body
turned up shortly before he was to testify against the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   A jury deliberated one day in state Supreme Court before
acquitting David Trumpet of robbery, larceny and weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpet, 32, remains a suspect in the grisly slaying of the
delivery man, Kelly Marcelus. Although Trumpet has not been charged
with the murder, authorities believe he may have killed Marcelus to
keep him from being a key witness at the robbery trial.
</P>
<P>
   On April 15 - with jury selection underway and Trumpet out on
bail - Marcelus vanished. Two days later, a fisherman found a
plastic bag along a Queens shore containing the victim's head. His
battered and burned body was discovered nearby in an abandoned car.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was postponed until this month. Jurors in the robbery
case were told that the victim had died, but not about the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A Domino's manager testified that Marcelus told him Trumpet
robbed him at gunpoint when he tried to deliver a pizza to
Trumpet's Brooklyn home. Before the alleged holdup, Trumpet had
called Domino's several times to complain about his order, the
manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Gliatta refused to discuss the
verdict. Trumpet's attorney did not immediately return calls
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Greene Ready for Michael Johnson  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Maurice Greene was admittedly nervous,
like a boxer before his first title fight.
</P>
<P>
   For Greene, his championship opponents will be the other
sprinters in the U.S. Olympic Trials, particularly Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The meet begins Friday at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium,
with the 100-meter final scheduled for Saturday. The 200 final,
where Greene will face Johnson barring any mishaps in the earlier
rounds, is set for July 23, the final day of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who entered a news conference Wednesday with his usual
jaunty bounce and bravado, said he was more concerned about the 100
because of its immediacy and would worry about Johnson later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting very edgy, very anxious, trying to stay as calm as
possible,'' Greene said, slowly drawing out his words to emphasize
that he was not really calm.
</P>
<P>
   Greene the world-record holder and two-time world champion in
the 100, is heavily favored to win the event in the trials and the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to come home with a gold medal would be devastating for
the confident Greene.
</P>
<P>
   ''My career would be void ... it would be nothing ... if I don't
get an Olympic gold medal,'' he said. ''It's the biggest meet of my
life. Nothing compares to this, not even the world championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Greene was 21 and still a neophyte under
the tutelage of sprint guru John Smith, he failed to get through
the quarterfinals of the trials, finishing seventh in his heat.
</P>
<P>
   For the Olympic Games, he drove about 18 hours from his home in
Kansas City, Kan., to Atlanta. During the 100 final, he sat in the
stands and cried uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told myself I would never let this happen again without
me,'' Greene said. ''The U.S. not getting the gold medal (won by
Canada's Donovan Bailey) ... I knew we were better athletes than we
had shown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the world champion and the world-record holder, but I need
to get the gold medal to feel complete. I want to be the best
sprinter ever, and if I don't get the gold, I can't say that I'm
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene wants to win the gold not only for himself and his
family, but for Smith, the world-record holder at 440 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's missing an Olympic gold medal,'' Greene said. ''He has a
big hole in his heart. If I win a gold, hopefully I can fill that
hole a little. He has never said anything to me about getting a
gold medal. But he's my coach and he was an athlete. I know he
would get great joy out of seeing me win one.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greene is the favorite for Olympic gold in the 100,
Johnson, the Olympic champion and world-record holder, has that
distinction in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the two is frosty, to say the least.
Greene has been bragging about how he is going to beat Johnson
while Johnson has called Greene ''immature'' and ''disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said I was immature?'' Greene said. ''He didn't back it up.
He's older (32 to 25) than I am. He should be more mature. Maturity
comes with age.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said I didn't respect him? I respect him totally, but I'm
not going to bow down to him. I wasn't in those races when he ran
his world records (in the 200 and 400). He's run a lot of great
times, but he hasn't run them against me.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it takes 19.33 (seconds) to win, I'll run that time. But
I'm not thinking about the 200 yet. I have to run the 100 first.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene also pointed out that he and Johnson come from different
backgrounds, different environments and different upbringings,
accounting for their different personalities and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The two have met twice in the 200 and each has won once. Both
races were in the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., with Johnson
winning in 1997 and Greene in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still learning the 200, but I'm able to step up to the
competition,'' said Greene, who has been running the 200 for only
three years -- 10 fewer than Johnson. ''I back down to no
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Before getting to Sydney, Greene must make it through the
trials, a task he is focusing on deeply and with some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I go through my career and don't make the Olympic team, my
career will be missing something,'' he said. ''It's something I
want so badly. Nothing comes before this.''

<HEADLINE> Skippy, Hellmann's maker Bestfoods reports 10 percent jump in profits </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Higher sales fueled by recent acquisitions,
plus double-digit operating income increases in most divisions,
helped Skippy peanut butter maker Bestfoods boost profits 10
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The international food company, in the process of being acquired
by Dutch consumer goods conglomerate Unilever for $20.3 billion, on
Wednesday reported that operating income for the April-June quarter
rose to $366 million from $333 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Net income, excluding merger-related expenses of $30 million
after taxes, rose 9.7 percent to $193 million, or 68 cents per
share, matching expectations of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thompson Financial. A year ago, Bestfoods reported net income
of $176 million, or 61 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Including the $30 million merger bill, net income fell 7.4
percent to $163 million and earnings per share dipped 6.6 percent
to 57 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, sales edged up 2.5 percent to $2.21 billion from
$2.15 billion. While sales jumped 29.4 percent in Latin America and
10.8 percent in Asia, currency fluctuations helped push sales down
6.9 percent in the company's biggest division, which includes
Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a good quarter for Bestfoods, particularly in light
of the significant impact unfavorable European currency rates had
on our reported sales and earnings,'' said C.R. Shoemate, chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Food industry analyst Mitchell Pinheiro of Janney Montgomery
Scott agreed, noting that despite the Euro's low value recently,
Bestfoods' operating income for that division fell only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dealing with foreign currency fluctuations (has) been one of
their hallmarks,'' Pinheiro said. ''That's one of the reasons they
(are being) acquired, because they've consistently delivered
double-digit earnings growth despite whatever problems are going on
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods said sales volumes rose 7.4 percent, with about
two-thirds of that increase due to recent acquisitions and every
division reporting volume gains. Meanwhile, profit margins improved
throughout the company, particularly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The baking division saw a 24.6 percent increase in operating
income, marking the 11th straight quarter with double-digit
earnings growth. The company cited volume gains for Thomas' bagels
and English muffins, premium bread brands such as Arnold, and
Entenmann's sweet baked goods, which benefited from a national
television ad campaign featuring celebrities such as Carol Burnett,
Yogi Berra and Kristi Yamaguchi.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Bestfoods reported a 29 percent increase in
sales, due to currency fluctuations and acquisitions of an
Argentine dressings business and a Brazilian food company that
makes everything from soup to desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Also, foodservice volumes - sales of condiments, custom-made
products and other foods to restaurants, airlines and institutions
- were up significantly in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months, net income excluding the merger costs
rose 10 percent, to $353 million or $1.24 per share, from $320
million or $1.10 per share a year ago. Sales crept up 1.7 percent,
to $4.43 billion from $4.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest U.S. food companies with operations in more
than 60 countries and products sold in 110 countries, Bestfoods
sells many well-known grocery brands, including Hellmann's, Mazola,
Knorr, Boboli, Brownberry and Mueller's.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bestfoods and Unilever announced an agreement under
which Unilever will acquire all outstanding Bestfoods stock for $73
per share in cash. The transaction, awaiting approval from both
companies' shareholders and from U.S. and European Union
regulators, is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have annual sales of more than $50
billion.

<HEADLINE> Activists say assault charges out of line after raid on alleged sex club </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - Two detectives working the night shift in a small
mill town in southeastern Massachusetts had a simple assignment:
Check out a report of guitars stolen from a downtown building.
</P>
<P>
   But what they allegedly found Saturday night behind one closed
door was far beyond routine: a sadomasochistic sex party involving
dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, civil liberties activists are criticizing the police in the
city of Attleboro for bringing assault charges against a woman who
allegedly hit another woman in the buttocks with a wooden paddle.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who has handled similar cases says Massachusetts law
may allow police to bring a charge of assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon even when the assaulted person consents - but the
law is ripe for a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you take the sex out of it, what is the difference between
this and boxing and other dangerous activities that people engage
in all the time?'' said attorney John Ward of Boston and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The two detectives came upon the party on Saturday night in a
building not far from the police station in this city of about
40,000 people about 41 miles south of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were 50 to 60 people in the former factory
building in various stages of undress. Police said they believe the
group was participating in ''sadomasochistic activity'' and were
paying a fee to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Whips, chains, paddles, a leather glove with tacks, and other
types of paraphernalia were seized.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were arrested: Benjamin Davis, 23, of Hudson, N.H.,
and Stefany L. Reed, 38, of New York City, who faced the most
serious charge: assault and battery with a dangerous weapon for
allegedly hitting another woman in the buttocks with a wooden
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   Both pleaded innocent Monday in Attleboro District Court and are
free on $1,000 cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that a 1980 state Supreme Judicial Court case has
established the legal precedent that people cannot consent to being
assaulted in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, the arrests were legal,'' Detective Sgt. Kenneth Collins
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Bristol district
attorney, said the office would be taking a look at the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always ready, willing and able to listen to counsel,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no phone listing for Davis in Hudson, N.H. His lawyer
for the arraignment, Richard Leonard of Reading, Mass., didn't
immediately return a message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's lawyer, Bruce Gladstone of Providence, R.I., proclaimed
her innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I can state is that this is a complete misidentification,
that the statements in the police affidavit as to what this
detective allegedly saw my client involved in are absolutely
false,'' Gladstone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client is traumatized obviously and is an innocent victim.
It's a miscarriage of justice. It's a misidentification,'' he said.
''My client is a victim of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Reed was doing at the party, Gladstone said, ''This
was simply a private party. I will leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties activists have stepped forward to say that
whatever happened at the party was strictly private business of the
individuals there and is protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults
is constitutionally protected activity - or should be,'' said Sarah
Wunsch, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't the Attleboro police have anything better to do? ...
This is like returning to the days of Puritan Boston,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Ward, who handled the 1980 case relied upon by police,
Commonwealth v. Appleby, said he believed the 20-year-old ruling
was now ripe for reconsideration by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Ward represented Kenneth Appleby, who was charged with
bullwhipping another man. Appleby was convicted of assault and
battery in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''For millions of Americans now, this is common accepted
behavior. ... I think the real issue is whether you can police
people's private lives simply because their activities are
bizarre,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Chateauvert, a spokesman for the National Coalition for
Sexual Freedom, said that most states outlaw sadomasochistic
behavior, either through the application of assault and battery
laws or through laws specifically against sadomasochism.
</P>
<P>
   A few, she said, ''recognize that this is not something for the
state deal with. It's an issue of sexual privacy.''

<HEADLINE> Manager Admits Having Trevi Child  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The jailed manager of Mexican pop star Gloria
Trevi denied accusations that he ran a sexually abusive harem of
young would-be singers, but conceded he had a child with Trevi, and
probably another with a teen-age backup singer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a good person, but I don't want to be labeled a
monster either,'' Sergio Andrade said in an interview taped last
week by the Spanish-language television network Univision. Excerpts
were aired Wednesday in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade and Trevi have been jailed since their Jan. 13 arrest in
Brazil, and are awaiting extradition to Mexico to face charges of
abduction and statutory rape lodged after teen-age proteges said
Andrade sexually abused them.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade admitted he began having sex with backup singer Karina
Yapor when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Yapor's abandonment of her baby in a Spanish orphanage prompted
criminal investigations into the case, and she has said Trevi led a
band of female supporters bound by ''blind submission'' to the
paunchy, middle-aged manager and guru.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade appeared thinner, but confident and unapologetic in the
interview at the Brasilia prison where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gloria and I had a baby ... unfortunately it died after a
month,'' Andrade said, claiming it had been Trevi's decision to
keep the birth a secret.
</P>
<P>
   He also said ''I understand that I did'' have a baby with Yapor,
but that she abandoned it without his knowledge. At Trevi's urging,
Yapor, at age 12, was handed over by her parents to Andrade's care
so that she could be given musical training.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Yapor's parents charge, Andrade gathered her and other
young girls to have sex with him. Yapor had the child at 14,
Mexico's age of consent.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi rose to fame in the late 1980s with an image of sexual
independence and social criticism. She spoke of someday running for
president and released a series of nude calendars that poked fun at
Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of independence, Trevi allegedly was involved in a
strange, submissive relationship. Yapor has quoted Andrade as
saying ''if one of us led the police to him, or they found us, he
would commit suicide along with any of the girls who wanted to do
it with him.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Given that we all had a blind submission to him, there was
nobody who said they wouldn't do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi, who denies the charges, declined Univision's requests for
an interview, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was never my intention to form a sect. I'm not Rasputin ...
I'm a sensitive person who also likes beauty,'' Andrade said. Of
his complex relationship with Trevi, he said ''she was like a
friend, a sister, a daughter, a companion and a lover.''

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists, lawmakers decry new water rules  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Environmentalists have long believed that
Gov. Christie Whitman says one thing and does another.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of her new water regulations, a majority of state
lawmakers agree.
</P>
<P>
   While Whitman has said she wants to step up the battle against
sprawl, her critics say her new regulations will promote
overdevelopment and threaten the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-four lawmakers signed a letter to the governor
protesting the proposed rule. They want it changed to remove
exemptions they say will ruin the remaining rural character of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't have smart growth with a dumb rule,'' said Jeff
Tittel of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   But the Whitman Administration defends the rule as a common
sense way to steer development toward areas that can handle it, and
away from more sensitive parcels.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to the environmentalists, is the land in
between the two extremes: sections of suburban communities like
Clinton Township in Hunterdon County and Lacey Township in Ocean
County that maps show are within long-planned sewer areas but where
the pipes were never actually installed.
</P>
<P>
   Such in-between areas are included in the 300,000 acres that the
state Department of Environmental Protection wants to exempt from
tough new water rules that control run-off and sewage discharge.
Elsewhere, developers would have to jump through many new
environmental hoops to win building approval under the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule will pave the way for development in places
where it still doesn't belong, such as a 952-housing development in
Clinton Township and a 1,500 unit development in Lacy Township,
according to Tittel.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists aren't looking for a complete development
moratorium in these areas, just environmental assessments when
needed. For example, developers should have to justify new projects
if they are located near endangered species habitat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not every area that is grandfathered needs protection,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Peter Page Wednesday said the critics must
recognize that some development must be allowed to accommodate
natural growth in the state. The new rules reflect the reality that
more people need more houses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is, we're living in boom times and we have
competing pressure: A public that is increasingly upset about
traffic congestion and sprawl and, at the same time, a demand for
housing that is greater in undeveloped areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the areas of the state where the tougher rules won't
apply, developers will still have to assure the state that their
projects will not degrade area water quality, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, said the new rule
does not go far enough. Hence, the letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an overwhelming and bipartisan demonstration of the
commitment of the Legislature to strong environmental concerns,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman Administration officials Wednesday didn't quite know
what to make of the scope of legislative objection. There are 120
lawmakers, so more than half signed the objection to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor said lawmakers' concerns will be taken into
account as part of a larger public comment period on the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Page said regulating water quality is almost a no-win
proposition when it comes to the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern of the department is that the Legislature would
take us to task for making a rule that's too strict. But now a
majority is saying the rule is too weak. We haven't quite sorted
out what that means yet,'' Page said.

<HEADLINE> Struggle for Progress at Camp David  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton struggled to push Israel
and the Palestinians toward a settlement of their half-century
conflict at a summit that was turning out to be difficult, as all
sides had feared. Still, the White House said Wednesday that there
had been ''real engagement'' on substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   Redoubling his efforts, Clinton made plans to remain overnight
after what he hoped would be a productive dinner with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was wrestling
with all the central issues. These include Jerusalem's future,
claims by 2 million Palestinian refugees to homes in Israel, the
status of some 195,000 Jewish residents on West Bank land Arafat
insists belong to the Palestinians and his aspirations for a state.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met separately with Clinton at Camp David. They
have not met face-to-face since the talks began Tuesday at the
secluded presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart described Clinton's role as that of ''an honest broker,
a facilitator.'' At the same time, Lockhart again made no claim of
progress toward the agreement the two sides are committed to
conclude by Sept. 13. But he cautioned reporters ''nothing should
be read into that one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dialogue was going on quietly at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a busy day between all the parties and there's been
real engagement today dealing with the substantive issues that
define what the parties need to agree on in order to reach an
overall agreement,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with members of the
Israeli and Palestinian delegations around a round table.
Separately, Clinton talked with Barak and then with Arafat. And
Dennis B. Ross, the senior U.S. mediator, also met with Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators had agreed in principle to a land swap, the
first acknowledgment that such an exchange could be part of the
final status deal being negotiated at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, who is close to Barak, said Palestinian negotiators
accepted a plan where large settlement blocs in the West Bank were
annexed to Israel in exchange for symbolic amounts of land inside
Israel which are uninhabited by Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The White House refused to confirm the report. Lockhart refused
to say if any progress had been made, but said nothing should be
read into his lack of comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went into this knowing it would be a struggle; we have not
been disappointed by that,'' Lockhart said after the president met
again with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just something that I think will continue from now
until we pick up and leave here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart used the word ''difficult'' four times and the word
''struggle'' three times in six sentences about the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Respecting the news blackout all parties accepted at the start,
Lockhart declined to go into any detail about what, if anything,
the talks that began Tuesday had achieved.
</P>
<P>
   While the atmosphere of the Camp David summit with Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was described as good, Lockhart
spoke in somber terms of the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian participants also were observing the
code of silence imposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tentatively plans to wind up his hands-on mediation on
July 19. But he also has said there was no ''artificial deadline''
to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The president also was expected to leave for part of Thursday,
addressing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's convention in Baltimore and a Congressional Medal of Honor
ceremony in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are working in a very serious way,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton found time to watch the final innings of the
All-Star baseball game on television with his daughter, Chelsea, in
his comfortable cabin, and took his dog, Buddy, for a walk
Wednesday morning before meeting with advisers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lockhart said, ''There are meetings going on,
both formal and informal, all over the place. ... There's a certain
informality out there that's adding to the contact.''
</P>
<P>
   On one front, at least, Clinton had success: Barak said Israel
was canceling the $250 million sale of an advanced airborne radar
system to China, as the administration and some members of Congress
had sought, citing security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said the decision was intended
to improve prospects for summit success. Israel, he said, needed to
preserve its ''intimate relations'' with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the news black at Camp David, outside the Maryland
mountain retreat representatives from both camps were speaking
freely.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Ashrawi said Wednesday on CNN that
Israel was ignoring the plight of Palestinian refugees. ''Shirking
responsibility is not a good way to start (the summit),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Cabinet minister Yuli Tamir repeated Israel's rejection
of Palestinian demands to establish a capital in the traditionally
Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be no division of sovereignty over Jerusalem,''
Tamir, the minister of immigration and absorption, said on CNN.
''Jerusalem will never be divided.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Meets With Mississippi Family  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials met Wednesday
with the family of Raynard Johnson, a black teen-ager who was found
hanged near his home in Kokomo, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno attended part of the meeting, along
with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder and Bill Lann Lee, acting
assistant attorney general for civil rights. The family was
accompanied by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who sought a
federal investigation into Johnson's death.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Holder offered few details of the session. ''It was
an informative meeting about a very tragic incident,'' he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said the FBI, along with federal prosecutors and the
Justice Department's civil rights division, were ''actively
investigating this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 17, was found hanging from a pecan tree just yards from
the front door of his rural home on June 16. Officials said autopsy
findings were consistent with suicide; Johnson's family disputes
that.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has said he believes Johnson's death was motivated by
the fact that Johnson and his brother were friends with two
17-year-old white girls. Jackson has set up a $10,000 reward and
toll-free tip line to encourage more leads in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As Wednesday's meeting took place, President Clinton sent a
letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., urging the House to
act on hate crimes legislation before its summer recess. ''It is a
national concern requiring a national response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not mention Johnson's death. He did cite several
high-profile killings motivated by hate over the past two years,
and said four hate-driven mass shootings -- two in Pennsylvania
alone -- were evidence of the need for stronger federal enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''These acts of violence affect entire communities, not just the
individual victims,'' Clinton said. ''We must send a message that
hate crimes will not be tolerated, and that one more hate crime is
one too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the Senate's action last month to add the hate
crimes proposal to a defense bill. ''Now is the time for the House
to do its part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes legislation, first proposed in 1997, is in
limbo, bogged down in election-year politics. Vice President Al
Gore was on hand for the Senate vote in case he was needed to break
a tie; Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., had the Senate
set aside the defense bill shortly after the hate crimes provision
was added. Democrats have pledged to keep the issue alive during
this election season.
</P>
<P>
   The hate crimes legislation would add offenses motivated by
sexual orientation, gender or disability to the list of hate crimes
already covered under a 1968 federal law. It also would give
federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a hate crime case if
local authorities refused to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The defense bill is S. 2549

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Volcano Erupts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's Pichincha volcano spewed ash
five miles into the sky Wednesday, but strong westerly winds
carried the volcanic material away from the capital, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption collapsed a portion of the volcano's crater, said
Hugo Yepez, director of Ecuador's Geophysical Institute. The
volcano is about 8 miles west of Quito.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Pichincha awoke from 339 years of dormancy, and since
October has registered a series of large and small eruptions,
several of which have blanketing the city with silty, gray ash.
Scientists say they do not expect the volcano to expel lava.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption Wednesday was not visible from Quito because of
cloudy conditions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Blasted for Waterways Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers and environmental groups
blasted the Clinton administration Wednesday for backing a proposed
change in federal rules they say will allow more pollution in the
country's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the move is meant to benefit the coal mining
industry and appease West Virginia's powerful Sen. Robert Byrd, who
has fought to allow mining companies to dump sediment into rivers
and streams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to stand by and let this happen. If we allow
it to happen, we are negating our environmental laws,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays said at a news conference with fellow Connecticut
Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson; New York Reps. Ben Gilman and Rick
Lazio; and California Rep. Brian Bilbray.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers want the Environmental Protection Agency and Army
Corps of Engineers to drop plans to write a new definition of
''fill'' -- material shoveled into waterways to create solid ground.
The idea is open to public comment until next Wednesday, after
which the heads of the EPA and Army Corps will issue a rule.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism comes a day after the EPA -- over the objections of
Republicans -- issued rules requiring states to examine more than
20,000 lakes, streams and other waterways, establish which ones are
most polluted and develop a cleanup program to meet federal water
quality standards. The new cleanup requirements eventually could
cost farmers, businesses and other polluters billions of dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Water Act specifically prohibits using waste as fill,
but the new definition will effectively erase that ban, the
lawmakers said. The Army Corps is the agency that grants fill
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's illegal to use waste as fill, and they're trying to get
around that by changing the rules,'' said Joan Mulhern, a lawyer
with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   W. Michael McCabe, the EPA's acting deputy administrator, said
the lawmakers and environmentalists were distorting the agency's
attempts to strengthen safeguards for waterways.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposal would make it more difficult for polluters
to dump waste in the water, though he did not say how.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change stems from a West Virginia U.S. District
Court judge's ruling last year that coal mining companies were
violating the Clean Water Act by dumping waste into waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The decision said coal companies could not dump rock and dirt
within 100 feet of perennial streams, which flow year-round, and
intermittent streams, which flow at least six months a year. It
said ephemeral streams, those that flow as a result of snow melt or
rain, could be buried by the waste, a practice called valley fills.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee,
tried to attach a measure to a federal spending plan in November
that would have legislatively overturned the court ruling. The
effort ended when Clinton said he would veto the bill if the mining
amendment was tied to it.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the Clinton administration is trying to
appease Byrd with the proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a flip-flop,'' said Brent Blackwelder, president of
the environmental group Friends of the Earth. ''It's giving with
one hand and taking with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray called the proposal ''absolutely absurd,'' and slammed
Byrd for trying to ''move the Clean Water Act to ancient history
when pollutants were not only allowed, they were encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman from Byrd's office did not return phone calls.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader May Be Prosecuted  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under a new United Nations resolution, rebel
leader Foday Sankoh may be prosecuted for human rights abuses in
Sierra Leone, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke briefed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the
U.S.-drafted resolution, which would establish a ''special court''
that would have jurisdiction over crimes under Sierra Leone law as
well as international humanitarian law and international human
rights law.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats at the United Nations have said that could mean a
hybrid court that has both international and Sierra Leonean judges
and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not seek to create a third international war crimes
tribunal, but we do believe that those accused should be tried
under a system that is part of the international war crimes
structure,'' he said. ''We are under no illusions that success in
any of these operations will easy and quick. These conflicts have
been long and bloody and brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke urged the senators to oppose a House effort to cut
U.S. contributions for U.N. peacekeeping by a one-third, citing
volatile tensions in Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we expect the U.N. to get peacekeeping right in Africa and
elsewhere, we cannot tie one hand behind its back,'' he said.
''Capping U.N. peacekeeping at $498 million ignores the fact that
demands for peacekeeping funding are growing, not shrinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels reignited Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war and
advanced to within 25 miles of the capital in May. Since then,
pro-government troops have recaptured some rebel-held towns and
U.N. peacekeepers have won the release of about 500 of their troops
kidnapped by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In two days, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering will lead
a weeklong mission to West Africa. He will meet with African
leaders in Abuja, Accra, Freetown and Bamako to discuss the extent
of potential U.S. assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an extremely important mission, one that will lay the
groundwork for President Clinton's visit to Nigeria next month,''
Holbrooke said.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Sen. Ends Forest Fight  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a major victory for environmentalists,
Idaho Sen. Larry Craig dropped plans to try to halt President
Clinton's proposal for protecting 43 million acres of roadless
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he had the votes to pass his amendment, but withdrew
it to allow the courts to decide whether the Clinton administration
violated open meeting laws by discussing the initiative with
environmentalists before it was announced. There are two pending
court cases -- one in Idaho and the one in Washington -- on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Several interests asked me not to jeopardize the court
activity,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lyons, the Agriculture Department undersecretary who
oversees the Forest Service, said he believes Craig bowed to
political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Craig knows there's tremendous popular support for the
(roadless) proposal,'' Lyons said. ''Senator Craig is on the wrong
side of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is trying to use administrative rulemaking to prevent
road building and other development on more than one-fifth of all
federal forests. His draft plan, announced in May, sets broad
criteria for logging, grazing and recreational activities, and
leaves it up to local foresters to decide whether roads should be
banned on parcels of 5,000 acres or less.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists call the effort a crowning achievement of the
Clinton presidency and one of the most important conservation moves
of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is making a decision on what to do with the last
undeveloped, unroaded wild forest land in this country. It is a
very, very big conservation initiative,'' said Debbie Sease,
legislative director for the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   But Western Republicans, timber companies and recreation
interests say the move would unfairly limit access to public lands
and hurt local economies. They denounce the rulemaking as an end
run around Congress, since the plan can be implemented without
lawmakers' approval.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's proposal would have delayed Clinton's plan until after a
panel reviewed the effort and made recommendations to improve it.
Environmentalists said Craig was trying to put off the plan until
Clinton leaves office, with the hope that Republican George W. Bush
is elected and scraps the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Craig initially offered the amendment on the Senate floor to a
$15.5 billion Interior Department appropriations bill, calling the
roadless plan the ''most slipshod rulemaking effort that I've seen
and the worst example in the last 20 years by any federally elected
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig then allowed Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to replace
the amendment with a less controversial proposal to reduce fire
risk near fast-growing metropolitan areas -- especially areas of the
West such as Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The Domenici proposal, co-sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., grants $240 million to the Forest Service and Bureau of
Land Management to use existing authority and cooperative
agreements to remove timber and brush on public lands that are the
greatest threat of catching fire.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement amendment passed on a unanimous voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the interior bill was scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the same measure, the Senate voted 73-27 against a proposal
by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., that would have transferred $7
million to American Indian health programs from the $105 million
the bill contains for next year's National Endowment for the Arts
budget. The House has approved $98 million for the agency, $52
million less than Clinton wants but the same as this year.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Inmate Rebellion Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Inmates who seized eight guards in
a southern Brazilian prison released their captives and ended a
two-day uprising after the ringleaders were transferred, a justice
department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The nine leaders were moved from the Ahu Provisional Prison in
Curitiba, 420 miles southwest of Rio, to nearby Parana State
Penitentiary, said Lourizal Vieira Junior of the Parana State
Department of Justice. When they arrived, they phoned back and
instructed inmates to let the hostages go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hostages were released without having suffered any
aggression or injuries,'' Vieira said by telephone from Curitiba.
</P>
<P>
   The uprising began Tuesday to protest overcrowding at Ahu
prison, which was built for 300 inmates but holds 800. Prisoners
armed with wooden sticks and homemade knives overpowered guards,
climbed to the roof and set fire to the administrative wing.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates originally took 18 hostages but gradually released
10, including two pastors, three teachers and a dentist.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Hostages Await Release  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Coup leader George Speight met Wednesday with
Fiji's powerful council of tribal chiefs, seeking their approval
for a deal that would dismantle the government and secure the
release of 18 remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place as a wave of civil disturbances continued
to sweep the country, with Thursday's takeover of an upscale
resort, Laucala Island, once owned by late American publishing
magnate Malcolm Forbes. Attempts to reach the resort by telephone
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The military said it was unclear if any tourists were there and
called the incident a peaceful sit-in by residents of an adjacent
island in a property dispute. The upscale Turtle Island resort was
taken over a day earlier, with the 40 tourists allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen hostages -- the last to remain in captivity in
Parliament since Speight's men staged a coup there on May 19 -- were
supposed to be released as the Great Council of Chiefs gathered.
</P>
<P>
   But previous releases of hostages, including nine on Wednesday,
have occurred under cover of dark. Dawn broke over the capital Suva
with them still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   There were concerns that access to Fiji's international airport
at Nadi, located on Viti Levu island, could be blocked by
barricades like those that have disrupted traffic elsewhere in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement signed Sunday, the military agreed to scrap the
country's multiracial constitution, depose its first prime minister
of ethnic Indian descent and grant Speight and his henchmen
immunity from prosecution. The deal also called for the release of
the hostages ahead of the Thursday meeting with the chiefs, who
were to rule on Speight's choice for a new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Speight was using tactics like takeovers of
police stations and the blockades to pressure the chiefs into
endorsing his proposed lineup for an interim government to replace
the one sworn in a week ago by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that is happening in the country at the moment is
putting pressure on the chiefs,'' Speight spokesman Jo Nata told
Australia's ABC radio Wednesday. ''Suva is almost under siege, the
whole nation is in chaos. Isn't that what you'd call holding a gun
against the heads of the chiefs?''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated Speight's claims that protesters were acting
independently, even though those participating in most of the
disruptions said their actions were being orchestrated by Speight
and his backers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the campaign also has sparked opportunistic copycat
incidents by local residents taking advantage of an amnesty for
politically motivated crimes to seek redress of long-held
grievances like land disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Forty tourists, including 15 Americans and 19 Australians, were
briefly held at the posh Turtle Island resort before being released
safely Wednesday morning, except for Richard Evanson, the resort's
American owner.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's important tourist industry has been devastated by the
government crisis, with some of the hundreds of resort hotels
scattered across dozens of islands reporting occupancy rates as low
as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen guards were taken hostage late Tuesday by about 50
inmates in the maximum-security ward of Naboro prison, about 10
miles outside Suva. The police riot squad and soldiers deployed
around the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers released Wednesday included the remaining ethnic
Indian members of parliament held except for deposed Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry and his son. The other remaining hostages are
ethnic Fijian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the Indian minority
has too much power. They demanded that the country's multiracial
constitution be scrapped and that Chaudhry, the first Indian to
head the country, be deposed.
</P>
<P>
   The military seized control May 29 following violence and
looting in the wake of the coup.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after weeks of negotiations, military leaders caved
in to Speight's demands and he agreed to free the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the support Speight has garnered, lower-level
chiefs who met Wednesday at the Parliament complex endorsed his
proposed lineup for an interim government, including his choice for
president.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Speight might end up with a
Cabinet post -- perhaps even the prime minister's post -- but the
17-man, all indigenous Fijian government lineup did not include his
name.

<HEADLINE> TV's 'Ebert &AMP; Roeper' Is Film Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Sun-Times syndicated columnist Richard
Roeper, who as a young reporter sometimes filled in for Roger Ebert
as a newspaper film critic, will permanently join Ebert reviewing
movies on television.
</P>
<P>
   Roeper will sit in the critic's chair opposite Ebert on a newly
named ''Ebert &AMP; Roeper and the Movies,'' Buena Vista Television
said Wednesday. Roeper has been among a rotating group of guest
critics on the current show, ''Roger Ebert &AMP; the Movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has strong opinions, a good movie background and a quick
sense of humor,'' said Ebert, who continues to write for the
Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   The show was renamed after the death last year of Ebert
sidekick, Chicago Tribune movie critic Gene Siskel. The original
''Sneak Previews'' became ''Siskel &AMP; Ebert'' -- both known for their
thumbs-up-or-thumbs-down ratings system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an American institution -- the most respected film
criticism show on television -- and we think Richard brings the
perfect combination of journalistic expertise and love of the
movies to this prestigious franchise,'' Buena Vista president
Janice Marinelli said in a release.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been a big fan of Roger and Gene and the show,''
Roeper said. ''It's like joining the Bulls after they've won all of
those championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Roeper will continue his daily column, which has appeared in the
Sun-Times since 1987 and is distributed nationally by The New York
Times Syndicate. He also is author of ''Urban Legends'' and
co-author of ''He Rents, She Rents,'' a guide to ''Guy Movies and
Chick Flicks.'' He also has been a talk show host on four Chicago
radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Intervention Might Help Athletes  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Craig Kirkland was loaded down with
notebooks, papers and brochures on gambling and NCAA eligibility as
he went into the first meeting of the Sun Belt Conference
Compliance Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in high school coaching 20 years and never done
anything like this before,'' the De La Salle basketball coach said
Wednesday. ''But these days I think it's necessary. There are
problems lurking everywhere and if kids aren't careful they can be
hurt before they have a chance to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers include gambling, agents, overzealous boosters,
improper contact with coaches. Not big high school problems, maybe,
but big headaches for the NCAA and its schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now at least one conference is hoping to get after the problems
early -- at the high school level.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the first ones to do this, but we're hoping to expand
it,'' Sun Belt associate commissioner Rob Bernardi said. ''It's the
obvious first step needed to educate kids about some of the
pitfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernardi got the idea to include high school coaches in the
workshop after seeing an NCAA program aimed at that group. The
information was good, Bernardi said, but he questioned how many
high schools had the satellite link necessary to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the time high school coaches are the ones that get the
first questions,'' Sun Belt commissioner Wright Waters said. ''But
we must think they are going to get it by osmosis or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 problem for the NCAA these days is gambling, said
Deana Y. Garner, an NCAA gambling representative, who spoke at the
Sun Belt workshop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially with its availability on the Internet,'' Garner
said. ''There are between 750 and 800 offshore web sites for
gambling. We think it's dangerous and I certainly think warning
high school athletes is a good idea. They're sure going to be
warned by the time they get to college.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA this spring met with 200 players at the Nike
All-American camp to discuss those issues. They will do the same
thing with female players this summer, said Jane Jankowski, public
information coordinator for the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to get the word as far as possible,'' Jankowski said.
''It's information that any student athlete that wants to play
college sports needs to know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jankowski acknowledged, outside of the three workshops the
NCAA conducts for high school coaches and mailings sent to high
schools, it's up to conferences or individual colleges to make the
effort to educate high school coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems is we don't know how much information they get,''
Waters said. ''The mailings go to the schools, but do they ever get
to the coaches?''
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen high school coaches signed up for the
two-day workshop. Kirkland said it was because getting information
on things like eligibility requirements, let alone issues like
gambling and agents,is tough.
</P>
<P>
   At De La Salle, a Catholic school with high academic standards
that is noted for turning out solid players, Kirkland had three
players sign scholarships this year. Although he seldom sees true
blue chip players in his program, Kirkland said many of his kids
are good enough to get scholarships. But getting to college with
eligibility in tact is far more difficult than it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''For years I gave my standard study speech, girl speech and
drug speech,'' Kirkland said. ''Now, with the boom in summer
basketball and AAU programs, you don't know what they face. We hear
about agents, street-agents, boosters. I've even had people trying
to steer my players to other high schools telling them they'll have
better college chances there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tough world for them now. Part of coaching should be
helping them get through it.''

<HEADLINE> Senate nears deal on China bills  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders on Wednesday moved toward
resolving an impasse on granting permanent trade status to China,
the top trade measure Congress is considering this year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, after an
hourlong meeting with Majority leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he
was now satisfied that a vote on the China trade bill -- in danger
of being pushed back to the last days of this congressional session
in September -- would now take place this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real willingness, an environment created for that to
happen,'' agreed Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, after the meeting
also attended by more than a dozen senators and administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last May the House voted 237-197 to end the annual debate over
trade relations with China and grant the Chinese permanent normal
trade status. The legislation has strong support in the Senate, but
final passage has been complicated by senators who say the trade
bill should be linked to legislation relating to China's weapons
sales policies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., joined by Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., has proposed legislation requiring an annual assessment of
China's military technology and weapons sales and giving the
president new authority to impose sanctions if China breaks
nonproliferation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The administration opposes the Thompson bill and Democrats have
blocked its consideration on the Senate floor until Lott sets a
July date for taking up the trade bill. Lott, in turn, has been
reluctant to consider the trade bill until the proliferation issue
is solved.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting Wednesday, the lawmakers agreed to form a group
to come up with a proliferation bill that will be acceptable to
both sides, said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ''The main thing is that
all is contingent upon PNTR (permanent normal trade relations)
coming up this month,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said they were working to rewrite the proliferation
bill so that it would not apply just to China, would raise the
threshold requiring the president to impose sanctions and make
those sanctions specific to a country violating weapons agreements
rather than to a broad economic sector.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., has offered an alternative to the
Thompson measure that would cover all nations of concern and give
the president more flexibility in imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Senate on Wednesday approved, by voice, an
amendment offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to a defense
spending bill that would set up a China security review commission.
</P>
<P>
   The new body would analyze such matters as the portion of trade
China dedicates to military systems, China's acquisition of
advanced military technology through U.S. trade and China's use of
financial transactions that affect the U.S. national security.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Dany Heatley, the NHL's No. 2 draft choice,
announced Wednesday that will return to Wisconsin rather than join
the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley decided during a visit to Atlanta to return to college
rather than turn pro, Thrashers spokesman Tom Hughes said. The
19-year-old left winger ''paid his own way'' but did visit
Thrashers facilities and meet with team officials, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley does not have an agent, thereby keeping his NCAA
eligibility. The Thrashers will retain his rights should he join
the NHL next year.
</P>
<P>
   Heatley scored 28 goals and assisted on 28 others during his
freshman year. He was the rookie of the year in the Western
Collegiate Hockey Association.

<HEADLINE> Man accused of killing wife in ravine plunge awaits his fate  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANANDAIGUA, N.Y. (AP) - A jury Wednesday weighed the fate of an
unfaithful husband accused of throwing himself out of a rolling
minivan and sending his wife plummeting 160 feet to her death in a
gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Casper III told police he took his wife, Catherine
Bly-Casper, out for a surprise breakfast at 7 a.m. on a Sunday last
July and pulled off a road a mile from their destination in the
village of Naples in rural western New York.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old engineer maintains he got out to relieve
himself, saw the vehicle rolling forward on a slight incline and
watched helplessly as it plunged into Grimes Glen with his wife
screaming inside.
</P>
<P>
   Bly-Casper, 39, was ejected from the vehicle and killed.
Photographs from a family vacation were left scattered in the
gorge. The couple's two sons, ages 7 and 10, had stayed behind at
their grandparents' house while their parents drove off.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week trial, the jury must decide whether
Bly-Casper's death was a freak accident or a calculated homicide.
Jurors deliberated 10 hours Wednesday before breaking for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree murder, Casper could get a maximum
sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Casper had been having an affair for four months with a woman
who worked at an organization he had enlisted in that develops
community leadership. His wife revealed her suspicions to him after
she found a credit-card bill for flowers and heard him muttering a
woman's name in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you would tell me if something wasn't right between us,
and I know you love me,'' she wrote in a month-old note police
found ripped up in the garbage after her death. It was unclear
whether she had ever given the note to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Tuesday, defense lawyer John Speranza said
no evidence was presented ''that this was anything but an accident.
... It's a big blank.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution hinged on a confession Casper allegedly made to
police in which he told of previously visiting the site to select
it as the place for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney R. Michael Tantillo said Casper told an
investigator he jumped out with the vehicle in gear before his wife
could escape and ''ran away .. like a coward'' as it rolled toward
the precipice. Referring to their unhappy marriage, Casper
allegedly added, ''I thought this would make her happy.''

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Taliban To Let Women Work  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia rulers
agreed Wednesday to rescind a new edict barring women from working
for international relief agencies, a senior U.N. official said
after a day of negotiations in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to neighboring Pakistan, Eric de Mul, the U.N.
coordinator for Afghanistan, told The Associated Press that
''quietly things will return to normal, Afghan women can return to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The return may be staggered, de Mul said, but Afghan women who
were forced off the job last weekend will be allowed back. He said
he received his assurances from Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil
Ahmed Muttawakil.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day that the Taliban freed
Mary MacMakin, an American aid worker who had been held in a
juvenile detention center since Sunday. The Taliban had agreed to
let her go earlier, but she refused to leave until all her Afghan
female employees, who were arrested along with her, also were
released. The women were freed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin, however, has been ordered to leave Afghanistan within
24 hours. She is accused by the Taliban of spying and trying to
convert Muslims to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am laughing at these charges. They are just not true,''
MacMakin said after her release. ''I am a threat for the Taliban
because my work is with women.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin, 71, has been here since the early 1990s operating
Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Support For Afghanistan. The
organization provides home-based work for Afghan women,
particularly widows.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin, who said she has spent a total of 24 years in
Afghanistan at different times, vowed to return to Afghanistan one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am just waiting for my staff to say goodbye,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the edict rescinded was a major breakthrough for de Mul
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, espouse
a harsh brand of Islamic law and have imposed strict controls on
women since taking control of the Afghan capital, Kabul, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When they took over, the Taliban ordered all girls' schools
closed and all women out of the work force. But they later made
concessions in the areas of education and health, and women began
to return to work for foreign aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived on the job wearing the all-encompassing burqa that
covers them from head to foot, and de Mul said every organization
is careful to ensure that men and women are segregated. Even the
most lenient among the Taliban oppose the mixing of men and women.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest proponents of strict control over women is
the Taliban's radical minister for vice and virtue, Mullah Mohammed
Turabi, who authored last week's letter warning international
humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, to stop
employing Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
   It was Turabi's letter that began the trouble. MacMakin was
arrested along with her staff, and scores of women who worked for
international aid groups stayed home, afraid of being arrested or
publicly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   An orthodox minister who lost a leg and an eye fighting Soviet
soldiers in the 1980s, Turabi is considered among the most rigid of
the Taliban leaders. He swept into Kabul in 1996 and launched a
campaign to beat women who did not wear a burqa or who ventured
from their home without a male relative. He also ordered residents
to paint their first-floor windows black to ensure that passers-by
do not catch a glimpse of women inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's strict code against working women has meant a
drastic increase in women and children begging in the street. On
the rocket-ruined streets of Kabul, women hidden within their
burqas sit in the middle of the road, their hands outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   Many are widows. The United Nations estimates there are about
28,000 widows in the Afghan capital. Devastated by relentless
fighting between rival Islamic factions, most of the 750,000 people
living in Kabul survive on international assistance.

<HEADLINE> Hartford Police promise to turn over all drug money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Under mounting pressure to hand over
assets seized from criminals, the city police department gave the
state more than $100,000 Wednesday to comply with court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford Police Department had come under fire for failing
to turn over cash, drugs and other property - totaling more than
$750,000 - that it had seized during more than 3,550 criminal cases
dating back more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the cash and goods should have been turned over to Chief
State's Attorney John M. Bailey's office and the Hartford criminal
court. A percentage of the funds would then be returned to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But the department failed to comply with court orders to turn
over cash and dispose of drugs, guns and other items seized during
criminal cases, once the cases were concluded, state and city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing scandal Tuesday prompted city and state officials to
call for an audit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could be a couple of words used to describe this: It's
idiotic,'' Mayor Michael P. Peters said, saying the problem
underscored the need for a new, permanent police chief.
</P>
<P>
   While acting chief Deborah Barrows has earned high marks for
taking over a troubled department in June 1999 and handling
community outreach in the aftermath of the Aquan Salmon shooting,
city officials said this latest blunder occurred fully on Barrows'
watch.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows issued a statement Wednesday saying $118,601 in checks
were being sent to the state to comply with asset forfeiture court
orders. Additional staff would be assigned to help comply with the
remaining orders, she said. Barrows requested a state auditor be
part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The department also reported it has turned over to the state 601
guns since March 1999 and complied with court orders to destroy
drugs in nearly 4,000 cases since May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows cited the police department's lack of a bank account to
transfer the funds to the state, as well as a shortage of personnel
and the loss of old court records for the yearlong delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''As chief of police, I stand behind my staff and welcome any
and all quality assurance checks in order to continue to provide
accountability to the public and to assure the integrity of police
services in the city of Hartford,'' Barrows said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent report by national consultant Carroll Buracker
criticized the department for failing to barcode evidence or keep
central records to detail how much money is in the property room.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said Hartford is the only municipality in the state that
has this problem. Most departments quickly turn in the money,
because they get 70 percent of it back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where is the money? Where is the money?'' Bailey said Tuesday.
''I've been asking the same question since May.''

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Cabinet Being Built  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Battered by the financial crises of four
successive administrations, Mexico welcomed signs Wednesday that an
experienced financier has emerged as a likely choice for the top
economic post in the country's first opposition-party government.
</P>
<P>
   Support built among analysts for Luis Derbez, the top economic
adviser to President-elect Vicente Fox, after he said Fox had given
him responsibility for helping plan the country's 2001 federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Fox publicly launched the selection process for his
Cabinet -- which he says will include as many political parties and
points of view as possible -- with a public call to business,
academic and civic groups to suggest candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokeswoman Martha Sahagun was quick to stress that no
appointments have been made yet. Two executive-search firms -- one
an affiliate of a U.S. company -- have confirmed they have been
hired by Fox to look for candidates, but refused to comment on
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez -- a U.S.-trained economist who has worked for the World
Bank and helped design Fox's economic platform -- said in an
interview published Wednesday that Fox had already asked him and
others to start drawing up a budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Such proposals are normally drawn up by the treasury secretary,
leading the newspaper Reforma to speculate that Derbez already has
that cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Rafael Elias-Linero of the securities firms ING-Barings
published an open letter saying Derbez would be a good choice
because ''the Mexican economy would be in very good and able
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had centered on the idea that a better-known figure,
such as former Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe, might be tapped for
the post to send a message of stability and continuity to financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But Elias-Linero noted that President Ernesto Zedillo's offer to
let Fox's team start working alongside the current cabinet during
the transition to the Dec. 1 handover of power would allow Derbez
to ''gain the exposure and networking elements that would make him
'known to the markets.'''

<HEADLINE> PBS New Kids' TV, Online Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- ''Cyberchase,'' a new PBS children's
series for television and the Internet, promises to make math and
logic exciting for the 8-to-11-year-old crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The animated program, set to debut in winter 2002, features
three young Earthlings who are summoned into cyberspace to prevent
an evil fiend named Hacker from conquering the online world.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can continue the chase through PBS Kids online at
pbskids.org. The National Science Foundation is among those funding
the series from Thirteen/WNET New York and Nelvana.
</P>
<P>
   PBS, which announced the show at the Television Critics
Association annual summer gathering, also released a study that
found TV can improve literacy among children.
</P>
<P>
   According to University of Kansas researchers, kindergartners
who watched about eight hours of the new PBS series ''Between the
Lions'' for a month had significantly improved basic reading
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Children who were tested before and after watching the program
had a 64 percent increase in their knowledge of word sounds, a
skill that predicts the later ability to read, the study found.
Non-viewers showed a 25 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   First-grade students who were also studied showed reading gains,
but these could not be definitively attributed to the series, PBS
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found children liked the show as much or more
than ''Pokemon'' and other popular shows. Set in an imaginary
library run by a lion family, ''Between the Lions'' mixes puppetry,
animation, live action and music.

<HEADLINE> Kent To Interview for Notre Dame Job  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Oregon basketball coach Ernie Kent will
meet Thursday with Notre Dame officials to discuss the school's
coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will take place at an undisclosed location, said
Greg Walker, an Oregon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   WGN Radio in Chicago reported Wednesday that Kent already had
been made an offer, citing sources ''close to the situation.'' But
Kent denied there was an offer to fill the vacancy created
Wednesday when Matt Doherty left to take the job at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have agreed to talk to Notre Dame, but that is as far as any
discussions have progressed,'' he said in a statement issued by
Oregon. ''I want to emphasize that I am perfectly happy to be the
head coach at Oregon, and this is not something I have initiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame athletic director Kevin White was out of town and
unavailable for comment, but said Tuesday he would not talk about
prospective candidates. Oregon athletic director Bill Moos was out
of town on vacation, but said in a statement that he considered the
interest in Kent ''a tremendous compliment'' to the program.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season, Kent led the Ducks to a 22-8 record, their
best since 1944-45. They went to the NCAA tournament for only the
second time since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Kent signed a three-year contract extension last October, which
is due to expire after the 2002-03 season. His total salary is
about $420,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kent has been a hot coaching property since his team advanced to
the NIT semifinals in 1999. He was rumored to be a candidate to
replace Lon Kruger at Illinois, but last month Kent ended the
speculation without ever talking to the Illini, saying he was
excited about his team's strong recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Led by McDonald's All-American Luke Ridnour, the Ducks could
contend for the Pac-10 title after finishing third last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish went 22-15 and finished second in the NIT in Doherty's
first season.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish return Troy Murphy, a first-team All-American and Big
East player of the year, and add transfer Ryan Humphrey, a 6-foot-8
forward who averaged 11.1 points and 7.5 rebounds in 1998-99 for
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Among other candidates mentioned by the media for the job are
Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, former NBA and Seton Hall coach
P.J. Carlesimo, Delaware's Mike Brey, Xavier's Skip Prosser and
Utah's Rick Majerus.
</P>
<P>
   Digger Phelps, who coached the Irish for 20 years before
becoming a broadcaster, said he would be interested in returning if
that's what it takes to get a Notre Dame man in the position.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the last decade Notre Dame has gone outside the family and
it hasn't worked,'' Phelps told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview Wednesday. ''I just think it's time to look into our
family. We've had great players and great assistant coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, 59, coached the Irish from 1971-1991.

<HEADLINE> US Worker Freed From Taliban Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- An American aid worker arrested four
days ago by the ruling Taliban was released Wednesday, and was
expected to meet an order to leave Afghanistan within 24 hours,
United Nations and Afghan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary MacMakin was expected to leave Afghanistan on an
International Red Cross flight Thursday morning bound for the
northern Pakistan frontier city of Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   She will go to India, although the length of her stay there is
uncertain. She said she wants to continue to work with Afghan
women.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin, 71, said she was treated well at the juvenile
detention center where she had been held since last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to be here. ... I am just waiting for my staff to
say goodbye,'' MacMakin said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric de Mul, the U.N. coordinator for Afghanistan who is based
in neighboring Pakistan, said MacMakin was freed along with her
Afghan female employees, who were also arrested last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who were in good health, were held in a juvenile
detention center in the heart of the Afghan city. Although the
Taliban had earlier said MacMakin could leave, the American woman
refused to go until her employees were freed.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban also revoked MacMakin's visa and ordered her to
leave the country, a Taliban Foreign Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin was accused of spying and trying to convert Muslims to
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   MacMakin has been in Afghanistan since the early 1990s operating
Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Support for Afghanistan, based out
of Bisbee, Ariz. Her organization provided home-based work for
Afghan women, particularly widows.
</P>
<P>
   De Mul said the United Nations will investigate MacMakin's
expulsion and see if it can be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban rule 90 percent of Afghanistan and their opposition
the remaining 10 percent, all of it in the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is a collection of Islamic groups who fought each
other bitterly while in control of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996
and are led by ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
   The groups that make up the opposition vary in their strict
interpretation of Islam with some espousing the same harsh brand as
the Taliban. Some are considered more moderate.

<HEADLINE> Energy regulators approve Independence Pipeline proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal energy regulators on Wednesday
approved the Ohio-Pennsylvania portion of a long-distance natural
gas pipeline proposal. They also added one condition to the more
than 100 they had imposed on the project earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed Independence
Pipeline Co. to begin building the pipeline through northern Ohio
and western Pennsylvania, the section dubbed the Independence
Pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners also approved the related SupplyLink Project for
Coastal Corp.'s ANR Pipeline Co.
</P>
<P>
   The multistate pipeline, intended to move gas from Chicago to
New York, was proposed by a partnership of natural gas sellers:
Transco, ANR and National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The FERC had voted in December to deny permission for the
Independence Pipeline to break ground, and said then the proposal
could be revived with enough signed contracts to prove the
construction is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Independence had to have signed contracts for at least 35
percent of their proposed capacity for service by shippers not
affiliated with the project before commissioners would approve the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioners found that the market information requested
met the criteria they had set,'' FERC spokeswoman Tamara
Young-Allen said of Wednesday's approval.
</P>
<P>
   In December, commissioners placed more than 100 conditions the
pipeline builders would have to meet before construction could
begin on the Ohio-Pennsylvania section.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the conditions dealt with environmental protection. They
also included five years of monitoring the pipeline's impact on
sensitive farm land and an ombudsman to deal swiftly with landowner
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they added one more condition: prohibiting natural
gas shippers from backing out of contracts with Independence and
ANR for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Pipeline, estimated to cost $124.8 million,
will begin in Defiance, Ohio, span 400 miles through 18 counties in
Ohio and Pennsylvania, and end in Leidy, Penn.
</P>
<P>
   ANR's SupplyLink Project would expand its existing system by
constructing 72 miles of pipe and operating various compression
facilities at five locations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline proposal has been at issue because:
</P>
<P>
   - It would disrupt costly drainage systems on which many
northern Ohio farms depend.
</P>
<P>
   - It would run close to homes, schools and parks in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   - Many property owners felt they were being bullied into giving
the pipeline companies what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, said he was ''appalled'' by the
commissioners' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision is environmentally irresponsible,'' he said.
''The Clinton-Gore administration talks about protecting the
people, but this decision is a prime example of their catering to
powerful interests without regard to the rights of the public.''

<HEADLINE> State cabinet member, U.S. congressman clash over dredging project  </HEADLINE>
By TOM STUCKEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - A Maryland congressman's attempt to derail a
dredging project that would deepen the Chesapeake and Delaware
Canal drew strong criticism Wednesday from the state transportation
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Water Resources Development Act of 2000, which includes the
C&AMP;D Canal project, is scheduled to go before a House committee and
subcommittee Thursday. U.S. Rep. Wayne Gilchrest said Wednesday
that he planned to introduce an amendment that would cut off the
project's authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary John Porcari called the proposed
amendment, ''a direct assault on the 127,000 Marylanders who depend
on the Port (of Baltimore) for their livelihood in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't understand why Mr. Gilchrest would slowly strangle the
future of those jobs,'' Porcari said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrest said Porcari ''has a right to his opinion. But in my
strong judgment, his opinions are absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Army Corps of Engineers have found that deepening
the canal would not benefit commerce, Gilchrest added.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no financial justification to deepening the canal,''
said the Maryland Republican, whose district straddles the
Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrest said he planned to offer the amendment Thursday
morning, when the act was scheduled to go before a subcommittee of
the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee
</P>
<P>
   If the amendment passed in subcommittee, the only other
Marylander on the 75-member full committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings,
said he would attempt to strike the amendment. The Baltimore
Democrat's district includes the Port of Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The congressman is opposing Mr. Gilchrest's amendment if it is
offered,'' said Del Steward, Cummings' press secretary. ''His focus
is to keep the economic viability of the port.''
</P>
<P>
   Porcari spokesman, Jack Cahalan, said the canal is a vital
shipping route connecting the Port of Baltimore to New York and New
Jersey. Without it, ships heading to Baltimore would have to round
the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula and head up the 100-mile
long Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's people and it's jobs,'' Cahalan said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is not the first time Porcari and Gilchrest have
clashed over dredging projects.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman led a protracted battle against dumping dredge
spoils at Site 104, a four-mile underwater trench just north of the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Porcari had planned to dump muck dredged
from the Port of Baltimore at the site under a 20-year plan to keep
the port open to large cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Parris Glendening gave the victory in that debate to
Gilchrest last month after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
reported it had found chemicals in the mud that might harm marine
life. The governor declared that dredge spoils would not be dumped
at Site 104 and appeared to be moving toward a complete ban on
open-water dumping.
</P>
<P>
   Material dredged from the proposed C&AMP;D Canal project would be
deposited at existing disposal sites, Porcari said.

<HEADLINE> Truck driver-broker convicted in stock fraud case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Florida truck driver whose employer promoted
him to stock broker was convicted Wednesday of fraud related to the
sale of securities in a proposed indoor golf range.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Taylor, 35, of Naples, Fla., was found guilty of scheming
to defraud and violating the state's business law. He faces four
years in prison when State Supreme Court Justice Laura Drager
sentences him Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was acquitted of larceny. He remains free on $50,000 bail
pending sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was one of 33 people indicted along with their employer,
A.S. Goldmen &AMP; Co., of committing stock fraud against thousands of
investors, cheating them out of some $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 indictment alleged Taylor, a Goldmen employee, sold stock
in Millennium Sports Management Inc. to an undercover investigator
by lying about the company's profits, stability and other
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium was a NASDAQ-listed company that operated a minor
league baseball stadium in New Jersey. In 1993, the firm went
public with Goldmen, a Naples brokerage, as its investment banker.
The move created what is believed to be the country's only publicly
held baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994-95, Millennium went into bankruptcy to reorganize. In
1998, Millennium and affiliated companies formed Stadium Capital
Inc. to fund the design and development of a ''stadium golf''
resort in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Goldmen was to act as the ''placement agent.'' While pushing the
stock, the indictment alleged, Taylor lied or hid important facts
about the project and he lied about famous individuals and
companies participating in it.
</P>
<P>
   Originally hired by Goldmen as a truck driver, Taylor was later
made a stock broker by the firm's principal owner, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said when he first
announced the Goldmen indictments that the brokerage was created
solely to steal money from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the firm started in 1988 and at its peak had
more than 300 brokers and 50,000 customers through its Iselin,
N.J., and Naples offices. The Iselin location closed about two
years ago.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Federal authorities said Wednesday
they have joined state officials in investigating the state
Department of Insurance, whose commissioner recently resigned in
the face of allegations of misuing insurance settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said they have formed a task force that includes
the Sacramento County district attorney, the state attorney
general, FBI and U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bill Lockyer's office has been conducting a
criminal inquiry into a broad array of matters arising from the
scandal at the Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush resigned Monday in the face of
allegations he helped his own political career by using settlement
funds from insurers who had been accused of Northridge earthquake
claims violations.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Pontello, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Paul Seave,
wouldn't comment on what, is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our task force will bring to justice any state officials who
have abused the people's trust,'' Seave said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles developer plans to transform Las Vegas Hilton  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SNEDEKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Las Vegas Hilton employees met with management
Wednesday to quell rumors swirling since a California developer
agreed to buy the off-Strip resort.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Roski Jr. agreed to buy the casino resort from Park Place
Entertainment Corp. for $365 million and plans call for extensive
remodeling of the once glamorous property.
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are anticipated as Roski considers expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 30 acres that are being underutilized to develop,''
Roski said.
</P>
<P>
   The new owner said he wants to update and expand the present
casino, remodel more than 1,000 hotel rooms and add 1,500 rooms and
a time-share development.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say Tuesday's announcement is good news for
Park Place because it can focus on its Strip properties - Caesar's
Palace, Bally's, Paris and the Flamingo Hilton hotel-casinos.
</P>
<P>
   And financial experts say the purchase was a good deal for
Roski, who bought the property for a third of its replacement cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the guy got a fantastic bargain when you consider the
size of the property,'' said Bill Thompson, a University of Nevada,
Las Vegas professor and gambling expert.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson compared the Hilton with new Strip casinos like the
Aladdin and Mandalay Bay that carry $1 billion price tags.
</P>
<P>
   ''The facilities are older, but over the years it's been kept
up,'' he said. ''It's not a decaying property. It would cost a
billion dollars to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski said Wednesday that he wants to transform the struggling
property next to the Las Vegas Convention Center to attract
convention attendees and local residents, rather than its previous
niche, which targeted upscale bettors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The property is better suited to conventioneers (than high
rollers). If positioned properly, it will be a big benefit to the
local market,'' Roski said. ''The property is very well-positioned
to serve the east side of Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski also wants to fashion the hotel-casino after some of the
Strip's newer, hipper resorts such as Mandalay Bay to draw younger
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Roski owns the Silverton hotel-casino south of the Strip off
Interstate 15. He has plans for $200 million worth of improvements
to the 300-room property as well.
</P>
<P>
   Roski is part-owner of two sports franchises in Los Angeles, the
NBA's Lakers and the NHL's Kings. While he plans to keep the sports
book open, no bets can be taken on the Lakers or the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the Hilton will allow Park Place to focus on enhancing
its value by using the sale proceeds to buy back stock and pay down
its debt, said gambling analyst Jason Ader of Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our perspective, the Hilton was one of their worst
assets,'' he said. ''Arthur (Goldberg) is making a statement that
he's not wed to anything that doesn't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Park Place retained the Las Vegas Hilton's $28 million
worth of high-end gambling customer marketing lists, the sale takes
a competitor out of the high-end business, Ader added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that Goldberg, the chief executive for Park
Place, was interested in selling the hotel to focus Park Place's
efforts to lure high rollers to Caesar's Palace, Roski said he
never knew the property was for sale until he approached the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roski said he approached Park Place in January about purchasing
the Hilton after a trip to Las Vegas to scout possible sites to
build an arena after he finished developing the STAPLES Center in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Roski's plan to turn the Hilton's decadent high-roller penthouse
villas into a restaurant/lounge/nightclub is on the money, said
financial analyst Martin Roffman of Roffman Miller Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I went there, all three were empty,'' he said, adding
that in its heyday, the Las Vegas Hilton was the top resort in town
for high rollers. ''Now the upscale gambler feels more comfortable
on the Strip.''
</P>
<P>
   Roffman also said $365 million is a good price for the
3,174-room property.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always like to see a fresh infusion of money in Vegas, he
said. ''Maybe he (Roski) will come up with something different.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal still needs the approval of Nevada gambling regulators.
Executives of both companies expect to complete the sale by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Roski's Southern California-based Majestic Realty Co. is one of
the largest privately held real estate companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Hilton Hotels bought the International and renamed it
the Las Vegas Hilton, then the world's largest hotel for a total
price of about $54 million.

<HEADLINE> Mutiny 2, United 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Mutiny and D.C. United played to
a 2-2 tie Wednesday night, dealing another blow to United's faint
playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   All four goals were scored in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trittschuh and Steve Ralston scored for the Mutiny
(11-9-1), who moved into sole possession of first place in the
Central Division. Raul Diaz Arce and Jaime Moreno netted for
United, the three-time champs who fell to an MLS-worst 4-13-6.
</P>
<P>
   United coach Thomas Rongen felt his team needed to win seven of
its last 10 games, including the game against Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing five starters, United outplayed the Mutiny, but
couldn't convert enough scoring chances to make up for two
defensive mistakes that led to goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny took the lead in the 16th minute when John Maessner's
right cross was headed at the far post by Trittschuh. Goalkeeper
Mark Simpson misread the play and the ball hit his arm from close
range and went in.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the first time in many weeks, D.C. United's offense
worked the way it's supposed to. United tied the score in the 23rd
when Moreno played a long ball ahead to Diaz Arce, who beat
goalkeeper Scott Garlick by striking his right-footer just inside
the far post from 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno and Diaz Arce worked their magic again seven minutes
later on a give-and-go at the top of the box. Diaz Arce one-touched
the ball back to Moreno, who scored his 10th goal of the season
from 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay scored a minute later when Ralston outran David
Hayes down the right side to chase down a pass from Mamadou Diallo.
With only Simpson left to beat, Ralston tapped in his shot from 12
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz Arce was denied a second goal in the 31st when defenseman
Chad McCarty made a kick save on the goal line. Seventeen-year-old
Bobby Convey was denied his first MLS goal on a nice arm save by
Garlick in first-half injury time.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo put a header off the post in the 51st minute, but United
otherwise controlled the second half. A.J. Wood put a shot off the
crossbar, and Garlick made a diving save off Diaz Arce in the 79th.
</P>
<P>
   United started its 23rd different lineup in 23 league games this
season. They were missing injured players Jeff Agoos, Ben Olsen,
Clint Peay, Antonio Otero and Judah Cooks. Richie Williams and
Carlos Llamosa were suspended for yellow card accumulations, and
Eddie Pope is preparing for World Cup qualifying with the U.S.
national team.

<HEADLINE> Episcopal Bishops Nix Gay Rites  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopal bishops voted against ceremonial rites
for same-sex unions Wednesday, a day after the provision was
narrowly rejected by clergy and lay delegates at the church's
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   The votes don't mean the debate is over, though.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the bishops planned to discuss a proposal calling
for further study of the theological basis for consecrating
same-sex unions, with the findings to be presented at the next
General Convention, in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Bishops, which along with the House of Deputies
makes up the church's governing body, also must vote on the rest of
the resolution, which calls on the church to support unmarried
couples in monogamous relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are really being asked to bless is to bless love, and
nothing more,'' said Steven Charlston, former bishop of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   With many members absent, the House of Bishops voted 85-63
Wednesday against developing rites for unmarried couples --
heterosexual or homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the measure would signal an enormous change in
doctrine ''and it will tear us apart,'' said Bishop Edward Little
of northern Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Other bishops said the church is moving toward more acceptance
of gays and lesbians but shouldn't move before congregations across
the country are ready to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Those were among the fears expressed Tuesday in the House of
Deputies, where 832 clergy and lay delegates narrowly defeated a
proposal to develop rites for unmarried couples.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies overwhelmingly approved the rest of the proposal,
which recognizes some church members are in monogamous, committed
relationships outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   While the measure doesn't mention homosexuals, it is seen as a
response to a push for the church to bless their relationships. The
resolution also acknowledges that individual dioceses will continue
to bless same-sex unions without churchwide sanction.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.4 million-member Episcopal Church has been debating the
roles of homosexuals in the church for at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Charles Duvall of Florida contended the closeness of
Tuesday's vote shows how ''almost exactly evenly divided'' the
church is on the issue -- the provision barely passed among clergy
members but failed by four votes among lay members.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows that we're not ready to move forward,'' Duvall said.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates had argued the proposal would alienate the
Anglican Church -- the Episcopal Church is the U.S. branch of the 70
million-member Anglican Church, which supports traditional
teachings on marriage and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with which the
Episcopal church is forming alliance to share clergy, sacraments
and programs, discourages any blessings of gay couples. But it
doesn't prohibit such unions, and some pastors have said they
intend to perform ceremonies for gays.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Lutheran Bishop H. George Anderson said Wednesday
that he doesn't see a problem with Episcopal proposals to
liberalize policies on homosexuals. He noted the Evangelical
Lutherans also have a pact with the United Church of Christ, which
sanctions same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Other denominations, including the United Methodist Church and
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), have recently voted against blessing
same-sex unions and ordaining homosexuals. The 1.4 million-member
United Church of Christ sanctions same-sex unions.

<P>
	   FORT PLAIN, N.Y. (AP) - The day after finding a 54-year-old man
dead in his home, police discovered what may be his mother's
dismembered remains in a freezer at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police went to George P. McGovern's house Tuesday and found him
dead inside. An autopsy revealed a heart attack killed McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a neighbor was cleaning and securing McGovern's
duplex when he found the dismembered remains in a chest-type
freezer. The last known occupant of the house was McGovern's
82-year-old mother, Louise McGovern, who was last seen about a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neighbors were told by Mr. McGovern that his mother had been
placed in a nursing home due to her declining health,'' village
police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Homer L. Buddles III said he was not sure the
remains were those of Louise McGovern but said an initial
investigation has not discovered Mrs. McGovern elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't even tell you it's a female,'' Buddles said of the
remains. ''That's why we sent the remains for an autopsy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The federal judge assigned to hear former
Gov. Edwin Edwards' trial on insurance fraud charges has postponed
the trial until Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the postponement from Aug. 21 was a conflict
with U.S. District Judge Edith Brown Clement's schedule, said
Edwards, who is his own attorney in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, Insurance Commissioner Jim Brown, attorney Ronald Weems
and David Disiere have pleaded innocent to setting up a sweetheart
liquidation deal for Disiere's insolvent Cascade Insurance Co.
Edwards was the only defendant present at Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards would not comment on the case, citing a gag order
imposed by the federal judge who presided over his earlier trial on
extortion and racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son Stephen and three other men were convicted May
9 of fixing bids for casino licenses. Edwards faces up to a
250-year prison term, but no sentencing date has been set.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Merlakia Jones hit a running 12-foot jumper
with .6 seconds remaining in overtime Wednesday night to give the
Cleveland Rockers a 74-72 victory over the Orlando Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, named to the WNBA All-Star Game earlier in the day, got
the ball at the top of the key with nine seconds to play. She
dribbled right and then left, before sending a high-arcing shot
over Taj McWilliams for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Johnson missed a long shot for Orlando at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (11-8) won its third straight and pulled within 1&AMP;frac12;
games of the first-place Miracle (13-7) in the Eastern Conference.
It was the Rockers' second overtime win at home over Orlando this
season. Cleveland won 83-79 on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams led Orlando with 22 points, and Nykesha Sales scored
all 20 of her points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Mery Andrade had 17 points and Jones added 16 for the Rockers,
who led 30-23 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin scored six points of her 12 points in overtime
for Cleveland before fouling out with 14.7 seconds left and the
Rockers ahead 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams made two free throws to tie the score. Cleveland got
the ball, called time, and set up the game-winning play.
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle started the second half with an 18-10 run to take a
41-40 lead. The lead changed 10 times the rest of the way in the
intensely played game.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando's strong zone defense kept Cleveland from getting the
ball inside, but allowed the Rockers clear shots from the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made a team-record 11 of 19 shots from 3-point range.
However, Orlando held a 21-9 advantage on free-throw scoring.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams scored 11 of Orlando's first 13 points, including the
first nine.

<HEADLINE> Fiery Gore scorns Bush before NAACP civil rights leaders  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) - Quoting Scripture and egged on by a howling
NAACP audience, Democrat Al Gore on Wednesday scorned Republican
George W. Bush's attempted inroads with black voters as nothing but
''nice-sounding words.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not asking you to read my lips. I am asking you to read my
heart and watch my feet and watch the work of my hands when joined
with yours,'' Gore told the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president pledged a ''marching-together'' fight for
public schools, affirmative action, a national hate-crimes law,
Supreme Court justices who will protect civil rights, and ending
any police targeting of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed the civil rights group - and touted his own
membership - two days after presidential rival Bush made his appeal
here, with the Texas governor heralding the contrast between
himself and other Republicans who ''have avoided the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday
afternoon,'' Gore said, pausing with a sarcastic scowl while
convention-goers hooted in approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I remembered what Scripture teaches in the book of James,
Chapter 2, Verse 18: Yea a man may say thou hast faith and I have
works. Show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my
faith BY my works! That is MY text for today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush bristled at the attack and said he was sincere in reaching
out to the NAACP and minorities. ''I talked from my heart,'' Bush
said in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A sometimes lackluster speaker, Gore's fiery speech seemed to
reassure supporters at a time when he labors to energize
traditional Democratic constituencies - blacks and other minorities
chief among them - against Bush's determined courtship under the
banner, ''compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Dy-no-mite! Dy-no-mite!'' screamed New York City Democrat
Jannine Green. ''Best I ever heard. George said nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett dismissed Gore's speech, saying his
appeal to black activists is symptomatic of ''what dire straits his
candidacy is in and the problems he has shoring up his base.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate the vice president once again is using the
opportunity not to tell the American people how he plans to bring
the country together, but instead focuses on tearing down Governor
Bush,'' Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NAACP members had leapt atop chairs as Gore entered
the hall with a dance in his step, grabbing hands, hugs and
high-fives two or three at a time.
</P>
<P>
   While the nonprofit NAACP must remain officially neutral to
retain its tax-exempt status, chairman Julian Bond and board member
William Lucy made clear their disdain for Bush - the first
Republican presidential candidate to appear before the convention
since his father in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy introduced Gore as someone who, ''unlike a lot of people,
has not just discovered the NAACP, has not just discovered the
problems of poor people, African-American people and people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   To reporters, Bond contrasted Gore's ''homecoming'' to the
NAACP's ''pleasure at the very fact that Governor Bush bothered to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   At the door, a Democratic National Committee representative
passed out invitations to DNC hospitality suites.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said his group would spend $8 million before November to
''register voters, educate voters'' and ''hurt (candidates) who are
the enemies of civil rights.'' He faulted Bush for ''mere
platitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore ticked down a list of all that he hopes blacks will hold
against Bush, most prominently his opposition to a national hate
crimes law.
</P>
<P>
   ''When James Byrd is dragged to his death behind a pickup truck,
then the governor of his home state ought to at least heed the
family's plea for action,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One brief sentence that said the word 'yes' would have
mattered a whole lot more to the cause of justice than a whole
speech that didn't even mention hate crimes, the future of the
Supreme Court, taking down the Confederate flag, ending racial
profiling, or defending affirmative action, or Bob Jones
University,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later stopped for coffee and sweets with Mayor Martin
O'Malley at Baltimore's old National Can Company, a revitalized
complex of restaurants and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said more abandoned industrial sites could be cleaned up
and put to use if the GOP-led Congress quit blocking
''brownfields'' legislation to give developers loan help and
liability relief.
</P>
<P>
   He released a November 1999 letter from Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, in which the Mississippi Republican confirmed an
agreement with Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, that no brownfields
proposal ''will be allowed to be considered or acted upon by the
Senate during this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bush, who has campaigned on brownfields
proposals similar to Gore's, to persuade Lott to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wrapped the day with two DNC fund-raisers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Before predominantly Jewish contributors at a private home in
Livingston, N.J., he commented for the first time on the Mideast
peace talks under way at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said ''peace with security'' must be part of any deal and
hinted at having inside knowledge of the discussions. ''I'm hopeful
that we can get some progress there. But more than that I cannot
say,'' he said, citing a news blackout on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   To predominantly Jewish contributors at the Livingston, N.J.,
home of real estate developer Charles Kushner, Gore addressed for
the first time the Mideast peace talks under way at Camp David. He
said ''peace with security'' must be part of any deal and he hinted
at inside knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful that we can get some progress there. But more than
that I cannot say, as you can understand, because the cloak of
secrecy is such that I certainly do not want to be responsible for
giving any details out,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   While on Bill Bradley's home turf, Gore also tipped his hat to
the former New Jersey senator, with whom Gore will campaign on
Thursday in Green Bay, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout the (Democratic) primaries, even when they got
pretty intense, I maintained constantly and always that it was an
honor to be in the same race with Bill Bradley.''

Gore Swipes Bush at NAACP Convention

<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore today scorned Republican George W. Bush's

''I'm not asking you to read my lips. I am asking you to read my heart and watch
my feet and watch the work of my hands when joined with yours,'' Gore told the

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush fired up Republican Party leaders today
by jumping to the defense of the GOP-led Congress, criticizing Al Gore for
calling it a ''do-nothing-for-the-people'' body. ''He offers more of the same --
four more years of a president at war with Congress,'' Bush said of Gore,
speaking to about 150 party leaders gathered from across the country for an
update on his campaign. Bush criticized Gore for ''shifting around a lot,''
citing the vice president's latest campaign strategy of attacking Congress for
not approving health care and other legislation -- and saying Bush should do

<HEADLINE> New 49ers President named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Peter Harris, toy company FAO Schwarz's
former chief executive officer, became president of the San
Francisco 49ers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 56, has full day-to-day control of the NFL franchise
with an emphasis on the business end. General Manager Bill Walsh
will continue to oversee the football side of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harris' primary tasks will be reviving the stalled
stadium-shopping mall project at Candlestick Point. The project
stalled when Eddie DeBartolo Jr. and sister Denise DeBartolo York
squabbled over team ownership. DeBartolo York took over in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's imperative that the team have a great stadium,'' Harris
said. ''I commit to exploring and then developing a stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris has a reputation for turning around troubled companies,
including FAO Schwarz. The toy company hired him as CEO in 1985 and
he quadrupled profits within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Harris worked for Accolade, a San Jose video game
producer. He is head of The Picture People, a family studio
portrait chain with 183 outlets in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have not had a permanent president since Carmen Policy
left for the Cleveland Browns in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Gore Swipes Bush at NAACP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Quoting Scripture and egged on by a howling
NAACP audience, Democrat Al Gore on Wednesday scorned Republican
George W. Bush's attempted inroads with black voters as nothing but
''nice-sounding words.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not asking you to read my lips. I am asking you to read my
heart and watch my feet and watch the work of my hands when joined
with yours,'' Gore told the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president pledged a ''marching-together'' fight for
public schools, affirmative action, a national hate-crimes law,
Supreme Court justices who will protect civil rights and ending any
police targeting of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed the civil rights group -- and touted his own
membership -- two days after presidential rival Bush made his appeal
here, with the Texas governor heralding the contrast between
himself and other Republicans who ''have avoided the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday
afternoon,'' Gore said, pausing with a sarcastic scowl while
convention-goers hooted in approval.

   ''But I remembered what Scripture teaches in the book of James,

<HEADLINE> Walt Wiesman Dies at Age 79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Walt Wiesman, the youngest member of
Werner von Braun's rocket team, has died. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesman died Tuesday in a nursing home, where he had battled
Parkinson's disease for about two months.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesman grew up in Germany and came to the United States in 1945
at age 25, part of the team of former German scientists who helped
build the U.S. Army's rocket program and NASA's space program.
</P>
<P>
   The team first arrived at Fort Bliss, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the team headed by von Braun moved to Huntsville, where
the rocket technology that eventually led to the Apollo program was
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesman became a U.S. citizen in 1954 and was considered one of
the rocket team's best communicators.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always a real live wire,'' said Ed Buckbee, former
director of the U.S. Space &AMP; Rocket Center. ''He enjoyed speaking
to any audience about space flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesman was a founder of the Huntsville Arts Council and
WLRH-FM, the state's first full-service public radio station.

<HEADLINE> Liberty 84, Sting 70  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vickie Johnson scored 19 points as the New York
Liberty won their fourth straight, 84-70 over the Charlotte Sting
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon added 16 for the Liberty (11-9), winners of six of
eight.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star selection Andrea Stinson had 21 for the Sting (3-17),
losers of four straight and nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, which made the playoffs in each of the WNBA's first
three seasons, shares the worst record in the league with expansion
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty led by 18 at halftime and increased their lead to
56-24 lead on a jumper by Crystal Robinson with 15:02 remaining.
Charlotte came within 68-51 on Stinson's scoop layup with 6:27
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty put their starters back in with just over five
minutes left as the Sting trimmed the lead to 14 on Dawn Staley's
layup.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Reid and Staley had 13 points apiece for Charlotte, which
shot a season-low 17 percent in the first half and finished with 36
percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips had nine points and seven rebounds for the
Liberty, and Teresa Weatherspoon had 10 points, seven assists and
four steals.
</P>
<P>
   New York led 16-6 on consecutive baskets by Weatherspoon. The
Sting were held without a field goal for more than 12 minutes
before Reid hit a short jumper to cut the deficit to 26-13.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty shot 9-for-16 on 3-pointers and led 38-20 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting made just five field goals in the first period. Reid
led with nine points on 3-for-4 shooting.

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead in NY Buildings Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two bodies were discovered Wednesday in the
wreckage of a pair of collapsed residential buildings and neighbors
kept vigil for two people still missing in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The first body was found beneath four feet of ''very tightly
packed rubble'' by firefighters who had burrowed into the debris,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. Several hours later, police found a
second body. Neither victim was immediately identified, although
police said the second was a white man in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said authorities believed a gas explosion was likely
to blame, although the investigation was continuing. KeySpan Energy
had said its workers found no evidence of a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the missing was expected to continue into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see it, but I can't leave,'' said Ken
Diamondstone, a resident of the Brooklyn neighborhood, as he stood
behind police barricades. ''We all know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the discovery of the second body, authorities said the
missing were an elderly couple who were fixtures in the
neighborhood for 30 years, and the co-owner of the building next
door. The three had apparently gone inside after smelling gas,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani identified the missing people as Khay Cochran and
Leonard and Harriet Walit, who apparently had just returned home
from a trip on the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were good neighbors, and good people,'' said Jack Lucas,
head of the block association, which had been planning its party
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings, a four-story brownstone apartment
building, collapsed Tuesday night on a quiet street, bringing down
much of an adjacent three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the first building fell without breaking, making it
more difficult for rescue workers to look for survivors underneath.
Cameras were being used to check under the debris.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Fears Spies Among Women  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A controversial edict barring women from
working for relief agencies inside Afghanistan was issued because
the nation's Taliban rulers feared some women might be spies, a
Taliban spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The edict, which Taliban militia rulers later agreed to rescind,
arose out of a belief that the former Soviet Union trained 35,000
Afghan women as KGB agents, said Abdul Hakeem Mujahid.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the KGB recruitment in explaining a Taliban edict
issued last week that warned international organizations against
hiring Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid, whose Taliban government has never been recognized by
the United Nations, said the employment of women by foreign
organizations was a ''national security issue.'' He said the
government needed to assure the women did not pose a domestic
threat and were not working for Afghan opposition groups or another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid made clear that the Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent
of Afghanistan, view Russia as their biggest threat.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and spent nearly a
decade battling Western-backed Islamic groups before withdrawing in
1989. Three years later, the Islamic groups overthrew the communist
regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's U.N. Mission said no one was available to comment on
Mujahid's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid's news conference was supposed to focus on the effects
of the worst drought to hit Afghanistan in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the session was dominated instead by questions about the
edict issued by the Taliban's radical minister for vice and virtue,
Mullah Mohammed Turabi, warning international humanitarian groups,
including the United Nations, to stop employing Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
   Mujahid said international organizations and the United Nations
had ignored a 1998 agreement with the government to provide
biographies of all Afghans they hire.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban is especially concerned about women, he said,
because during the decade of Soviet power ''about 35,000 women were
employed as secret agents and (an) intelligence force of the
communist regime there. These were well-trained agents of the
KGB.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban wants to make sure that the female agents are not
hired by international organizations, Mujahid said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the edict was also triggered by the recent hiring of 600
Afghan women by the U.N. World Food Program which angered the
Taliban because he claimed the women were asked their ethnicity and
whether they wanted to go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came on the same day that the Taliban freed Mary
MacMakin, an American aid worker who had been held in a juvenile
detention center since Sunday.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House again passed Republican legislation
Wednesday to cut taxes for millions of married couples, setting up
a showdown in the Senate and a late July, pre-GOP convention
confrontation with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, meanwhile, reached agreement with Democrats
to remove parliamentary roadblocks and finish debate this week on a
House-passed bill to abolish inheritance taxes, another GOP
priority that Clinton has threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   The 269-159 vote by which the House passed the 10-year, $182
billion ''marriage penalty'' tax cut was a virtual mirror image of
a February vote on the same bill. The move was necessary because
Senate Democrats filibustered the first bill, forcing GOP leaders
to pass it again under budget rules that limit debate and
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it once, but it was held up in the Senate,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''It's something we've promised the
American people, and we'll get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is aimed at the estimated 25 million two-income married
couples who pay higher income taxes than they would if single, but
it also gives a tax cut to virtually all married people who file
joint tax returns. It would gradually expand the bottom 15 percent
income tax bracket so that by 2007 it is double the bracket for two
single people and would boost the standard deduction to twice that
of singles in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would raise the income cap to allow more
lower-income couples to claim the earned income tax credit and
would ensure that couples who claim certain personal credits, such
as the $500 per-child credit, do not run afoul of the complex
alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate intends to take up its 10-year, $248 billion version
of the bill later this week. A House-Senate conference committee
would be named to work out differences, which mainly center on how
the next-highest 28 percent tax bracket is treated.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are rushing to get the bill to Clinton before the
start of the Republican National Convention on July 31, calculating
that a veto gives them a popular issue to exploit. If the president
were to sign the measure, the GOP could use that to fight Vice
President Al Gore's claim that Republicans are running a
''do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the measure was nothing but ''a political
statement,'' in the words of Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. They tried
to force Republicans to attach a government-run Medicare
prescription drug benefit that Clinton has made a condition of
signing the tax cut into law. But that effort was rejected by a
230-197 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a nexus between marriage penalty and
prescription drugs,'' Hastert said. ''They're at risk of being
do-nothing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking up the marriage tax cut, the Senate intends to
begin serious debate on the 10-year, $104 billion Republican bill
that would gradually scrap federal estate taxes by 2010. Passage
could come as early as Thursday evening, or possibly Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats plan to offer a series of amendments, including a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, along with an estate tax
alternative that increases exemptions for family farms and small
businesses that suffer most from the tax. Clinton has endorsed the
Democratic approach, saying complete repeal is unnecessary and
would mainly help the wealthiest people in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's staggering to see what the Republicans will do in the
name of tax reduction, benefiting the very, very wealthiest in this
country,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty bill is H.R. 4810.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Aid Bill Veto Threatened  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a threatened veto, the House late
Wednesday rejected most of the money President Clinton wanted for
debt relief for poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   It threw out an amendment to the foreign aid bill that would
have added $390 million over the next two years for an
international debt program, leaving the figure at $69 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish we had more but we don't have more,'' said Republican
Rep. Sonny Callahan of Alabama, arguing that under budget caps set
earlier this year the House is not permitted to increase proposed
spending unless an equivalent amount is cut from some other
program.
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed more than three hours of sometimes
impassioned debate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said rejection of the extra money
''condemns countless hundreds of thousands of innocent children to
death by starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are creating wealth at a pace unparalleled in the history
of the world,'' Frank said. ''A relatively small amount of money
... could alleviate untold sufferings. And for this house ... to
deny to the poorest people in the world the debt relief which the
administration has asked for ... is the cruelest single act of
public policy I can recall in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being asked to share what we have with some of the most
needy people in the world,'' said Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some day ... I'd like to be part of a Congress that ends
hunger, that ends disease,'' said Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio. ''We
can end tuberculosis, we can end cholera and we can end polio.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said Americans can ''be
proud'' of their foreign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always more money that could be spent. There are
always more things that could be done by government,'' Diaz-Balart
said. ''But I am not ashamed of what the American people, through
their Congress, do in foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, the head
of the president's National Economic Council, told reporters
earlier Wednesday that the amount included in the bill would not
meet U.S. obligations under a program launched last year by the
world's richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill as it stands now would provide $82 million for debt,
including $12.6 million for environmental debt relief and $69
million for the general debt relief of $435 million requested by
the administration for debt relief for 40 of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill before Congress provides grossly inadequate funds to
help the poorest countries in the world to fight poverty and
disease,'' Summers said. ''As a result, the president's advisers
will recommend that the president veto the bill in its current
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling told reporters that ''debt relief is at the top of the
president's agenda. We intend to fight long and hard to make sure
that this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers and Sperling appeared with a group of Democrats who said
they would oppose the bill, which the House was considering on
Wednesday, because of the failure to meet Clinton's request on debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''The foreign debt burden of most impoverished nations is a
crushing burden on the poorest people of the world, diverting
scarce resources from health care, education and the hope of
development,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of Congress to fully fund the U.S. share of the
debt relief package comes at an embarrassing time for Clinton, who
is due to attend this year's annual economic summit next week in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's summit, the world's seven richest countries -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada --
pledged to write off $50 billion in debt owed by poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials fear that lack of action on the part of
Congress will give other countries a chance to retreat from their
own promises, threatening the collapse of the whole initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we fail, we become the excuse for every other country of
the world not to do its part,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The debt issue has been pushed by a collection of religious
organizations operating under the banner, Jubilee 2000. In a
ceremony outside the Capitol, the group presented the members of
Congress with boxes full of petitions it said had been signed by
500,000 Americans urging debt forgiveness for poor nations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in NY Buildings Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two bodies were discovered Wednesday in the
wreckage of a pair of collapsed residential buildings and neighbors
kept vigil for one person still missing in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The first body was found beneath four feet of ''very tightly
packed rubble'' by firefighters who had burrowed into the debris,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. Several hours later, police found a
second body. Neither victim was identified.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said authorities believed a gas explosion was likely
to blame, although the investigation was continuing. KeySpan Energy
had said its workers found no evidence of a gas leak. A city
official said authorities were also investigating a report that a
new gas dryer had been installed in one of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the missing was expected to continue into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see it, but I can't leave,'' said Ken
Diamondstone, a resident of the Brooklyn neighborhood, as he stood
behind police barricades. ''We all know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the discovery of the second body, authorities said the
missing were an elderly couple who were fixtures in the
neighborhood for 30 years, and the co-owner of the building next
door. The three had apparently gone inside after smelling gas,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani identified the missing people as Khay Cochran and
Leonard and Harriet Walit, who apparently had just returned home
from a trip on the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were good neighbors, and good people,'' said Jack Lucas,
head of the block association, which had been planning its party
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings, a four-story brownstone apartment
building, collapsed Tuesday night on a quiet street, bringing down
much of an adjacent three-story building.
</P>
<P>
   The roof of the first building fell without breaking, making it
more difficult for rescue workers to look for survivors underneath.
Cameras were being used to check under the debris.

Fiji Military: 4 Resorts Seized
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Protesters in Fiji seized two more tourists resorts
Thursday, bringing the number held to four, the military said. The U.S.
government urged all Americans to leave the country amid increasing unrest
spawned by a two-month-old parliamentary hostage crisis. The latest resort
seizures, which appeared to be peaceful protests, came hours after the takeover
of the upscale Laucala Island resort and a day after the occupation of a beach
resort where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed. It was unclear if the takeovers
were part of rebel leader George Speight's efforts to pressure the Great Council
of Chiefs, Fiji's traditional power, to endorse his proposed Cabinet for an
interim government.

plans to remain overnight after what he hoped would be a productive dinner with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. White House

Barak and Arafat met separately with Clinton at Camp David.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim of the Vancouver Grizzlies
has been selected for the final spot on the U.S. Olympic basketball
team, replacing the injured Grant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Basketball selection committee made the decision
Tuesday, and Abdur-Rahim's agent confirmed Wednesday that the star
forward will accept the spot. Kobe Bryant of the NBA champion Los
Angeles Lakers was the early choice to replace Hill, but his
wedding plans kept him for making the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Hill broke his left ankle in April.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team begins training camp in late August, and the
Sydney Games will run from mid-September to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim was a unanimous choice, a member of the selection
committee told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim got the news while at home in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels a sense of recognition. He's extremely happy,'' said
agent Aaron Goodwin, whose client plays for one of the NBA's worst
teams in one of its smallest markets.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim's selection came as a bit of a surprise, but only in
part because Bryant and Charlotte's Eddie Jones were mentioned as
the most likely replacement for Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, however, decided to go with a bigger player to
fill the void at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that if they went small, it would be Kobe or
Eddie,'' Goodwin said, ''and if they went big, it would be Shareef
or Antonio McDyess (of Denver).''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim, 23, averaged 20.3 points and 10.1 rebounds for the
Grizzlies last season, his fourth in the NBA. The 6-foot-9 former
California star can play either forward position for the Olympic
team, backing up bigmen Alonzo Mourning, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett
and Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the U.S. team includes Jason Kidd, Tim Hardaway,
Steve Smith, Allan Houston, Gary Payton, Ray Allen and Vince
Carter.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Extraditing Suspect to US  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A suspected Colombian cocaine trafficker
will be extradited to the United States on Thursday, police
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Garcia, who faces a New Jersey indictment, will be flown
to New York City accompanied by U.S. drug agents, state security
police said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old would be the second Colombian extradited to the
United States by President Andres Pastrana in less than a year,
following a decade-long hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition has long been a priority of U.S. officials in the
South American country. The move by Pastrana, who is seeking
improved ties with Washington, comes on the heels of a $1.3 billion
U.S. aid package that will be used to launch a counter-narcotics
offensive in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A heroin suspect Pastrana sent to the United States in November
was the first Colombian extradited since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 47, was arrested in February 1999 along with 18 alleged
members of a smuggling ring that shipped cocaine through the
western port of Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged in the United States with smuggling in 230 pounds
of the drug hidden in liquor boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the world's leading producer of cocaine and a
growing heroin supplier. But traffickers often avoid convictions or
get lenient sentences due to widespread fear and corruption in the
justice system.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes had 25 points, nine rebounds and
five assists, and the Houston Comets closed with a 13-0 run over
the final 5:05 to beat the Sacramento Monarchs 77-62 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith scored 22 points -- 14 in the first half -- as
the three-time WNBA champion Comets improved to league-best 19-2
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams struggled to maintain a lead in the first half until
the Monarchs (13-7) began a 14-2 run to take a 29-20 advantage,
their biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Houston answered right back, though, with a 15-2 run to take a
35-31 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento regained the lead at the start of the second half
with a 10-2 run, but the Comets quickly took it right back and
never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs managed to tie the game twice more and trailed by
only two, 64-62, with 5:05 left to play, before Houston went on its
game-ending run.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper (17), Tina Thompson (15) and Tiffani Johnson (10)
also reached double figures for the Comets. Ruthie Bolton-Holifield
and Tangela Smith added 12 and 11 points, respectively, for the
Monarchs.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Decries Columbine Cops  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Lawyers for the daughter of Columbine victim Dave
Sanders said in a court filing Wednesday that sheriff's deputies
did nothing to save the wounded teacher even after they knew the
two gunmen were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the conduct ''conscience shocking,'' the lawyers also
charged that deputies stopped students and teachers from trying to
rescue Sanders at Columbine High School, even though they received
frequent telephone updates about his worsening condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragic irony is if the SWAT team personnel, the police,
the deputies and everyone else there had never shown up or if they
had left at 12:30 p.m., he would still have been alive,'' said
Peter C. Grenier, a lawyer representing Sanders' daughter, Angela.
</P>
<P>
   Two teen gunman killed Sanders and 12 students before committing
suicide on April 20, 1999. Sanders, 47, was shot twice in the
shoulder as he shepherded students from the school's library to
safety. He bled to death before rescuers reached him.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders sued the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office,
contending a sharpshooter had a ''clear view'' of one of the gunmen
but was denied permission to fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her suit also states sharpshooters witnessed the suicides of the
gunmen, but sheriff's commanders prevented anyone from trying to
rescue her father for nearly four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's filing was in response to a Jefferson County motion
to dismiss Angela Sanders' lawsuit. The county argued that it
should not be blamed for the actions of the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   County spokeswoman Michelle Frongillo would not comment on
Sanders' new filing because lawyers had not received it yet.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Joe Vitiello had three hits and scored
three runs in the Pacific Coast League's 8-2 victory over the
International League in the Triple-A All-Star game Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vitiello, a first baseman with the Las Vegas Stars, had a
triple, double and single in three at-bats after entering the game
in the fourth inning. The San Diego farmhand was voted the Lou
Gehrig Player of the Game, as well as the PCL Star of Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was one of those nights when hits fell in. The people in
Rochester put on a great show,'' said Vitiello, who is hitting .353
with 11 homers and 46 RBIs for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Springs' Giovanni Carrara was the winner, allowing one
hit and no runs while striking out two in his one inning.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 12,810 was the fifth-largest in the 13-year history
of the Triple-A All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   By winning for the second consecutive year, the Pacific Coast
League took a 2-1 lead in the series. The format was changed when

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Waste Leaves Hanford  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- A truck left Hanford on Wednesday with
the nuclear reservation's first shipment of radioactive waste bound
for an underground dump in southeastern New Mexico, the Department
of Energy said.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment was to have left for the federal Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant last month, but was delayed because of a paperwork
problem involving a state review in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The truck that left Wednesday was carrying seven 55-gallon drums
placed in special shipping containers, the Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The drums contain transuranic waste -- typically items such as
clothing, tools and debris used in the handling of nuclear waste --
that has a half life of 20 years or greater. That means it takes 20
years for it to lose half its radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,800-mile route crosses through Oregon, Idaho, Utah,
Wyoming and Colorado. The trip is expected to take about two days.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 30 years, Hanford is expected to send about 2,500
shipments -- the equivalent of 80,000 drums -- to the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant, near Carlsbad, N.M.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Name Low Coach  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Low knows it won't be easy to get the New
York Rangers back in the playoffs. Anything less, however, is not
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Low signed a multiyear contract Wednesday to coach the Rangers,
an Original Six franchise that has been out of the postseason for
three straight seasons. That failure will not be tolerated under
the Rangers' new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not acceptable for this team not to make the playoffs,''
said general manager Glen Sather, who left the Edmonton Oilers last
month to take over the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sather didn't wait long to make more news. The Rangers called a
news conference for Thursday morning to announce the signing of
Mark Messier, the captain of their 1994 Stanley Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't been to the playoffs since Messier, their
former captain, left as a free agent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, who led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54
years in 1994, was also a five-time champion with the Oilers. He
won four Cups with Sather as coach and another under John Muckler,
Low's New York predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   After serving six years as an assistant with the Oilers, Low
took over as head coach in April 1995 -- working under Sather. He
quit last year when his contract expired and he wouldn't re-sign
for the same salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I deserved a raise for getting a hockey club into
the playoffs and knocking off heavily favored opponents twice in a
row,'' Low said.
</P>
<P>
   Low, who was a finalist to become the coach of the expansion
Columbus Blue Jackets, was 139-162-40 with Edmonton, leading the
Oilers to first-round victories over Dallas in 1997 and Colorado in
'98.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be the lowest-paid coach in the league
anymore,'' Low said. ''That wasn't going to change, so I left.''
</P>
<P>
   Low, a goalie, played for six teams -- including the Oilers --
during an 11-year career. He worked his way up the Edmonton system
as a minor league assistant and head coach before joining the
parent club as an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In the six weeks since he took over, Sather has been learning to
adjust to running a big-budget team compared to what he was used to
in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   He already signed free agent defenseman Vladimir Malakhov and
returned Messier to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers spent plenty of money last summer, signing free
agents Theo Fleury, Valeri Kamensky and Stephane Quintal. All were
disappointing as the Rangers limped to a 29-41-12 mark, despite a
league-high payroll of $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler and GM Neil Smith were fired on March 28 with only four
games left in the regular season, when it became clear the Rangers
would again miss the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not coming with a blindfold on, it's not going to be
easy,'' the 50-year-old Low said of his new job. ''I may leave with
a blindfold on -- just make sure you give me a smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Low served as coach and GM of the Houston Aeros of the
International Hockey League last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their split, Low and Sather remained friends. Low said
he got advice from Sather during a season in which he led the
injury-plagued Aeros to a 44-29-9 mark and the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sather's first choice Kevin Lowe, Low's replacement as Oilers
coach, took Sather's job as Edmonton GM. It was then that Sather
turned his sights to Low to join him in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty exciting day for me,'' Low said. ''There are not
too many jobs in the world like the one I'm about to embark on.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Kyle, the coach of Hamilton, Edmonton's AHL affiliate, and
Ted Green, an assistant under Low and Lowe with the Oilers, were
hired as the Rangers' new assistant coaches. Green also is a former
Edmonton head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The familiarity and comfort level Sather had with the trio made
his decision easier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I interviewed a lot of people,'' Sather said. ''I kept coming
back to Ron, Ted and Walt. I knew I wouldn't have to go through a
honeymoon period.''
</P>
<P>
   Sather said the deal was completed over the weekend as Low
attended the wedding of Sather's son in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also made Don Maloney vice president of player
development and assistant general manager on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies third baseman Jeff Cirillo has
signed a contract extension that reportedly will keep him with the
team through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   A Rockies spokeswoman confirmed the agreement Wednesday, but
declined to provide details. A news conference is scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message seeking comment from Cirillo's agent was not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Previous reports said Cirillo was negotiating an extension that
would guarantee him about $28.5 million from 2002-05, with a club
option for 2006.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's All-Star game, Cirillo told the Denver Rocky
Mountain News his contract would be for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never considered myself a star, just one of the parts,''
he said. ''To be able to be paid what I'm going to get paid is
almost ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies acquired Cirillo, 30, from Milwaukee in a
nine-player, four-team trade in December. He has one year left on
his current contract
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo is batting .330 for the season.

<HEADLINE> US, N.Korea Missile Talks End  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- North Korea on Wednesday refused
to stop developing missiles for self defense, claiming Washington
has deployed ''thousands of missiles'' that threaten the communist
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is why the United States has no right to make such unjust
claims for the freeze of our missile capabilities,'' said Jang
Chang Chon, head of North Korea's bureau on U.S. affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jang said that Pyongyang regards its missile program as part of
its right to self-defense. However, North Korea remains willing to
discuss the possibility of curbing exports of missile technology if
paid enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We clarified that we will continue our discussions on the
condition that the U.S. gives compensation for our economic and
political losses in case of suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over North Korea's missile program ended in a
stalemate Wednesday, with the United States refusing to pay
Pyongyang to curb exports of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of talks, the North Koreans restated their
offer: $1 billion a year in exchange for a halt to missile
technology exports. They also refused to stop developing such
weapons for self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were the first in 16 months, and chief U.S.
negotiator, Robert Einhorn, assistant secretary of state for
proliferation, said no breakthrough had been expected. They agreed
to meet again at an undetermined time and location.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North Koreans should not be compensated for agreeing to
stop conducting activities they should not be conducting in the
first place,'' Einhorn said. ''We are not prepared to pay cash
compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn indicated that the long-reclusive, impoverished country
stood to gain far more politically and economically from a better
security environment and normalized relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims North Korea is the world's top exporter
of missile equipment and technology, to customers including
Pakistan and Iran, and wants development and exports of missiles
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pyongyang has said it will not negotiate its right to
develop defensive missiles, there are hopes it may be more flexible
on exports, though they are a vital source of hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   After rattling Asia in mid-1998 by test firing a missile over
Japan into the Pacific Ocean, North Korea recently agreed to a
moratorium on long-range missile tests in exchange for an easing of
U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   It has opened official talks with Japan, moved to establish
diplomatic relations with many countries in Asia and Europe, and
joined a security forum of Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   The talks come amid increasing North Korean willingness to
discuss defense issues, marked by the historic June summit between
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   This week's negotiations took on fresh importance in U.S. eyes
after last weekend's failed test for the proposed American missile
defense shield. Proponents of such tests say the United States
needs to develop a way to defend itself from states including North
Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In an unrelated development Wednesday, the Philippines and North
Korea signed an agreement establishing diplomatic relations,
opening the way for the Communist nation to participate in a
regional security meeting later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides hailed the agreement as a significant milestone
that took almost 25 years to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines had been the only Southeast Asian country
without formal ties with North Korea.

<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Exiled for months to government-owned
trailer parks, some refugees will soon be able to return to this
town ravaged by Hurricane Floyd, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state and town governments have agreed to complete a trailer
park in the Edgecombe County community in 30 to 40 days. The park
will comprise 65 mobile homes, as opposed to the camper-style
trailers refugees are living in, said Doug Boyd, an emergency
management official.
</P>
<P>
   September's storm paralyzed eastern North Carolina for weeks,
and killed 51 people, destroyed thousands of homes and washed away
millions of dollars of crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In Princeville, 90 percent of the dwellings, which housed 1,100
families, were flooded.
</P>
<P>
   The job of getting residents back home is being coordinated by
the town and the state Division of Emergency Management, which
oversees trailer parks in Edgecombe, Pitt and Lenoir counties for
flood victims. The parks must be closed by March.

<HEADLINE> Messier Returning to the Rangers  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark Messier is coming back to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, who captained the New York Rangers to the 1994 Stanley
Cup, only to leave as a free agent three years later, will rejoin
the team for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scheduled a news conference Thursday morning to
announce the deal that will reportedly pay the 39-year-old center
between $10 million to $11 million for two years.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season in New York, Messier led the Rangers to
their first championship in 54 years. He also won five titles with
the Oilers, four with Glen Sather as the coach and one with John
Muckler at the helm and Sather as GM.
</P>
<P>
   Sather left the Oilers just last month to become the GM with the
Rangers, and Messier's return to New York was almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, Sather hired former Oilers coach Ron Low to lead
the Rangers. Low replaced Muckler, fired along with GM Neil Smith
with only four games left in the Rangers' season.
</P>
<P>
   Sather revealed Wednesday that a Messier deal was close and
could be completed at any time.

<P>
   After the Rangers were eliminated in the 1997 Eastern Conference
finals, Messier left to sign with the Vancouver Canucks. Neither he
nor the Rangers have been in the playoffs since.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks opted to pay Messier a $2 million buyout for the
final two years of his five-year contract instead of being on the
hook for $6 million a season, making him an unrestricted free agent
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver hoped to bring him back at a reduced salary. Messier
had 17 goals and 37 assists in his final season with the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Messier, the fourth-leading scorer in NHL history and tops among
active players, first came to the Rangers just one game into the
1991-92 season in a trade with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Messier's return will bring smiles to the faces of Rangers fans
and many players. He should take pressure off current captain Brian
Leetch as well as Adam Graves and Mike Richter -- holdovers from New
York's championship team.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 NHL seasons, he has 627 goals and 1,087 assists. Messier
scored 183 goals and set up 335 others in six seasons with the
Rangers.

<HEADLINE> Robot Removes Woman's Gall Bladder  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A woman had her gall bladder removed by a
robot Wednesday, one day after the da Vinci Surgical System was
approved by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The da Vinci, approved for use at five U.S. hospitals on Tuesday
by the Food and Drug Administration, enables surgeons to operate by
manipulating joysticks at a computer terminal. Lenses inserted in
the patient's body give the surgeon a 3-D view of the person's
insides.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William E. Kelley Jr. performed the gall bladder surgery
Wednesday on 35-year-old Kimberly Briggs at Henrico Doctors
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very pleased. I think it went very smoothly,'' said
Kelley, who had been trained on the da Vinci but had used it to
operate only on pigs and cadavers before.
</P>
<P>
   Also pleased was Briggs, who was wheeled into a news conference
less than four hours after her surgery was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great,'' she said, adding that the less invasive
procedure would allow her to be home in time for her son Mario's
sixth birthday party on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery using the da Vinci has been approved only for abdominal
operations in the United States, but the $1 million robot is being
more widely used in Europe, Kelley said. FDA approval for da Vinci
on cardiac surgery could come this year, Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hospitals are conducting clinical trials of robot-assisted
heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   With wrist-like devices at the end of the robotic arms giving
surgeons a full range of precise movement, the da Vinci is a
significant advance on laparoscopic surgery, a decade-old
breakthrough that already had made much surgery less invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Katz, a cardiac surgeon, said using a computer screen
to view the area magnified by 10 times and having a robot do the
work with precision are ''incredibly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives you the ability to get your instruments where they
need to be,'' said Katz, who is trained to use da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said, da Vinci could make operations involving
large incisions virtually obsolete, allowing patients instead to
cover their incisions with ''a few Band-Aids.''
</P>
<P>
   Five hospitals are trained to use the da Vinci now: Henrico
Doctors Hospital in Richmond; Baylor University Medical Center in
Dallas; Ohio State University in Columbus; East Carolina University
in Greenville, N.C.; and the San Ramon Medical Center in
California.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead in NY Buildings Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three bodies were discovered Wednesday in the
wreckage of a pair of collapsed residential buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings, a four-story brownstone apartment
building, collapsed Tuesday night on a quiet street in Brooklyn,
bringing down much of an adjacent three-story building. The roof of
the first building fell without breaking, making it more difficult
for rescue workers to look for survivors underneath.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of painstaking digging by hand, firefighters made
their first grisly discovery: the body of Leonard Walit, 72, buried
beneath 4 feet of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, rescue workers found the body of Khay
Cochran, 74. And late Wednesday night, the body of Harriet Walit
was found.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the collapse of two buildings was possibly tied
to a gas leak, although KeySpan Energy said it was too early to
determine a cause. Late Wednesday, a city official said authorities
were also investigating a report that a new gas dryer had been
installed in the building that collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The collapsed building was home to the Walits, who were fixtures
in the neighborhood for 30 years, and co-owned the building next
door. Both the Walits and Cochran had apparently gone inside after
smelling gas, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were good neighbors, and good people,'' said Jack Lucas,
head of the block association, which had been planning its party
for Saturday.
