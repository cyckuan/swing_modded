<HEADLINE> NATO Uses New Bombs against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia May 3 (Xinhua) --NATO planes knocked the
lights out and put the power off in 70 percent of Yugoslavia
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Using a special weapon for the first time on the 40th day of
air strikes, NATO said on Monday it had short-circuited much of
the national grid without damaging the electrical power
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It appears to be a variety of cluster bomb which bursts over
its intended target, firing out numerous bomblets which open in
turn and scatter their threads over the local transformer park,
according to Reuters reports Monday.
</P>
<P>
Each contains wound-up pellets of gossamer-like carbon thread,
a highly conductive material that shorts out any electrical
connection it comes into contact with, the reports said..
</P>
<P>
The bomblets are about the size of a soda can. One found in
Yugoslavia bore the marking BLU-114B.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the United States used an
anti-grid bomb in the Gulf War called KIT 18. It was not clear if
the weapon used over Yugoslavia was the same or an improved
version.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has cleared 48,000
anti-personnel land mines along 10,000 kms of power lines and on
10,000 hectares of farm land since 1993, a senior military officer
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the first meeting of
signatory states of the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of
use, store, production and transmission of anti-personnel land
mines, Defense Minister Aguiar Mazula noted however that two
million land mines remain in the country, and their clearance will
cost Mozambique about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
International cooperation is of great importance in removing
them, Mazula said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambicans are still living in danger since land mines are
claiming lives and injuring people daily, especially women and
children, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
While Mozambique is committed to shouldering the obligation as
mapped out in the Ottawa convention, Mazula urged the
international community to continue its support for Mozambique's
effort in the removal of land mines on its land.
</P>
<P>
The land mine prohibition meeting, which has attracted over
1,000 representatives from 72 countries and international
organizations including the United Nations, will come to a close
here Wednesday.

PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The eldest grandson of former French
President Charles de Gaulle, who bears the same name as his
grandfather, was asked Monday to give up his name by a European
parliament deputy for associating with the French extreme right
National Front.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Euro deputy Olivier Duhamel asked de Gaulle, who
is also a Euro deputy, to change his name ``to respect the honor
of Europe'' during a session of the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, according to a report by Agence France-Presse (AFP).

<P>
``Cannot the European Parliament ask that `de Gaulle' change
the name to respect the honor of Europe?'' AFP quoted Duhamel as

De Gaulle is the number two on the list of the National Front
group headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen for the European elections to be
held on June 13.

<HEADLINE> Low Interest, Mortgage Rates Help U.S. Construction Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending for
the first quarter of this year was 10 percent higher than in the
same period last year, according to the Commerce Department's
report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Low interest and mortgage rates have fueled spending on
construction projects, which rose 0.5 percent in March, despite a
drop in commercial building, the Department said. That came on top
of four previous months of increases, including a big 2 percent
jump in February.
</P>
<P>
Spending on building new homes, which consumers have been
snapping up at record rates, jumped 2 percent in March after a
smaller increase in February. Spending was up on construction of
both single-family homes and apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
But spending on commercial construction fell 2.1 percent, a
large drop, still not enough to wipe out the huge 4.0 percent
increase the month before. Spending on office building projects
increased slightly, but was more than offset by declines in
industrial, hotel and retail construction.
</P>
<P>
Government construction spending rose 0.3 percent, with
highways, sewer systems and water supply facilities leading the
way.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unveil Deregulation Package for Obuchi's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States on
Monday unveiled a package of Japanese deregulation commitments as
a gift of Japan's Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi for his visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The package outlined Japan's commitments to cut red tape in
telecommunications, housing, medical devices and pharmaceuticals,
energy and in the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
It also included commitments by Japan to expand its financial
services deregulation efforts and beef up its competition policy.
Tokyo also agreed to make its regulation practices more open and
transparent to foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
Many of the commitments agreed to in the deregulation package
were promised by Japan during the 1998 meeting of leaders of the
Group of Seven major industrial countries in Birmingham, England.
U.S. and Japanese officials have spent a year fleshing out many of
those promises and some of the commitments in the latest package
are new, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Fisher, U.S. deputy trade representative, said if Japan
fails to live up to its commitments on lowering telephone
interconnection rates, which reduces costs for competing new
telephone companies, the United States would launch a complaint at
the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials said Japan's agreements to accelerate
introduction of new performance-based standards for three-story
multifamily wood houses should help open the $42 billion building
materials market to U.S. firms immediately. Other deregulation
commitments, including an agreement to no longer consider nails
used in electric nail guns as weapons, should create new
opportunities for U.S. firms, they said.
</P>
<P>
Japan also agreed to inject more competition into its medical
devices and drug markets and to speed up the approval process for
new drugs. U.S. officials said 80 percent of new drugs put on the
market in the last five years are not available in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also treat nutritional supplements as a food item in
regulations. That will make it easier to bring those items into
the $6 billion Japanese market, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
On energy, Japan agreed to regulatory changes that will speed
up efforts to upgrade power generating facilities. It also
agreed to bring standards for self-service gasoline pumps in
line with international standards.

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Monday
that it welcomes a role of Ukraine in a peacekeeping force for
Kosovo, provided NATO was at the core of the force.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly value Ukraine's participation in the Bosnia
exercise and would welcome Ukraine's participation in a Kosovo
international security force," said State Department spokesman
James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The nature and composition of the future force in Kosovo is the
main remaining difference between the United States and Russia,
</P>
<P>
Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who visited Belgrade
last week, said on Monday he was bringing a letter for President
Bill Clinton with concrete proposals on how to end the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Russia had begun to show greater understanding of
why Washington insists on a strong NATO role in the peace force
but a gap remained between the two powers.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav authorities said that the would accept a non-NATO
force armed only for self-defence.
</P>
<P>
"They refuse to accept two of the key points, which are that
the Serb forces must withdraw and that an international security
force with real military capabilities must deploy if we're going
to provide the security that will be a magnate for the refugees to
return," Rubin said.

KUWAIT CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Monday welcomed the upcoming visit here
by his Yemeni counterpart Abdul Qader Ba-Jammal aimed at mending
the bilateral ties affected by Sanaa's sympathy with Iraq
during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, also First Deputy Prime Minister, told Kuwait News
Agency (KUNA) that he had officially invited Ba-Jammal for the
visit, but indicating that the date of the visit has yet to be
decided.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources were quoted by KUNA as saying that
most probably the visit would take place after the first
bi-annual meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders,
slated in the Saudi capital of Riyadh next Monday.
</P>
<P>
A high-level Yemeni delegation will arrive here very soon
to prepare for Ba-Jammal's upcoming visit, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the financial, administrative and technical
preparations for the reopening of the Yemeni Embassy would be
finished before the visit.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Ba-Jammal's visit would end in
more clear positions on regional and international issues of
mutual concern, especially on the Iraqi problem.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait downgraded the bilateral relations with several Arab
nations, including Yemen, which sided with Iraq during the
1990-91 Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The ice began to thaw since May 1997 when Kuwait declared
it was "willing to improve ties with all Arab countries
except Iraq."
</P>
<P>
In March, Kuwait normalized its ties with Jordan, also
sympathized with Baghdad in the 1991 Gulf War, following an
official visit by Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel-Ilah
Al-Khatib.

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Monday the U.S.-led NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia will not
end despite the release of three U.S. POWs by the Yugoslav
authorities.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the three POWs, U.S. civil rights leader

Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) started to bomb Yugoslavia's
military and civilian targets, even refugee convoys. However, the

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqi Civilians Killed in U.S., British Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi civilians were killed and
12 others were injured on Monday in U.S. and British warplanes
attacks, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that according to preliminary report,
Iraqi anti-aircraft units hit an enemy plane.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the spokesman
said that at 10:33 (0633 GMT), 12 formations of enemy warplanes
coming from Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Neineva, Erbil and Dohuk provinces.
</P>
<P>
These planes fired directional bombs at a civilian target,
killing two civilians and injuring 12 others, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired missiles at the enemy
plane, and according to the report of observation posts, one enemy
plane has been hit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared several times in the past that its air
defenses have downed U.S. and British warplanes violating its
airspace, but failed to present relevant evidence.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain denied all such claims, saying
all their planes enforing the no-fly zones returned to their bases
in Turkey, Saudi Arabia or Kuwait safely.
</P>
<P>
According to another report of the Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on Monday met with commanders of air
forces and anti-aircraft forces. The agency did not elaborate on
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi military spokesman said that 13 formations of enemy
planes from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace in the day.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British airstrikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones and the Iraqi air defenses have almost become daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Japan to Reduce Steel Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on Monday
warned Japan to reduce its steel imports "on a consistent basis"
or the United States will act to block those imports.
</P>
<P>
"We will take action if steel imports do not return to their
pre-crisis levels on a consistent basis," Clinton said at a joint
news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi after
their summit meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Playing by the rules of trade is the best way to sustain a
consensus for open trade," Clinton added. He threatened the United
States would act to keep Japanese steel out of U.S. markets if
those imports continue to exceed the levels existing prior to the
Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said last week it had determined that
Japanese steel companies were engaging in illegal steel dumping,
selling abroad at less than home-market prices, and that tariffs
of up to 67 percent could be imposed on hot-rolled carbon steel, a
widely used product.
</P>
<P>
Such tariffs, which could be imposed retroactively to
mid-November, effectively would price that type of steel out of
the U.S market.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it is important that Japan respect both the
principles of open trade and fair trade. "I have fought for both
objectives. It will help Japan adapt to the challenges of the new
global economy," Clinton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Students of the Columbine High
School in Colorado State of the United States finally returned to
class Monday after two weeks of school closure due to the campus
shooting tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The students arrived at the Chatfield High School, about 4
kilometers away from the Columbine School, to continue their study
as their own school was still closed for crime investigation.
</P>
<P>
The roughly 2,000 Columbine students have not been in class
since two teenagers went on a shooting and bombing rampage on
April 20, killing 12 students and a teacher before taking their
own lives. Some 50 bombs were found in the school campus.
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the shootings continued, Jefferson
County Sheriff John P. Stone said the man suspected of selling a
semiautomatic handgun used in the massacre could surrender Monday.
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was held Sunday at the Red Rock amphitheater
west of Denvor, capital of Colorado State, to pay tributes to the
dead in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The campus shooting incident, which is the most serious campus
shooting in U.S. history, has shocked the whole nation and
triggered a heated debate on its causes.
</P>
<P>
American people have blamed the tragedy on the violent culture
in U.S. society and easy access to assault weapons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya FM: Visit to China "Very Successful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya
Godana  Monday described his visit to China as "very successful",
which he said has reinforced the bilateral cooperation and
enhanced mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in the Kenyan capital Nairobi here, Godana told
Xinhua that he and Sun Guangxiang, China's vice-Minister for
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation had signed an exchange of
notes that the Chinese government will offer a five million yuan
(about 600,000 U.S. dollars) grant to the Kenyan government on
projects agreed on by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Godana has just wrapped up his five-day official visit to
China, the first of its kind since he assumed the foreign
portfolio more than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government pledged its commitment to continue to
help the developing countries within its means, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Godana also disclosed that he and Chinese senior officials had
discussed issus like the trade imbalance between the two
countries, which is in favor of China.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity is there in China for Kenyan businessmen
because I learned during the trip that some of Kenya's products
like tea do have a market in China," he said, adding that "Kenyan
businessmen face a challenge to tap the enormous potential offered
by the Chinese market."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side expressed the willingness to come to Kenya
for investment, which will also contribute to balancing the
trade, " Godana said.
</P>
<P>
 China has promised to set up a trade and investment center in
Kenya, which is designed to facilitate the activities of Chinese
businessmen and boost their investment in Kenya, and the center
will hopefully be built before the end of this year, he revealed.
</P>
<P>
China has interest in investing in food-processing, textile,
electronics and mechanical manufacturing, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the Chinese government to encourage its
companies to invest in this East African country, which is an
important gateway to enter

the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and the future
East African Community, he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that a Chinese businessmen delegation will visit
Kenya in June to explore the opportunities for economic
cooperation and investment.
</P>
<P>
On the experience which Kenya and China share, he observed that
Kenya can learn from China's experience in agriculture, since
China with a population of 1.2 billion, about a quarter of the
world population, has solved the problem of feeding its people on
its arable land which accounts for only 7 percent of the world
total.
</P>
<P>
In the field of education cooperation, he said that China
requested Kenya to encourage its students to go and study in
China's universities, especially in the areas of science and
technology.

<HEADLINE> Serbian and U.S. Pen Pals Anguish over NATO Airstrike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- "War will start. I am scared" --
a female Serbian undergraduate e-mailed those horrendous lines to
his American university tutor, kicking off a candid exchange of
views and an outlet of indignation at NATO's airstrike against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Washington Post", under the title "On Opposite Sides, But
Not Opponents", published on Sunday 9 e-mail letters from Daniela,
a 24-year-old university student in Yugoslavia and Gary Borisy, a
56-year-old professor of molecular biology in the United States.
Daniela left Eastern Europe last summer for the University of
Wisconsin where she took a five-month internship at Borisy's lab.
In December, she returned to Yugoslavia to continue her study. As
the NATO bombing drew nearer, the Serbian lady and her American
tutor began serious discussions on the issue over internet.
</P>
<P>
"I am not hurt with bombs, but I am hurt with lies! You are
looking on your TV and hearing only one side (especially on CNN),
only things that your government wants to tell you. You are not
here and you really don't know what is happening here, what is
happening with Serbian people," Daniela wrote in a letter dated
March 27.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombings "hit all areas around Belgrade", "they hit
some civilians' houses, several schools, they damage on hospital
for children with mental diseases, and medicine(pharmacy)
industry", and "in Kosovo town of Pristina they hit center of town
with three bombs and also damage the Serbian Orthodox monastery
Gracanica (it was made in 1315)", the letter read.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated March 29, Daniela wrote: "NATO is NOT
preventing humanitarian catastrophe, NATO is making the biggest
catastrophe this country has ever seen. This is a catastrophe for
Serbian people as well as Albanians, Hungarians, Slovaks and
whichever nation is living in this country."
</P>
<P>
These attacks by NATO, she added, are an example of the "law of
power" instead of, as it should be, "the power of law".
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated April 5, the Serbian lady described the
sorrow plight her hometown and her family suffered on Easter
season, a traditional holiday for Christians all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"It should be happy holiday, but it was not. NATO attacked my
hometown two times, first on Good Friday and then on Easter. They
dropped 21 bombs on the Zastava car factory in Kragujevac (my
hometown). I heard on CNN that NATO thinks that Zastava can
produce components for planes, but that is so funny. There is
nothing there but cars! My town was crying, because Zastava was
for them more than a factory, more than buildings. It was bread!"
</P>
<P>
"Both of my parents worked there. Now, they don't have jobs...I
don't receive my scholarship anymore because my country is in the
war," the Serbian undergraduate wrote.
</P>
<P>
Professor Borisy, in his letter on March 28, said that he
agreed with Daniela that NATO bombs "will not do anything good,
they will be the cause for spreading fights on Kosovo", and as a
result, "both Serbs and Albanians will suffer".
</P>
<P>
He told his student that the Congress and people in the U.S.
are "very divided" about the bombing and most people don't really
understand the situation.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing is "supposedly to stop Milosevic by destroying
the infrastructure of your country, but instead it only causes
ruin and suffering of the people", Borisy wrote in a letter dated
April 5.
</P>
<P>
"We should be helping to integrate Serbia and the other former
Yugoslav countries as full participants within a peaceful Europe.
Bombing does the opposite! And I am sure you are right that the
bombing in Kosovo is making it impossible for many people to live
there," the professor wrote to his Serbian student.
</P>
<P>
In another letter, dated April 14, Borisy wrote: "At the
beginning of the Vietnam War, only two U.S. senators had the
courage to vote against it. One of them was William Fulbright, who
referred to the war as an "arrogance of power." Now, NATO is also
showing "an arrogance of power", he added.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba to Visit Libya on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian president Frederick Chiluba
will leave here for Libya Tuesday to hold consultative talks with
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on how to put an end to the
nine-month war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Zambian Foreign Ministry said here Monday
that Chiluba will be accompanied by Presidential Affairs Minister
Eric Silwamba, Minister for the Religious Desk Peter Chintala and
other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi's special envoy, Libyan Assistant Secretary for African
 Affairs, Ali Trek, said here Sunday that peace efforts made by
Gaddafi and Chiluba for an end to the conflict in DRC is not
contradictory.
</P>
<P>
The visiting envoy called on the Southern African countries to
respect and support the peace agreement signed in Libya last month
by Congolese president Laurent Kabila and Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
He said although not all the parties involved in the conflict
were present, the peace agreement was a right step toward the
peaceful solution to the war, which has involved six other African
countries.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels fighting to topple Kabila and their main ally
Rwanda said any deal was meaningless without involving the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba described the summit meeting hosted by Gaddafi as a
step in the right direction but said the agreement was not binding
because the rebels were not present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Makes Television Speech on Yugoslav Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac Monday
made a televised speech on the Yugoslav crisis, saying that France
holds no illusion about the latest initiatives by Belgrade, but
will continue looking for a political solution with Russia.
</P>
<P>
``Without allowing themselves to be abused by the lures of
Belgrade, the allies will continue to look for a political
solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the release of three American soldiers by
the Yugoslav government, the latest proposal by Yugoslavia to NATO
and the letter sent by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
U.S. President Bill Clinton through the American black leader
Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
``Our efforts should associate the allies and Russia, which has
chosen to engage itself with them in a concertation taking fully
into account the demands expressed by the United Nations Secretary
General,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who will fly to Moscow on May 13 to discuss with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin the Yugoslav crisis, also said
that there is no other solution ``which conforms with the morality
than obtaining the acceptance by Belgrade of all the conditions as
are demanded by the international community.''
</P>
<P>
``Stop the killings and destructions, withdrawal of the Serb
forces from Kosovo, return of the refugees, the guarantee of their
security by a force of peace created by the United Nations
Security Council, put to work of a large autonomy for the
province,'' said the French president.
</P>
<P>
He said that ``no confidence can be made to the authorities of
Belgrade, which has expelled tens of thousands of Kosovars from
the city of Prizren'' at the same time when the three American
soldiers were released.
</P>
<P>
``There is not any reason to change the strategy (of NATO),''
he said.

<P>
LUANDA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The government troops of Angola have
beat back the assaults by the forces of the rebel National Union
for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) on the strategic targets
in the central City of Huambo, a military source here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The military source who refused to be named said UNITA launched
its offensive on Huambo at 23:00 p.m. Sunday and fighting lasted
until early Monday morning , but he did not revealed the
casualties on either side.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA targets, the source said, were the airport, the fuel
stores and power plant in the city.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA men tried hard to penetrate into the city in the past
10 days but failed, only ended up in killing two civilians and
looting some houses in their action, he charged.
</P>
<P>
The situation in central Angola became tense again since March
after the government forces failed in its offensive on Andulo,
UNITA's headquarters in Bie Province. Since then, UNITA started
surrounding Huambo and Kuito, capital of Bie province.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Huambo along with the tens of thousands of
refugees having poured in have fallen victims. They are now living
in acute need of food and medicine, suffering from hunger and
diseases.

ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A political solution to the Yugoslav
crisis must be found and Greece had offered its services in this
direction, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas described the bombing by
NATO of a Yugoslav bus as "the sole consequence" of war, he
stressed that this should make more imperative the need to seek a
diplomatic solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Yugoslavia's decision to free the three U.S.
soldiers captured for over 30 days was "a positive act."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted that Greece abstained from the
decision by the European Union (EU) to impose an embargo on
Yugoslavia but would nevertheless adhere to it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greece's Economy and Finance Minister Yannos
Papantoniou said Monday that a "Marshall plan" for the
reconstruction of the Balkans would total 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that in this framework, and while Greece was active in
an effort to end the Yugoslav crisis, the Greek government decided
to take measures to participate in a reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged Greek businessmen to coordinate their
efforts to preserve the Greek presence in the Balkan region.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Aims to Curb Abuse of Trademarks on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) has set out recommendations in an effort to
curb the abuse of trademarks on the Internet in a newly published
report.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the WIPO report sets out a definition for
the abusive sue of trademarks on the Internet. The report, which
addresses questions relating to domain names, intellectual
property and related dispute-resolution issues, was initiated by
WIPO in July 1998 at the request by the United States, one of
WIPO's 171 members.
</P>
<P>
WIPO will present the report to its members at their annual
meeting here in September. The recommendations have been presented
to the Interim Board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN) for consideration when it meets on May
25-27 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
In the report, WIPO has recommended that the contact details of
applicants using existing generic top level domains (GTLDs) be
collected, and that those details be freely and instantly
available over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
WIPO also recommends the establishment of a uniform and
mandatory administrative dispute-resolution system, under which
panels of three experts would apply the streamlined, quick and
cost-effective procedures outlined in the report, to review
multiple claims and eliminate cases of clear abuse of trademark
holders' rights, leaving the more complex cases to the courts.
</P>
<P>
The third recommendation that WIPO has made is a system by
which owners of globally famous marks can obtain exclusions
prohibiting others from registering the marks as domain names in
gTLDs. The status of these marks would be determined by a panel of
experts drawn from a list administered by WIPO.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the WIPO report recommends further study and
consultation on the feasibility of adding a differentiated
non-commercial and use-restricted domain that could address the
need for privacy and free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Provided that the recommendations in the report are adopted and
implemented, WIPO believes that the introduction of new gTLDs is
possible. However, it does maintain that any new gTLDs should, in
any event, be added to the domain name system in a slow and
controlled manner to ensure that the impact of this experience is
monitored and assessed.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conflict Cost Sets to Skyrocket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN May 3 (Xinhua)-- Both Germany and the European Union (EU)
have paid millions for Kosovo conflict, and they will bear far
more, German officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far Germany has spent over 687 million marks (382 million
U.S. dollars) on its involvement in the NATO air strikes and on
aid for the Kosovo civilians, the German embassy in Albania told
the Deutsche Presse Agentur (dpa) news agency.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's military spending is estimated to about 589 million
marks, and humanitarian aid for Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia has
been some 84 million marks.
</P>
<P>
A further 15 million marks has been spent on bringing Kosovo
refugees to Germany and providing them with housing, food and
medical services.
</P>
<P>
Germany accepted 10,000 Kosovo refugees since April 17.
Interior Minister Otto Schily said Monday he planned to receive a
further 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the EU has so far paid 557 million euros (590
million U.S. dollars) for helping the Kosovo refugees. To the sum,
Germany has contributed 43 million Euros.
</P>
<P>
But compared to the expected price of rebuilding the region, the
amounts already spent seem small change, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The "cautious cost estimates" for rebuilding Kosovo, Albania
and Macedonia will be a minimum of 30 billion euros, said Klaus
Haensch, th deputy chairman of the Social Democrats in the
European Parliament.

representative office in East Jerusalem, has asked Israel to
reconsider its orders to close three Palestinian offices inside
the building.
</P>
<P>
An urgent appeal issued by the Orient House on Monday said this
act of Israel is in contradiction to the peace process, a process
the Orient House has been committed to.
</P>
<P>
"Such a closure will be detrimental to the interests of the
Israelis and the Palestinians alike, and to the future of our
generations who will find a hope in peacefully resolving their
differences," the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
The closure might prove to be a major factor in the escalation
of public unrest, disturbance and threat to stability, it warned.
</P>
<P>
All activities, such as conferences, workshops, people to
people programs organized by the Orient House in the past, were
aimed at serving as a driving force for achieving shared
objectives towards realization of peace, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government decided on April 22 to issue closure
orders on three Palestinian offices in the Orient House,
including the office of Faisal Husseini, minister in charge of
Jerusalem affairs of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The PNA has strongly criticized the decision, saying such a
forced closure was illegal and could cause unrest not only in
Jerusalem, but in the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani to implement the orders at once. But
Kahalani refused that, saying the Orient House should be given
some time to go through legal procedures due to its rejections of
closure.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani was scheduled to meet chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erikat on Monday to discuss this issue, but the meeting was
postponed till the coming Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Israeli Public Security Ministry will decide
whether to enforce the closing orders.
</P>
<P>
Israeli peace groups also criticized the decision, accusing it
of using the Jerusalem issue as a political weapon for election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Israeli authorities demolished two
Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem on Monday, bringing the
total number of the Palestinian houses demolished since the
beginning of this year to 44.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians set up on Monday a sit-in tent at the Herods
Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem, to protest against Israeli
measures in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Infant Deaths Preventable: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a 1998 progress report, the UNICEF Harare office Monday said
children were also affected by acute respiratory infections
(ARI's), intestinal infections (Diarrohea), nutritional
deficiencies and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
However, on a positive note, UNICEF said because the government
had initiated an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in 1981
against the six major child killing diseases, the number of child
deaths had been kept reasonably low.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1981, EPI coverage had risen from 25 percent in 1982 to
over 95 percent in 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of this, polio and diphtheria rarely occur and
outbreaks of measles have been largely contained," it said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said the area of maternal mortality was still of grave
concern.
</P>
<P>
"More often than not, maternal mortality occurs as a result of
delays in seeking and or receiving treatment," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that deaths of many children could be attributed
to birth attendants who were not adequately trained.

<HEADLINE> MediaOne Sets Stage for Bidding War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- MediaOne Group set stage for a
bidding war Monday when the cable television company announced its
plan to accept AT&AMP;T's merger offer for 55.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T made its surprise offer to acquire MediaOne two weeks ago
in a bid to break up a Comcast-MediaOne deal. Comcast Corp.
offered 48 billion dollars to buy MediaOne on March 23.
</P>
<P>
MediaOne said here today its board concluded that AT&AMP;T's bid
financially superior to Comcast's offer. MediaOne's board decided
to terminate its merger agreement with Comcast at a special
meeting in Dallas last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
MediaOne's 14 million subscribers at home and broad were at
stake for fight between AT&AMP;T and Comcast because they could be
converted into high-speed Internet subscribers. Whoever controls
MediaOne could have more control over the potential Internet.
</P>
<P>
The bidding war also attracted some big players. Microsoft
Corp. and American Online Inc. have expressed interest in teaming
up with Comcast to counter AT&AMP;T's bid, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said both Microsoft and American Online acted with
the full support of Comcast and as of yesterday afternoon, Comcast
remained "very encouraged" about its prospects for making a
winning counteroffer.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Reforms Road Rehabilitation Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is currently
pursuing policy reforms which aims to put road rehabilitation and
maintenance on a more sustainable basis by building up local
contracting capacity through using labor-based methods.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Works and Supply Godden Mandandi said this while
opening the Seventh Regional Seminar for Labor Based Practitioners
in sub-Saharan Africa here with the theme of contracting in
employment intensive works.
</P>
<P>
Mandandi said the government has been implementing reforms
program to re-align public institutions engaged in the road
rehabilitation and maintenance operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of reforms is to enhance private sector
participation in the public sector responsibilities and to
maximize the use of locally available human and material
resources.
</P>
<P>
Mandandi said two projects have so far been carried out in the
country, the district road improvement and maintenance project of
1987 to 1994 and the road maintenance project of 1991 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said the objectives of the two pilot projects were to
demonstrate the cost effectiveness of using labor based methods in
construction and maintenance of roads especially feeder roads,
rural roads and highway maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The government, through these policy reform efforts, intended
to create about 30,000 new jobs for the people in the road sector
through using labor-based small scale contractors, he said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Cease-Fire on Ethio-Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Monday called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to
immediately end their border fighting and to start implementing
the 11-point OAU framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
In his monthly news briefing, OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash said
OAU's position is immediately ending the border war to implement
the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Without the stop of the war, they cannot do anything," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists that OAU's current Chairman and President
of Burkina Faso Blaise Compaore will visit the Horn of Africa very
soon to meet leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea for an immediate end
of the fighting between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent visit by the United Nations special
envoy for Africa, Mohammed Sahnoun, the OAU spokesman said the
U.N. special envoy met with the OAU Secretary General. He also met
with representatives of the OAU high-level delegation made up of
Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti and representative of the OAU
Secretary General in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
"Sahnoun's mission is within the framework of the OAU, is not
coming for new proposals or new initiatives," he said, adding that
his mission is mainly for consultations with leaders of lthe two
countries to put an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Dagash said OAU welcomes the Sirte Agreement signed by presidents
of Uganda, the DRC, Chad, Eritrea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
However, he said OAU wants to harmonize the Lusaka agreement
with the Sirte agreement to bring all parties involved together to
realize the cease- fire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The OAU spokesman also appealed to return civil rule to the
Comoros.
</P>
<P>
He said, OAU condemns the coup d'etat which took place just one
week after the signing of the Antananarivo agreement, adding that
"we don't recognize" the military regime there.

<P>
Opening a policy seminar for diplomatic staff and aid agencies,
Sadza said a number of aid programs have failed in Africa because
of lack of understanding between donor and recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
She added lack of understanding regarding the social,
political, economic and cultural realities of recipient countries
had led to the collapse of many development projects.
</P>
<P>
"Millions of dollars have been wasted in projects which have
not benefited the African continent," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was important for the recipient countries as well
as donors to understand the policies and operating frameworks on
each side.
</P>
<P>
She also called for regular dialog between donors operating in
Zimbabwe and the government.
</P>
<P>
This, she said, would enable both parties to identify problems
in the management of aid and find solutions.
</P>
<P>
Without adequate consultations, Sadza said, donor community aid
programs would not succeed, and waste of national resources would
ensue.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar was held in Harare to enhance good working
relationships between donors and government agencies responsible
for aid management.

<P>
Deputy Energy Minister for Water Affairs Rasoul Zargar said
that Iran is currently cooperating with Russia in this field, the

Zargar said that the center will seek the latest in cloud
seeding technology, conduct research on the sites suitable for
cloud seeding projects and set up a data bank on country's weather

He said that Iran started a joint venture cloud seeding
project in Karaj and Jajoroud of Tehran province in 1974 in
cooperation with a Canadian company and the project raised the
precipitation rate by 18 percent within a period of four years.

LUANDA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, an island
African country in the Atlantic Ocean, has for the first time had
its 19 home-trained professionals ever since its independence in
1975.
</P>
<P>
At a graduation ceremony held in Sao Tome, capital of the small
island country recently, Prime Minister Quiherme Posser da Costa
conferred bachelor degrees on the 19 graduates who major in
finance, management and information.
</P>
<P>
The 19 students have finished their five-year study in a
private institute of information, management and finance.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that home-trained professionals in
science and technology is of realistic importance to the country's
economic development and the fight against poverty, adding that
training the much- needed personnel will not only save the country
a lot of money, but can also solve the problems of unemployment in
the low-educated group of people.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Tome government is also encouraging its colleges and
institutes to establish ties with their counterparts in developed
countries, Costa said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are some undergraduates majoring in
laws, language, biology and maths at the Super Polytechnics
Institute established two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome is listed by the United Nations as one of the poorest
nations in the world, with youths having to go to universities for
studies in Europe or the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Airstrikes to Continue, Reiterates Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Monday the U.S.-led NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia will not
end despite the release of three U.S. POWs by the Yugoslav
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia must show "unambiguous evidence" that the withdrawal
of its forces is underway before the alliance pauses in its
airstrikes, said Clinton, adding refugees must return home and an
international security force must be able to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Clinton also said U.N. troops could
be part of the mission, signaling that the administration would be
open to negotiating the makeup of the force.
</P>
<P>
The president also said U.S. troops must be part of the
operation so that Kosovo refugees will feel safe to return home.
</P>
<P>
"What's subject to negotiations is who's in the security forces
-- how's it going to work," Clinton said, stressing there is a lot
to talk when he meets Russia's Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the three POWs, U.S. civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson, who arrived at the Air Force base after a trip to
Belgrade, strongly urged Clinton to talk with Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic and resolve the crisis through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, speaking to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland, said, "We must seize this moment to take the step to
dramatic diplomacy from bloody, protracted war."
</P>
<P>
Clinton thanked Jackson for his diplomatic effort, but added
the United States cannot forget the plight of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
"When will these people see their home again, with the safety
and rights Mr. Milosevic has often pledged but never delivered?"
Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of refugees have fled Kosovo since the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) started to bomb Yugoslavia's
military and civilian targets, even refugee convoys. However, the
alliance has put the blame on Belgrade.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Francesco Frangialli,
Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (WTO), said
Monday Africa's immense tourism resources remain untapped, thus
its benefit from the industry is poor.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said out of 625 million global tourist arrivals
last year, Africa had only 125 million, accounting for 9.6
billion U.S. dollars out of the global profits of 455 billion
dollars, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 "Within the same period ECOWAS recorded about 25 million

<P>
Frangialli made the remarks at the opening of the joint 33rd
WTO Commission for Africa meeting, 24th Africa Travel Association
annual conference and the convocation of African Ministers of
Tourism in Accra.
</P>
<P>
 The five-day meeting is the first to be held jointly by the
two organizations and the first to be held in Ghana and Africa.
</P>
<P>
 Over 1,500 officials, including 27 African ministers, are
attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
 Frangialli said Africa has great tourism potentials that
warrant the commitment of their governments to its development.
</P>
<P>
 Frangialli pledged WTO's support to Africa to ensure that the
 continent realizes the full benefits of its tourism potential.
</P>
<P>
 Mike Gizo, Ghana's Minister of Tourism, also said Africa's
share of international tourism is very poor and stressed the need
for African countries to form coalitions to fully utilize the
resources.

<HEADLINE> Sunken U.S. Boat Has Faulty Seal Days Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators are focusing
on whether a faulty drive-shaft seal and a large canopy combined
to help drag 13 people to their deaths aboard a fast-sinking
tourist excursion boat.
</P>
<P>
The World War II-vintage vessel had been in the repair shop
just two days before it sank in Lake Hamilton Arkansas State
Saturday, drowning 13 of its 21 passengers, a member of the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
NTSB member John Hammerschmidt said investigators want to know
whether company mechanics actually made any repairs, and what was
done.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the amphibious boat, which can travel on both
land and water, sank in a matter of seconds as passengers
scrambled for life preservers.
</P>
<P>
Some victims, especially those near the center of the vessel,
may have been prevented from swimming free by an overhead canopy.
</P>
<P>
"The canopy of the vessel appears to be a significant factor
in escaping the vessel," said Hammerschmidt, whose team of
investigators interviewed survivors Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday was the first time the boat had been out since, and
the driver was about seven minutes from shore when she realized
the boat was taking on water, according to Hammerschmidt.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, the Miss Majestic, is one of several amphibious
vehicles that have rolled and floated through Hot Springs for 40
years without any previous fatalities.

ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
said here Monday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) could not exercise sovereignty in the name of its members
and it did not have such authorization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Greek Parliament, Simitis said that the Greek
government recognized the importance of collective regional
security organizations and for that reason Greece participated in
NATO, but Greece did not wish and did not consider it correct for
NATO to be transformed into an international security
organization.
</P>
<P>
Greece did not agree that the alliance could act based on its
principles, independent of those established by the United
Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier also stressed the need for strengthening the
European Union's common foreign policy and political security.

<HEADLINE> New Law to Guarantee Press Freedom in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Press Bill, to be tabled in
Parliament soon, will guarantee greater press freedom, Kenya's
Information and Broadcasting Minister Joseph Nyagah said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the bill will promote the development of dynamic
and responsible print and electronic media, Nyagah told a
conference marking the World Press Freedom Day.
</P>
<P>
Nyagah told participants in a workshop on radio and television
media that the bill will be in place before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Nyagah emphasized that there was need to create laws to
regulate electronic media in the era of pluralism.
</P>
<P>
The current law regulating broadcasting is the Kenya
Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) Act Chapter 21 of the Laws of
Kenya and does not apply to the rest of the electronic media, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country did not have a broadcasting Act to
regulate ownership, development and licensing of radio and TV.

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen Monday ordered an Air Force Reserve search and rescue group
to active duty for the ongoing NATO air strike campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The call-up of 120 members of the 939th Rescue Wing in

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Arrives in Washington for Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Balkan special envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin, former Russian prime minister, arrived here
Monday for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin was reported to bring a letter to Clinton from
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The envoy immediately started
meeting with Vice President Al Gore and is expected to meet
Clinton later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Clinton said the U.S.-led NATO airstrike
campaign against Yugoslavia will not end despite the release of
three U.S. POWs by the Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia must show "unambiguous evidence" that the withdrawal
of its forces is underway before the alliance pauses in its
airstrikes, said Clinton, adding refugees must return home and an
international security force must be able to protect them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Clinton also said U.N. troops could
be part of the mission, signaling that the administration would be
open to negotiating the makeup of the force.
</P>
<P>
The president also said U.S. troops must be part of the
operation so that Kosovo refugees will feel safe to return home.
</P>
<P>
"What's subject to negotiations is who's in the security forces
_ how's it going to work," Clinton said, stressing there is a lot
to talk when he meets Russia's Balkan envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
After the release of the three POWs, U.S. civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson, who arrived at the Air Force base after a trip to
Belgrade, strongly urged Clinton to talk with Yugoslav leader
Slobodan Milosevic and resolve the crisis through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, speaking to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland, said, "We must seize this moment to take the step to
dramatic diplomacy from bloody, protracted war."
</P>
<P>
Clinton thanked Jackson for his diplomatic effort, but added
the United States cannot forget the plight of Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
"When will these people see their home again, with the safety
and rights Mr. Milosevic has often pledged but never delivered?"
Clinton asked.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of refugees have fled Kosovo since the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) started to bomb Yugoslavia's
military and civilian targets, even refugee convoys. However, the
alliance has put the blame on Belgrade.

peace process.

<HEADLINE> Two Military Planes Crash in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two military planes crashed Saturday
and Sunday at Mandera District in northern Kenya, killing a boy
and injuring 14 people, said a media report here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The crashes also caused Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to
cancel his visit to the town as he is going to use the same
airstrip, the Daily Nation report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the president's visit to Wajir and Garissa
districts in North Eastern Province went on as planned.
</P>
<P>
Moi landed safely in Wajir and later at Garissa, where he was
to spend the night before addressing local residents later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first of the two ill-fated planes crashed Saturday
afternoon for what said to be a mechanical problem, when its pilot
decided to take-off, said a source at the defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The second crash occurred at the same airstrip when an advance
party of the presidential entourage landed Sunday morning, as the
plane suddenly veered off the runway, scattering well-wishers who
had turned up to greet the arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The plane was said to be badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Mandera District Hospital confirmed that at least 13
people were treated and discharged. But the aircraft captain,
who suffered an injured arm, remained in the hospital, a media
source said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the injured captain, none of the crew was hurt in
either of the crashes and all were said to be back at work.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Air Force was investigating the causes of
the crashes.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. manufacturing sector
expanded for the third straight month in April, the National
Association of Purchasing Management said in a survey released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The association reported its monthly index of business activity
fell to 52.8 percent. That was down 1.5 percentage points from its
March level, but still above 50. The trade group of corporate
purchasing executives considers any reading above 50 percent a
sign of growth.
</P>
<P>
The organization assesses the health of the nation's factories,
and in turn the overall economy, through a monthly survey of its
members. The group's findings are widely followed by economists,
including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, because
they usually are the first indicator of how the economy performed
in the just-ended month.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the strengthening of an order backlog index, up
for the second month in a row, indicates manufacturing activity
will continue to grow in the next two months.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo said Monday that his in-coming government would
work with its neighbors for greater integration in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Abidjan, commercial capital of Cote
d'Ivoire, the president-elect pledged to work for greater regional
cooperation when he takes office on May 29, reports reaching here
Monday said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech during a visit to the Abidjan-based African
Development Bank (ADB), General Obasanjo stated that his
government would offer assistance to poorer African states through
support from the ADB.
</P>
<P>
"My administration will not relent in its effort to support and
to cooperate with the African Development Bank," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that it was the government under his leadership in
1976 that Nigeria founded the Nigeria Trust Fund, a soft loan arm
of the ADB with an 80 million U.S. dollars grant.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian National Planning Minister Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi
said last Wednesday at an international workshop that Nigeria's
equity share in the ADB would be increased to demonstrate its
commitment to the development of the African economies.
</P>
<P>
At present, Nigeria is the largest African share-holder with
about 10 percent equity in ADB. African owners have 60 percent
equity shares of the bank while non-Africans control the remaining
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo started his visit with a closed-door briefing session
at the Nigerian embassy with several west African ambassadors
based in Cote d' Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader later had lunch and talks with Cote
d'Ivoire President Henri Konan Bedie, and then he left for Dakar
of Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Justice Minister to Face Vote of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti National Assembly
(parliament) Tuesday approved two motions for a vote of confidence
on the Minister of Justice and Islamic Affairs Ahmad Khaled
Al-Kulaib accused of being responsibile for the misprints of some
120,000 copies of Quran.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency said the two motions, tabled to the
parliament by 20 parliament members (MPs), were approved before
the wrap-up of a grilling debate targeting Al-Kulaib. But it did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Under the parliament by-laws, either motion could be acted on
seven days after it is submitted.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's debate, MP Abbas Al-Khodari, who launched the
grilling motion, described the typos of the holy book as "a
disaster."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Al-Kulaib of failing to avoid the misprinting,
wasting public funds and forgery.
</P>
<P>
Defending himself, Al-Kulaib said "no one denies there was a
mistake, but there was no evidence these mistakes were
deliberate."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the typos to "carelessness of some workers in
the printing shop and mistakes of some employers receiving the
copies of Quran without cross-checking them."
</P>
<P>
As the questioning of the minister could result in a
no-confidence vote which might force him out of office, the
cabinet had tried to avert it, but failed in its attempt.
</P>
<P>
To approve the motions needs a simple majority of 24 votes out
of the 47 elected lawmakers, regardless of how many are present to
vote.

Sastry highly praised the technology used to build the Bamboo
Park and showed special interest in the handicraft that went into
making a bamboo boat and bamboo floorboards.

GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) met here again Tuesday in an attempt to solve
their differences over which of the two candidates should be their
new director-general.
</P>
<P>
At two previous meetings of the WTO's ruling General Council on
Friday and Saturday, trade representatives from the organization's
134 members failed to agree whether Supachai Panitchpakdi of
Thailand or Michael Moore of New Zealand should succeed Renato
Ruggiero who resigned on April 30 when his four-year term of
office ended.
</P>
<P>
A scheduled meeting on Monday was canceled by General Council
Chairman Ali Mchumo of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo announced on Friday that Moore caught up from behind and
passed Supachai with 62 members supporting him. Mchumo proposed
at the same meeting that Moore be appointed as WTO's new chief.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo's proposal was rejected by backers of Supachai who was
said to have 59 supporters. Some of them requested a vote on the
issue if there was no way to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Both Supachai and Moore vowed to stay in the contest for the
WTO top job. Another 13 members have not yet decided which of the
two candidates to support.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Meet Russian Special Envoy for Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is scheduled to meet with Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian
special envoy for Yugoslavia, at noon on Tuesday, a U.N. spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will take place here at 12:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian special envoy arrived in New York after his Monday
meetings in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other
senior U.S. Government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after his meeting in Washington that he had
delivered a plan from Moscow and Belgrade to end the Balkan
conflict, but did not offer any details.
</P>
<P>
Annan, voicing his welcome to the Yugoslav decision to release
the three American soldiers who were caught somewhere inside the
Yugoslav territory about a month ago, said Monday that there was
no immediate prospect of peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, back from visits to Germany and Russia at the
end of April, last week met German and Russian leaders, including
Chernomyrdin, but returned to New York with no concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
"The trip to Moscow and Berlin has reconfirmed my belief that
we should do whatever we can to find a political solution because
the implications of the alternative is too frightening to
contemplate," he said Monday in response to a press question.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
launched air strikes on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent
member of the U.N. family, violating the U.N. Charter and
international law.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led military alliance has so far sidelined the United
Nations politically since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March
24. But now that six weeks of bombing have created more serious
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo, including a large exodus of
refugees from the Serbian province, the calls for a quick
diplomatic deal to end the bombardment are increasing.
</P>
<P>
Annan is trying his best to use his influence to forge an
agreement over the Kosovo crisis, which broke out in February
since the ethnic Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for
independence of the Serbian province.

MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Tuesday congratulated tennis player Yevgeny Kafelnikov on becoming
the first Russian to top the ATP rankings.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the 122-year history of tennis, a
Russian sportsman has become the world's top player," he said in a
telegram.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Kafelnikov officially became the world number
one men's singles player on Monday, but his reign may be brief
since he pulled out of this week's German Open in Hamburg with a
viral infection.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open champion could be replaced at the top by
Dutchman Richard Krajicek, who at number five is the highest-
ranked player in the tournament.

<HEADLINE> France, Britain Hold Joint Conference on Yugoslav War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain Richard
and his British counterpart George Robertson said at a conference
that NATO is determined to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic out of Kosovo and denied any possible division of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two reiterated in the conference, the first since NATO
launched air strikes against Yugoslavia, the conditions for an end
to NATO bombing: "Stop the massacres and destruction, allow the
return of refugees, guarantee their security with a peacekeeping
force to be created by the U.N. Security Council and grant
autonomy to Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The gestures of Mr. Milosevic have little meaning as long as
these conditions are not satisfied," said Richard.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is considering increasing by 25 percent its
military force engaged in the NATO operation and is consulting
with NATO Supreme Commander in Europe, U.S. General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
France, the second largest NATO participant in the war after
the U.S., has committed 60 warplanes, 6,000 soldiers and a dozen
warships, including an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
French warplanes have carried out 1,000 military tasks,
including bombing missions, air defense, electronic and
photographic reconnaissance, in-flight oil supply, rescue and
combat.
</P>
<P>
For his part Robertson said that NATO could stop bombing
temporarily if the Yugoslav forces begin to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
French and British forces make up 20 percent of the total NATO
force and 50 percent of the European forces engaged.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Media Urged to Support Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The media in Zambia and all over the
world has been urged to speak out against the bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) forces.
</P>
<P>
Dusan Zupan, the charge d'affairs at the Yugoslavian embassy in
Zambia, said in a statement released here Tuesday that the media
should not give a blind eye to the crimes and human suffering
being experienced by the people in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said the bombing campaign that started almost six weeks ago
by NATO to compel Yugoslavia to meet basic demands on Kosovo as a
free state was a crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The recent bombing of two huge thermoelectrical power stations
by NATO war planes had caused a lot of suffering to the civilian
population, said Zupan.
</P>
<P>
As the media celebrated the World Press Freedom Day, he said,
there was need to campaign for an end to bombings in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
While Yugoslavia took a humanitarian move to release three
American soldiers who had been captured there, the
American-dominated NATO forces responded by announcing that they
would intensify the bombings, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Basketball Association to Expand in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Bouyed by the success the league is
enjoying in its 25th season, the Philippine Basketball Association
(PBA) is now thinking of expanding its family in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
PBA Commissioner Jun Bernardino said Tuesday the conditions are
ripe for the entry of new franchises in Asia's pioneering
professional cage league next season.
</P>
<P>
"It's ideal if we can have an even-numbered cast. So we could
add one team to make it 10 or three teams so we can make a total
of 12," Bernardino told a forum in Manila.
</P>
<P>
With the entry of Tanduay Rhum at the start of the 1999 season,
the PBA's memberhip ballooned to nine ballclubs, the most since
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
No less than five companies have signified their interest to
join the PBA, according to Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
The prospective applicants include Red Bull and Blue Detergent,
both of which currently mantain teams in the Philippine
Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
"We're studying the applicants based on the stability of the
companies and the kind of product they have. We'd also like to
make sure they could maximize their exposure in the league and get
the value for the money they put in," Bernardino said.

<HEADLINE> Two Palestinian Factions Demand Immediate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinian political factions on
Tuesday called for the immediate proclamation of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the
Arab Liberation Front made the appeal at a demonstration staged at
noon Tuesday in front of the Palestinian Legislative Council in
Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians took part in the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrator said the validity of the Oslo agreements, signed by
the Palestinians and Israel in 1993, is now over, and it is the
right of the Palestinian people to proclaim an independent state
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Zeidan, member of the Political Bureau of the Democratic
Front, said the postponement decision made by the Palestinian
Central Council recently has not diminished the pressing demand on
the part of many Palestinians for the proclamation of a sovereign
Palestinian state without delay.
</P>
<P>
He said it is futile to bet on the American guarantees, the
coming Israeli elections or on the Israeli Labor Party in handling
the issue of the Palestinian state declaration.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Awad Al Orouki, member of the Political Bureau of
the Arab Liberation Front, said in a statement that "the fourth of
May should be a prominent day for all Palestinian national forces
to get rid of that Oslo agreements, and move on to a advanced
stage based on the new national program."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ibrahim Abul Najjar, Deputy Speaker of the
Legislative Council, who walked out from his office to greet the
demonstrators, said, "the proclamation of the Palestinian state
was actually done in 1988, and the proclamation would be mere
reiteration and would stand as evidence of our determined
sovereignty and our adherence to Palestinian legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Israeli warplanes were flying overhead in
Gaza, the demonstrators shouted "Long live the fourth of May", and
"yes to sovereignty of the Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a demonstrator expressed support for the immediate
proclamation, saying that "the fourth of May must be the day of
the proclamation of the state no matter whether Israel liked it or
not."
</P>
<P>
A five-year interim period for transition to Palestinian
autonomy expired on May 4 as specified in the Oslo
agreements. However, the Palestinian Central Council which
recently met in Gaza did not announce the termination of this
stage, nor did it proclaim an independent and sovereign
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council decided on April 29 that it would remain
in session until June when a plenary meeting would be held to take
the final decision on the proclamation of the state.

national construction since becoming independent.

continuously, and that Chinese entrepreneurs have done a good job
in doing business in Zimbabwe. He said he hoped that more Chinese
companies would conduct cooperation with their Zimbabwean
counterparts in mining, agriculture, manufacturing and water
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also briefed Zhu on the political and economic situation
in Zimbabwe. Zhu briefed Mugabe on China's economic situation and
its measures to promote development.

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury will close its over-

</P>
<P>
The Treasury's Internet and phone service has become so popular,
and so few investors do business face-to-face, that the Treasury
will close counter services at 36 Federal Reserve banks and the

to save taxpayers five million dollars per year, and customers can
still go to the 40,000 financial institutions that issue and
redeem savings bonds.

The Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt said less than two percent
of the 620,000 investors in its automatic Treasury Direct service

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that China is willing to work with Tunisia to further
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Tunisian Foreign Minister Saeed Bin Mustafa,
Zhu said that bilateral cooperation has been progressing since the
establishment of diplomatic ties 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have maintained continuous high-level
exchanges of visits, and they have pursued fruitful economic and
trade cooperation, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have cooperated with and supported each other
closely in international affairs, making unremitting efforts to
safeguard the rights and interests of a large number of developing
countries, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries are far apart geographically, they
are faced with the same tasks of developing their respective
economies, Zhu said, adding that it is helpful to promote
bilateral cooperation.

<P>
Zhu also spoke highly of Tunisia's great achievements in the

<HEADLINE> NATO to Continue Attacking Yugoslav Targets, Says UK's Robertson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) - British Defense Secretary George
Robertson on Tuesday accused Belgrade of not listening to Russia's
diplomatic bid to end the Kosovo conflict and said NATO would
continue attacking Serb military targets.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that while Mr. Chernomyrdin continues with his
diplomacy -- and it's very commendable that he should be trying --
there's nobody really listening to him in Belgrade," Robertson
told Sky Television.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO should continue to bomb Yugoslavia until Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic makes a compromise and agrees to all
NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime we have got to continue to tell President
Milosevic that the damage which is being done to his military is
irreversible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian presidential envoy Victor Chernomyrdin, who visited
Belgrade last week, was in Washington on Monday and met with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to brief him on his efforts to forge a
cease-fire in Kosovo. The U.S. officials said no breakthrough
seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said NATO had no intention of diluting its core
demands that Belgrade withdraw all its troops from Kosovo and
allow an international force into the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that while the force would have to be
controlled by NATO, he would welcome troops from a wide range of
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We want Russians, Ukrainians, we want people from Africa and
other continents. That kind of peace-keeping force already works
in Bosnia, so there is a good model to be followed," Robertson
said.

<HEADLINE> 14 African Nationals Arrested for Heroin Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Customs' Drug Enforcement Cell
at Karachi Airport has nabbed 14 African nationals from various
countries while in transit during the last three days and
recovered large quantities of heroin filled capsules from them.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported Tuesday, the
Africans, who hailed from Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, Ghana and
Nigeria, were carrying the capsules in their abdominal cavities
which were extracted through medical process at the Jinnah
Hospital in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs sources, the Africans apprehended
included nine Tanzanians, two from Mozambique and one each from
Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Customs authorities said that till Tuesday 422 capsules had
been retrieved from their abdominal cavities at the Jinnah
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The heroin recovered from these capsules is approximately more
than four kilograms and the process was still on.
</P>
<P>
These Africans had come to Karachi from Nairobi on different
flights and at different days and were in transit with Bombay as
next destination.
</P>
<P>
They were apprehended on ground of their suspicious movement

<HEADLINE> NATO Finds No Evidence of Hitting Civilian Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, May 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO said here Tuesday that it
could find no evidence of alliance planes being involved in an "
alleged incident" when a bus carrying civilian passengers was
attacked during Monday's air strikes in northwestern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Every pilot was questioned and "exhausting and thorough reviews
" were conducted, but no evidence was found of the bus strike
being connected to NATO's air campaign, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Serbian officials were reportedly quoted as saying that at
least 17 people were killed in the incident. NATO sources said
Monday that the death toll was exaggerated, but did not deny the
tragedy, which could be the sixth "accident of war" since NATO
started its assault against Yugoslavia six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Shea said the "alleged incident" happened in a very
hilly area which was a combat zone in Kosovo and the passenger bus
"could have been ambushed there" by a force armed with small
weapons, rather than NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
Shea also said that the Serb forces in the past days had used a
lot of intensive anti-aircraft defense weaponry against NATO
aircraft. On that night, all NATO aircraft returned safely, Shea
said at a briefing at NATO headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
NATO has stepped up its air raids in "a full range of attacks"
in Yugoslavia since last weekend, signaling a new stage of the war
in the small Balkan country. But NATO since then has lost two
warplanes, an F-16 and an AV-8B Harrier fighter, and an A-10 jet
fighter has been damaged by Serb anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
Shea also said that U.S. President Bill Clinton would come here
on Wednesday morning to discuss with NATO decision-makers the
political and military aspects of the operation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to stay here from 7 a.m. to around 9:30 a.m.
on Wednesday during his Europe tour, the spokesman added.

in transportation and communication, we have decided to extend the
registration, both in Indonesia and abroad, until May 15," KPU
Chairman Rudini told reporters here after chairing the
commission's plenary meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 100 Civilians Killed in Taliban Jet Bombing: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Around 100 civilians have been
killed in Afghanistan's northern province of Takhar as a result of
the Taliban's latest jet bombardment, the News Network
International quoted an opposition commander as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sayed Hussain Anwari, commander of Harrakat-e-Islami, an
opposition group in the anti-Taliban alliance, was quoted as
saying, "relentless Taliban aerial bombings of Bazaar-e-Mandawee
in Talokan, the provincial capital of Takhar, resulted in the
killing of around 100 civilians Monday morning."
</P>
<P>
Scores of people were also injured with more than 50 in
critical condition, claimed Anwari.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban's indiscriminate air attacks on Talokan and other
major towns are a reflection of the militia's dwindling military
clout and desperation," Anwari added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that troops loyal to the anti-Taliban alliance
launched a major offensive on the Kunduz province Sunday morning,
capturing substantial territory in the its surprise move.
</P>
<P>
Anwari claimed that following the fall of the central Afghan
city of Bamiyan early last week, the Taliban are now under
tremendous pressure to defend a number of key towns in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"With the supply routes to Kunduz now depleted, we view the
fall of the province as inevitable," he said.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China, having learned bitter lessons
from last summer's devastating floods, has increased its
investment by nearly 50 percent in water conservancy projects,
compared with the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country lost 3,004 human lives and 255.1 billion
yuan worth of property, including domestic animals, in the
widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
Since last autumn, 29 province-level administrative areas have
invested a total of 63.9 billion yuan in anti-flood projects and
other water conservancy facilities, the Ministry of Water
Conservancy said today.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of farmers have completed 12.8 billion cu m of
dykes, with the help of 464,000 machines, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off, said the ministry. So far, a large
number of flood-damaged water conservancy facilities have been
repaired, while the area of water-saving cultivated land
nationwide has increased by some 1.33 million ha, according to
official figures.

</P>
<P>
Matarrese also praised the venue in Sokwipo of South Korean
Cheju island, saying it is a stadium harmonizing the natural
beauty and the super-modern architectural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 45 people were killed
and hundreds injured when tornadoes tore through the U.S. states
of Oklahoma and Kansas on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Forty people were killed in Oklahoma alone in the storms, the
largest of which formed about 80 kilometers southwest of Oklahoma
City and cut a path at least a one-kilometer-wide as it moved
north and east.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the Murrah Building, but instead of nine stories
tall, it's spread out over a large area," said Oklahoma City
assistant fire chief Jon Hansen, referring to the federal building
which was bombed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 230 kilometers north, a tornado spawned by the same storm
system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and
killed at least five people in Wichita, Kansas, and its suburb of
Haysville. Hospitals were reportedly treating more than 80 people.

Office, said early Tuesday the initial count of 10 deaths was
proved wrong when authorities realized victims had been counted
twice. But authorities still feared more dead would be found.

<HEADLINE> Polls in Nepal Generally Orderly, Peaceful: Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first-phase parliamentary
elections held Monday in Nepal were "generally orderly and
peaceful and took place in a positive atmosphere" based on
preliminary reports from the observers, the United Nations
Information Center here said in a press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The observer teams found that generally, voting procedures
were well-organized and went smoothly," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
International and national election observers monitored the
first-phase elections and approximately 1,500 observers including
63 from 14 foreign countries visited all the 35 districts and 90
constituencies voting in the first phase, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program coordinated with the
foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
The press release said "regrettably, there were reports of
disturbances in a few places, the teams also noted some procedural
inconsistencies."
</P>
<P>
The observers found that voter turnout was approximately 55 to
60 percent based on preliminary estimates, and about half of the
voters were women, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up First Rule of Law Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's first rule of law center was
established at prestigious Beijing University here today, marking
the 101st anniversary of the university.
</P>
<P>
The Center for the Study of the Rule of Law received start-up
funding and technical support from Microsoft of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"As China is facing the challenges of a new century, the study
and spread of the rule of law in China are of great significance,"
said Vice-President of the University He Fangchuan.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing University is honored to be a pioneer of history again
by initiating the study and training of the rule of law in China,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The center will focus on researching the protection of
intellectual property rights during the initial phase. Zheng
Shengli, secretary-general of the Intellectual Property School of
the university, serves as the head of the center.
</P>
<P>
Ma Lianyuan, deputy commissioner of the State Intellectual
Property Office and member of the Consultancy Board of the center,
said that the center will make contributions to China's drive to
perfect its intellectual property rights system.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China established the system of protection of
intellectual property rights in just a dozen years. It took
Western countries tens or even 100 years to do the same job.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has an imperative need to deepen its
insights into legal fields concerning intellectual property rights.
He said that, facing the new problems cropping up in the process
of technological advance, China should also develop its own
concepts and ways of dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft will provide funds for the center to hold an annual
seminar, round-table sessions and lectures, make collections of
theses, set up an on-line library, offer scholarships and research
fellowships for students and invite foreign lecturers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese university teachers and
students in Beijing have expressed their indignation at NATO's
ongoing bombing of Yugoslavia, saying that NATO's brutal action
indicated the hegemony and power politics, which are essential
ingredients of the U.S. policy, have not changed.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with Xinhua, they held that developing
countries, including China, can protect themselves and safeguard
world peace only by developing their domestic economies,
maintaining social stability and improving national power.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaoyuan, a 25-year-old graduate student of International
Politics with Beijing University, told reporters that he was
furious about the recent two air attacks on buses conducted by
NATO which have caused the deaths of dozens of innocent
Yugoslavian civilians.
</P>
<P>
"NATO bombed many civilian establishments with absurd excuses.
I think the air attack is the result of the increase in power
politics in the post-cold war era, and a severe challenge to the
current international principles and norms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jia Yanfeng, a junior student of the Serbian Language with the
Beijing Foreign Studies University who returned from Yugoslavia
recently, said that in the university where she once studied the
Serbian students and Albanian students lived in peace with each
other, even during the Kosovo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw the streets and shops I was so familiar with bombed,
I felt very sad and am now very worried about the current
situation in Yugoslavia," said Jia.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen Xiangping, who is working for his doctorate
in the Philosophy Department of Beijing Normal University, human
rights can by no means be protected by violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, disregarding the existence of the United
Nations, outrageously launched wanton and indiscriminate bombing
against Yugoslavia, and the brutal action shows that NATO must be
condemned for its breach of world peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qu Huibin, one of Jia's classmates, said that the excuse of
human rights transcending sovereignty conducted by some Western
countries, including the U.S., is aimed at seeking hegemony and
NATO's military strikes against Yugoslavia have put this absurd
theory into practice in a massive way, and trampled underfoot the
civilization of a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
"The real intention of the air attack on the Serbian TV Station
is that the United States doesn't want the voice of Yugoslavia to
be heard. Meanwhile, the Western media's coverage of the whole
event springs only from their own perspective." added Qu.
</P>
<P>
Hou Bensong, a junior of the Economic Management Institute in
Qinghua University, told reporters that the air attacks by NATO
reminded him and his classmates of the Second World War launched
by Germany in 1939, the Opium War in 1840, and the invasion of
China by eight powerful allied forces in 1900.
</P>
<P>
Chi Qiang, a sophomore from the People's University said that
his classmates' responses toward the military attack have
undergone three phases: agitation, tranquillity and reflection.
Teachers and students have made a deep analysis on the essence of
NATO's military action and its influence on the international
situation.

<P>
The College of International Relations of Beijing University
has issued a summary of a seminar it held on NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the strikes are aimed at ousting Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and dismantling Yugoslavia to pave
the way for its expansion to the east and the south.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NATO has made Kosovo a testing ground for its new
strategy, while trying to put the Balkans under its control and
rid the Balkan peninsula of the traditional Russian presence, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that NATO's behavior is a concentrated
reflection of the U.S. concept of "both leadership and partnership
" in its global strategy.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo crisis, however, is just a start," the paper said,
"the United States will first trim the 'order' in Europe, subdue
Russia, and then turn to other places."
</P>
<P>
Feng Tejun, a professor in the International Politics
Department of the Chinese People's University, also cited the
Kosovo crisis and NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia over the
past 40 days as the most severe challenge faced by the
international community since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
The hegemonism practiced by the United States is becoming more
and more obvious, he said.
</P>
<P>
Feng's opinion was echoed by other two teachers, Cao Changsheng
and Li Kun, both from Beijing University. They pointed out that
many people have let down their guard since the end of the Cold
War and have been holding an over-optimistic vision of world peace.
</P>
<P>
"Viewing the current situation, the peace of the world is faced
with the severe threat of hegemonism," said Cao, a professor at
the Institute of World Socialism.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhuangqing, a student of the Mongolian ethnic group at the
People's University, said that the United States has continued to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs in the disguise of
protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
"If their acts of invasion are not effectively contained, the
world will never enjoy tranquillity," Li added.

Zuo Di, an undergraduate of the English Department of the
Beijing Foreign Studies University, said many Chinese college
students are concerned about current international affairs, and
they support Yugoslavia. They accuse NATO of launching aggressive
air strikes against Yugoslavia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After making an analysis of the purpose and influence of NATO's
air strikes, teachers and students view it in comparison with
China's actual situation.
</P>
<P>
Ni Ning, vice-president of the Journalism School of the
People's University, said China's history over the past century
teaches the lesson that lagging behind others will result in being
invaded, and this principle also applies to the current world
situation.
</P>
<P>
China must seek faster economic growth and maintain stability
to increase its national strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaofeng, a second-year student at the Business
Administration School of the People's University, said, "We must
realize that the U.S. invasion logic is very dangerous. Besides
indignation, we must work hard to improve our internal strength to
effectively support international truth and justice."
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiuming, a teacher of the Serbian language at the Beijing
Foreign Studies University, said the comparison of military
strength between NATO and Yugoslavia stands at 15:1 at present.
</P>
<P>
Confronted by the major powers, Yugoslavia has the courage to
say "no," Wang said, noting that the issue provokes a feeling of
patriotism among youth.
</P>
<P>
While condemning NATO's invasion, China must improve its
comprehensive strength to make greater contributions to world
peace, said Li Kun, a teacher at Beijing University.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Further Intensify Air Strikes on Yugoslavia: Clark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark
said Tuesday that the alliance will increase and further intensify
air strikes on Yugoslavia in the coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here after a routine visit to
NATO troops, Clark said that the 40 days of air raids on
Yugoslavia had been effective and the Serb military forces in
Kosovo were under "heavy pressure."
</P>
<P>
"The air campaign will increase and further intensify," the U.S.
general said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday
that NATO could temporarily halt air strikes against Yugoslavia
conditionally.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that U.S. Apache helicopters were well-prepared to
begin attacking Serb tanks in Kosovo, but he again declined to go
into operational details as to when they would be sent into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent 24 Apache helicopters to neighboring
Albania on April 21 and one of them crashed recently during a
training mission.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister Being Questioned for Quran Misprints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti parliament Tuesday
started to question Justice, Endowments and Islamic Affairs
Minister Ahmad Al-Kulaib for his part in misprints of some
120,000 copies of the holy Quran.
</P>
<P>
MP Abbas Al-Khodari, who launched the questioning motion,
described the typos of the holy book is "a disaster."
</P>
<P>
This mistake "harmed many copies of the holy Quran which
were sent to many countries, namely African countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The MP also accused Al-Kulaib of failing to adopt measures to
avoid the misprinting, wasting public funds and forgery.
</P>
<P>
Defending himself, Al-Kulaib said "no one denies there was
a mistake, but there was no evidence these mistakes were
deliberate."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the typos to "carelessness of some workers in
the printing shop and mistakes of some employers receiving the
copies of Quran without cross-checking them."
</P>
<P>
As the questioning of the minister could result in a
no-confidence vote, the cabinet had tried to avoid it, but
failed.
</P>
<P>
To develop into a no-confidence, at least 10 MPs are required
to sign the motion to be submitted after the questioning is closed.
</P>
<P>
Should this happen, only 47 elected MPs are permitted to
vote on the no-confidence motion. The approval of the motion
therefore needs a simple majority of 24 votes, regardless of
how many lawmakers are present to vote.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence vote will be held 8 days after the motion is
submitted. If Al-Kulaib fails to survive the vote, he is forced
out of office.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Tuesday that only 20 MPs
have voiced support for the no-confidence vote.

<HEADLINE> China, Netherlands to Boost Floral Business Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Dutch florists and
floral industry officials have agreed to strengthen cooperation in
floral business.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium here on Monday during the '99 Kunming
International Horticulture Exposition, some 200 experts and
officials of the two countries held that the cooperation is
conducive to improving environment for man.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zehui, an official from China's State Forestry
Administration, told the meeting that China is keen to increase
its floral business with the Netherlands, which is known for its
developed flower growth and production.
</P>
<P>
"While the Chinese government pays close attention to
protecting forestry resources, it has also highlighted the floral
industry as an important means of beautifying cities", Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Hayoh Apotheker, minister of agriculture, physical planning and
fisheries of the Netherlands, noted that his country has already
expanded cooperation with China by offering training for gardeners
from Yunnan Province, the host of the ongoing largest gardening
exposition in China.
</P>
<P>
A tulip strain cultivated in a greenhouse in the Dutch
Exhibition Hall in the exposition park was given the name of "
Kunming Tulip" on Monday. It is a special gift from the Dutch
government to the exposition.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch hall covers an area of 1,650 sq.m. and displays 5,000
tulips in 20 varieties, 160 potted azaleas, 65 trees and other
plants.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, which is the world's largest flower producer
and exporter, occupies more than 60 percent of the world's flower
trade, and offers 800 to 1,000 new flower species a year.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Continue Dialog With IMF, World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has succeeded
in persuading the World Bank not to withdraw its representative
office from the southern African country following repeated
explanation on the country' s current economic reform program and
the time-table for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The bank agreed to reconsider its decision after its annual
meeting slated for this September, Angolan Finance Minister
Joaquim David made the remarks Monday upon his return from a visit
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
During the interval, the World Bank will see the concrete
actions taken by the Angolan government on economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"Having overcome the doubt over the economic reform in Angola,
we will continue to negotiate with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)," he reassured.
</P>
<P>
His Washington visit was projected to ask the two institutions
to map out a new monitor program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF made a similar program for Angola in 1998, which
stipulated that the financial institution has the right to
participate in and evaluate the government's economic policies and
measures as return for loans the country urgently needs.
</P>
<P>
The monitor program also includes strict control on government
expenditure, transparency on government accounts, lowering
inflation, and gradual uplift on government control on foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the failure of the Angolan peace process, the
monitor program did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
The renewal of civil war in Angola has brought up defense
expenditure to 38 percent of the budget. The increasing number of
refugees also burdened government expenses on aid. These made it
impossible for Angola to rid itself of long-time financial
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the plummeting oil prices on the international market
has cut the country's revenue by one-third, hiking in turn the
prices for basic domestic merchandises which accordingly bring up
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe there is little possibility for Angolan
government to reach any agreement with the World Bank and the IMF
under present circumstance.

</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
cities in China are iodine-deficient, and there are 6.6 million
strumous sufferers.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. Water Treatment
Technology Symposium opened here today, amid worldwide concern
over the deteriorating water situation.

well as officials from the EPA and the Agricultural Ministry of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day symposium, the experts will share their
views on water environmental protection and water treatment
technology.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Remains Opposed to Unilateral Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel will continue to oppose any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state in the future.
</P>
<P>
At a crowded news conference in his office, Netanyahu said
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat backed
down from a threatened unilateral declaration of statehood Tuesday
because "he understands that we will respond very firmly."
</P>
<P>
Arafat had repeatedly hinted to declare an independent state on
May 4 when the five-year interim Palestinian self-rule period
stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
He also traveled dozens of countries to rally support for the
possible move. But many states urged him to hold off the statehood
declaration to avoid giving Netanyahu fodder in the coming
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council was convened last Thursday
and announced to delay the decision over statehood proclamation
until after the May 17 Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Moshe Arens, Netanyahu said, for the last four years, Israel has
been telling the PNA not to declare a Palestinian state
unilaterally. "Now Arafat wisely backed off," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian decision marked only a temporary
suspension and Arafat has left the door open for a new
declaration, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that we will continue to oppose any
actions in defiance of the treaty we have signed," Netanyahu
said. These unilateral actions are "unacceptable and illegal," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Resumes Peace Talks With NDF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine President Joseph
Estrada ordered Tuesday the resumption of the stalled formal peace
talks with the rebel National Democratic Front (NDF) and the
restoration of the effectivity of safe conduct passes issued to
peace negotiators of the NDF.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum dated May 4, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora, on behalf of the president, advised Ambassador Howard Dee,
chairman of the government peace panel, that effective Tuesday,
the suspension of the peace talks and the Joint Agreement on
Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG) is lifted.
</P>
<P>
Dee, in turn, officially conveyed the presidential directive to
the NDF, through its negotiating panel's chairperson Luis
Jalandoni who is based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, and expressed
the hope that the two groups could return to the negotiating table
the soonest and break ground in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuant to President Estrada's directive on the peace talks,
please be advised that effective today, the suspension of the
peace talks with the NDF, and that of the JASIG, is hereby lifted
to pave the way for the revival of the talks," Zamora said in his
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Dee relayed to Jalandoni the government's hope that both panels
can resolve their differences and make substantial progress in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Our panel is ready to resume talks with your panel. With the
talks restored to their status quo ante, we would welcome your
suggestions on how our panels can resolve our differences so that
we can move beyond the current impasse and make substantial
progress in the talks. We will await your response so that both
panels can start preparations for the revival of the talks," Dee
said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
Zamora reminded the NDF, however, that the JASIG provides
safety and immunity guarantees only to accredited persons "in
connection with the performance of their duties in the peace
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"The JASIG, therefore, must not be used for employing violence
or threat of violence against non-combatants and civilians, or for
any other purpose contrary to the spirit of the Agreement which is
to build trust and confidence in the peace negotiations," he said
in his memorandum.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada ordered the peace talks indefinitely
suspended last February 22, following the abduction by New
People's Army (NPA), NDF's military arm, of Brig. Gen. Victor
Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto in Davao City on February 17.
He called the kidnappings acts of terrorism and abuse of the
government's goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The NPA also kidnapped three other uniformed officers.
</P>
<P>
These NDF hostages, composed of a general, a police inspector
and three military officers, have already been released by the
rebels, signaling the resumption of the formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada has reiterated his conditions that the talks take
place in the Philippines and that an accord be reached by the end
of this year.

<HEADLINE> University of Ibadan Shut Down in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The University of Ibadan in the
southwestern Osun State of Nigeria has been closed down
indefinitely following the protracted students' protest against
the newly-introduced municipal fees, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the closure of the university beginning from Monday,
Vice- Chancellor Omoniyi Adwoye also ordered the immediate
suspension of the students' union executive and the Students
Representative Council.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday by Elizabeth Etteh, university's
public relations officer, said that the measures are aimed at
maintaining peace which had been threatened by students'
disruptive actions since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following the closure, students union president Ovie Onwuine
said "whenever he (Adwoye) chooses to re-open the campus, struggle
continues."
</P>
<P>
"There is no way by which we will pay the outrageous fees they
are charging us," said the student leader.
</P>
<P>
Security was beefed up Monday at the university entrance where
a detachment of armed anti-riot police stood guard a few meters
away from the gates as students demonstrated against the
"municipal fees".
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chancellor Adwoye explained that the 50-year-old
university was constrained to introduce the charges because of its
inability to offset the huge bills from its water and electricity
consumption.

<HEADLINE> 3 Palestinians Injured in Clashes With Israeli Soliders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- At least three Palestinian
students were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers Tuesday at
Bitonia checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah,
Palestinian security police said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted when the Palestinian students threw stones
at the Israeli soliders, who responded with fired rubber-coated
bullets, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The students held a demonstration on the occation of May 4, the
date on which the five-year Palestinian interim self-rule period,
stipulated in the Oslo accords, expires, to demand an early end of
Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land and the declaration of
an independent Palestinian state in the territories.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement
should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the
date. And the Palestinians believe they have the right to declare
an independent state on the day.
</P>
<P>
However, a permanent peace accord remains out of reach by
Tuesday and Palestinian leadership has delayed decision over
statehood declaration until after the May 17 Israeli elections to
avoid squandering international good-will.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited dozens of states
to rally support for his statehood proclamation, but many states
urged him to hold off the unilateral move on May 4 to avert being
exploited by hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
coming elections.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian police officer told Xinhua that everything
could happen in the territories today or tomorrow because the
Palestinians do not have their independent state in the
territories on the historic date.
</P>
<P>
"We are ordered to maintain order in the territories since
Monday night and we are prepared for any eventualities," the
officer said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Fatah movement also organized a large-scale demonstration in
the West Bank town of Hebron Tuesday morning, urging the
palestinian leadership to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched from the Hebron
University to the "border line" between H1 and H2, but no clashes
are reported so far.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Jewish settlers, whose settlements are located in H1
area, live among 130,000 Palestinians, whose living areas are
called H2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
is scheduled to hold a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in
Ramallah to demand the Palestinian leadership let the Palestinian
people exercise their sovereignty on the Palestinian land and get
rid of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another
Palestinian political faction, is to organize a demonstration
Tuesday afternoon in Gaza to voice its support for the declaration
of the statehood.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Adoptions of S. Korean Children Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of South Korean children
adopted by foreigners rose last year, the first time since 1987,
reversing an 11-year decline, the Health and Welfare Ministry said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 2,249 South Korean children, including 848
disabled, were adopted by foreigners in 1998, a 9.3 percent rise
from 2,057 children the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise to the "IMF period", which
began in late 1997 when corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions left hundreds of thousands of South Koreans
jobless, forcing many low-income families to disintegrate.
</P>
<P>
To cut the number of overseas adoptions, which had at one time
earned the country the stigma of being the "largest exporter of
babies", South Korea reportedly introduced a quota system for
foreign adoptions in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the system designed to eliminate foreign adoptions by
the year 2015, the nation has reduced the number of children
permitted for overseas adoption by three to five percent each year
from about 8,000 in 1987 to 2,057 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, last year the government lifted the restrictions after
the number of abandoned children jumped in the wake of growing
economic hardships.

<HEADLINE> Swan Lake To Be Staged in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian composer Tchaikovsky's
immortal ballet Swan Lake will be staged in Hong Kong this week.
</P>
<P>
This English National Ballet version of the show will be the
largest ever, featuring over 120 dancers, including 70 swans
rather than the traditional 32.
</P>
<P>
And it will be a "gymnasium version," moving out of the
traditional proscenium arch format into a vast central performing
area of 400 square meters with spectacular towering sets.
</P>
<P>
Michael Coad, producer of the show and chief executive of
sponsoring Worldwide Entertainment Limited, said that the
extraordinary quality of the English National Ballet and the
unique in-the-round production of a popular ballet will ensure
that this will be "Hong Kong's dance event of the decade."
</P>
<P>
The English National Ballet is on a 12-week, 10-city world tour,
and Hong Kong is the first city in the world to see the show,
which needs 220 costumes weighing five tons in all, 224 pairs of
pointe shoes and 95 make ballet shoes.
</P>
<P>
The "in-the-round" show will be staged in the Grand Hall of the
Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, where the ceremony of
Hong Kong's return to China was held in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Coad noted that the magnificent building is "part of the first
performance."
</P>
<P>
Derek Deane, art director of the English National Ballet, said
the version was created two years ago at a specially designed
setting with the purpose of "bringing in new audience into ballet.
"
</P>
<P>
Classical ballet is for everybody and does not have to be
attended by wearing formal suits and dresses, Deane, who also
produced new staging of The Nutcracker and Romeo and Juliet
recently, argued.
</P>
<P>
In terms of choreography the show is basically along the
original line. But it is out of the theater and larger than the
normal setting, according to Derek.
</P>
<P>
Technical designer of show, Keith Tucker, said the huge and
magnificent set of Swan Lake is "indeed an international version,"
combining styles of previous versions such as Russian, French and
English.
</P>
<P>
The English National Ballet will give five performances in Hong
Kong before moving to Australia over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Two Finnish Tourists Abducted in N. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Finnish nationals have been
abducted by Somali gunmen in the northern coasts, a report
reaching here has said.
</P>
<P>
According to the VHF radio report, the Finnish nationals, a
man and a woman, are reportedly tourists travelling on a yacht
along the Red Sea heading for the Indian Ocean islands of
Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
Somali gunmen of the northeastern Somali Salvation Democratic
Front (SSDF) intercepted the yacht a few days ago by using a
small armed boat and forced them to dock into a village, a few
kilometers east of the port town of Bossaso.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen have not made their captives public until Monday
probably in fear of being forced to free the hostages, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Elders from Bossaso have reportedly been denied of access to
see the hostages. The other notable thing is that the abductors
had not made any demands of ransom for the release of the Finnish
tourists, nor had they accused the Finnish yacht of violation or
trespassing into the economic water zones of northeast.

HANGZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A middle school in this capital of
Zhejiang Province, which was founded by an American missionary
named W.S.Sweet, celebrated its 100th anniversary today.
</P>
<P>
The school, the No. Two Middle School of Hangzhou City, was one
of the first Chinese schools to adopt a modern educational system
from the West. And it is still among the best schools of its kind
in this east China province.
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the provincial government recovered the right of
management over the school, when the American headmaster was
replaced by a Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, the school has fostered a large
number of talented people including Yu Dafu, a leading Chinese
writer, translator Feng Yidai, traditional painter Dong Xiwen and
architect Chen Congzhou.
</P>
<P>
"We should not hide the facts of history," said deputy
headmaster Wen Qian, referring to the inclusion of the American
founder in the newly-published chronicle of the school.
</P>
<P>
The deputy headmaster noted that many of the school's graduates
have studied abroad in recent years. He added that the school
plans to accept students from the United States and other foreign
countries.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Hits Highest Level 12 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar rose above 69 U.S.
cents Monday for the first time in 12 months, lifted by rising
commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
A brisk rally boosted the dollar by half of a cent to end the
day at 69.13 cents, its highest close since May 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prices of raw materials are the highest in 11 months, according
to an index of 26 commodities by Goldman Sachs and Co.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian currency has been in the doldrums since last
summer when the world economy was hit by a crisis of confidence
because of a slowdown in Asia and Russia's default on debt.
</P>
<P>
The "loonie" plummeted to the lowest value in its 140-year
history last August, just above 63 cents.
</P>
<P>
The loonie's rise has sparked talk that the Bank of Canada
could trim interest rates by a quarter-point soon, possibly even
this week.
</P>
<P>
Above 69 cents, "We're in the realm of an independent Bank of
Canada cut, if the bank chooses", said Andrew Pyle, chief
strategist with ABN Amro Bank Canada.

natural resources of the world of Islam to improve the status of
Muslims throughout the globe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue concerning the Persian Gulf region, the
critical situation in Kosovo and Palestine, and destabilizing

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Curb Stubborn Power Cable Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to crack
down on suspects in connection with stealing power cables which
has inflicted great economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye warned here Monday that stern
legal measures would be taken against suspects who would be found
guilty of stealing power cables and oil from transformers.
</P>
<P>
"This type of economic sabotage has been discouraging both the
government and donors," an angry Sumaye said while inaugurating
the Dar es Salaam Power Supply Extension Project that is aided by
the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, according to newspaper reports Tuesday, said the
Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) had spent five billion
Tanzanian shillings (1 US dollar equals 705 Tanzanian shillings at
present) to repair power cables in Tanga Region alone because of
rampant thefts.
</P>
<P>
"Such a huge amount of money could be better used to finance
other development projects for the benefit of a larger section of
the Tanzanian community than be spent on the re-installation of
stolen power cables," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged the public to expose all saboteurs,
claiming that those found guilty would face long jail sentences
and the suspects will not qualify for bail in accordance with the
newly approved Economic and Organized Crime Control Act.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added NPC Chairman Meets with Japanese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said here
today that it is an important task for young politicians of both
China and Japan to carry on the bilateral friendship initiated by
their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Li met today with a Japanese delegation from the Dietmen's
League for Japan-China Friendship (DLJCF) led by its director-
general Machimura Nobutaka, which is composed of young Dietmen
from Japan's major parties. Li said China welcomes more Japanese
Dietmen, especially younger ones, to visit China so as to deepen
friendship and understanding.
</P>
<P>
He said the delegation's visit coincides with China's
commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the May 4th Movement, a
mass patriotic movement sparked by friction with Japan. After the
end of World War I, the Paris peace conference, controlled by the
Western powers, transferred all rights grabbed by Germany in
China's Shandong Province to Japan.
</P>
<P>
China, although on the winning side, had to suffer humiliation
due to the corruption of the then warlord regime. Public
indignation aroused by this event directly led to the outbreak of
the May 4th Movement, which is considered to be not only an anti-
imperialist, anti-feudal patriotic movement, but also a mind
emancipation movement.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he recalled this period of history together with
the young Japanese Dietmen present with the purpose of learning
from history, looking forward to the future, eliminating problems,
and ensuring the healthy development of Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Nobutaka said it is beneficial to recall historical events, and
Japan does not want to see those regretful things in past Japan-
China relations re-occur.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many young Dietmen, many of them
participating in the DLJCF, who lack a comprehensive understanding
of history.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that both sides would expand
communication so as to contribute more to the friendship between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nobutaka is visiting China as guest of the China-Japan
Friendship Association.

BERLIN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- German marathon runner Uta Pippig,
suspended in October last year after failing a drug test, on
Tuesday dismissed her chances of competing at next year's Sydney

</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Pippig said she didn't expect the International

</P>

</P>
<P>
The federation is to annonce a definitive decision on a
possible ban for Pippig before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Pippig believes that the federation's decision to suspend her
was too harsh and also questioned the validity of anti-doping

NEW DELHI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- India is to hole the fourth polls
in five years to Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, in
September and the first week of October, a top election officer
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Manohar Singh Gill, India's chief election commissioner, told
the press that after deep deliberations, his commission "has come
to the unanimous view that in the given circumstances, the best
possible time for the elections, considering all factors, is the
month of September and the first week of October".
</P>
<P>
The house was dissolved by President Kocheril Raman Narayanan
on April 26 following the failure of the coalition government led
by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to win a confident vote in Lok
Sabha.
</P>
<P>
Gill said that his commission would in due time, on an
appropriate date and after full preparations, make the formal
announcement of the election schedule.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after a full meeting of the Election
Commission earlier today in the backdrop of Monday's consultations
by all party leaders on the timing of the forthcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Following the downfall of the government, BJP and its allies
have tried to convince the election commission to hold the
election as early as possible to win what observers here described
as "votes of sympathy".
</P>
<P>
However, five of the six national parties and a majority of
state parties opposed at Monday's meeting to the demand of BJP and
its allies for early scheduling of the polls in June on the ground
of avoiding raining season from mid-June till the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Gill admitted that his commission had been confronted with
holding mid-term elections in the most difficult period of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after the dissolution of the low house,
Congress and other opposition parties demanded to hold the polls
in the time frame decided the Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Boasts Victory on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday credited his government for compelling
Palestinians delay statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel will continue to oppose any unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state in the future.
</P>
<P>
At a crowded news conference in his office, Netanyahu said
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat backed down
from a plan to declare statehood on Tuesday because "he
understands that we will respond very firmly."
</P>
<P>
Flanked by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister
Moshe Arens, he said, for the last four years, Israel has been
telling Arafat not to declare a Palestinian state
unilaterally. "Now he wisely backed off," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said in the past that the Palestinians have the
right to declare an independent state on May 4, the date by which
Israel and the Palestinians are supposed to have reached a
permanent agreement according to the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
But the international community has urged him to hold off such
a move since it might destroy the already troubled peace process
and drive Israeli voters to elect a hard-line government to power
in the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council, a 124-member Palestine
Liberation Organization leadership body, decided last week to
postpone a decision over statehood proclamation until after the
Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu pointed out the postponement was only
temporary and Arafat has left the door open for a new declaration.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that we'll continue to oppose any
actions in defiance of the treaties we have signed," Netanyahu
said. These unilateral actions are "unacceptable and illegal," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of the Palestinians, for the sake of peace and
for the sake of our common future, it is in the interests of the
Palestinians not to declare a state unilaterally on May 4 or any
day at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has threatened to annex parts of the
West Bank still under its control if the Palestinians declare a
state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, the leading hawkish minister, reiterated this position
at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that if such a declaration is made, Israel
would also bar Israeli individuals or corporates from investing in
the Palestinian areas or demand Palestinian compensation for
financial benefit it has enjoyed from Israeli investment.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister denied that the tightening Israeli control
over Jerusalem, including demolition of Arab houses, confiscation
of Palestinian residencies and closure of Palestinian institutes,
is also a unilateral action banned by the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The status of Jerusalem, as it stands now--under fully
Israeli sovereignty--, will be maintained until it is decided
otherwise (in future agreements with the Palestinians)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Israel is not violating the status quo of
Jerusalem and will "act to ensure the continuance of Israel's
sovereignty over the city."
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, over which the Palestinians also claim
sovereignty, is supposed to be negotiated in the final-status
talks, which should have begun by May 1996 according to Oslo
accords, but has never happened.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is running a neck-and-neck campaign with One Israel
leader Ehud Barak in the runup to the May 17 elections. He has
charged that Barak will not stand as firmly as he does against a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lashed out at Netanyahu over what they called
his attempt to turn a diplomatic failure into a victory,
describing the convening of the news conference is "nothing but
election propaganda."
</P>
<P>
One Israel legislator Shlomo Ben-Ami said as a matter of fact,
it is Arafat who has gained international support for his
postponement of a declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai said the Palestinians
had agreed to put off a unilateral declaration when they signed
the Wye agreement in Washington last October.

<HEADLINE> No Hopes for DPR Korea to Share World Cup Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior FIFA official on Tuesday
ruled out the chance of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPR Korea) hosting some of the 2002 World Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
"It's too late for them to participate," Antonio Matarrese,
vice-president of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, the co-host of the 2002 World Cup with Japan, had
offered to DPR Korea to stage two or three of the 32 matches which
they are entitled to hold.
</P>
<P>
Chung Mong-joon, president of South Korea's football
association, said he wanted to give his last shot when he
accompanies FIFA President Sepp Blatter to DPR Korea this fall.
</P>
<P>
Chung tried twice to visit DPR Korea earlier this year, but
both trips were postponed due to reportedly little DPR Korea
response to the proposal.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Considers Liberalization of Airwaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting will table a bill in parliament this year to
liberalize the airwaves, The Eastern African Standard newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Joseph Nyagah said that once the bill is passed, his
ministry would pave the way for Kenya's Communications Commission
to control and regulate the management, ownership and licensing of
the mass media.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference here Monday on the state and future of
 electronic media in Kenya, Nyagah said that the bill would rely
on recommendations of the task force on press law.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kenya has neither the Broadcasting Act nor
the Mass Media Act which provide for ownership, development and
licensing of radio and television stations, noting that the only
existing law on the development of media was the Communications
Commission of Kenya (KBC) Act.
</P>
<P>
According to the Media Institute, Kenya has so far licensed 12
TV stations and 20 radio stations.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Official Election Period Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's election period
has officially started as 14 political parties paid their deposits
for polls and the order of the ballot paper has been decided.
</P>
<P>
The 14 parties have paid deposit to participate in the national
 elections on June 2, while 16 others will fight for provincial
polls only, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) announced
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Parties have to pay 100,000 rand (16,660 U.S. dollars) for
taking part in the national election and 20,000 rand (3,300
dollars) for each of the nine provinces.
</P>
<P>
The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) will have the
coveted top position on the ballot paper after the party's name
was drawn first in a raffle by IEC Chairman Brigalia Bam at a
function. The other parties will be listed in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear indication that the ACDP will do extremely
well in the election and we are optimistic about getting about 20
percent of the vote," ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
The ACDP was the smallest party with only two seats in the
now-dissolved National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to IEC chief electoral officer Mandla Mchunu, nine
parties have not paid their national or provincial deposits and
have to meet all requirements by May 7 to participate in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said the May 7 deadline will not be extended as ballot
papers have to be printed and sent to South African embassies and
missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
Smaller parties objected to the high deposit required by the
IEC and the Labor Party has filed a lawsuit to have the deposits
scrapped.

<HEADLINE> Asian Sectors See Mild Net Inflows in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (HKIFA) said here Tuesday that the six Asian sectors
of the fund industry registered an aggregate net inflow of 14.76
million U.S. dollars in March.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that these sectors recorded aggregate
monthly net inflows this year. In January and February, the six
Asian sectors had total registered net outflows of 13.42 million U.
S. dollars and 21.04 million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Increased investor interest was also reflected in gross sales --
most Asian sectors saw an increase in gross inflows in March.
</P>
<P>
Except for the Asia-Pacific Regional (excluding Japan and Hong
Kong) sector which saw a marginal drop in gross sales in March,
all the other five Asian sectors saw an increase in gross sales
over February.
</P>
<P>
The five sectors are Japanese Equity, Hong Kong Equity, Single
Asian Countries (excluding HK and Japan), Asia-Pacific Regional (
excluding Japan, including HK) and Asia-Pacific Regional (
including Japan).
</P>
<P>
The six Asian sectors attracted aggregate gross inflows of 113.
36 million U.S. dollars in March, accounting for 22.35 percent of
the industry total.
</P>
<P>
In February, the gross total was only at 49.26 million U.S.
dollars, representing about 14 percent of the industry total.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing the sales of Asian funds in March, Desmond Chan,
chairman of the HKIFA, said: "We have seen more investor interest
in single Asian sectors, in particular in funds investing in Japan,
south Korea and Thailand."
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the market rallies in Japan and the United States, as
well as the fact that recovery gathers momentum, most Asian
markets have firmed up, Chan added.

<HEADLINE> Pirated Optical Discs Storage Centers Destroyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Customs officers
destroyed three pirated optical disc storage and packaging centers
and seized a large quantity of suspected pirated optical discs
worth about 4.1 million HK dollars (525,641 U.S. dollars) in a
three-consecutive-day operation from Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Customs and Excise Department (CED)
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the CED on Tuesday said that Customs
officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau seized
a total of 250,000 suspected pirated optical discs, including 130,
000 VCDs, 6,5000 VCDS of Japanese TV drama series, 40,000 pirated
CD-Roms and 15,000 pirated music CDs.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted following in-depth investigations
into the interception of 1.74 million HK dollars (223,077 U.S.
dollars) worth of pirated optical discs from two cargo
consignments from Singapore and South Korea on April 19 and April
26.
</P>
<P>
In the operation, the officers arrested 10 men, aged between 16
and 44.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CED said that the department would continue
to take vigorous enforcement action against piracy activities.
</P>
<P>
"We shall further strengthen the collection of intelligence in
an attempt to curb piracy activities at different levels," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The on-going anti-piracy operations demonstrate the SAR
government's determination in combating piracy activities and
preserving the good image of Hong Kong, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
In an on-going operation across the SAR codenamed "Thunderbolt"
which commenced on March 16 this year, Customs officers have
destroyed 411 shops, seized 1.5 million pirated optical discs
worth 32 million HK dollars (4.10 million U.S. dollars) and
arrested 230 suspects.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the officers seized 39 million pirated optical discs
worth 960 million HK dollars (123 million U.S. dollars) and
arrested 1,645 people.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, the Customs seized 2.16
million pirated optical discs with a market value of 39 million HK
dollars (5 million U.S. dollars), and arrested 288 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone who is found
selling any pirated article is liable to prosecution. The maximum
penalty for the offense is a fine of 50,000 HK dollars (6,410 U.S.
dollars) per disc and four years' imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Meeting Balance Budget by 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Tuesday
dismissed fears that it will not be able to meet its goal of
balanced budget by the year 2002, citing projected growth rates
and the implementation of the tax administration programs as
assurance that it can hit its economic targets.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican
said the fears aired by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
mainly because the Philippine government and the IMF do not share
the same definition of revenues, resulting in their differences as
to how to view Manila's fiscal position.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was reported to have aired concern over the
Philippines' target of a balanced budget by 2002, predicting that
it would take four more years to accomplish the goal of removing
the fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
To balance the budget, the IMF proposed that the government
push for the enactment of more revenue raising measures, saying
the tax measures now pending in Congress, will not earn much for
the government, but will merely improve the playing field for the
business sector.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine government believes that its tax
administration programs under the Bureau of Internal Revenue
(BIR), will be enough to boost government's revenue generation
plans, saying by the year 2002, the BIR will have the capacity to
effectively curb tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
"The tax administration programs of the BIR will be at its
final stages of implementation. At that time, the major revenue
districts of the BIR will be fully computerized. Its management
information system will encompass all large and most of the medium
account taxpayers," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this, Barican said that "the economy will be growing
at normal rates of five to six percent by that time. We would have
completely recovered from the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he projected that by 2002, "inflation and
interest rates would be approaching the levels before the
financial crisis, that is five percent for the former, and 10
percent for the latter."
</P>
<P>
"The peso would be very stable, moving within a tight band.
This would reduce the government's debt service payments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that "the revenue reforms submitted to
Congress for deliberation, including the rationalization of fiscal
incentives, rationalization of motor vehicle taxation, tax on
large idle lands, and conversion tax, would have been passed (by
the year 2002), to boost the revenue effort."

JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The two-week nationwide bus
strike in South Africa, which ended Monday, has cost bus companies
and employees 115million rand (19 million U.S. dollars), the
Sowetan newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>

Four trade unions of 18 bus companies were involved in the

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges U.N. to Relocate Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
called on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to
relocate the refugee camps situated along the Kenyan side of the
border with Somalia and move them inside Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a public rally at Wajir District in North Eastern
Province Monday, Moi said that refugees in the province had abused
the generosity of Kenyans and had contributed to a lot of
incidents of insecurity including sneaking in of firearms.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Tuesday quoted Moi as
saying that his government would take stern actions against those
refugees who sneak from their designated camps into urban centers
to perpetuate crime.
</P>
<P>
He told the people at the rally to cooperate with security
officers to ensure that illegally held firearms are recovered,
noting that this would help reduce the incidence of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Moi urged the North Eastern Provincial Security Committee to
strengthen security along the Kenyan-Somali border so that people
there can do their business unmolested.
</P>
<P>
In order to maintain good relations between Kenya and Ethiopia,
the president also instructed those living along the border with
Ethiopia not to cooperate with rebels fighting the Ethiopian
government.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the different clans in Wajir District to cultivate
harmonious co-existence and amicably solve the problems that may
arise between them through dialog with elders.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone President Rules Out Cease-fire with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah has ruled out a cease-fire agreement with the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) unless he had the support of
traditional chiefs, Nigeria's Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted as saying on the state radio Monday
that "the government will not take any cease-fire decision without
the involvement of paramount chiefs."
</P>
<P>
A delegation of traditional chiefs has reportedly called on
President Kabbah "not to accept any cease-fire proposal" until the
rebels "vacate all economic areas and the highway leading to the
provinces for vehicular traffic."
</P>
<P>
In Lome, capital of Togo, the rebel group has agreed to a joint
proposal for a cease-fire put forward at the weekend by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the U.N.
special envoy to Sierra leone, Francis Okelo.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said that such a cease-fire would have to be approved by
the government and the west African peace-keeping force ECOMOG
which reinstated the Kabbah government in March of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who was
sentenced to death for treason last October and was recently
released temporarily, agreed that a cease-fire would be possible
once mining and other economic areas under rebel control were free
to resume normal commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
At present in Sierra leone, the Kabbah government supported by
ECOMOG troops holds capital Freetown and its vicinity while the
rebels control several strategic points in the west African
country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Sierra Leone government has said that the
government is implementing a dual track approach to the rebels,
which is to continue dialog with the rebels while to fight them to
clear them from strategic positions in the country.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Younger Chinese Compete by Learning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- For many people 5:00 p.m. marks the
end of the working day and time for going home, but to Li Mingdeng
it means the beginning of an equally important, if not more
important, part of life -- studying at a night school.
</P>
<P>
Li, a computer engineer at Pengli Department Store in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, is studying marketing
at a downtown night school on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with my current work, but I have the feeling
that only professional knowledge is not enough," Li told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to learn as much as possible while I am still
young," added Li, who graduated from Hunan University in central
China's Hunan Province three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Just like the commodities market, the professional market in
China has to some degree developed into a buyer's market and
employers have become unusually choosy," Liang Guiquan, a scholar
of the Guangdong Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, commented
on Li's choice of night schooling at his own expense.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Guangzhou is not the only place where
China's young but well educated generation has encountered the
pressure of competition.
</P>
<P>
While enjoying an unprecedented degree of freedom in job
selection, young people in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin and Shenzhen have felt the pinch of increasingly fierce
employment competition.
</P>
<P>
The changing situation has forced young people, including many
college graduates, to attend various types of programs for
continued education in order to increase their chances to obtain
and maintain good jobs, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, there were an average 2.5 applicants for each job
offer and more than 80 percent of the job seekers have at least
three years of college education, according to data provided by
China Nanfang (Southern) Professional Information Network.
</P>
<P>
In response to this situation, part-time training programs and
night schools have sprung up and thrived in Guangzhou, Shanghai,
Beijing, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Official figures show that the
special economic zone of Shenzhen alone has 233 continued
education institutions, which trained nearly 300,000 people last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Ministry of Education,
economics, management, computer science and foreign languages are
the most popular specialties in continued education.
</P>
<P>
Many people choose courses and specialties that are quite
different from the nature of their work and they just want to
enrich their bank of knowledge and increase their competitiveness
on the job market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the current reform situation and increasing
job mobility, many people hope to use continued education to build
up their personal assets in knowledge and techniques for job re-
selections in the future, a noted scholar on social issues at
Beijing University said.
</P>
<P>
He lauded the popularity of part-time training and schooling
among young residents as something encouraging and conducive to
the formation of an interaction among employment competition,
respect for knowledge and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Liang Weifeng, general manager of Guangzhou Dashan Air
Conditioner Co. Ltd., said that competition among enterprises is
to a large extent competition for professionals with knowledge in
multiple areas and with creativity and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, just as engines need to be refueled, I need to keep
charging and recharging myself," Li Mingdeng said.
</P>
<P>
Like Li, Ms. Xiao of the Beijing Branch of the China
Construction Bank, who declined to give her full time, is
undertaking all the troubles and hardships to be a certified
public accountant.
</P>
<P>
"Competition highlights one's true skills and study is a
personal passport to the 21st century," said Xiao, a postgraduate
with a three-year-old baby.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mekong River Commission (MRC)
has finally relocated its new Headquarters in Phnom Penh, the
capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An official inauguration ceremony was held in its new
Headquarters.
Attending the ceremony were Prime Minister Hun Sen,
representatives of the four countries of the Mekong River families
and some diplomatic envoys.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen and Le Huy Ngo, chairman of the MRC
Council for 1998/99 of Vietnam addressed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said: "for Cambodians, the Mekong river has always been
with them for their survival, like a mother looking after her
children."
</P>
<P>
"Since four-fifths of the Cambodian territory is on the slope
of the Mekong river, the sustainable developments on irrigation,
Hydro-electricity, environment, ecology and the prevention of
floods ... are not only the wishes and goals of the MRC, but also
a main political goal of the Royal Government of Cambodia," Hun
Sen said.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong River Commission consists four countries namely
Laos, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, with no less than 60 million
inhabitants living along the Mekong river basin. Its predecessor,
the Committee of Coordination and Investigations of the Lower
Mekong Basin, was established in 1957.
</P>
<P>
On April 5, 1995, an Agreement on the Cooperation for the
Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin was signed in
Chiang Rai by the four Lower Mekong riparian countries which
established the Mekong River Commission. Over the past 40 years
its headquarters was in Bangkok. Now the MRC has been relocated
in Phnom Penh, a place within the Mekong River Basin.
</P>
<P>
Le Huy Ngo said that the MRC has formulated its medium and long
term Vision and Strategy to make the MRC "a world class,
financially secure, international river basin organization," with
"an economically prosperous, socially just and environmentally
sound Mekong River Basin."
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the MRC should "promote and coordinate
sustainable management and development of water and related
resources for the countries' mutual benefit and the people's
well-being," Le Huy Ngo added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Rejects Plea to Close Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has rejected
donor nations' demand to close down some embassies and missions
abroad, citing that it would cause a diplomatic row.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana said at a press
conference here Monday that such a move would not have gone well
with countries with missions in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted Godana as
saying that Kenya belongs to the "super states" housing one of the
United Nations headquarters in Nairobi, where many countries are
represented.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government opted to reduce staff instead of
closing the missions, adding that a third of the staff initially
targeted in the exercise have already been recalled.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a significant return and much money was used to
enable help those employees to return," Godana said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about whether Kenya will re-open its mission in
Rwanda, which was closed down at the height of the Rwandan civil
war, the minister said that his government has not decided yet.
</P>
<P>
But he said Kenya would soon announce a mission to provide
diplomatic services to Rwanda, Burundi and the surrounding areas.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The soaring resources sector
ensured a positive close for the Australian sharemarket Tuesday
despite a generally quiet reaction to Wall Street's record high.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended a modest 9.4 points, or 0.31
percent, firmer at 3,083.9, after early expectations that it would
add around two percent after Wall Street broke through to close
above 11,000 points for the first time ever on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Market turnover totaled 488.1 million stocks worth 884.8
million U.S. dollars, with 754 stocks rising, 646 falling and 441
remaining steady.
</P>
<P>
The subdued reaction to the Dow Jones' record close of 11,014.7
points was partially explained by the belief locally that Wall
Street's run would not be sustained.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's local rise was almost entirely fueled by the leading
 resource stocks as the all resources index added 34.0 points to
1,263.9.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP was almost as strong with a 67.5 cents
gain to 17.55 Australian dollars on turnover of 9.4 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heritage of May 4th Movement Boils Down to Patriotism: Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-president Hu Jintao
urged Chinese young people to carry forward the spirit of the
Great Patriotism characterizing the May 4th Movement 80 years ago
to contribute to the reform and opening up in China today.
</P>
<P>
"The May 4th Movement gave birth to the great spirits of
patriotism, democracy, science and progress, and all the heritage
boils down to the Great Patriotism," Hu said at a grand gathering
of 6,000 representatives of youth from the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji,
Li Ruihuan, Li Lanqing, as well as heads of non-communist parties
and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce attended the
meeting held at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Today is China's "May 4th" Youth Day. It is also the 80th
anniversary of China's "May 4th movement" of 1919, an anti-
imperialist, anti-feudal political and cultural movement led by
intellectuals imbued with the rudiments of Communist ideology.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the patriotism demonstrated in the Movement
vividly revealed the Chinese national spirits of indomitableness
and aspiration of constantly striving to be stronger.
</P>
<P>
Carrying forward the May 4th Movement tradition means that
today's young people must adhere to the theoretical guidance of
Marxism, Mao Zedong Thoughts and Deng Xiaoping Theory and
unswervingly advance the reform and opening up causes of China,
the vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing Chinese history following the May 4th Movement,
Hu stressed that it is evident that the Chinese Communist Party is
the most loyal inheritor of the Movement, and the choice of the
Chinese people to follow the CPC in its liberation and
construction causes is correct and has been justified.
</P>
<P>
He told the Chinese young people to cultivate their ideological
attainment while actively pursuing academic education, to pursue
personal accomplishments as well as serving the country, to foster
lofty ideals and get prepared for hardship, so as to become
socialist contributors as required by the Party and people under
new circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qiang, first secretary of 14th Central Committee of
Communist Youth League of China, presided over today's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Search Finds Signs of World's Oldest Sunken Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Wooden remains of what could be
the world's oldest boat is being surveyed by a group of Chinese
underwater archaeologists near Changshan islands in the Bohai Bay
off China's coast.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, curator of the Museum of Chinese History, said the
sunken boat could be 4,000 years old and the three month
investigation has already made some fascinating discoveries.
"We have found a number of earthen pots which date back to the
Longshan Culture or the Yueshi Culture," said Yu.
</P>
<P>
"We might find that this sunken boat carried the ancient
pottery during the Yueshi Culture period," added Yu, explaining
that the coastal areas in northern Shandong Province were the
birthplace of the two cultures at least 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Once part of the mainland thousands of years ago, the islands
are home to many Neolithic sites and in the 1960s local fishermen
salvaged a number of intact earthenware pots 60 meters below the
sea's surface.
</P>
<P>
"Marine biological remains surrounding the pots show that they
had been underwater for a very long time," Yu said. "And they most
likely were part of the boat's cargo," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the search team, China's only one in this field of
expertise, is finding it very difficult to actually target what
might be the boat because of difficult conditions, but Yu has
pledged to continue the exercise.
</P>
<P>
China started its underwater archaeology in 1989 with the help
of Japanese experts.
</P>
<P>
The team recently found over 1,500 cultural relics, including
delicate china, ironware, and a 500-kg stone anchor which dated
back 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Before China had assembled its own underwater archaeological
expertise, a British diver called Michael Hartcher led a group of
foreigners on an underwater treasure hunt in 1985. They found a
great number of items such as china and gold bullion which made
huge profits at auction for them.
</P>
<P>
After that the Chinese government formulated regulations to
protect the country's underwater cultural relics and establish its
own research and excavation center.

<HEADLINE> hke050437-Singapore's Maritime Sector Plays Major Role in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Minister for Education
and Second Minister for Defense Teo Chee Hean said here Tuesday
that his country's maritime sector contributes 3 percent of the
gross domestic product, playing a significant part in bringing
Singapore to where it is today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the IMDEX Asia 99, Teo
said, "The importance of the sea to Singapore's development and
prosperity is reflected in our status as a global city of
international trade."
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore's total trade in 1998 amounted to more than
353 billion Singapore dollars (about 208 billion U.S. dollars)
which was almost three times the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports accounted for more than 40 percent of the total
exports over the past years, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Teo, the maritime sector employs a workforce of
more than 24,000 workers and has a turnover of some 10 billion
Singapore dollars (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) per annum,
</P>
<P>
"It is noteworthy that the maritime sector generates a net
value added per worker of 161,000 Singapore dollars (about 94,000
U.S. dollars) per annum, which is almost twice the average net
value added per worker for the entire services sector," he
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Teo noted that the Singapore Shipping Registry has been
experiencing growth rates of about 10 percent a year in recent
years and it grew to 22 million gross tons in 1998. It currently
ranks the 8th in the world and has become "the largest merchant
fleet in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Billing Singapore as the world's busiest port in terms of
tonnage and leading bunkering port, Teo said 1998 saw Singapore
container traffic growing by 7 percent to the 15 million TEU mark
for the first time with some 18 million tons of bunker supplied.
</P>
<P>
Citing his country as the world's leading jack-up rig builder
and one of the world's leading ship repair and conversion centers,
Teo said Singapore's shipyards are focusing their efforts on
high-value ship repair, building and conversion jobs, and the
design and building of new generation deep water rigs.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's 5th National Assembly Opens Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Permanent Deputy Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dzung said Tuesday that despite many
difficulties and challenges, the Vietnamese economy still achieved
growth in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In his government report to the fifth session of the 10th
legislative National Assembly (NA) which opened here Tuesday,
Dzung said that Vietnam's industrial production has increased only
by 10.1 percent in the first four months of this year, the lowest
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Because of a poor market, Dzung said, some main industrial
products, most of state-owed enterprises, have witnessed low
growth or even contraction in production.
</P>
<P>
According to him, coal production decreased by 21.2 percent,
steel by 19.4 percent, cement by 1 percent and silk fabric by 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rice output of the winter-spring crop this year was about
13.6 million tons, a little bit more than last year's
winter-spring crop, Dzung said in his government report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the value of Vietnam's export and import in the
first four months of this year reached 3 billion U.S. dollars,
down 7.5 percent from the same period last year. This was the
first negative growth in the value of Vietnam's export and import
in many years.
</P>
<P>
Dzung called for accelerating the national renovation process,
fully utilizing resources, overcoming difficulties, and
successfully implementing the socio-economic targets set for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Le Kha Phieu,
Vietnamese President Tran Duc Luong and Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The NA session, which will last for more than a month, is
scheduled to pass several amendments to the Criminal Law, the
Press Law, the Business Law, and the Law of the Fatherland Front
of Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Troops Won't Leave DRC: Defence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not withdraw its troops
from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), despite mounting
pressure on the domestic and international scene to do so, the
Zimbabwean defense minister has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald newspaper Monday, Moven Mahachi
said that Zimbabwe will only pull out of the DRC when peace
prevails in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the DRC as a defense force to prevent the aggressors
and our boys are doing just that it would not make any sense to
withdraw at this stage, when we have already gone this far," the
paper Tuesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The DRC is our brother and we are there at the invitation of
the Congolese government through President (Laurent) Kabila. So we
will only withdraw when the Congolese government feels it's ripe
for us to do so," said Mahachi.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister acknowledged that Zimbabwe had not budgeted
for the war, but had to make sacrifices to bring peace and stop
the rebels from committing genocide in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"I know our economy is not doing well, but that will not stop
us from fighting," he said, adding that "we are meeting some of
the expenses and other allied forces are also doing so."
</P>
<P>
Angola, Chad and Namibia also sent troops to the DRC last
August to help Kabila's government to fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe was the main player of the allied forces and its
troops were currently deployed on the eastern front, protecting
major cities, such as Lubumbashi and Camina.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi dispelled reports that Zimbabwe had severe casualties
there.
</P>
<P>
However, the Zimbabwean minister applauded peace initiatives by
the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and hoped that the Ugandan
President would stick to his promise and bring peace to the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Macao Newspapers Applaud Spirit of May 4 Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of the 80th
anniversary of the May 4 Movement, newspapers in Macao published
editorials encouraging young people to carry forward the fine
tradition of the movement and contribute to Macao's future
development.
</P>
<P>
On May 4, 1919, students in Beijing took to the streets
protesting against the then warlords-led government which planned
to sign a humiliating international pact. The demonstration
triggered widespread protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the movement served as a campaign to fight
against feudalism and promoted democracy and science.
</P>
<P>
The "Macao Daily News" said in an editorial on Monday that the
May 4 Movement brought new thoughts and new culture to China and
was a Chinese style of Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
The movement was also a good example of the integration of
intellectuals, workers and farmers in the course of the Chinese
revolution, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"To inherit and carry forward the spirit of May 4 Movement, we
should love the motherland and the people, and uphold the banners
of democracy and science in the trans-century modernization drive
of our country," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Macao newspaper "Tai Chung Pou" pointed out in its Tuesday
editorial that the May 4 Movement was a dynamic patriotic movement
in modern China with the participation of people throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
"To carry forward the patriotic spirit and march toward
democracy and science is a serious historic mission for all
Chinese people, particularly the youth," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The "Correio Sino-Macaense" newspaper noted that "our
retrospection of history is to manage our current affairs better
and create a bright future."
</P>
<P>
Chinese young people should promote the spirit of May 4
Movement and push ahead China's reforms. As to the youth in Macao,
they should take an active part in preparing for the establishment
of the Macao Special Administrative Region and contribute to the
complete reunification of the country, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, U.S. Strengthen Anti-narcotics Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United States
pledged Tuesday to strengthen their cooperation in curbing illegal
drug trade by expanding their anti-narcotics campaign in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
This was learned from Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican
who was present at the meeting between Philippine President Joseph
Estrada and U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard at
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the American ambassador agreed that U.S. and
Philippine anti-drug authorities ought to explore innovative ways
to curtail the drug trade," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted during his regular press briefing that Hubbard had
echoed Washington's concern that the Philippines had been used by
foreigners running illegal drug syndicates, as a transshipment
point of narcotics bound for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It is due to this concern, Barican said, that the U.S.
ambassador had asked President Estrada "to address this kind of
problem before it gets to such a stage that it becomes a serious
concern."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that although the Philippines has a wide coastline,
making it an ideal transshipment point of goods bound for the
U.S., the former has not been listed as among the top countries
used as jump-off point for drugs that enter the American market.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem of drug trafficking, Barican said the
Presidential Palace "is considering the creation, in the long
term, of a central unified civilian drug enforcement agency,
patterned after the American model."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) which is
primarily tasked with tracking down the operations of illegal drug
syndicates and effect the arrest of traffickers and
narcotic-related offenders.
</P>
<P>
Barican said such a move would be a long-term goal, as he
explained that the creation of an agency similar to the DEA would
require legislation, and the enactment of such laws by Congress,
normally takes time.

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China and Cuba signed five trade and

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- In response to a call to improve
workers' benefits, the Philippines' Labor and Employment
Department said Tuesday that President Joseph Estrada has created
a Presidential Retirement Income Commission to look after the
pension and retirement benefits of workers.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the commission will review the operation of the
current retirement income system and make recommendations for
reform and improvement of the pension fund systems.
</P>
<P>
In Executive Order No. 91, the president said that it is
necessary to integrate the different pension/retirement fund
systems to make them more equitable, efficient, affordable and
financially sound.
</P>
<P>
The commission will be composed of 15 members to be appointed
by the president.
</P>
<P>
The representatives will come from the Department of Finance,
the Department of Labor and Employment, the Department of Social
Welfare and Development, the Social Security and Government
Service Insurance Systems, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and the
Voluntary Pension System, among others.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Estrada directed the commission to submit an interim
report that will outline the current status of the retirement
income system and discuss areas needing improvement and a final
report that will detail the commission's recommendations for
change.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some organized labor groups called on the government
to increase by at least 50 percent the medical and health benefits
of workers, including pension and retirement benefits.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Clash With Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua)-- Clashes erupted Tuesday between
Palestinian students and Israeli soldiers at Bitonia checkpoint
near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian security police
said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes are going on now and no casualties are reported so
far.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian students threw stones at the Israeli soliders,
who responded with rubber-coated bullets, the Palestinian police
added.
</P>
<P>
May 4 is the last day of the five-year Palestinian interim
self-rule period enshrined in the Oslo accords between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership had originally hinted to declare an
independent state on the date, but they delay the decision over
statehood proclamation till after the May 17 Israeli general
elections.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian police officer told Xinhua that everything
can happen in the Palestinian territories today or tomorrow
because the Palestinians do not have their independent state in
the territories on the historic date.
</P>
<P>
"We are ordered to maintain order in the territories since
Monday night and we are prepared for any eventualities," the
officer said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Demanding the palestinian leadership declare an independent
Palestinian, Fatah movement organized a big demonstration in the
West Bank city of Hebron Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of demonstrators marched from the Hebron University
to the "border line" between H1 and H2, and no clashes were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been divided into two zones, with H1 the residential
area for 130,000 Palestinians and H2 occupied by the Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
is scheduled to hold a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in
Ramallah, demanding the Palestinian leadership let the
Palestinian people exercise their sovereignty on the Palestinian
land and get rid of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another
Palestinian political faction, is to organize a demonstration
Tuesday afternoon in Gaza to voice its support for the declaration
of the statehood.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Call for More Industrial Investment Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists at a recent
symposium in Beijing have called for the establishment of more
industrial investment funds in the country, which they said would
help expand China's financial market and bring in more foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The symposium hosted by the Society of Macroeconomy of China
focused on the development of joint industrial investment funds
between Chinese and overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the symposium were quoted by today's China
Securities as saying that the development of more industrial
investment funds would foster a new investment and financing
mechanism in China, in which the government would play a less
important role.
</P>
<P>
They said such investment funds would divert more private
capital from bank deposits into the investment market, hence
reduce the pressure on the government to issue more treasury bonds
and improve the efficiency of capital resources.
</P>
<P>
The economists said the development of Sino-foreign investment
funds would draw to China the huge funds managed by investment
funds, insurance funds and pension funds of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government give top priority to the new
investment tool in its future efforts to attract foreign
investment, as it would neither increase the country's foreign
debt, nor would it cause disability in the financial market.
</P>
<P>
They said investment funds could be either industrial funds
jointly launched by Chinese and overseas institutions with its
funds raised from both domestic and international markets, or
joint fund management corporations with its funds solely raised in
the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Computers Hit by CIH Virus in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 computers in Kuwait
were affected by CIH virus when it attacked computers worldwide on
April 26, local Arab Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which is also dubbed as Chernobyl because it hit
computers on April 26, the thirteenth anniversary of the nuclear
disaster in former Soviet Union, has inflicted extensive and
costly damage on private and public computer users, Chairman of
the Kuwait Computer Society Hamoud Al-Assousi said.
</P>
<P>
Assousi said that 60,000 to 70,000 people in Kuwait use e-mail,
the main way by which the virus spread around the world and enter
computers.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the victims of the virus were individuals,
companies and government institutions. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Neal Britto, an expert of a local computer company, estimated
that 20 to 25 percent of companies in Kuwait have been affected by
the virus and that it would cost 65 Kuwaiti dinars (214 U.S.
dollars) to 75 dinars (247 dollars) per terminal to fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
"This has been the most powerful virus in a very long period
of time. There were plenty of other virus in the past, but this
was a really dangerous one," Britto said.
</P>
<P>
CIH virus, reportedly created by Chen Ing-hau, a 24-year-old
Taiwanese information engineer, is among the most damaging
viruses of recent years.
</P>
<P>
The virus employs a "spacefilling" technique that clogs up a
computer's hard-disc storage system, crashing most systems and in
many cases making restart impossible.
</P>
<P>
Since April 26, thousands of computers in the Gulf Arab
countries have reportedly been struck by CIH virus and the
worst-hit state is the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Israel Locate Key Gene for Possible Melanoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli researchers have
discovered the gene responsible for making melanoma metastasize
and invade other tissues and organs, a finding that will help
develop innovative treatment for the often-fatal skin-cancer.
</P>
<P>
According to a Jerusalem Post report Tuesday, the gene enables
the cancerous cell in melanoma to produce an enzyme, which allows
the tumor cell to invade distant tissues and organs.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is important because it will help doctors
diagnose if the tumor will metastasize or not, according to
experts at the Israel Cancer Association (ICA).
</P>
<P>
Based on the finding, researchers can strive to develop
substances, even a vaccine, to block or neutralize the enzyme,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The ICA urges parents to protect children from the sun with
protective clothing, hats and sunscreen, saying that ultraviolet
ray exposure has a cumulative damaging effect over one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The association, which is sponsoring an ongoing Skin Cancer
Week, also said the incidence of melanoma has stabilized in
Israel since 1992 after years of increase thanks to intensified
education about the prevention of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Early detection of melanoma has increased to 40 percent of
cases between 1994 and 1996 from 20 percent in the period between
1990 and 1993, the experts said. If diagnosed early, the patients
will have a 90 percent survival rate, they said.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities and local authorities have been encouraged to
provide shade at schools, kindergartens and public areas, the
newspaper report said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors Continue Strike For Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- About 25 hospitals in Israel were
closed Tuesday as doctors continued their strike to protest
against the lack of progress in the negotiations with the Finance
Ministry over salary increase.
</P>
<P>
The doctors from the general, psychiatric, geriatric and
rehabilitation hospitals around the country took part in the
strike.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched by Israel Medical Association (IMA)
Monday after a fruitless meeting between IMA leaders and the
officials from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
IMA leaders said that the wage's real value has eroded since
the signing of a wage agreement with the Finance Ministry in 1994
</P>
<P>
The leaders said that the doctors want to preserve the real
value of their wages and to have the salaries they earned since
1994 accordingly adjusted.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry officials have rejected the doctors'
demand, saying they would cause a meltdown of the entire public
wage system.
</P>
<P>
They also accused the doctors of exploiting the May 17
elections as a way of forcing the government to give in.
</P>
<P>
Yoram Blasher, IMA's chairman, has refuted that the doctors
decided to strike only after it became clear that the Finance
Ministry was "deliberately dragging its feet, and had no intention
of conducting negotiations in good faith."
</P>
<P>
Blasher added that the strike will continue until an
acceptable wage deal is signed.

PARIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 17 civilians were killed and 43 injured by an
airstrike of NATO on Monday in Kosovo. The bomb hit a bus and two
cars. NATO has opened an inquiry in the wake of the sixth error in
its airstrikes since the beginning of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time, NATO plunged Serbia into darkness with
the help of an ultra-secret special arm which, said experts, could
be a bomb of graphite. After destroying the principal bridges of
the country and strongly damaged the television networks, NATO
caused from the night of Sunday till Monday morning a gigantic
short-circuit depriving most of Serbia of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The diplomatic efforts aimed at seeking a solution to the
Yugoslav conflict were accelerating on Monday, while NATO
concentrated its airstrikes on the Serb forces of Kosovo. French
President Jacques Chirac will go to Moscow on May 13 for a working
visit during which he will meet with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
-- The corpse of George Mallory, the British man who died in
1924 with his companion Irvine near the summit of the Everest
Mountain (Himalayas), could have been discovered. The authorities
of Nepal remain skeptical because of an absence of a DNA test,
while the mystery remains unsolved as for whether Mallory and
Irvine had attended the summit before Hillary and Tenzing became
the officially recognized conquerors of the mountain in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Low Tax Collection Misses Target in Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The low tax collection by the
Israeli Finance Ministry in the first four months of this year has
failed to meet the target in the 1999 budget bill, local daily
Haaretz reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the government's income from taxes
reached 39.9 billion shekels (about 9.8 billion U.S. dollars) in
the first four months, a drop of 0.7 percent in real terms
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the Finance Ministry as saying that the low
tax collection led to a shortage of 2 billion shekels (491 million
dollars) in comparison with the target in the 1999 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry attributed the decline to the economic
slowdown and the shekel's instability.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as the May 17 general elections is in the
offing, such economic figure would "have the alarm sounding
madly," and the cabinet might call an emergency session to deal
with the problem.
</P>
<P>
It said that the government should consider how to curtail
spending dramatically, but not leap into "election economics."
</P>
<P>
Since the Likud Party came to power in June 1996, Israel has
taken a strict economic policy in a bid to lower inflation.
</P>
<P>
The policy and the instable global financial market has led the
country into a economic depression over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> First Mass Wedding Ceremony to be held in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti alms committee is
preparing for a first-time-ever mass wedding ceremony for citizens
and expatriates in the country, local English daily the Arab Times
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This idea came in response to the ever-rising number of
spinsters in Kuwait," said Ahmad Al-Kandari, Director of the
Al-Othman Zakat (alms) Committee organizing the mass wedding.
</P>
<P>
The number of Kuwaiti spinsters were reported to have reached
40,000.
</P>
<P>
Al-Kandari expected an overwhelming response from Kuwaitis and
non-Kuwaitis who are unable to bear the cost of a wedding
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
People in Kuwait, a desert country, still observe the tradition
of holding wedding ceremonies for the engaged couples in the
weekend evenings in big tents erected in open places by special
service companies.
</P>
<P>
Besides family members and relatives, a small number of close
friends are also invited to the weddings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the arrangements underway, Kandari said the
committee had contacted large hotels in Kuwait so that each could
provide two large halls, for men and women separately, along with
a proper dinner buffet for wedding guests.
</P>
<P>
He said that the door of the mass wedding is open to both
Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis and couples wishing to participate would
not be imposed any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Arab and foreign news reporters will be invited to cover the
event, he added.

<HEADLINE> Japanese, German Automakers Enjoy Huge Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Three major Japanese and two
German automakers Monday reported their April sales results in the
United States, saying they had their biggest improvement in the
month.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Corp., the largest Japanese automaker, posted its
best April ever in the United States, with sales up nearly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yale Gieszl, vice president of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc.,
said Toyota Camry once again became bestseller in the United
States, with sales up 21 percent for its best April ever. Its
truck sales also boosted by 13.5 percent and minivan sales by 25
percent, again the best April ever.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor Co. said it had its biggest improvement in April:
total sales were up 21 percent, led by a 26 percent gain in trucks.
Its redesigned Quest minivan, for example, nearly doubled sales
over April 1998. Car sales were up nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Honda Motor Co. also benefited from improved truck sales, up 53
percent, including 211 percent gain for new Odyssey minivan and 41
percent increase for the CR-V compact SUV. Honda's overall sales
improved 4 percent, dragged down by a 3 percent decline in car
sales.
</P>
<P>
Gler's total sales improved 2 percent, with 6 percent increase
for cars while truck sales were flat.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the reasons for April's remarkable rise of foreign
auto sales were familiar: a robust economy and consumers confident
enough about the future to take on the increased debt of a new car
or truck.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Solving Kosovo Issue by Political Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi stated here Tuesday that the Kosovo issue can be solved
through political means with the consideration of the wide-range
efforts launched by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remark at a joint press conference with the
Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) Ezzidine Laraki.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that following the efforts of various countries
and international organizations, a political solution to the
Kosovo issue is close to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Kosovo issue should be handed over to
the U.N. Security Council in order to find a final resolution.
</P>
<P>
"Without an international consensus, the Kosovo issue can not
be resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began air strikes
against Yugoslav Serb targets after the Serb-led government
refused to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
So far, hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees have poured
into neighboring Macedonia and Albania, with more on the road.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister noted that the OIC, under Iran's
chairmanship, is studying ways to reach an international

In an exclusive interview with the Middle East News Agency,

<HEADLINE> Blair: Solution to Kosovo Crisis Must be Based on NATO's Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Monday that all international efforts for a peaceful solution
to the Kosovo crisis must be based on NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Macedonian Television in Skopje,
capital of Macedonia, Blair said that he welcomed all the efforts
of finding a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis, including the
attempts by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy Victor
Chernomirdin.
</P>
<P>
But those efforts, before all, must be based on NATO's five
demands including the pullout of Serb troops from Kosovo and
refugees' return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's position on the U.N. role in the resolution of the
Kosovo conflict, Blair acknowledged that the U.N. role remained
important.
</P>
<P>
But he added that all further U.N. actions would have to be
based on what "NATO had achieved by military means, as the only
way of guaranteeing" peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our objectives are the troops of (Yugoslav President Slobodan)
Milosevic to get out of Kosovo and the international military
force to go in to lead people back to their homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that he shared NATO General Secretary Javier
Solana's optimism that the end of the Kosovo war was not months
but days away.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he thought the use of NATO ground forces would be
necessary in Kosovo, Blair said that NATO "constantly updates all
its planning and assessment on the issue."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the air strikes would continue until Milosevic
realized "this is a conflict he would not win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair pledged to give Macedonia support and assistance in
helping the Kosovo refugees, whose number has reached 180,000 in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of his one-day visit to Macedonia was to visit
British soldiers deployed in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Blair also met Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov and Prime Minister Ljubcho Georgievski.

<P>
It intends to train around one hundred world class young
scientists, one thousand academic and technological leaders within
China and 10,000 core members to help boost the country's various
academic fields.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the Ministry of Personnel, together with other
government departments, will sponsor 36 senior research classes
this year.
</P>
<P>
These will cover such areas as scientific and technological
innovation, intellectual property protection, quality control,
environmental protection, modern agriculture, geoscience, medicine
and biological medical science, aviation and space flight, new
materials and new energy.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that senior government officials, members of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
as well as some renowned experts and scholars will give lectures
at the senior research classes.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of talented young scientists are scheduled to attend
the research classes. They will carry out academic research and

HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A five-day HOFEX 99, Asia's most
comprehensive food service and hospitality event, opened here
Tuesday, attracting 1,411 companies from 48 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The eighth Asian International Exhibition of Food and Drink is
displaying a diverse range of products, from mouth-watering food
and drinks products, to bakery and confectionery equipment and
products, and hotel and restaurant equipment and services.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition area has jumped to 24,000 square meters, the
largest in its history, representing a 9 percent increase over the
previous event amid the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Portugal and Anhui Province in eastern China as well as
Taiwan participated in the exhibition for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chau Tak Hay, secretary for
Trade and Industry, said the opening of the exhibition underlines
Hong Kong's role as a major international sourcing, trading and
exhibition center, in addition to being a city with a thriving
hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the food and hospitality industry is an important
component of the Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
As of end 1998, there were 8,582 restaurants and 88 hotels and
guest houses in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Hong Kong's total exports of processed food and
beverages alone amounted to 27 billion HK dollars (3.46 billion U.
S. dollars), including 23 billion HK dollars (2.94 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of re-exports.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the hotels and restaurants contributed some 42 billion
HK dollars (5.38 billion U.S. dollars) to Hong Kong's economy,
representing 3.5 percent of its total GDP.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the strong performance of Hong Kong's food and
hospitality industry to a number of favorable factors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a significant travel and tourist industry which
is one of its largest earners of foreign exchange, a discerning
and growing population which demands quality food, its strategic
location as a gateway to the vast market of Chinese mainland, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said the businessmen in Hong Kong are always
responsive to the changing tastes and trends in the increasingly
sophisticated culinary world.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. ARCO Oil Firm Earns More Profits Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO),
one of major oil companies in the world, announced Monday that its
first quarter profits are much better than analyst estimated.
</P>
<P>
Excluding results from chemical and coal operations that ARCO
has sold or spun off, net income from continuing operations rose
to 165 million U.S. dollars in the January-March quarter, or 51
cents a share, from 134 million dollars, or 41 cents a share, a
year ago, the Los Angeles-based ARCO said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts surveyed by First Call expected ARCO's first quarter
earnings of 29 cents.
</P>
<P>
ARCO, which has agreed to be acquired by BP Amoco for 26.8
billion dollars in stock because of hard times brought by the
lowest oil prices last year, did report a decrease in revenue to 2.
55 billion dollars in the first quarter, from 2.65 billion dollars
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Most of the first quarter's net income came from refining and
marketing operations, which earned 129 million dollars after-tax,
up from 19 million in the first three months of last year. It was
due to lower crude oil costs, higher retail volume and a jump in
retail prices, said Michael Wiley, ARCO chief operating officer,
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
California gasoline prices shot up to record levels late in the
first quarter as a result of product losses from four California
refinery instances.
</P>

"Since the majority of ARCO exposure is in California, of
course they benefited from substantially higher refining margins,"
Lehman Brothers analyst Paul Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts added the lower exploration spending in the first
quarter-- just 74 million of an expected 450 million dollars for
the whole year -- also helped boost ARCO's earning.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Consult Tanzanian, Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
will be in Tanzania Tuesday to hold consultations with his
Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mkapa on the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"They will review the progress made so far in the peace process
in the DRC and discuss what they can do to achieve peace in the
country," Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua
Tuesday morning in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu is also expected to attend
the talks. Museveni is scheduled to come back in the afternoon.
But that depends on the progress of the talks," she added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni will brief the two leaders about his recent talks with
DRC President Laurent Kabila in Libya and they will explore more
active roles they should play in bringing an end to the nine-month
armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
This is a follow-up to earlier talks between Mkapa and Kabila
and with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, chairman of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) peace initiative in the DRC, was in Tanzania last month and
appealed to Mkapa to contribute more to the search for peace in
the third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion in August of 1998 quickly spilt into a regional
war after sucking in several countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad are fighting along with the
forces loyal to Kabila while Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi are
allegedly backing the Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged war exerted staggering financial burdens on the
governments involved. Kabila, who had taken a tough stance on
negotiations with the rebels, began to call for talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Kabila would hold talks with the rebels in
Kenyan capital Nairobi in mid May. However, main rebel leader
Wamba dia Wamba announced that his forces was not invited.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said on many occasions that the real resolution to the
DRC crisis lies in their direct talks with the Kabila government.
Any deal struck without the participation of the rebels will
surely turn out to be fruitless, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Negotiated Solution to Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela Tuesday called for a negotiated solution to the Jammu and
Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function hosted by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in honor of the visiting president, Mandela expressed his
hope that the leadership of India and Pakistan will find out "a
negotiated settlement of the dispute".
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was "encouraged" by the latest round of
dialogue between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India and
welcomed the Lahore Declaration signed by the two leaders in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that the spirit which led to the
signing of the Lahore Declaration will sustain progress towards
peace and security in the South Asian subcontinent," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has complete confidence in the leadership of
Pakistan and India to resolve the Kashmir dispute peacefully
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also expressed his concern over the nuclearization of
the subcontinent and called on the two south Asian countries to
"promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in the region."
</P>
<P>
Arriving here Tuesday morning, Mandela was on a four-nation
tour, a farewell visit as he intended to leave the office next
month. Mandela is also to visit China Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The visit has for me personally an element of taking leave of
those who supported us in our struggle for liberation and
freedom," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Pakistan for its support and assistance to the
long-time struggle against apartheid in South Africa which led to
the establishment of an elected government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Sharif paid high
tribute to Mandela for his wise leadership under which, "South
Africa has achieved enviable socio-economic progress and
stability."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, Sharif said, Pakistan is
prepared for the continuation of a meaningful dialogue with India
on all issues, including Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Indian leadership will reciprocate the
sincerity of our purpose," Sharif said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) --In a new step to make better use of
Beijing's rich scientific human resources in developing its high-
tech industries, the capital's authorities have signed a full
cooperation agreement with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Most of China's scientific and technological elite are members
of CAS headquartered in Beijing, which explains the main reason
for the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has also decided to work closely with Beijing
University and Qinghua University, China's two top universities
for liberal arts and for engineering. This will involve the
opening of two institutes focusing on Beijing's economic and
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Beijing will provide CAS with two
million yuan annually to support a series of the latter's research
programs that will hopefully produce good social and economic
results for the city.
</P>
<P>
A special committee, with Beijing Mayor Liu Qi and CAS
President Lu Yongxiang as co-directors, will be formed to oversee
the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Beijing's leaders announced it was to regard
high-tech industries as its new economic powerhouse and will make
greater efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Last month, it introduced a wide range of preferential policies
to attract and retain talented scientific and technological
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, high-tech industries
contributed 54.6 percent to Beijing's industrial economic growth
and the ratio went up to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Prices Hit 17-months High in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices hit a 17-month
high at 19 U.S. dollars a barrel Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, according to reports reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose 19 cents to 18.85
dollars a barrel, after earlier in the session topping 19 dollars
a barrel. Oil product continued to be buoyed by the gains in crude
oil. June gasoline rose 0.37 cent to 55.56 cents a gallon and June
heating oil rose 0.27 cent at 45.37 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil last traded at 19 dollars a barrel on December 5,
1997 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Last week, June crude oil rose another one dollar a barrel and
has now risen 60 percent from the most recent low at 11.70 dollars
a barrel on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Market sources say the latest increase of oil price was a
success the world oil producers has made in trimming back the
global glut of oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) had cut output by 1.35 million barrels a day,
indicating a higher-than-expected 81 percent compliance rate in
OPEC to the cuts pledged under a pact reached in Vienna on March
23.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the oil prices could continue to rise in
coming days if an upcoming report from OPEC shows its members are
adhering to promised cutbacks.

</P>
<P>
New Zealand now has 988 bank branches, 555 fewer than in 1993.
</P>

</P>
<P>
WestpacTrust closed 45 branches, followed by ANZ (Australia

The closures followed the sale of PostBank to ANZ in 1989 and
Westpac's purchase of Trust Bank in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bank of New Zealand closed 18 branches in 1998, while the
National Bank, which last year bought Countrywide, closed 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's external trade
balance recorded a larger surplus during the first quarter of this
year, the Statistics Department said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus during the January-March 1999 period amounted to

of 9.1 billion ringgit (2.39 billion dollars) in the same period
last year, an increase of 72.5 percent, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The bigger surplus during the period under review was due to a
larger decline in imports of 10.7 percent to 53.7 billion ringgit
(14.13 billion dollars) and a marginal increase in exports of 0.3
percent to 69.4 billion ringgit (18.26 billion dollars).

half of the country's total trade during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia continued to maintain its trade surplus record for 17
consecutive months till March 1999 when the surplus of 6.5 billion
ringgit (1.7 billion dollars) was higher by 32.6 percent than the
surplus of 4.9 billion ringgit (1.29 billion dollars) in February

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Export Growth Slows Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Merchandise export receipts in the
Philippines grew by 15.2 percent in the first quarter of 1999, but
the growth pace slowed down to only 9.1 percent in March, the
National Statistics Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here, the office said aggregate merchandise
export receipts for the first quarter went up to 7.85 billion U.S.
dollars from 6.816 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"For March 1999, total dollar flows went up 9.1 percent to
2.699 billion dollars from 2.474 billion dollars a year earlier,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was caused by a modest export growth of
electronics and components and a drop in the export of apparel and
clothing accessories, the office said.
</P>
<P>
In March, exports of electronics and components increased by 11
percent, compared with 38.17 percent in January and 22.7 percent
in February.
</P>
<P>
Receipts from apparel and clothing accessories dropped by 15
percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Electronics accounts for 52 percent of the country's total
exports while apparel and clothing accessories are the third major
products for export.
</P>
<P>
The office said exports of coconut oil also suffered a
3.3-percent contraction in March.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and the Netherlands remained the
Philippines' major trading partners in the first quarter.

<P>
PLDT Executive Vice President Antonio R. Samson said PLDT is on
target in its objective to make its services Y2K ready by the end
of the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"A well-organized and well-funded program has been in place as
early as middle of 1997 to ensure our services continue to operate
in the year 2000 including accounting and billing systems for both
customers and investors," Samson said.
</P>
<P>
He said its international gateway exchanges and local basic
telephone services are now ready for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
PLDT is retiring its analog services to make the firm fully

The company has been conducting intensive remediation and
testing work to meet its mid-year 1999 objective.

Its dedicated testing environment and infrastructure are being
used to accelerate the testing. As a parallel activity, testing is
also in progress in the test beds of PLDT's major suppliers in
various parts of the world, Samson said.
</P>

The program costs PLDT about 100 million U.S. dollars and
involves software system, work stations and equipment, among
others.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese basketball star Yao Ming
is capable of being an impact player in the NBA of the United
States, said a U.S. sports management firm in a news release
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yao, 18, a star player for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese
Basketball Association and a member of the Chinese National Team,
has signed a management agreement with the Cleveland-based firm,
Evergreen Sports, Inc.
</P>
<P>
"He is considered by many to be China's premier basketball
player and capable of being an impact player in the NBA," said
Evergree. Yao is seven-feet-six-inches (2.28 meters) tall, and
weighs 270 pounds (123 kg).
</P>
<P>
The sports management firm is helping Yao evaluate his
professional basketball options and will manage his career if he
chooses to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
"Given his size, athleticism, intelligence and discipline,"
Evergreen president Michael F. Coyne said. "We believe Yao Ming
will be a very early pick in this year's NBA's draft if he chooses
to declare himself eligible."
</P>
<P>
The firm quoted NBA player representative and former NCAA
Division 1 head basketball coach Tom McLaughlin as saying that "
there hasn't been a player with Yao Ming's combination of size,
strength, skill, and agility since Shaquille O'Neal."
</P>
<P>
"He is a once in a lifetime pick for a NBA team," McLaughlin
said. "If he enters the draft, he'll likely be the first Asian-
born player in the NBA.

Mandela arrived here Tuesday on an official visit to Pakistan for
talks with Pakistani leaders on a wide range of issues of common

</P>
<P>
A 21-gun salute was sounded as the South African president
descended his special plane along with his daughter Zenani Mandela
Dlamini.
</P>

Mandela was greeted by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's day-long visit to Pakistan is part of his farewell
tour as president. He has announced his intention to leave the

</P>
<P>
Government officials said Mandela's visit to Pakistan is an
important step in further consolidating bilateral ties, which have
grown steadily since the demise of the apartheid regime in 1994
and the restoration of democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The visit is the second by Mandela to Pakistan. He toured this
South Asian nation as president of the African National Congress
in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Islamabad, Mandela will call on President
Rafiq Tarar and hold talks with Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Both countries attach great significance to such high-level
exchanges for deepening mutual understanding and sharing
perceptions on issues of common concern, the officials said.

Mandela and Sharif last met on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly in New York last September. The two leaders

<HEADLINE> Iran to Purchase 30 Gas Turbines from Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday signed a contract worth 1
billion U.S. dollars to buy 30 gas turbines from Italy to boost
its power generation, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed between Iran's Power Plants Research
Directorate Company (MOPNA) and the Italian company Ansaldo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Iranian Energy minister Habibollah
Bitaraf said the contract was aimed at boosting Iran's power
generation in order to meet the country's demands.
</P>
<P>
preliminary investigations conducted by the Energy Ministry at
the beginning of 1998 revealed that the country would face a
shortage of about 2,000 or 3,000 megawatt of electric power in
the first few years of the third five-year development plan which
is scheduled to kick off in the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bitaraf said that the Energy Ministry decided to set up seven
combined cycle power plants in the next decade in addition to the
new hydroelectric and thermal power plants to meet the country's
energy requirements.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will involve the purchase and manufacture of 30
gas turbines with a capacity of 4,700 megawatt, he said, MOPNA was
recognized as the main sponsor of the project and the Italian firm
was finally chosen as the main supplier of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the contract also encouraged
manufacturers to put forward technical know-how, to provide the
required machinery and cooperate with about 30 local factories in
the manufacture of at least 52 percent (about 500 million dollars)
of the value of the contract in the country.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the contract, heavy commitments have been
made by both sides, he said, Ansaldo will meet the requirement in
equipment as well as transfer of technology for the construction
of the power plants and the Italian state insurance company Sace
has agreed to provide insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier report said that Iran's power generating capacity has
reached 25,000 megawatts, ranking 21st in the world.

He said NATO's action seriously violated the principles of the
U.N. Charter and international law.

He added that the Vietnamese people, who used to be the victims
of war of aggression and experienced heavy losses and sacrifices
in fighting for the nation's independence, sovereignty and
reunification, are very indignant at NATO's military attack and
have great compassion for the Yugoslavian people's serious losses.

LOS ANGELES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Online advertising revenues in
the United States more than doubled in 1998, reaching 1.92 billion
U.S. dollars, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
It grew by 112 percent over the 906 million dollars for 1997,
said the leading online ad association Internet Advertising Bureau

</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter alone, Web ads increased by 34 percent to

only 267 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Internet as a viable advertising medium is
barely four years old, IAB said that its growth, measured in
billions of dollars, is astounding. The association expects a
sustained growth period in coming years due to increasing online
ad budgets and greater commitment by large traditional advertisers.
</P>
<P>
The categories which lead the online spending were consumer-
related advertisements at 31 percent, computer-related ads at 26
percent, and financial services at 19 percent. Top sectors
represented in the consumer category include retail, auto, toys,
travel and music.
</P>
<P>
Top 10 Web sites drew 71 percent of all ad spending for the
fourth quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, banner advertising represented

percent from 36 percent at the end of 1997.

JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's first quarter gross
domestic product (GDP) dropped by 10.34 percent compared with the
same period of last year, but was up 1.34 percent when compared
with the fourth quarter of 1998, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said.
</P>
<P>
The GDP increase in the first three months this year was mostly
contributed by a better rice and other food harvest, leading local
newspapers Tuesday quoted the bureau's head, Sugito Suwito, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Household consumption expenses in the first quarter edged up
1.41 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year, he
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary crisis that has impacted on the economic
structure is forecast to cause a 19.89-percent rise in
contributions by the agriculture sector in 1999, up from 18.84
percent in 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Indonesia's economy has not shown significant
improvement. Almost all sectors suffered a negative growth except
the agricultural, electricity, gas and water sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the deflation trend, Sugito said that although prices of
some commodities have increased, prices of most commodities in the
market, including rice, red chili, onion, sugar, fresh chicken and
fish, recorded a decrease.
</P>
<P>
The country booked inflation in January and February and posted
deflation in the following two months.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation rate from January to April this year averaged at
3.37 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in the same period last
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports in February increased to 3.193 billion U.S.
dollars from 3 billion dollars in January while imports edged up
to 1.817 billion dollars from 1.81 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has initiated a training program on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (Aids) prevention for local medical officials.
</P>
<P>
An official from the autonomous regional public health bureau
said that the program is being sponsored by the British Save the
Children Fund and that Tibet and the United Nations' Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization will jointly host a series of
publicity activities in the second half this year on the
prevention and control of Aids in the region.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tibet has reported no Aids patients, the official said.
In recent years two foreign tourists who intended to travel in
Tibet were found to be Aids patients and were refused entry to the
region.
</P>
<P>
With booming tourism and further opening up, more and more
domestic and overseas tourists come to Tibet year by year. In 1998,
Tibet received a total 380,000 tourists, including 90,000
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The increasing tourist numbers will bring the potential danger
of entry of the disease, the official said, adding that Tibet is
increasing examinations on tourists flying to the region and a
number of international health organizations are mapping out
support plans on Aids prevention and control work in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Urges Clinton to Show Good-will Gesture to Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson urged President Bill Clinton on Monday to phone Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic as a good-will gesture after three U.S.
POWs were released.
</P>
<P>
However, a White House official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Clinton would not make any telephone call to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Jackson told reporters after his meeting with Clinton at the
White House that the president told him he needs time to "mull
over it."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Yugoslav authorities released the three POWs --
Steven Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Texas; Andrew Ramirez, 24, of
Los Angeles; and Christopher Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said that NATO will not pause in its air campaign
against Yugoslavia, instead, it will step up the operation.
</P>
<P>
"What's missing here is some gesture," Jackson said. "I would
hope that we would look soon for some basis for more talks, even a
pause in the bombing."
</P>
<P>
"Those little steps in the right direction can spare all of us
a long and bloody war," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Clinton to hold talks with Milosevic. "There is
power in talking. There is power in reciprocity. There is power in
diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"We have the right not to talk.... To not talk is not the right
thing to do. To not exchange prisoners is not the right thing to
do. We are strong enough to express courtesy," he added.
</P>
<P>
But senior U.S. administration officials said that there was no
plan for Clinton to meet Milosevic.

Jackson also suggested that NATO release the two Serb prisoners
it is holding and urged the alliance to stop bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We must seize this moment to take the step to dramatic
diplomacy from bloody, protracted war," Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
"We have the power to bomb. We should have the strength to
negotiate. A bridge has been blown up, the bridge of diplomacy and
trust, and that bridge must be restored," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Jackson criticized NATO's initial response
to Belgrade's release of the U.S. soldiers as showing the "
arrogance of power."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourists Visiting Indonesia Up 7.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign tourists
visiting Indonesia in the first three months of this year
increased by 7.4 percent to 943,720 compared with the
corresponding period of last year, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Central Bureau of Statistics Sugito Suwito said
here Monday that the tourists entered the Indonesian territory
through 13 gateways in Mataram, capital of West Nusa Tenggara
Province, which registered the highest increase in the number of
tourist arrivals, namely 69.08 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mataram was followed by Ngurah Rai airport (Bali) with a
23.15-percent increase in tourist arrivals and Batam (Riau) 22.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of foreign tourists entering the country
through Adi Sumarmo airport (Solo) dropped by 65.83 percent,
through Hasanudin (Ujungpandang) 54.52 percent and Entikong
(Pontianak) 42.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation in the number of tourist arrivals much depended
on the social, political and security conditions in the country,
Antara News Agency Tuesday quoted Sugito as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists visiting Indonesia in 1998 was 3.51
million, down by 16.97 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit by a spate of riots following the
downfall of former President Soeharto on May 21, 1998, amid the
country's worst economic and political crisis in decades. The
riots have claimed more than 1,000 lives in the last 18 months.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA to Propose Better Flight Recorders for 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) said Monday it will propose that airlines
install better flight data recorders, known as black boxes, on
Boeing 737 commercial planes to track more flight functions,
especially those related to the rudder.
</P>
<P>
The FAA proposal comes after the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) ruled that a jam in a rudder-control valve caused the
1994 crash of U.S. Air Flight 427 near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
killing all 132 people on board.
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, flight recorders have provided a blueprint for
deficiencies in the system that needed to be fixed," FAA
Administrator Jane Garvey said at the NTSB's international
symposium on flight data recorders in Arlington County, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
She said the FAA will also propose prolonging the 30-minute
recording now required on cockpit voice recorders to two hours and
installing a 10-minute backup power supply by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The NTSB has been asking the FAA for years to require longer
tapes to record pilots' conversations and better flight data
recorders. The two devices play a critical role in helping
investigators determine the cause of accidents.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, federal regulators issued a rule ordering all U.S.
transport airplanes besides 737s to be equipped by August 2001
with flight data recorders that could track a minimum of 17
functions.
</P>
<P>
Garvey said the agency will propose additional requirements for
737s, which will include flight data recorders capable of keeping
information on four to 11 more flight functions -- beyond those
covered by the 1997 ruling. And they ought to be installed by
August 2000 -- a year earlier than those covered in the 1997
ruling.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 3,100 Boeing 737s in operation in the
worldwide fleet.

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka's Central Bank Calls for Healthy Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Central Bank has urged
the government to curb the country's massive expenditure over
earnings and maintain the budget deficit at a healthy level in
order to enliven the economy, press reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government should "go back to the budget deficit of 6.5
percent" of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of the present
9.2 percent, The Island newspaper reported, quoting Central Bank
Governor A.S. Jayawardena.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the deficit increased further there would be
a rise in prices and the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardena said taxes contributed only 16 percent to GDP, down
from an earlier 21 percent. He proposed that all people should be
driven by the government to pay their statutory dues including
politicians and government servants.
</P>
<P>
An increase in levy concessions and tax holiday would merely
harm the country instead of boosting the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the belief that tax holidays lure investors, he
said other factors such as infrastructure and political stability
play a more vital role in their confidence.
</P>
<P>
Predicting a GDP growth rate of 5 to 6 percent this year, he
added that the 1998 economic growth rate of 4.7 percent was
commendable in the context of a highly unstable external
environment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Has 172 Billion Baht Debt Restructured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 172.2 billion baht (4.65
billion U.S. dollars) of the debt of 76 companies in Thailand has
been restructured, Bank of Thailand (BOT), the country's central
bank, said in a report to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was available Tuesday, quoted the corporate
debt restructuring committee of the bank as saying the 172.2
billion baht accounted for 25 percent of the total debt of 676
billion baht (18.3 billion dollars) under the committee's
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Of the 172.2 billion baht debt, some 104 billion baht (2.8
billion dollars) owed by 25 companies was successfully
restructured as on April 23.
</P>
<P>
The rest debts are owed by companies which have already stopped
operation, debtors who are already under court supervision, or
debtors who have returned to performing-loan status.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the Thai Bankers' Association, the
Association of Finance Companies and the Foreign Bankers'
Association had signed debtor-creditor and inter-creditor
agreements in March and April to help facilitate the debt
restructuring process, which is necessary to reduce the level of
non-performing loans and aid economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The agreements focus on medium and small-sized enterprises of
commercial banks and finance companies. There are specific
procedures and timetables under the agreements to select target
debtors and complete the tasks.
</P>
<P>
Generally, a case is given 60 days to complete. Another 15 days
will be given for settlement of disputes, if any. Independent
advisers will be appointed to help settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
The target for speedy debt restructuring is now corporate
debtors with debt between 100 million baht (2.7 million dollars)
and 1 billion baht (27 million dollars), the report said.

<HEADLINE> Hockey Player Chiasson Killed in Traffic Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Carolina Hurricanes defenseman
Steve Chiasson was killed when his pickup track flipped on a dark,
lonely road hours after his team was eliminated from the North
American ice hockey Stanley Cup playoffs in North Carolina last
night.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old player was found early Monday morning and the
State Highway Patrol says he might have been speeding after
drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
The truck rolled and ejected Chiasson, who was not wearing a
seat belt and had been driving alone, investigators said. Weather
was not a factor and no other vehicles were believed to have been
involved.
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier in Boston, the Bruins ended the Hurricanes'
season with a 2-0 win in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
Team spokesman Chris Brown said two cases of beer and water,
sports drinks, milk and vegetable juice were served on the team's
charter flight to Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
He didn't know how much beer Chiasson drank. After the plane
landed about 1 a.m. at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, the
players got into their vehicles and left.
</P>
<P>
Chiasson spent eight years with the Detroit Red Wings, was
traded to the Calgary Flames in 1994 and in 1997 to what then was
the Hartford Whalers.
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89, he led all Red Wings' defensemen with 47 points. In
1989-90, he scored a career-high 14 goals and again led all
Detroit defensemen in scoring with 42 points.
</P>
<P>
Chiasson played in his first NHL All-Star game in 1993.

<HEADLINE> At Least 17 Killed in Clash in Indonesia's Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian security forces shot and
killed at least 17 people in the special territory of Aceh on
Monday as thousands of unarmed demonstrators protested against
violence by the military, national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people were wounded in the incident just north of
Lhokseumawe, 1,600 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident was triggered after thousands of people held 80
soldiers, who were searching for two missing army intelligence
officials, Lhokseumawe Military Commander Col. Johny Wahab said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and civilians exchanged gunfire during the clash, the
second in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
Wahab denied that the soldiers killed the people.
</P>
<P>
"The shooting was an act of self-defense after the mob began to
open fire. It was also unknown whether the fatalities were killed
by our bullets, because some people in the crowd were armed with
rifles," The Jakarta Post quoted Wahab as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his troops used only rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made following the clash and no deployment of
reinforcement troops was needed, Wahab said.
</P>
<P>
"We have restored order and business will be normal as usual,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The previous clash in Lhokseumawe occurred on April 21 when
thousands of students tried to attack the local police
headquarters. A student and a member of the Mobile Brigade were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Demands for a referendum in the westernmost province have
intensified in the past year.

WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Gregg Popovich was named NBA
Coach of the Month today after guiding the San Antonio Spurs to a
13-3 record in April.
</P>

allowing fewer than 85 a contest, and went 9-0 at the Alamodome.
Popovich, the team's general manager who is in his first full
season coaching job, helped turn around the Spurs after they lost
eight of their first 14 games.
</P>
<P>
Popovich edged Paul Silas of Charlotte for the award. Other

Brown of Philadelphia, Rick Adelman of Sacramento and Utah's Jerry

<HEADLINE> Hungary Joins EU Oil Embargo Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government Monday
announced the country's participation in the European Union's oil
embargo against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Deputy State Secretary of the Economy Ministry Balazs Peter
said Hungary would stop its trade of crude oil, oil products and
natural gas with Yugoslavia but could provide oil to humanitarian
institutions, diplomatic missions or peace-keeping forces in that
country under specific authorization of the Economy Ministry and
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, customs sources said Hungary would halt oil
and oil product exports to Yugoslavia, including gasoline, diesel,
lubricant and natural gas, and would also refuse to let other
country's oil exports to Yugoslavia pass through its territory.
</P>
<P>
Balazs noted that Hungary has not exported any oil to
Yugoslavia since NATO launched air strikes on March 24, neither
would it be able to charge transit fees on oil and natural gas
exports passing through its territory to Yugoslavia in the months
to come -- meaning an innumerable amount of losses for Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The longer the war and the oil ban last, the heavier the losses
will be, he said.

inflation for the first four months of this year was 2.1 percent,
Vitoon Tulayanondha, deputy director of the Business Economic
Department was quoted Tuesday by The Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the decline partly to the reduction of
value-added tax to 7 percent from 10 percent, which took effect on
April 1. Price of non-food items fell by 0.6 percent while food
prices declined by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The index is likely to drop further as the wholesale price
index might continue to fall, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Reinforces Control over Sulfur Dioxide Discharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China will cut its sulfur dioxide
emissions by 14 percent before the end of 2000 and 42 percent 2010,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide are
discharged into the atmosphere every year, causing acid rain to
fall in 40 percent of the nation's territory, according to the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Programs have been drawn up to control acid rain and sulfur
dioxide in zones covering 11.4 percent of the country, including
175 prefectures and cities, mostly in southern and central parts
of China.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has demanded that each prefecture and city in
the zones draft a plan for acid rain and sulfur dioxide pollution
control. Each city must reach national standards on sulfur dioxide
discharges by 2010.
</P>
<P>
To date, 93 percent cities have issued programs; the other
cities have completed draft programs and are waiting for approval
from their local governments.
</P>
<P>
According to the programs, 1,798 sulfur dioxide pollution
control projects will be conducted before the end of 2010,
eliminating 9.77 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
This reduction could be realized through comprehensive
prevention and control measures such as modifying the current fuel
mix, introducing clean energy and production techniques, and
reducing the use of high-sulfur coal, said Qiao Zhiqi, SEPA's
department director in charge of pollution control.
</P>
<P>
SEPA is demanding that all cities make every effort to improve
their air quality.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should publish major industrial pollution
sources and set a deadline for them to achieve national standards
on sulfur dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
The discharges of at least 80 percent of the major industrial
enterprises must meet standards by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
SEPA will conduct regular inspections to enforce the acid rain
and sulfur dioxide control programs in each locality, Qiao Zhiqi
said.

<P>
BUDAPEST, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela on Monday criticized NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
as "irresponsible" and urged talks between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin to solve the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He expressed anger over NATO's continuing air strikes at a
meeting here with Hungarian President Goncz Arpad, the official
news agency MTI reported.
</P>
<P>
He said a normal human being cannot accept punishment targeting
innocent civilians, noting that what NATO is doing now is killing
civilians including women, children and elderly people.
</P>
<P>
He called for a meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents,
saying they have the obligation to seek a peaceful solution to the
crisis, and their meeting will be constructive and conducive to
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the opinions of the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council should be fully heeded.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Viktor, Mandela urged all sides of the Kosovo conflict to return
to the negotiating table as soon as possible and reiterated South
Africa's rejection to military actions without U.N. approval.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cautions Against Quick Solution to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said on Monday that it was still too early to assume that a
favorable turn of events had occurred in the Balkans crisis, but
Russia was working for a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told reporters after talks with his Belgian counterpart
Eric Derycke, who made a visit to Moscow on Monday, that they had
discussed the Balkans situation and compared notes on the various
political aspects concerning the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and Belgium were close on principles and
positions concerning the settlement but still needed further
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Russia's ties with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Ivanov said Russia has frozen its
relationship with NATO for the time being and the future of
bilateral ties needs further study and analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister noted that Moscow could not turn a
blind eye to the fact that instead of stopping its air campaign,
NATO has increased its bombing of Yugoslavia, which he said
undermined efforts for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Derycke said Russia's mediatory efforts were important for the
peace process. He said the Balkans envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin's
visit to the United States on Monday was part of Russia's efforts
to bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said Chernomyrdin would make new proposals to the United
States.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Promises More Security Guarantees for Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO will set up as soon as possible
an expert commission to discuss providing Bulgaria with a friend-
or-foe aircraft identification system, NATO Supreme Allied
Commander Europe General Wesley Clark said here Monday after
meeting with President Peter Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov has urged NATO to provide Bulgaria with such a system
after a stray NATO missile fell in Gorna Banya in Bulgaria, said
the president's Press Secretary Neri Terzieva.
</P>
<P>
After Bulgaria is equipped with systems for identifying NATO
planes, the alliance will be able to give still fuller guarantees
for Bulgaria's security, said General Clark, who arrived in Sofia
on Monday evening for a brief working visit.
</P>
<P>
The visiting general and Stoyanov agreed that the building of
Southeastern Europe should start before the end of the Kosovo
conflict, Terzieva told the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The positive result of our meeting is that in several weeks we
will be able to do for Bulgaria's air defense what under other
circumstances would have taken years," Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
said after his meeting with Clark.
</P>
<P>
Clark told reporters that by the end of the week, he will send
a special mission of military experts to Bulgaria to study the
state of Bulgaria's air defense and decide how NATO can help.
</P>
<P>
"I admire the courage and foresight of the Bulgarian Government,
" Clark said after his meeting with the Bulgarian Prime Minister.

<HEADLINE> Coach Happy With Shuttlers' Physical Fitness Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- With only a few days to go before
the Sudirman Cup, Indonesian badminton team trainer Tahir Djide
expressed satisfaction with improvements in the national shuttlers
physical condition.
</P>
<P>
"Results from the second physical fitness test, staged on
Saturday, showed their condition improved by about 70 to 80
percent," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Tahir said the shuttlers should be better prepared
physically for a major event like the Sudirman Cup.
</P>
<P>
"They have yet to reach their best form, based on the
international standard for shuttlers. It's different from when I
trained Liem Swie King and Icuk Sugiarto in the 1980s," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia staged two physical
fitness tests last month, testing the athletes on the VO2 Max,
which measures oxygen's capability in the blood.
</P>
<P>
Both test results showed national shuttlers have not reached
the international standard of 69 milliliters per kilogram of
weight per minute.
</P>
<P>
Tahir said during the two-week training program, athletes
managed to increase their score on the VO2 Max from 55 ml/kg/min.
to 58 ml/kg/min. at the highest.
</P>
<P>
"Among the five events, women's singles have the lowest results.
But they only took part in the first test," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tahir said women's singles player Lidya Djaelawidjaja and
doubles specialist Zelin Resiana had the best results among the
female shuttlers.
</P>
<P>
However, Tahir was disappointed with the test results of All
England finalist Taufik Hidayat, whose performance on the VO2 Max
decreased.
</P>
<P>
"I hoped he would reach 59 on the second test but he failed,
decreasing by two from his first test result of 56," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tahir, however, expressed optimism that Taufik would still be
able to perform at his best in the Sudirman Cup and the World
Championships in Copenhagen from May 10 to May 15.
</P>
<P>
Taufik was among several players who complained about the
training program, saying it could cause injuries.
</P>
<P>
Tahir defended his training program, saying he was trying to
train shuttlers to move and use their energy as efficiently as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He said he only prescribed elementary exercise in the first
week of training and in the second week employed circuit training.
</P>
<P>
"I only gave them elementary training and they complained. What
if I gave them advanced training," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- IBM, the U.S. International
Business Machines Corp., will introduce its sixth generation
mainframe G6 later this month, the Wall Street Journal said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top-end G6 should run at 1,614 MIPS, or millions of
instructions per second, more than 50 percent faster than the top
speed on the current G5. It can use a maximum of 12 processors,
two more than the G5. Each of those chips will process more than
200 million instructions per second, while the G5 chips process
about 155 million instructions per second.
</P>
<P>
IBM said the G6 builds on previous advances, including the use
of CMOS chips, or complementary metal-oxide silicon. The G6 will
also be the first IBM mainframe to use more-efficient copper-based
semiconductors, and the new machines will have expanded memory and
be easier to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
The machines, mostly priced between two million U.S. dollars
and three million dollars, should allow IBM to sustain or possibly
improve upon the market-share gains it made in 1998 in the heavy-
duty computer sector.

<P>
YANGON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A new bridge across Myanmar's
Myitmahka River linking the country's western sector of Bago
division and Ayeyawaddy division was opened to traffic Monday,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Myitmakha River Bridge, which is 456 meters long and has a
3.6-meter-wide motorway capable of withstanding up to 36 tons of
load, was built by a company under the Ministry of Construction at
a cost of over 612,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Letpadan-Tharawaw-Hinthada Road in Letpadan
township in Bago division, the bridge enables people in the region
to travel in a shorter time than before.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been building six new major bridges spanning the
Ayeyawaddy River since 1988. Of these, four have been completed
and they are Myaungmya, Nawahtay, Maubin and Bala Minhtin. The
remaining two, the Bo Myat Tun and the Anawratha, are expected to
be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
During the period, three bridges across the country's Thanlwin

<P>
MANILA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
doubts that the Philippines can meet its target of a balanced
budget by 2002, saying it could take about four more years to
erase the annual deficit, Business World said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted official IMF documents as saying the fund
projects a budget deficit equivalent to 1 percent of gross
national product (GNP) by 2003 from 2.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a balanced budget by 2004, the IMF said, the
government will have to ask the congress for more revenue-raising
measures since tax collections continue to be weak.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is asking the congress to approve
several tax measures which, it hopes, could increase the
government's revenue base, or the number of people paying taxes,
raise annual revenues and improve the playing field for the
business sector.
</P>
<P>
These include the mandatory filing of statements of assets and
liabilities which will have a tax amnesty component, the taxation
of the financial sector, rationalization of fiscal incentives and
the implementation of a road user's tax.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said some of these tax policy measures will not earn
much for the government, but merely improve the playing field for
the business sector.
</P>
<P>
The IMF stressed revenues as a share of GNP -- the widest
measurement of the economy's productive capacity -- should rise in
the medium term "to ensure adequate resources for expenditure
policies and a sustainable deficit path."
</P>
<P>
Investors who participated in the Asian Development Bank annual
meeting last weekend pointed out that while budget deficits are
acceptable during adjustment periods, it should not be allowed to
become chronic since this would affect the ability to pay
outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficits force the government to borrow from either the
domestic or international markets to finance its programs,
increasing the debt stock.
</P>
<P>
Budget surplus, on the other hand, helps an economy pay off its
outstanding debt.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The spirit of "patriotism, progress,
science and democracy" of the May 4 Movement still encourage
China's students - to study hard and help the nation reach its new-
era goals, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
A conference was held yesterday in the Great Hall of the People
to award excellent college students and mark the 80th anniversary
of the May 4 Movement.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 university students and 200 classes from across
China were honored, by the Ministry of Education and the Central
Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, for their
performance in ethics, academic training and physical education.
</P>
<P>
China needs more talented workers, with high moral characters
and academic skills, to meet challenges in the next century, and
to propel its economic growth, Education Minister Chen Zhili said.
</P>
<P>
Honoring students for their excellent ethical and academic
performances should be a long-term part of China's educational
development, Chen added.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Says It Fulfills Oil Cutback Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has fulfilled its promise
to cut oil production, the country's state oil company Mexican
Petroleum (Pemex) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico exported 1.52 million barrels of crude oil per day (bpd)
last month, down by 125,000 bpd from the average volume of the
first quarter, as part of its commitment with other producers.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico carried out the accord strictly and on time," as they
agreed to do at a meeting with other petroleum producing countries
in The Hague last March, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the cutbacks, the prices of Mexico's basket of export
crudes "have sensibly recovered" in April with an average of 13.52
U.S. dollars per barrel, 5.26 dollars higher than in February --
the largest price increase over the last 17 months, Pemex noted.
</P>
<P>
Pemex said the average price of exported crudes in the first
four months of 1999 was 10.27 dollars per barrel, 1.02 dollars
higher than that predicted in the year's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of oil prices "continued to improve" with an
increase in the prices of Brent crudes and petroleum products
during the last week of April.

<HEADLINE> Rice Husks Used to Generate Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed a
technique of using rice husks to generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The technique is being applied by the Huagang Rice Corporation
Ltd in Putian, in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Rice husks are put into a special gasification furnace. After
being burned incompletely, the husks produce a kind of combustible
gas. Electricity can be generated when the cooled and purified gas
is passed into generation units, according to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The invention is on the list of key technology research
projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The technology will save the country large amounts of money
previously used for electricity generation, as China is a major
rice-producing country, and the vast majority of its rice husks
are so far not used, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
The corporation purchased five generation units last year, and
two of them are generating 200,000 kw of electricity from rice
husks each month.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
and the country's largest and oldest guerrilla group -- the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- are scheduled to
resume talks Thursday to seek an end to the longest armed conflict
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
In a daring gesture which surprised Colombians, President
Andres Pastrana on Sunday traveled to the camp of Manuel Marulanda,
headquarters of FARC, to arrange peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a negotiation process concerning a
concrete agenda has been achieved since the civil war started 35
years ago. The war has cost the South American country at least 35,
000 lives.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Sunday after the surprise meeting between
President Pastrana with FARC's leader Marulanda, both men said
they reviewed previous peace efforts, established concrete and
significant advances, and agreed to resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
They also said that an international commission would be set up
to verify agreements.
</P>
<P>
The government and the 15,000-member FARC group started the
peace talks in January, which were later suspended.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Computer Expert Solves Virus Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Mao Xinwei, a teacher at Zhejiang
University in east China, claims he has discovered ways to repair
the hard drives of computers damaged by the CIH Chernobyl virus.
</P>
<P>
Mao has published his methods of repairing the damage and
recovering lost data on Zhejiang University's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
Mao's notebook computer was affected by the CIH virus on April
26, as the virus swept China. He worked all night and finally
found an antidote to the virus, and recovered all the data on his
three CIH-affected computers.
</P>
<P>
Computer experts say that some 100,000 computers were affected
by CIH on April 26, and in Zhejiang 3,000 computers were shut down
by the virus.
</P>
<P>
CIH is a widely distributed virus with the potential to render
PCs useless. It results in a significant loss of data from the
hard drive, as well as the possible inability to start up or
reboot the computer.
</P>
<P>
The virus apparently had been timed to strike on April 26, June
26, and the 26th of other months to mark the anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear-power disaster.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy Predicted to Contract in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy in 1999 is
expected to further contract and suffer a minus 1.02 percent
growth as against minus 13.68 percent last year, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to 1998 when the economy grew by minus 13.68 percent,
Indonesia's economy in 1999 is still not encouraging," Antara News
Agency Tuesday quoted chief of the Central Bureau of Statistics
(BPS) Sugito Suwito as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on the latest developments, including
the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1999 which is estimated at
1,080.3 trillion rupiah (13.5 billion U.S. dollars) based on
current prices, Sugito said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the national economy will still bear a heavy
burden in 1999 when the country conducts general elections which
will affect the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts made by the government in the fiscal, monetary
and real estate sectors this year will hopefully contribute to the
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1999, the mining sector is expected to register
a minus growth of 0.99 percent, the manufacturing sector minus
0.28 percent, the construction sector 0.79 percent, the trade,
hotel and restaurant sector 0.75 percent and the service sector
minus 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the agricultural sector is predicted to grow by 0.37
percent owing to the growth of the foodstuff, plantation, forestry
and fishery subsectors.
</P>
<P>
The electricity, gas and drinking water sector is predicted to
grow by 0.38 percent and the transportation and communication
sector 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The electronics and automotive industry is expected to register
a minus 9.13-percent growth and textile and leather goods and
footwear a minus 1.94-percent growth as a result of the
skyrocketing prices of imported auxiliary goods.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Phoenix Suns guard Jason Kidd,
who led his team to a 10-6 record during April, today was named
NBA Player of the Month.
</P>
<P>
Kidd scored or assisted on 43.2 percent of Phoenix's points in
16 games. He averaged 20.1 points, 10.4 assists, 6.7 rebounds and
2.4 steals in 42.6 minutes per game and had two triple-doubles to
give him a league-leading seven this year.
</P>
<P>
"When you look at Kidd, the guy's almost averaging a triple-
double," Minnesota Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders said. "He's
improved his perimeter shooting drastically. Now he's become a
spot-up 3-point shooter."
</P>
<P>
Kidd recorded 10 or more assists 10 times and 20 or more points
on nine occasions during the month. His best performance came
April 25, when he totaled 22 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds in
a 95-71 victory over Houston.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for the award were Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo,

<HEADLINE> Wright Begs for Forgiveness of Outburst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- England Premier League soccer club
West Ham's Ian Wright has begged for forgiveness after allegedly
kicking the door of the referee's dressing room following his
sending off against Leeds.
</P>
<P>
The former England striker had to be restrained by team-mate
Trevor Sinclair after being dismissed for two bookable offences
during his side's 5-1 home thrashing by Leeds on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wright's 16th minute red card sparked a flurry of sending offs,
with the Hammers finishing the game with only eight men on the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
Shaka Hislop and Steve Lomas also took early baths as a bad-
tempered contest sparked a stormy atmosphere in the stands.
</P>
<P>
Wright, whose clash with Ian Harte prompted the dismissal, is
reported to have gone straight to referee Robert Harris' room and
kicked open the door.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old frontman is to be reported to the Football
Association by fourth official David Elleray.
</P>
<P>
But he has attempted to defuse the row by apologising for his
behaviour, insisting he cannot even remember the incident which
was due to a "stupid and reckless" brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
"I was furious at being sent off for only the second time in my
career," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed at being dismissed, at letting down my
manager Harry Redknapp, my team-mates and the West Ham fans by not
being on the pitch to help win the game and get us into Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It was as if I was watching someone else. I don't even
remember properly what I did - only that I was into the ref's room,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Hendry Takes Record Seventh Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Hendry of Scotland confirmed
his position as one of snooker's immortals after claiming his
seventh World Championship with an 18-11 victory over Welshman
Mark Williams at The Crucible in Sheffield, England on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Scot, who entered the final session of the final needing
just three frames to take the title, won the first two to put
himself on the brink of history.
</P>
<P>
As he had during the entire match, the former World No 1
capitalised on Williams errors to make frame clinching breaks.
</P>
<P>
Hendry, who enjoyed what little good fortune available during
the two day final, had to wait a little while longer to confirm
his victory, as Williams staged a courageous fightback in the 27th
frame, with a break of 89 which included 12 reds and 11 blacks.
</P>
<P>
And Williams won the next frame, a scrappy affair, by 73-67 to
close the gap to six frames.
</P>
<P>
But his new found success was based on adrenaline rather design,
and when a break of 40 in the next frame was broken by another
missed pot, Hendry needed no second invitation, as he rattled away
a superb break of 88 to create snooker history.
</P>
<P>
His seven titles make him the most successful player in the
modern era, eclipsing the record previously held by Steve Davis
and Ray Reardon of six.
</P>
<P>
This triumph is arguably the greatest of his career, having
been written off earlier in the season after a series of damaging
defeats at the hands of lesser opponents.

ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty military trucks driven by ethnic
Albanian sign-ups from northern Europe were halted near the
southern Italian port of Bari on Monday as they prepared to embark
for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Italian police blocked the trucks that government sources said
were destined for a ferry ride to the Albanian port of Durres, and
eventually to join the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in the battle
against the Yugoslav army in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian volunteers, who came from Switzerland and
other northern European countries, told officials that the trucks
were merely bringing relief supplies for the hundreds of thousands
of Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
After a call-to-arms by KLA leaders last month, some 4,000
Kosovar immigrants have traveled through Bari to join the fight in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Some weapons were seized by Italian authorities at the port of
Bari in the first days of the KLA's movement.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian media, the flow of weapons has become
better organized in recent weeks, with people set up in the
southern Italian city to help clear the way for Kosovar volunteers
to arrive in the Balkans.

<P>
The outbreak of the war and Europe's fragmented and ineffective
response to it "demonstrated yet again that the Old Continent had

Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Recalling that at the end of World War II, Europe's elders had
dreamt of a Europe with a single political will, Scalfaro also
stressed the importance of redoubling efforts to establish a
single line on foreign policy and defense.
</P>
<P>
"This Europe, by not being able to find a single political
voice, has marked its own political failure," he said, adding that
he did not use these harsh words lightly.
</P>
<P>
Great patience and perseverance were needed to build the united
front that was the only way to ensure peace in the future, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro warned of the dangers of becoming numb to the reality
of war.
</P>
<P>
"We must never accept the destruction of human beings as an
inevitable aspect of fate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Says Kosovo Solution Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Balkans envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Monday that he was closer to a diplomatic
settlement over the Kosovo crisis after meeting U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We got closer to a diplomatic solution," Chernomyrdin told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very complicated issue. We will keep on working. We
remain hopeful," Chernomyrdin, who spoke through an interpreter,
added. "The stakes are very high."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin brought Clinton a letter from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin which he has said contained concrete proposals to
end NATO's air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances under which NATO might stop bombardment was
"the main issue" of their meeting, Chernomyrdin said.

Earlier Monday, Clinton said the U.S.-led NATO air campaign
against Yugoslavia will not end despite the release of three U.S.
POWs by the Yugoslav authorities.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves ESAF Loan For Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) announced Monday the approval of a three-year loan of 209.4
million U.S. dollars for Ghana under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) to support the government's economic
reform program for 1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be disbursed in seven installments, and the first
equivalent to 29.9 million dollars will be available immediately,
the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects. ESAF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year
and are repayable over 10 years with a five and a half year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has made significant progress in reducing macroeconomic
imbalances since 1997 while implementing structural reforms, the
IMF said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the African country's real growth of gross domestic
product (GDP) increased from 4.2 percent in 1997 to 4.6 percent
despite the drought related energy crisis, and inflation fell to
16 percent from 21 percent at end-1997.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the 1999-2001 program are to consolidate
the achievements already made in macroeconomic stability and
accelerate the pace of structural reform. Real GDP growth is
projected to increase to 6 percent while inflation would be bring
down to 5 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the 1999 program are to obtain real GDP
growth of 5.5 percent, end-of-period inflation of 9 percent, and
gross official reserves equivalent to three months of imports.
</P>
<P>
Strong macroeconomic performance will depend on further fiscal
consolidation and public sector reforms, the IMF stressed.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of reforms in the cocoa sector, strengthening of
the financial sector, and divestiture of large enterprises are
essential to the success of its economic program, the IMF added.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Above 11,000 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
closed above 11,000 points for the first time Monday as investors
had more confidence in the manufacturing and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks reached 11,014.69, up 225.65. The index
rose more than 1,000 points only 35 days after closing above
10,000 for the first time on March 29, making the fastest rise
between 1,000-point markers in history.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the Dow took four months to move to 7,000 from
6,000 from October 1996 until February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The index was pushed higher by manufacturing and industrial
shares after the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported that its monthly index of manufacturing activity declined
1.5 percentage points to 52.8 percent in April. That indicated
that the manufacturing sector is still expanding because any
reading above 50 percent on the index is a sign of growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that Americans'
personal income rose 0.4 percent in March, but their spending kept
pace, showing confidence in the economy's strength.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 19.45 to 1,354.63 but the technology heavy Nasdaq index
fell 7.27 at 2,535.58 because investors continued to shed
technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 9.88 to 644.18 and the American
Stock Exchange composite index rose 9.70 to 786.67. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.47 to 433.28.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,024 up, 1,011 down and 526
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 805.67 million shares from 934.40
