<HEADLINE> Samaranch to Meet with Swiss Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch will have a meeting
with Swiss ministers in a bid to enhance the ties between the
world sports ruling body and its host country.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch will meet Tuesday with Swiss President and Sports
Minister Adolf Ogi, Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger and Foreign
Minister Joseph Deissin in the capital, Bern, Ogi's department
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss the IOC's reforms in the wake of last year's
bribery scandal and the struggle to combat doping in sport.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the IOC and Switzerland, where it has been
based since 1915, have seen progress in recent months following a
difficult patch last year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the reports of corruption and bribery among IOC
members, there has been a debate among Swiss lawmakers on whether
to grant a government-backed tax exemption to the organization.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the IOC to chose Italian city Turin as host for
the 2006 Winter Olympics over Swiss candidate Sion led to
vandalism at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne and to angry reaction
from politicians and news media.
</P>
<P>
The selection was seen by some Swiss as an act of revenge by
IOC members after Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler made public
allegations of corruption in the voting process.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the criticism, IOC Director-general Francois
Carrard said publicly that the IOC could easily move if it felt
unable to stay in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The IOC also has complained that being in Lausanne causes it
problems because Switzerland is not a member of the European Union.

JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen South African
miners have been trapped underground after an earth tremor
measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale hit a mine in Orkney of the
North West Province.
</P>
<P>
Cherane Russell, the management spokeswoman of African Rainbow
Minerals, said there is still ventilation in the area where the
miners are trapped, according to a report by South African Press
Association on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Promoting Tehran-Bonn Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri on Tuesday called on Iranian and
German statesmen to work to improve relations and develop
political, economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the German Parliament Hans Ulrich Klose, Nouri said that the
Iranian government and parliament share common view on developing
relations with Germany, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran regards non-interference in the internal affairs of other
states and honoring national interests as the principles of its
diplomacy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Inviting his German counterpart to visit Iran, Nouri also called
for removal of obstacles in the way of Tehran-Bonn cooperation and
hoped that the bilateral relations would reach the same level that
they were before.
</P>
<P>
Germany was the biggest trade partner of Iran before Tehran-Bonn
ties slumped following a Berlin court ruling accusing Iranian
leaders of sponsoring terrorist assassination of Iranian opposition
leaders in April, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Klose underlined that reinforcing parliamentary relations would
serve to boost relations between Tehran and Bonn, saying that the
German government and the opposition party are unanimous in
fostering relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The German lawmaker arrived here on Monday with a parliamentary
delegation on a three-day visit. He said he is pleased with the
outcome of his negotiations with the Iranian officials. It was not
known what negotiations he was conducting, but his visit here is
thought to be linked to the case of German businessman Helmut
Hofer, who will appear before court in days.
</P>
<P>
Hofer, 58, was arrested in September 1997 and charged with
having an affair with an Iranian Muslim woman, for which he was
found guilty and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The conviction was later revoked and a retrial sentenced him to
a fine, which was paid in October. But he was remanded for trial on
further charges, reportedly of connections with foreign elements, a
reference to spying.
</P>
<P>
But the latest reports said he was on a new charge of insulting
a policeman.

LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, currently on a visit in London, on Tuesday urged the
world's most powerful nations to adopt "a culture of inclusion" in
their dealings with nations like Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in
London, he said that Tehran wanted to see a "global civil society"
underpinned by the principles of diversity, pluralism, tolerance,
dialogue and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said he hoped that his visit would contribute to a
greater understanding between Iran and Britain and other Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the doors to serious dialogue between our two nations
will be further opened, and as a result, we could together
contribute to better neutral understanding and move forward
towards realization of our aspirations or freedom, justice and
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, the first Iranian minister to visit Britain since the
1979 Islamic Revolution, arrived in London on Monday on a bridge-
building tour.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister held separate talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and his British counterpart Robin Cook

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Says France Backs Plan to Arrest Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Tuesday that France backs the plan of the Hague-
based International Tribunal in charge of war crimes in former
Yugoslavia to arrest Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Prosecutor General of the
International Tribunal, Carla Del Ponte, Richard said that such an
operation should be staged by several countries instead of by
France alone.
</P>
<P>
``This is not a French operation... The arrrests of people
accused of war crimes are the operation of cooperation with other
states of the (NATO) alliance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic is believed to be living in his former stronghold of
Pale in the Serb controlled zone in Bosnia, which is under the
responsibility of French troops deployed in Bosnia by the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Del Ponte said that the arrest of Karadiz, who is accused of
war crimes during the civil war in Bosnia in the early 1990s, is
one of her priorities during her term as head of the international
tribunal.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges British Companies to Exploit Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, on the second day of a bridge-building trip to Britain,
on Tuesday urged British companies to step up investment in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a new chapter in our bilateral relations, for
which the confidence-building stage is nearing completion,"he told
British businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who ventured into London's financial district to
deliver his business-friendly message, is the first Iranian
minister to visit Britain since the Iranian revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He urged British firms to exploit the warming of political ties
between London and Tehran to develop closer business ties.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran now offered more attractive terms for
foreign companies to pursue direct investment or partnerships with
Iranian firms and had set up special free trade zones offering tax
exemptions and cheap energy and manpower.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Britain to match Iran's moves by removing
remaining obstacles to investment in his country, and offer
credits and export cover currently unavailable to British firms.
</P>
<P>
"It would be appropriate for Iran's trade partners with the
European Union, especially the United Kingdom, to review their
policy on political and insurance risks in trading with Iran,"
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister, who met his British counterpart
Robin Cook for three hours of talks on Monday, signed a joint
declaration with Cook earlier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the two countries had agreed to
strengthen cooperation, including combating drug trafficking.

MAPUTO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called for an extra-ordinary summit of the heads of
state and government of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to search for peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chissano suggested that the summit be held on January 16 in the
 Mozambican capital Maputo in his capacity as SADC Chairman,
according to a report by Mozambique News Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a press release by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs as saying that the summit will discuss the current phase
of implementation of the July 10, 1999 Lusaka cease-fire accord.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will also evaluate the work carried out by the
commissions instituted under the Lusaka accord, concerning the
modalities and mechanisms of its implementation, aimed at taking
appropriate measures for the rapid normalization of the situation
in that SADC country," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting has continued in the DRC, with both the
government of Laurent Kabila and the rebel forces accusing each
other of violating the Lusaka cease-fire agreement, which was
signed by all belligerents in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
Many SADC leaders will be in Maputo at the weekend to attend
the Saturday ceremony at which Chissano will be sworn into office
for a further five years as Mozambican president.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Cautiously Optimistic Over Proximity Talks on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- James Holger, the resident
representative here of the United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan, expressed on Tuesday cautious optimism over the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"I am slightly more optimistic, the important thing is for the
dialog to continue and not be interrupted as it has happened in the
past so many times," he told the press after a meeting with Cyprus'
Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Nicos Rolandis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for the reunification of Cyprus in a
bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but no significant
achievements have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The first round of U.N.-brokered proximity talks were held last
month in the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
Holger said the U.N. aims to tackle the positions of the Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides on the four core issues - namely
property, constitution, territory and security - in the second
round of proximity talks, due to begin at the end of January in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of the two sides are not expected to meet face
to face during the Geneva talks, but direct contact is envisaged to
take place in the third round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Calling for patience, Holger said "it is going to be a long
process."

<HEADLINE> Greek Foreign Minister Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou reaffirmed Tuesday his government's staunch
backing for a solution to the Cyprus issue within the framework of
a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation as provided by United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou arrived here Tuesday on a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
This was Papandreou's second visit to Cyprus in less than three
months. He will meet with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides,
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and local party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will discuss the present situation following the
first round of indirect talks on Cyprus in the U.N. headquarters in
New York last month, Papandreou said upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
He said the conclusions of the European Union (EU) summit last
month provided an opportunity to push for a settlement to the
Cyprus issue and to Cyprus' accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU Helsinki summit reconfirmed that Cyprus' EU accession can
be achieved even if the Cyprus issue is not settled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.

<P>
The first round of U.N.-brokered talks were held last month in
New York, during which Clerides, as leader of the Greek Cypriots,
and Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriots, contacted

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Fail to Reach Agreement on Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators on interim issues met Tuesday in Jerusalem but failed
to reach an agreement on an Israeli troop redeployment in the West
Bank stipulated in the Sharm el Sheikh peace accord.
</P>
<P>
After meeting his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran in Jerusalem,
senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel Radio that
they discussed the Israeli transfer of another 6.1 percent of the
West Bank scheduled on January 20, but failed to finalize the maps
of the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sharm el Sheikh agreement signed in early
September, Israel should transfer 1 percent of the West Bank under
its control and 5.1 percent under joint control to full Palestinian
jurisdiction in the third phase of redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of withdrawals under the agreement, scheduled
on November 15, was not carried out until last week because of a
dispute over who had the rights to decide which areas to be handed
over.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was resolved only after the intervention of Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat. Reports said Arafat accepted the maps after
an understanding with Barak that Israel would consult the
Palestinian side over the areas to be handed over in the third
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Arafat wants Israel to transfer Abu Dis and
other Arab villages on the outskirts of the Arab East Jerusalem in
the coming stage of withdrawal in order to give him a foothold in
Jerusalem before the conclusion of the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest issues between the
two sides, Israel claims the whole city as its eternal capital,
while the Palestinians want the eastern part of the city, which
Israel seized from Jordan control in 1967, to be the capital of a
future state.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that the two sides would resolve this
issue by enlarging the city to include surrounding villages and
towns and then divide the enlarged city into parts separately
controlled by Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli minister in prime minister's office, Haim Ramon, who is
in charge of the Jerusalem issue, confirmed to Israel Radio Tuesday
that Israel would hand over Arab villages in suburb Jerusalem to
Palestinian control in the coming redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settler leaders would hold an emergency meeting later
Tuesday in an attempt to thwart this move, which they said would
weaken Israel's grip on Jerusalem, the radio report said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat refused to confirm whether he and Eran had reached
agreement over this issue.

<HEADLINE> Embargo Kills 1.2 Million Iraqi Children: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10-year-old U.N. sanctions
have claimed lives of over 1.2 million Iraqi children by the end of
last November, said Iraqi Health Minister Omid Medhat Mubarak on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that 502,
000 children died under five and some 748,400 others died before
they were of age.
</P>
<P>
He said that the high child mortality rate was caused by the
acute dearth of medicines and medical equipment and prerequisites.
</P>
<P>
The most common diseases that led to the massive deaths of
children included respiratory infections, severe diarrhea,
intestines inflammations and malnutrition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The child mortality rate is 108 per thousand living births,
which is much higher than normal, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the embargo had also prevented 74.7 percent of big
surgical operations and 68.6 percent of laboratory examinations
from being conducted.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of diseases that Iraq had eradicated
before the imposition of the U.N. sanctions in 1990 had re-emerged
because of sharp shortage of medicines.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the feverish attempts by the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee to put on hold important
medical contracts were the fundamental reason of the high child
mortality rates and the suffering of the Iraqi children in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys of
deliberately blocking the approval of its contracts signed under
the oil-for-food program and impeding the implementation of this
program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iraq following
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in Iraq, which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil
every six months to buy humanitarian supplies for its people
reeling under the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Compensate Victims of Religious Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government will offer
compensations to victims, or their families, of last week's
Christian-Muslim violence in a southern village, government sources
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Coptic Christians and two Muslims were killed and 33
others injured in al-Kosheh, a mostly Christian town about 400
kilometers south of the capital city Cairo, over the New Year
period.
</P>
<P>
The Social Affairs Ministry will offer 3,000 Egyptian pounds
(about 882 U.S. dollars) each to families of the 21 who died, and
1,000 pounds (294 dollars) to those injured and hospitalized for 48
hours, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Owners of shops that had been looted or burned will also receive
1,000 pounds (294 dollars) for property damaged during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The clash, the most violent one in Egypt for years, were sparked
by a fight on December 31 between a Muslim customer and a Christian
shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
The Religious and Social Affairs Committee of the People's
Assembly (parliament) is to visit the area on Thursday in a further
attempt to reconcile the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Coptic Christians are the largest religious minority in mainly
Muslim Egypt, making up about 10 percent of the population of 64
million.
</P>
<P>
Copts and Muslims generally live peacefully together in Egypt.
But tension and violence is sometimes reported. Some of it has been
linked to Islamic extremists.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses Iran of Training Hezbollah Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's military intelligence
on Tuesday accused Iran of supporting Lebanese military group
Hezbollah to continue fighting against Israel troops in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Senior officers of the military intelligence told the Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset (parliament) that Iran
has sent recently about 200 revolutionary guards and other military
experts to south Lebanon to train local Hezbollah fighters.
</P>
<P>
Israel in the past accused Iran of backing Hezbollah, or the
Party of God, in resisting Israeli troops, but this was the first
time that Israeli military intelligence confirmed that Iranian
military personnel are stationed inside the so-called security
zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 after two invasions, with the declared aim of buffering its
north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military experts are training Hezbollah fighters to
use new weapons, make roadside bombs and operate Katyusha rockets,
and urging them to conduct more frequent military operations
against Israeli soldiers, the intelligence officers said.
</P>
<P>
The information the military intelligence gathered showed that
Iran is doing everything possible to offset the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks, they added.
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that Iran continues to develop long-range
missiles with help from Russia, which they said poses a major
threat to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Syrian has taken measures to prevent the Hezbollah from
conducting military actions against Israel and this is why
Hezbollah could not launch Katyusha attacks against Israel, the
officers said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised to bring the Israeli troops
back home from the security zone by July this year, even if Israel
could not reach a security agreement with the Lebanese government.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The premiers of Greece and Italy
stated here Tuesday that they support the proposal by the Serb
opposition for early elections and an end to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, which focused on bilateral
relations and the situation in the Balkan region, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis said that Greece had from the very
beginning backed a lifting of the embargo against Serbia because
it believes the embargo did not provide solutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, who arrived
here Monday for a two-day official visit, said that the sanctions
that affected the Serbian people could be suspended, such as those
on air transports and the supply of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
While calling for a humanitarian aid for the Serb people, both
premiers urged the international community and the U.S. to pay
attention to this proposal.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the materialization of the Stability Pact
in the Balkans does not proceed with a satisfactory pace.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers announced the decision on a conference in
Ancona on the security in the region of the Adriatic Sea with the
participation of Greece, Italy, the European Union (EU) and the
coast countries.

<HEADLINE> Red Lion Stamp Returning To British Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The little red lion quality
control mark is to be stamped on British eggs again after an
absence of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown will launch the new scheme this
week, declaring British eggs are now the safest in the World, The
Dail Telegraph reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The original red lion was introduced by the now defunct Egg
Marketing Board but was dropped in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The reintroduction of the quality control mark follows a
nationwide control program against salmonella designed to make
British eggs among the safest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Egg producers have been worried that cheap imports of eggs
flooding into Britain are undermining their market. They hope that
the return of the mark to millions of eggs produced under the Lion
Quality brand will boost sales.

<HEADLINE> Primakov May Not Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A close ally to Yevgeny Primakov
said Tuesday that the former prime minister may not run in the
upcoming presidential elections while Primakov himself remained
tight-lipped about his plan.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who leads the Fatherland-All Russia coalition, has
seen his rating dropping in comparison to the quick rise of
Vladimir Putin, the current prime minister that became acting
president following Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on December
31.
</P>
<P>
The Fatherland-All Russia bloc's showing in the December 19
parliamentary elections was poorer than expected. The bloc has
since witnessed some split and the All Russia movement that groups
regional leaders has indicated that it would urge Primakov to seek
the position of speaker of the State Duma lower house of
parliament instead.
</P>
<P>
"I know Primakov's personal attitude to this matter. It is
likely to be announced shortly, but the Agrarian Party is working
on the assumption that Primakov's name is unlikely to be on the
voting ballot," said Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Russian
Agrarian Party.
</P>
<P>
Much of Lapshin's party joined the Fatherland-All Russia bloc
for the December Duma elections, and Lapshin himself was number
five on the Fatherland-All Russia ballot, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lapshin said that the Agrarians elected to the Duma with the
coalition or with its support in single mandate districts are also
of the opinion that Primakov should become house speaker.
</P>
<P>
This way Primakov will be able "to give authority and political
weight" to the Duma as the country's supreme legislative body, and
"act as a constructive counterbalance" to the executive power
during the next four years, Lapshin said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that if Primakov is elected speaker, "the Duma will
not fall into senseless confrontation" with the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Primakov has so far refrained from answering
questions about his plans for the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
He last made the announcement to run just days before the Duma
elections, a move seen as aiming at winning more votes for
Fatherland-All Russia.

LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
on Tuesday called for continued U.S. support for Northern Ireland
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Belfast before flying to Washington for
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday. Adams also
accused Britain of being slow to scale down its military presence
in the province after guerrilla ceasefires.
</P>
<P>
Adams's talks with Clinton will take place on a background of
growing pressure on the Irish Republican Army to disarm to ensure
the survival of the province's power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
But Unionists, led by Northern Ireland First Minister David
Trimble, have threatened to pull out of the coalition if the IRA
does not start handing in weapons from its long war against
British rule.
</P>
<P>
Adams said disarmament was a matter that should be worked out
between the guerrilla group and the disarmament commission, and
challenged Trimble not to allow the dispute to block political
progress.

<P>
GENEVA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 leaders in political
and civil society, global business, scientific, academic and media
will meet late this month in the eastern Swiss town of Davos to
try to set tone for the development of the new century, the World
Economic Forum(WEF) announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the theme of the WEF's first annual meeting in the
new millennium, "New Beginnings: Making a Difference", WEF
Managing Director Claude Smadja said, "New realities are radically
changing...almost every domain of human activity. The compounding
forces of globalization, the technology and biology revolutions,
and the emergence of the e-economy confront us with a challenge of
unprecedented magnitude in modern history."
</P>
<P>
"The millennium Annual Meeting will be a unique opportunity to
set the tone at the outset of a new era, to send forceful signals
on the orientations we should take, on the strategies we need to
implement in addressing the new economic, technological, societal
and geopolitical realities of the 21st century," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting from January 27 to February 1, discussions
in plenary sessions, panel-led exchanges, briefings and working
meals will focus on 12 areas where societies need to act to
maintain cohesion and prosper in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
This year's annual meeting in Davos will be the Geneva-based
WEF's 30th since it was founded in 1971.

UNITED NATIONS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday morning met with the Security Council members
to discuss the candidates for the chairman of the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for
Iraq, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the U.N. chief first met with the five permanent

The United Nations Security Council last month adopted a
resolution which created UNMOVIC to replace the United Nations
Special Commission(UNSCOM) led by Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before the U.S.-led military air
strikes against Iraq in December 1998. It has not returned to

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Tumbles, Central Bank Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble shed 70.16
kopeks, or 2.5 percent, Tuesday to a record low of 28.4365 to the
U.S. dollar, but the central bank said the devaluation was just a"
temporary phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
At the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, traders started the
day with 29 rubles against the dollar, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
But Viktor Geraschenko, chairman of the Central Bank, said the
exchange rate had been volatile in the past few days due to
subjective rather than objective economic factors.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank would not resort to large-scale
intervention to prop up the ruble.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the ruble plunged 50 kopeks to 27.7349 against the
greenback, which observers said was a signal that the currency
could be in for a rocky ride in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In December, Geraschenko sent a letter to Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin, now also acting president, saying that it would
become increasingly harder to keep the ruble stable while using
hard currency reserves to meet hefty payments on Russia's foreign
debts, the Moscow Times reported.
</P>
<P>
In total, Russia must pay 10.2 billion dollars in foreign debt
this year, 3 billion dollars of which falls due in the first three
months.

LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's 225-year-old auction
house, the Sotheby's, said on Tuesday that it was taking to the
Internet to allow buyers to bid from home.
</P>
<P>
The auction site -- sothebys. com -- will focus on fine art
pieces and collectible items traditionally sold in live auction
rooms.
</P>
<P>
Each online sale stays open for two to four weeks and on its
first day nearly 5,000 lots were on sale on the site.

<P>
The auction site is limited to computer users with Internet
access in the United States, Canada, Britain and Germany, but
Sotheby's plans to extend its reach to other countries soon.
</P>
<P>
It makes its debut when many other websites are offering
fine art and antiques at auction.
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's said total expenditure on its Internet ventures,
which includes its partnership with retailer amazon.com, was 40
million U.S. dollars, 15 million dollars more than the initial
projection.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Call For Early New Round of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and
Japan agreed Tuesday to continue their close cooperation for early
launch of the new round of World Trade Organization (WTO)
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting between Japanese ministers and European
Commission officials, both sides emphasized the importance and the
need to launch the new round of WTO talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's team for the meeting was chaired by
Commissioner Chris Patten and attended by the other five
Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
Patten said the EU welcomes the close cooperation with Japan in
the WTO which is a key element underpinning bilateral relations. "
Both the EU and Japan agree on the importance of the rule-based
multilateral trading system and on the need to closely cooperate
towards an early launch of negotiations on a new round to enable
the WTO system to operate efficiently in the 21st century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, both sides reaffirmed that the agenda
for the new round should be sufficiently comprehensive to include
not only the built in agenda (agriculture and services) and market
access but also the improvement and reinforcement of existing
rules and disciplines such as anti-dumping, as well as the
establishment of additional rules for investment, competition and
trade facilitation.
</P>
<P>
They also agree to continue cooperation "so that the new round
will pay due regard to non-trade concerns as well as factors such
as the sustainable use of exhaustible natural resources and
environmental aspects".
</P>
<P>
"Both sides continue to support the establishment of a dialogue
on trade, globalization and labor issues with a view to promote a
better understanding of the issues between all interested parties,
"the EU-Japan Joint Statement on WTO said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Make First Trip As Burundi Peace Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela will make his first trip as newly
appointed peace mediator in Burundi's civil war on January 16,
planning to meet the main leaders involved and study the so-far
fruitless peace effort.
</P>
<P>
Jakes Gerwel, a close aide to Mandela who will accompany the
former president, said on Tuesday Mandela will travel to Arusha,
Tanzania, where the peace efforts are centered.
</P>
<P>
"This is a first acquaintance, getting to know the ground, and
getting to know the people," said Gerwel.
</P>
<P>
Gerwel said Mandela will depart the same day for New York where
he is due to address the United Nations Security Council on
Burundi on January 19 before returning home on 21 January.
</P>
<P>
More than a year of peace talks in Arusha have been stalled
since former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere died in London
last October. Mandela was named to replace Nyerere as mediator.
</P>
<P>
Six years of civil war between Burundi's Hutu rebels and the
Tutsi- dominated government have left more than 200,000 people
dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Hutus make up the vast majority of Burundi's 6.5 million
population, while Tutsis dominate government, the armed forces and
the economy. The 1993 assassination of the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu, by Tutsi paratroopers
sparked the latest round of conflict.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Supports S. Africa-EU Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ireland will support the
trade deal between South Africa and the European Union when the
European Commission discusses the agreement on Wednesday, Irish
prime minister Bertie Ahern said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement reached on October 16 (last year) should stand,"
Ahern said after a meeting with South African President Thabo
Mbeki in Pretoria, according to the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said that the agreement, after lengthy discussions, had
been concluded and it should be implemented as from January 1.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the agreement was delayed due to Italy's
objections to the South African use of the liquor name grappa.
Greece has similar objections against the use of the term ouzo.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had spoken to the Italian prime minister about
the issue on Monday, who said the matter was being dealt with in
the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We will see if they will come back to us," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to matters of economy, Ahern said his country was very
anxious to develop good relations with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said about 100 companies were already directly involved
with investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, the first Irish prime minister to visit South Africa,
will also go to Johannesburg and Cape Town during the rest of his
four-day visit.

NEW DELHI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday accused

BEIRUT, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes blasted
suspected guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon on Tuesday to
retaliate the guerrillas' attack earlier in the day in which two
pro-Israeli militiamen were wounded, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed suspected guerrilla hideouts near two
villages east of the Israel-occupied south Lebanon town of
Nabatiyeh, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far.

Earlier in the day, two members of the Israeli-allied South

Israel established a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak returned to Israel Tuesday afternoon after winding up his
second round of peace talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not speak to reporters upon his arrival at the airport
about what progress has been made in the second round, in which the
key issues of borders, water, security arrangement and
normalization of ties between Israel and Syria have been discussed.
</P>
<P>
But local media quoted a source of the Israeli delegation as
saying Tuesday that "a certain amount of progress" had been made in
the second round, even if there was no "dramatic breakthrough or
historical conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Announcing the two sides will continue their peace talks in the
U.S. on January 19, U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke on Monday
about a two-month time frame for completing the Israeli-Syrian
process. He also said that he thought Lebanon would join soon in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the last two days of the talks, both negotiating teams
studied seriously the "working document" presented to them last
Friday by Clinton, which outlined the two sides' positions on key
issues and the American's suggestions for their settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are definitely not on the same place as they were
in last week," an American source was quoted as commenting on the
second round.
</P>
<P>
Barak returned to face stiff domestic opposition to trade the
Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in 1967 Mideast War for a
comprehensive peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Golan Residents Committee, over 100,000
protestors from around the country flocked to Tel Aviv's Rabin
Square Monday night to demonstrate against a prospective full
withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Interior Natan Sharansky from the Yisrael
Ba'aliya party and Minister of Construction and Housing Yitzhak
Levy threatened Tuesday to leave the government if Barak returns
the whole of Golan back to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan is one of the key issue
dominating the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.

PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Cooperation
Charles Josselin will visit Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda from
January 12 to 15 to seek support for implementing the Lusaka truce
agreement for the Democratic Republic of Congo, the French Foreign
Ministry confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Josselin will be in
the three countries and meet with the "strongman" of Rwanda, Vice
President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, who support the rebels of Congo, signed a
truce agreement on July 10, 1999, in Lusaka, Zambia, with other
belligerent countries of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia involved in
the Congo conflict which broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government of President Laurent Kabila, and its
allies Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia also signed the agreement in
Lusaka, while the rebels in Congo endorsed the truce on August 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The truce agreement calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops
from Congo, the demilitarization of the rebels, the deployment of
U.N. peace-keeping force and free elections in Congo.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Siemens corporation has a
strong interest in Beijing's urban transportation construction,
the subway system and light railways in particular, said Dr. Jur.
Dr-Ing.E.h.Heinrich v.Pierer, Siemens' president and chief
executive officer, today during a meeting with Beijing Mayor Liu
Qi.
</P>
<P>

said Siemens is warmly welcome to participate in this project.
</P>
<P>
Liu also invited Pierer to attend the Hi-tech Industry Week
which will be held in Beijing in May.
</P>
<P>
Pierer has said that in addition to their Beijing headquarters,
Siemens plans to establish a research and development center in
the city as well.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed a willingness to provide technological
support to Beijing's transportation system, electricity supply,
and environmental friendly projects.
</P>
<P>

joint ventures in China with total investments exceeding 1.1
billion U.S. dollars.

Mutual military exchanges are also important, because the
soldiers of the two countries play a substantial role in
safeguarding national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for exchanges among political and legal circles, Conable
said that frequent contacts among the mayors and lawyers of the
two countries will improve investment and trade and economic
cooperation, as well as legal building.
</P>
<P>
He also encourages academic exchanges, especially among young
scholars, which can guarantee the smooth development of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two American experts said that NCUSCR will continue to
contribute to increasing friendly exchanges between the United
States and China, however Lampton said that "we play a more
important role if governmental relations are bad."
</P>
<P>
But he seems to favor the other role: arranging more exchange
projects and enabling NCUSCR to become a place for greater
communication.

<P>
"But the increase of contact will result in the increase of
friction, because more interest is involved," Lampton said.
</P>
<P>
Considering history and reality, U.S.-China relations have
experienced difficulties, which should urge the two countries to
promote mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Lampton said a great price will be paid if the U.S. and China
have only competition and conflict and deny cooperation, but that
the vision of a U.S.-China friendship without friction is
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
"In the future we will have areas of cooperation and areas of
disagreement," he said, adding that the challenge is how to "
manage the conflict" so as not to negatively influence cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots exchanges should not be neglected in the promotion
of mutual understanding, but there also is room for other channels
of exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Conable, former president of the World Bank, pledged to
encourage more trips to China by U.S. congressmen, who have a say
in the U.S.- China relations, but they usually care more about
domestic issues and the next election.

<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
have been linked by history and current and future common
interests, although they are totally different in historic
traditions and social circumstances, two China experts from the
United States said here today.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that enhancing mutual understanding and
reducing conflict are the best ways to guarantee the development
of U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
Barber Conable, chairman of the National Committee on United
States-China Relations (NCUSCR), and David Lampton, a senior
scholar at Johns Hopkins University, are in Beijing to attend the
10th Sino-U.S. Dialogue meeting among Chinese and U.S. notables,
and expressed their views on the Sino-U.S. relations in an
interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the two experts emphasized the unofficial flavor of
the meeting, they, together with the other 650 NCUSCR members,
have a strong determination to "interpret China to the U.S., and
interpret the U.S. to China," and "clear out the distortion" to
enable people to "learn how things really are and not what they
imagine them to be."
</P>
<P>
Lampton said that looking back over the past decades, U.S.-
China relations have experienced fundamental changes, and now
common interests between the two sides have increased.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's economy has developed rapidly, and the U.S.
now shares tremendous commercial interests with China. Currently,
about 50,000 Chinese scholars and students study in the United
States, and educational exchanges between the two countries have
been strongly enhanced.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi and Myanmar officials
will meet in the latter's capital city, Yangon, on Friday to
discuss the issue of Myanmar refugees now staying in southeastern
Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district, the official BSS news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member Bangladeshi delegation will leave here Thursday
for Myanmar to hold talks with officials there to expedite the
repatriation of the remaining refugees to their homeland, Foreign
Ministry sources were quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, to be headed by Azad Ruhul Amin, secretary of
Relief Ministry, will include officials from the Foreign Ministry
and the Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
At present there are about 20,000 Myanmar refugees, known here
as Rohingyas, in two camps in Cox's Bazar awaiting repatriation.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 Rohingyas from Arakan province of Myanmar crossed
into Bangladesh in 1991-92 and took shelter in Cox's Bazar and the
hill district of Bandarban, also in southeastern Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 refugees had returned to Myanmar by July 1997 when
the repatriation of the refugees stopped reportedly as a result of
the refugees' refusal to return.
</P>
<P>
The last official meeting between the two countries was held in
Bangladesh in February 1997, and the repatriation process resumed
in November 1998 but was reportedly moving at a slow pace as
initially only 50 refugees were to be repatriated each week.

<HEADLINE> War Is Ending: Angolan Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Complete collapse of the Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi is irreversible as the civil war is
coming to a close, the Angolan Defense Minister Kundi Paihama
said.
</P>
<P>
Paihama made the remarks in the Huila Province where he
inspected front lines, military hospitals and other institutions,
saying the capture of the town of Jamba by government force
during the Christmas holiday gave another blow to Savimbi,
according to official newspaper Jornal de Angola Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister accused Savimbi of being obstinate on all
issues, saying that he had lost a lot of opportunities provided by
the government to become a worthy compatriot and participate in
the national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, Savimbi can not complain the Angolan government
because it is Savimbi who first violated and invalidated the
Lusaka Protocol when he decided to return to the forest areas and
took up arms in a bid to destroy the sovereign organs established
after the fair and free elections in 1992," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Paihama urged Savimbi's followers to immediately lay down their
arms. He said that those who decide to abandon Savimbi and his
bellicose UNITA movement will be installed in various productive
sectors.
</P>
<P>
At present, however, the rebels are still fighting with the
government troops in many provinces around the country while some
of them have fled to neighboring countries such as Namibia.

<HEADLINE> France Suspends Part of Military Cooperation With Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- France has decided to suspend
part of its military cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire and is re-
arranging its civil cooperation with the west African country,
said the French Foreign Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after a military junta led by General Robert
Guei overthrew President Henri Bedie in Cote d'Ivoire in a
bloodless coup in December.
</P>
<P>
France, which has very close relations with Cote d'Ivoire and
has 550 soldiers permanently deployed there, has condemned the
coup but has refrained from intervening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bedie and his entourage have come into exile in
France.
</P>
<P>
"The French government has decided to suspend part of its
military cooperation with Cote d'Ivoire in the wake of the coup of
force of December 24. France will also re-define the criteria for
the continuation of civil cooperation," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
She said that 16 of the 37 French military advisors in Cote
d'Ivoire "have ceased their functions, but are staying in their
places for the moment."
</P>
<P>
"The military cooperation with the general staffs of different
armed forces has been suspended, but the programs on the center of
regional training, health and air security are kept," she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also said that France will keep the civil
programs which directly benefit the people of Cote d'Ivoire, such
as those on economic reform and regional development.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- America Online Inc., the upstart Internet provider that just
a few years ago was battling to survive, said Monday that it would
buy giant Time Warner Inc., in a mammoth 183 billion dollars deal
that changes the media and entertainment landscape and
demonstrates the power of the paper wealth fueling the electronic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
-- Acting President Vladimir Putin Monday fired a top Kremlin
manager implicated in a bribery scandal, a fresh sign that he does
not want his administration tainted by the controversies that
surrounded his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States said it would reconvene the Israel-Syria
negotiations on January 19 to avoid losing the momentum built up
in the eight days of talks that ended Monday. The decision by the
U.S. reflected an upbeat sense that some progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
-- The first detailed public images of a secretive North Korean
missile base, taken by a private spy satellite, show a small rural

WELLINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- American qualifier Michael
Sell stole the spotlight as he pulled out a shock win over fourth-
seeded Frenchman Nicolas Escude in the first round of the New
Zealand Tennis Open at Auckland on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sell, ranked 161 at the end of last year, fought a dramatic
battle as he fought back from 6-0 and 5-1 down to snatch a
stunning 0-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 victory over Escude who finished the
year ranked 37.
</P>
<P>
It was Sell's best win on the tour and the second time he has
made the second round at this tournament after qualifying into the
main draw here two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Like Escude, Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia fell at the first
hurdle as he bowed to defending champion Sjeng Schalken of the

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Piacenza has fired first-year
coach Luigi Simoni after the club lost three straight games and
languished 17th in the 18-team Serie A standings.
</P>
<P>
The club said Tuesday that assistant coach Maurizio Braghin
will take over the team on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
A 3-0 humiliation by previously winless Cagliari on Sunday
became the last straw for Simoni whose job status had been shaky
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
That defeat dropped Piacenza's record to 2-5-9 overall, 0-1-7
on the road. The club has scored a league-low nine goals.
</P>
<P>
Simoni, 60, coached Internazionale of Milan to the 1998 UEFA
Cup title and a second-place finish in the 1997-98 Serie A season,
which earned him the Golden Bench Award as coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
But with Inter struggling at the start of the 1998-99 season,
Simoni was fired the same day that he was notified of the coaching
honor.

<HEADLINE> HK to Deregulate Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will not artificially
restrain networks in their capability to carry broadcasting,
telecommunications or multimedia services, said K C Kwong,
Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting of Hong Kong
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to remove all restrictions regarding the forms
of service which different types of transmission networks may
carry," said Kwong at the luncheon meeting of the Hong Kong
Institute of Directors.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to allow fixed telecommunications networks to
carry program services and the cable television network to carry
telecommunications services," he said.
</P>
<P>
The only caveat is that they will be subject to appropriate
licensing requirements under the respective regulatory regimes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rapid advances in technology, coupled with changing market
environment, are blurring and dissolving the traditional
boundaries of telecommunications and broadcasting, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kwong also told the meeting that the government had earlier
decided on a progressive liberalization of the external facilities
market from January 1 this year in order to enhance Hong Kong's
external connectivity.
</P>
<P>
The government will announce shortly the results of the
applications for licenses to provide external telecommunications
facilities and to operate local wireless fixed networks.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the television side, Kwong said the government had
decided to open up the TV market for competition.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government had invited applications for the
provision of new television services last August and 10
applications had been received, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Re-rated as World's Freest Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has once again been
ranked as the world's freest economy in the Economic Freedom of
the World: 2000 Annual Report published by the Fraser Institute,
the Hong Kong Center for Economic Research and the Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the findings, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang
said Tuesday that he was happy the report recognizes the fact that
Hong Kong has fully respected and preserved its economic freedom
after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It is another welcome acknowledgment of the continuity of Hong
Kong's free and open market economy functioning robustly under '
one country, two systems'," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
This assessment is shared by the Heritage Foundation, which
rated Hong Kong as the world's freest economy in its report
released early last month.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that some concerns noted in the report over Hong
Kong's legal system and the protection of private property rights
dated back to the atmospherics surrounding the 1997 transition.
</P>
<P>
"Like many of the other worries expressed at the time, these
particular concerns proved to be unfounded," he said.
</P>
<P>
All those who live and do business here would agree that Hong
Kong has a solid and well-established system to protect property
rights, he noted, adding that under the "one country, two systems"
principle, the rule of law based on the common law system
continues to be the bedrock of Hong Kong's success.
</P>
<P>
The report rates Hong Kong very highly in a number of key areas,
including small Government, economic structure and the use of
markets, international exchange and the freedom of exchange in the
financial market.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital for us to maintain our strength in these important
areas in order to safeguard our status as the world's freest
economy and a leading international financial center," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Take Stronger Measures to tackle Alien Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Customs and
container cargo traders Tuesday agreed to adopt new measures to
prevent Hong Kong from being used as a base for alien smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Shipping companies will be required to report use of "soft-top"
containers to the Customs for inspection prior to export. And they
will, together with container terminal operators, strengthen the
security including the use of modern technology to prevent illegal
migrants from boarding the vessels or hiding in the containers.
</P>
<P>
They are also asked to report immediately any suspicious
shipments to the relevant government departments and to follow
agreed procedures to check new clients' business registrations and
relevant documents before accepting business.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a joint meeting, Head of Customs Ship Search and
Cargo Command Ronald Au Yee-leung said that apart from these
measures, the Customs will reinforce the terminal patrol inside
the container storage yard paying particular attention to "soft-
top" containers.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Customs has a sound mechanism for
checking cargoes to prevent the smuggling of illicit cargoes and
has adopted a "risk assessment" system in selecting cargoes for
examination.
</P>
<P>
"As the Hong Kong Customs is a member of the World Customs
Organization, the department maintains close cooperation and
exchange of intelligence with its counterparts overseas to combat
any illegal activities," Au said.

<HEADLINE> China to Break Teachers' "Iron Rice Bowl" (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Middle and primary schools in Beijing will try a system
combining permanent and temporary employment contracts when hiring
teachers. The temporary employment quota will account for over 15
percent of the total teaching staff in these Beijing schools, and
the schools will have the right to fire unqualified teachers, and
so a new way of recruiting teachers.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau said that
Beijing will push forward the contract recruitment system step by
step throughout the city according to the principle of fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
They predict that by the end of this year, over 10 percent of
the middle and primary schools in the city will adopt the
employment contract system.
</P>
<P>
These schools will also try to reduce the number of
administrators, and see that the number of teachers in each school
is at least half that of other staff members. Educators say that
the ideal proportion of students to teachers is 14 to 1 in middle
and primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Educators also point out that the adoption of the employment
contract system is just the first step toward the reform of
primary and middle schools, and the ultimate goal is to stimulate
teachers' enthusiasm and improve the quality of the teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
China's famous educator, the late Tao Xingzhi, once said: "
Primary education is the base of a nation's education, and so the
quality of primary teachers can decide a nation's future." China
has already announced that in the near future all primary teachers
will be required to have a university diploma.

<HEADLINE> China to Break Teachers' "Iron Rice Bowl" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese middle and primary
schools are now using a new method of employing teachers.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chinese Ministry of Education disclosed today
that some Chinese middle and primary schools have begun hiring new
teachers by having them sign labor agreements.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, middle and primary schools in eight
districts of Beijing's suburbs have started recruiting new
teachers this way.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, teachers in the city of Qingdao in east China
's Shandong Province are entering the "personnel market," and the
1,000 teachers' college graduates in the city this year will enter
the personnel market. The teaching profession will no longer be an
assured lifelong profession for them.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, to be a teacher in China meant having an "iron
rice bowl," that is, a lifelong job, because the schools
themselves did not have the right to hire or fire teachers. For
over five decades, teachers and schools had not signed a single
labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
Gong Zhenxing, president of the Beijing No. 8 Middle School,
expressed his agreement with this new measure, saying "this will
be good for ensuring the quality of teachers." At present, the
teachers and workers at his school still have their "iron rice
bowl," and although students there have performed very well in the
entrance exam for senior high school and university, the teachers
are still underpaid. At present, he cannot awarding the good
teachers or fire the unqualified ones.
</P>
<P>
Educators say that schools should have the right to hire and
fire teaching staff to ensure the quality of teaching.

Charter and played an active role in maintaining world and
regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>

is one of a series of important diplomatic efforts by China, and
once again demonstrates China's support of U.N. peace-keeping
activities.
</P>

all regulations and do their best to accomplish their mission.
</P>

CAIRO, January 11 (Xnhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Economic reforms being pursued by the Arab countries
include such measures as liberalizing production prices, relying on
the market mechanism, admitting entrepreneurs to economic marketing
and investment, restructuring economic management, especially in
agriculture, and limiting the State role to supervision and
carrying out infrastructure projects, the Arabic daily al-Alam al-
Youm on Tuesday reported in line with a study on the Impact of
Privatisation Programs and Policies on Agriculture in the Arab
World conducted by Adel Mustafa, a professor of agricultural
economy in Azhar University in Cairo.

ANKARA -- Greek company Rokas S.A. has sent a proposal to
Turkish company Gucbirligi Holding to launch a joint venture for
production of wind energy, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The power to be generated can be sold in Greece and Turkey, said
the proposal. A partnership between the two companies will
contribute to the development of commercial and friendly relations
between the two neighbors, and act as a model for other firms to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Rokas S.A. said that it has 40 years of experience in wind power
industry and is keen to make investments in Turkey and other

</P>
<P>
Foreign capital inflow to Turkey stood at a mere 800 million
dollars in 1999.
</P>

Foreign capital will not only address the energy sector, but also
small-and-medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Government will this month start working
on a new draft to amend the State Tender Law No.2886 with a view to

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Teams Begin Discussions on Third Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua)-- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators for interim-phase talks began here Tuesday afternoon to
discuss Israel's third troop redeployment from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Saeb Erekat headed the Israeli and Palestinian teams
respectively at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Egypt
last September, Israel has to withdraw its troops from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank territories on January 20.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source close to the negotiations said Tuesday that
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority have agreed that the
handover of another 6.1 percent of West Bank land will take place
on January 20, the day Arafat will meet with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Washington to discuss ways to advance the final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will agree to a 6.1 percent withdrawal, but
will also ask Israel to agree with the Palestinians on the areas to
be handed over, to aviod another dispute over the maps like the one
that delayed the 5 percent pullback until last week, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The maps concerning the next redployment are to be discussed at
Tuesday's meeting, but the Palestinian side wants Israel to
transfer Abu Dis and other villages in the Jerusalem area to the
Palestinian side, the source pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the peace deal, Israel has carried out two
pullbacks from the West Bank and transferred 12 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says CLOB Issue Has Nothing to Do with WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday that the Central-Limit-Order-Book
International (CLOB) issue affecting Malaysia-Singapore ties has
nothing to do with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Mahathir made the statement at a press conference at Putrajaya
near here in response to his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong's
remarks that Singapore may raise the matter with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
It was Singapore's right if it wanted to bring the issue to the
WTO, Mahathir said, adding: "And it is our right to say this is
our problem and it has nothing to do with the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told reporters after meeting United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) Supreme Council members that he was prepared
to meet Goh to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Singapore reportedly would take its CLOB issue with Malaysia to
the WTO if it cannot be resolved between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We would try to put this off for as long as possible, but in
the ultimate, if there's no solution, Singapore has no choice but
to take the matter to WTO, and perhaps the shareholders may also
take the Malaysians in the courts in Malaysia," Goh was quoted as
saying in an interview with Reuters Television aired in Singapore
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Goh said he was waiting for the "right time" to have a
discussion with Mahathir on a package of outstanding bilateral
issues, likely after the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding issues between the two neighbors included a new
water agreement for Singapore and the status of land owned by
Malaysia's railway authorities in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 17 billion ringgit (4.47 billion U.S. dollars) of
Malaysian shares, at the current market price, once traded over
Singapore's CLOB over-the-counter-market, remained frozen when
Singapore halted its trading following capital controls imposed by
Malaysia in September 1998.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Future Depends on Creative Minority: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Singapore government
minister said here Tuesday that his country's future will depend
on a creative minority who are entrepreneurs in times of rapid
change.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a key-note address to Millennium Conference of
Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) Society &AMP; Partners,
Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo said: "Whether we like
it or not, our future will depend on a creative minority making
important decisions which will decide our common fate."
</P>
<P>
George Yeo said the creative minority need not be born in
Singapore but they will have to feel passionately for Singapore
and want to die in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Noting that no system throws up the right people automatically,
he said that in stable times mature societies can afford bad
leaders and at the critical moments in history, particularly for
young countries, the performance of a creative minority can make
enormous difference to the fortunes of a people.
</P>
<P>
"In this new world, the entrepreneurial skills needed to run
the GE (General Electrics) are not all that different from the
skills needed to run a country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day millennium conference focused its discussions on
national plans designed to transform Singapore into a knowledge-
based economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Signing on the deal is the last
thing Bora Milutinovic need to do before he officially takes the
helm of the Chinese men's national squad.
</P>
<P>
Following a 150-minute talk on Tuesday Milutinovic and the
Chinese Football Association (CAF) finally saw eye to eye with
each other in the details of the contract.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached consensus. The next thing we do is to sign the
contract," said a source close to Milutinovic and who was also
involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The deal will make the Yugoslavian become the third foreign
head coach of the national squad following Germany Klaus
Schlappner and Englishman Bobby Houghton who both were fired
following poor performances.
</P>
<P>
"I have not signed on the contract," said Milutinovic who
refused to reveal more about the bargain.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, the only coach who managed to guide four different
nations into the second round of World Cup finals, has been the
biggest catch for China who never qualified for the soccer premier
event.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, who headed the national and Olympic sides for 18
months, was sacked on December after China failed to qualify for
the Sydney 2000 Games.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Leader Stresses Publicity and Ideological Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese leader Hu Jintao
today urged Party officials to strengthen publicity and
ideological work in a bid to rally the people around the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Hu, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee, said at the high-profile national
conference for chiefs of CPC publicity departments that the nation
should exploit the advantages of publicity and ideological work to
the maximum in order to allow the strengths of various ethnic
groups to come together, and to realize the country's goals.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also attended by other important Party
officials, including Wei Jianxing, Li Lanqing, Zhang Wannian, and
Zeng Qinghong. Ding Guangen, head of the Publicity Department of
the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that in 1999 publicity departments in the country
successfully implemented the Party's policies and maintained a
good political orientation in uniting and teaching the masses of
the people and furthering reform, opening up and the modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
He praised them for their publicity work during the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic and the
return of Macao, adding that they have been in agreement with the
Party central committee with Jiang Zemin at its core by holding
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that the next 20 years, especially the next 10 years,
will be a very critical period for China, and the Party will face
the challenges brought about by the times. Therefore, an arduous
effort must be made to consolidate the ideological foundation that
will enable the nation to work hard in solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The main task is to hold high the banners of Marxism, Leninism,
Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, and use the Party's
theories, policies, and doctrines to educate the officials and the
people, and advocate patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and hard
work style, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that officials read more books and create an
atmosphere conducive to study, and to use Marxism to change their
thinking. Theorists must pay attention to major international and
domestic issues and write powerful, profound, convincing, and
influential articles that make a clear distinction between right
and wrong.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that the Chinese media must adhere to the Party'
s line and mobilize the people to safeguard stability and
solidarity, and create good public opinion for reform, opening up
and the modernization drive. The media should help the people gain
a correct understanding of the situation, and present the future
as one that will be bright for them.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the core of ideological work is to carry out education
in a manner that will help the people cultivate lofty ideals and
correct convictions, including spreading the Party's theories and
lines and the teaching of materialism, atheism, and science.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that cultural and publicity work should be
strengthened, and officials must work hard to achieve cultural
prosperity while reinforcing management. Artists should carry
forth the nation's fine traditions and learn from foreign
achievements.
</P>
<P>
He urged Party officials to attach great importance to
publicity and ideological work and said they should improve their
leadership techniques.

<HEADLINE> China Actively Preparing for Spring Festival Season Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's communications
departments are actively preparing for the Spring Festival travel
season which starts on January 21 and ends on February 29.
</P>
<P>
During these 40 days, over one billion people will return to
their native homes for the traditional holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Some six million passengers are expected to take airplanes
during the period, increasing by three percent that of the same
period last year, according to the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Some temporary flights will be added as needed based on
passengers volume, and teachers and students will continue to
enjoy preferential policies when buying tickets for their winter
break, said one CAAC official.
</P>
<P>
Passenger transport volume on highways and along waterways will
reach 1.47 billion, up 3.4 percent, according to the Ministry of
Communications.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Railways predicted that during
this year's Spring Festival travel season railways will handle 128
million passengers, averaging 3.22 million per day, and the
estimated total volume will be five percent more than last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that transportation services run on time, additional
passenger trains will be in service. Ticket prices will also vary
depending on demand in an attempt to control the amount of travel
during the festive season.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the country will further increase
train speeds in October.
</P>
<P>
The "Spring Festival Season Transport," as it is called,
includes transient laborers and college students returning home
during their winter vacation. This year the Spring Festival, Lunar
New Year Festival, an occasion for family reunion, falls on
February 5.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more people have been traveling
during the Spring Festival period. According to sociologists, the
"sea of humanity" that traverses the country during this period is
due to economic development and improved living conditions.
</P>
<P>
During this peak travel time, China's transportation system,
chiefly the railroads, works especially hard to ensure that all
traffic runs smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Grants Flight Permission to Two Foreign Airliens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has granted permission to
two airlines from the Gulf to operate flights out of Cyprus, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Cyprus' Communications and Works Minister
Averoff Neophytou as saying Emirates Airlines and Gulf Air will in
the near future operate flights from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines will cover destinations not operated by Cyprus'
national carrier Cyprus Airways (CY).
</P>
<P>
Neophytou said the decision was taken in the framework of the
plan for gradual air liberalization by 2003.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Cyprus has rejected an application for a second
Israeli company to operate flights to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Israel's national carrier El Al operates flights
to Cyprus under a bilateral agreement with CY. Tel Aviv is one of
CY's three most lucrative routes, along with London Heathrow and
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is not yet ready to liberalize these three
routes, because CY insists that it needs more time to work out a
strategy to face full air liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Neophytou said the Cyprus government has also rejected
applications from several British airlines wishing to operate
flights to Cyprus.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's First Lady Janet
Museveni has urged young people in the country to take advantage
of the current stable situation to contribute to Africa's
development in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
She made the appeal in a speech delivered at the opening
ceremony of the annual youth conference at the International
Conference Center here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The first lady described the new millennium as a millennium for
 Africans. The just passed century is one of exploitation by
colonialists and struggle by Africans to win independence, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the new millennium, we will try to reach the forefront of
human advancement. We must accept the responsibility. What you
hold in your hands is your future, as well as future of Africa,"
she told the large gathering.
</P>
<P>
She urged the young people to brave the challenges they are
facing such as child labor, sex abuse, homosexuality, HIV/AIDS,
drug abuse and so on, adding that youth should now translate their
commitment into action.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by Uganda Youth Forum which was
established in 1992. A national conference has been held each year
since then.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Calls Kim Il-sung Independence Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Tuesday for the first
time officially described the late leader Kim Il-sung of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as an independence
fighter against imperial Japan.
</P>
<P>
"A Database of North Korea's Chief Figures" published by the
Unification Ministry Tuesday said Kim Il-sung established the
Chosun Association of Independence Fighters in May 1936 and fought
against the Japanese troops at Pochonbo and Chungpyong-ri, South
Hamkyong Province in June 1937.
</P>
<P>
Kim also served as an officer in an anti-Japanese army in
northeastern China under the Chinese Communist Party, says the
database.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the South Korean government to
recognize Kim's activities as independence fighter in official
publication.
</P>
<P>
Kim Il-sung was described by past South Korean administrations
as disguising himself as real General Kim Il-sung to increase his
charisma in the North.
</P>
<P>
The database also describes Kim's sun Kim Jong-il as a bold and
determined man with various interest in fields such as movies and
theater and says however he is plagued by "impetuousness and self-
ostentation".
</P>
<P>
The database profiles some 230 leading DPRK figures in terms
of academic, professional backgrounds, incumbent positions and
their family and character.

<HEADLINE> France's Abortion Rate Among Highest in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 220,000 French women resort
to abortion each year, with the abortion rate among the highest in
Europe, Le Figaro reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry Tuesday
launched a big campaign of public information on the use of
contraceptives to help women know better about pregnancy,
especially those under 20.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such campaign since 1992, joined also by
ministries and government departments in charge of health,
education, women's rights and overseas territories.
</P>
<P>
France, a profoundly Catholic country, legalized the use of
contraceptives in 1967.
</P>
<P>
A study showed that in the 1990s, 37 out of 100 women got
pregnant without wanting it, because of failure to use
contraceptives properly or to use them at all, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> China Lays down Gold Medal Quota for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top sports officials
have encouraged the country's athletes to try to win a minimum of
16 gold medals for the upcoming Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Weimin, Vice Director of the State General Administration
of Sports, put out Tuesday the gold medal target for this year's
quadrennial games for which a total of 222 Chinese athletes have
qualified in 120 events of 19 sports.
</P>
<P>
Yuan noted the uphill battle lying ahead for China, who is
expected to face fierce competition from such sports powerhouses
as Germany, France and the host Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Our situation is quite complex and tough," said Yuan at a
national meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that it will be quite hard to repeat
the performances in Barcelona and Atlanta Games where China
scooped 16 golds respectively to end up fourth placing.
</P>
<P>
"China has the strength to compete for golds in over 30 events
of 6 or 7 sports. But there are many uncertain factors in such
sports as diving, gymnastics, walk and judo. So it will be very
hard to keep fourth placing in golds count," said Yuan.

PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Two-time world and European
champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia has withdrawn from the Grand
Prix Final in figure skating, the International Skating Union (ISU)
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The competition starts on Friday in Lyon and brings together
the top point scorers of the six-event Grand Prix series between
October and December last year. Yagudin and compatriot Yevgeny
Plushchenko each won three of the men's events.
</P>
<P>
The ISU confirmed that the Russian Federation sent a fax saying
Yagudin was injured and would be replaced by another Russian,
Alexander Abt, who was the first substitute in the event.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix Final will have Michelle Kwan of the United
States meeting Maria Butyrskaya of Russia in the women's event.
Last March Butyrskaya beat an ailing Kwan for the world title.
</P>
<P>
Three other Russians -- Julia Soldatova, Victoria Volchkova and
Irina Slutskaya, who won the Russian national title last month --
also are entered in the women's competition.
</P>
<P>
Elvis Stojko of Canada, who won the world championships three
times before Yagudin took it the last two years, will also compete
in the men's event.
</P>
<P>
There is also competition in the pairs and ice dance with the
winners of each event getting 50,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Article on Cyprus by Senior Greek Official Draws Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Political parties in Cyprus have
expressed opposition to an article by a senior Greek official,
which they claimed implies that Greece is backing a confederation
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Giorgos Pandayias, press adviser to Greek Premier Costas
Simitis, wrote that any solution to the Cyprus issue can only take
place by setting aside nationalism, and should be based on equality
and on a series of measures for rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
The article was published Sunday in a Greek newspaper, Turkey's
local mass media reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Cyprus are obviously upset over the phraseology
used by Pandayias, saying the implication is that a Cyprus solution
should be based on a confederation, the long-standing demand of the
Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides Sunday categorically
stated that a confederation will never be accepted either by the
Greek or Cypriot governments.
</P>
<P>
Both socialist EDEK party and center-right Democracy party
expressed opposition to the article on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I'am not at all satisfied by this article," said EDEK leader
Vassos Lyssarides.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Democracy party said the party was surprised,
condemning the article as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Nicos Anastassiades, the ruling Democratic Rally party leader,
said he hopes Pandayias is not suggesting confederation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bizonal bicommunal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has been insisting that the
breakaway state in northern Cyprus be recognized internationally
and a solution be based on a confederation of two states.

<P>
He said that the Internet, a new but ubiquitous medium in the
economy, has been used by the young students as a way to learn new
things.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other way, we think, of getting our message across
to the youth than through the Internet," he added.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will focus on active student participation by
creating web-based competitions which are open to students ranging
from primary schools to universities.
</P>

projected target of 9 billion U.S. dollars for the whole fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months the exports have registered an increase
of 7.4 percent over the same period of last year to the tune of 4.
103 billion dollars, the Associated Press of Pakistan quoted
official sources as saying Tuesday
</P>
<P>
"The exports are persistently showing an increasing trend and
if it (trend) continues, we are expected to cross 9 billion
dollars of exports by the end of the current fiscal year," said
one source.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, exports will certainly pick up mainly on
the back of textile products and exports of rice and fresh
vegetable, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is expected to export around 2.5 million bales of
cotton, which will be an additional earnings as last year not a
single bale could be exported, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
There are visible signs of increase in certain categories of
exports which have vast potential to make a real breakthrough in
efforts of the government to boost exports and narrow down the
trade gap.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months, the exports of ready-made garment to
quota and non-quota countries have increased by 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) the ready-made
garment is one of the high value products of export in the textile
as it carries value addition of more than 500 percent as compared
to the export of yarn.
</P>
<P>
In the non-traditional sector, exports of fresh fruits and
vegetables will also increase this year.
</P>
<P>
A multi-facet strategy is being worked out to arrest the trade
gap by boosting exports, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Tumble on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled on
Singapore Stock Market Tuesday on profit-taking amid fears that
market valuations are too high.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell 23.98 points to
end the day at 2,409.70 points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume dropped to 300.30 million shares worth 661.33
million Singapore dollars (about 396.72 million U.S. dollars).
Declining issues outnumbered gainers by 275 to 65 with 158
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Fastech topped the actives chart with a turnover of 35.29
million units. Benefun was the second most heavily-traded stock
which had 14.26 million shares done. TChongInt was the next with
13.65 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50 was the biggest gainer of the day as it shot up to
a close of 30.20 Singapore dollars, up 200 cents compared to the

DBScw00 sank 60 cents to finish at 23.90 and 12.80 Singapore
dollars respectively. SembLog shed 55 cents to end at 6.40
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brokers attributed Tuesday's fall partly to lack of
institutional support, saying the institutional investors
considered market valuations to be very high.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said Tuesday's slump was caused by profit-taking which
was exaggerated by forced selling stemming from unsettled retail
transactions from last week.

<P>
LUANDA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki has promised the visiting delegation of the Angolan ruling
party to curb the illegal actions supporting the Angolan rebels
led by Jonas Savimbi, Angola' s official news agency Angop said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the remarks during a meeting with the Angolan
delegation led by President of the People's Liberation Movement of
Angola (MPLA) Joao Lourenco, who attended the 88th birthday of the
South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
The South African president said that he will keep the
political circles and local enterprises from continuing to support
the Angolan rebels led by Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Lourenco emphasized the victory gained by
the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) and the national police in the
central highlands.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government troops have conquered various
places occupied by the rebels, captured diverse weapons and
military materials, as well as liberated thousands of population.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco also told the South African president that some of the
rebels' military materials, especially the"Cleimoor" mines, are
made in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan ruling party leader said he is confident that
the South African government led by the ANC can neutralize the
actions supporting the enemies of Angola, who intended to destruct
the good relations between Angola and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Decide Tariff Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has allayed fears that its common
external tariff (CET) will be determined by economic organizations
outside the region, Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday..
</P>
<P>
"The CET will be decided by us. There're no external
organizations which will come to dictate the matter to us," COMESA
Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the business community fear that external
businesses or economic groupings that have great business
interests in the region will determine the COMESA CET.
</P>
<P>
A study on the common external tariff has already been done and
its effects on the COMESA has been analyzed, Mwencha said, adding
that the legal frame of the CET has also been looked at.
</P>
<P>
The tariff rate will range from between five percent to 30
percent and raw materials will attract a five percent common
tariff while finished goods will attract the highest tariff rate
of 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA official said that a 15 percent rate will be applied
for other commercial products.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA will establish a free trade area by the end of
October this year and have the CET in place in the year 2004.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique and Mauritius have

</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mozambique had reached a similar agreement with
Malawi, Noticias newspaper Tuesday quoted the source as saying.
</P>

</P>
<P>
And the Mauritian businessmen are talking with the Mozambican
government on a 30-million-dollar project for the rehabilitation
of a sugar plant in Buzi, also in central Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the source also disclosed that the Mozambican

<HEADLINE> Profile: S. Korean PM Nominee Park Tae-joon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Park Tae-joon, head of the South
Korean ruling coalition partner United Liberal Democrats (ULD),
has been nominated by President Kim Dae-jung as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Park's nomination bill will be submitted to the National
Assembly, or parliament, late Tuesday for consideration and is
expected to be ratified Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Park will replace Kim Jong-pil, who resigned Tuesday morning
and will go back to the ULD to manage the party's race for the
forthcoming general elections scheduled for April this year.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Dae-jung spoke highly of Park's outstanding
management ability and profound achievements in economy, saying
that Park will continue to push for economic reform in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the Man of Steel" of S. Korea, Park established
Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO) in 1968 and successfully managed
the state-run company until 1993.
</P>
<P>
POSCO, seen as an engine of South Korea's industrialization, is
now the world's largest steel producer.
</P>
<P>
Born in South Kyonsang Province, South Korea in 1927, Park, a
graduate of Waseda University of Japan and the Korea Military
Academy, was once chief of staff during  President Park Chung-
hee's time in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Park began his business career as manager of Korea Tungsten Co.
and became chairman of the economic committee of the Chun Doo-hwan
government in the 1980s due to his business prowess as POSCO
president.
</P>
<P>
As POSCO president, Park was a four-term member of parliament
and came to the forefront of politics in 1990 when he was named
head of the Democratic Justice Party established by then South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo in 1988.
</P>
<P>
When Kim Young-sam became president in 1993, Park went to Japan
and stayed there for nearly five years after he was dismissed from
the POSCO chairmanship and was charged with bribery.
</P>
<P>
Park returned to his country in 1997 to run in a by-election in
Pohang and was sworn in as president of the opposition ULD, which
later joined hands with the opposition National Congress for New
Politics led by Kim Dae-jung for the 15th presidential race in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
After the nomination, Park said he will work hard as South
Korea is faced with many issues including the widened gap between
the haves and have-nots, unemployment and increased impoverishment.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister designate also pointed out that South Korea
has to restructure its manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

<P>
GENEVA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- All 10 people on board a Swiss
Crossair Saab-340 liner were killed on Monday evening in a crash
near the Swiss city of Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Investigators into the crash were quoted Tuesday by Swiss Radio
International as saying that the aircraft went down only two
minutes after take-off from the Zurich Kloten airport for a
routine flight to Germany's Dresden.
</P>
<P>
"Flight controllers say the plane bore right on take-off
instead of the usual left," said Swiss Radio International. "When
air traffic control asked for an explanation, they were told to
stand by. That was the last contact with the aircraft. It then
disappeared from the screen."
</P>
<P>
There were seven passengers and three crew members on the plane.
Crossair's parent company, SAir, has so far named six of the seven
passengers who died: four German, one Swiss, one French and one
Spanish.

<HEADLINE> Employers of French Truckers Maintain Blockade of Border Entries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Employers of small French
trucking companies maintained some 70 blockade points at border
entries Tuesday morning to protest against the 35-hour-work-week
law and rise of oil and gas prices.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by four professional organizations of the
trucking industry of France said if the government continues to
refuse to meet their demand, "the anger cannot but increase."
</P>
<P>
The employers of trucking companies want the government to
allow all truckers to work a maximum 60 hours in one single week,
or 48 hours a week in average for a period of four months.
</P>
<P>
They have declined an invitation by Minister of Transport Jean-
Claude Gayssot to discuss the consequences which could come from
implementing the 35-hour-work-week law in their trade.
</P>
<P>
The main points of the roads linking France with Belgium
remained blocked Tuesday morning, as several hundred trucks were
trapped on the four main highways linking the two countries, said
truckers' union.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 trucks were blocked from entering France at the border
entry point with Spain in Junquera, Catalonia, Agence France-
Presse quoted Spanish police as saying.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 trucks from Britain at the ferry terminal in
Saint-Malo in the northeast also remained besieged at the port
area by a dozen employers of trucking companies, who spent the
night in the cold to maintain the blockade.

MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fighting between
government forces and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
raged on Tuesday in the southern Philippine province of
Maguindanao, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Resisting MILF rebels are still trying to hold on to their
position at the village of Iginagampong, located along the
Cotabato-Isulan highway, as military forces inched their way
through the contested zone.
</P>
<P>
The encounter occurred at noon Tuesday even as members of the
government-MILF Coordinating Council for the Cessation of
Hostilities (CCCH) were negotiating for the abandoning of nearby
Talayan town hall held by some 100 MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
A short commotion at around 1:30 p.m. reportedly took place as
military tanks positioned themselves at least 100 meters from the
venue of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Members of the CCCH are composed of chairman Eliseo Mercado
and Maguindanao Governor Zacaria Candao, among others.
</P>
<P>
They are reportedly trying to forge a truce with the rebels to
end hostilities following an order from retired general Orlando
Soriano, chief government peace negotiator, of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The move will also pave the way for Talayan Mayor Udzag
Midtimbang to resume his work at the besieged town hall.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conflict has already claimed the lives of four
MILF guerrillas, two civilians and wounded 11 government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Aguak evacuation center said that a two-year-
old girl named Normina Tucan expired at dawn Tuesday due to severe
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
The report added that relief goods and medicines have not yet
reached the evacuation center as critical portions of the Cotabato-
Isulan highway are still teeming with Moro rebels.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants' Retirement Age Extension Demanded in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Trades Union
Congress (MTUC) Tuesday cited correlation between average life
expectancy and retirement age in demanding for the extension of
the statutory retirement age of civil servants from the present 55
years to 60.
</P>
<P>
"In Malaysia, the average life expectancy is 72 years (75 for
women and 69 for men) which is way past the current retirement age
of 55," MTUC President Senator Zainal Rampak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many healthy, skilled and experienced workers, though capable
of productive work for many more years, have been forced out of
the job market by outdated compulsory retirement laws, he said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
The stated rationale that serving government servants should
retire at 55 to ensure sufficient jobs for fresh graduates and
school-leavers entering the job market annually was not tenable,
he said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that statistics indicated that it was the country's
private sector rather than the public sector which led in job
creation through foreign direct investment and domestic commercial
activity.
</P>
<P>
The private sector therefore absorbed the majority of the
available manpower with the public sector only playing a
complementary role in job creation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national daily New Straits Times Monday quoted sources as
saying that the Cabinet had decided against increasing the
compulsory retirement age for civil servants as proposed by
CUEPACS, the largest public sector employees union.

<HEADLINE> Jihad Legion Kept Out of Maluku, Says Indonesian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Tuesday said that the Jihad (holy war) legion
should be kept out of strife-torn Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
During a get-together with an Islamic foundation at the
presidential office here, the head of state said the existence of
the Jihad legion would threaten the survival of the state and the
existing social order.
</P>
<P>
"I do not care what you call it. But anything that may threaten
the survival of the state will be dealt with strictly. If
necessary, those who made the instruction (to enter Maluku) will
be apprehended," Wahid was quoted by the Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that some 400 people recently departed
from Jakarta's Tanjung Priok port bound for Maluku.
</P>
<P>
He said he has instructed the head of the Indonesian Police and
the chief of the Indonesian Defense Force (TNI) to quarantine
ships entering Maluku, seize all weapons aboard and arrest the
owners.
</P>
<P>
"Be they Muslims or Christians, those who possess firearms
should be arrested. Everyone must be treated fairly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Maluku, which originally centered in the greater
Ambon area, spread to the Halmahera islands last week. The
religious clashes have evoked strong emotion from several Muslim
groups across the country as there were claims that Muslims in the
area were being slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, a year of conflict in the islands
has left more than 1,134 dead, over 2,300 injured and 8,500
buildings,including 122 places of worship, damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
On January 7, tens of thousands of Muslims gathered at the
National Monument Square in Central Jakarta to pledge their
support for a holy war in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The president Tuesday also corrected press reports saying that
"a million" Muslims recently gathered at Jakarta's National
Monument Square. According to him, there were less than 20,000
people during the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"It was some kind of a show of force. They thought they could
force me to resign from this post (of presidency). I feel no
grudge, after all, this is a free country," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wahid, as a mode of expression, it was all right
but it would be quite a different matter if the idea is to be put
into action.
</P>
<P>
"So long as they do not take any action, they will be let alone.
But once they get into action, they will be apprehended," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Doubles Newspaper Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China has doubled its newspaper
groups with the approval of eight new groups to be formed, the
State Press and Publication Administration said here today.
</P>
<P>
This will give China a total of 15 newspaper companies
nationwide. The eight new ones are Dazhong Newspaper Group,
Beijing Daily Group, Jiefang Daily Group, Sichuan Daily Group,
Zhejiang Daily Group, Liaoning Daily Group, Harbin Daily Group and
Shenyang Daily Group.
</P>
<P>
The administration issued the go-ahead to China's first
newspaper group, Guangzhou Daily Group, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the Nanfang Daily Group, Yangcheng Evening News Group,
Guangming Daily Group, Economic Daily Group and Wenhui-Xinmin
Group took shape in 1998, China wanted newspapers to run
themselves under the market principle.
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, Shenzhen Newspaper Group, the first of its
kind located in a special economic zone, started business.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has 2,160 newspapers, with
an annual circulation of 26 billion copies.

<HEADLINE> mee011101 hke -- Jordanian Opposition Calls for Talks With Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Muslim Brotherhood, a powerful
opposition party in Jordan, has asked King Abdullah Bin Hussein to
open a dialogue with the outlawed Palestinian militant group Hamas
and to allow its leaders to return to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made in a memorandum presented to the monarch
last weekend, the semi-official English daily Jordan Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the memo, the party urged Abdullah to allow leaders of the
Palestinian Resistance Movement, or Hamas, to return to Jordan and
to hold a dialogue to streamline its presence and activities in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Four Hamas leaders, including its political bureau chief Khalid
Mishaal, were expelled to Qatar last November following a crackdown
on the group in Jordan starting from last August.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Muslim Brotherhood, an umbrella group for
Hamas in Jordan, had mediated with the government to solve the
crisis, but failed.
</P>
<P>
Hamas remains opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process and it
is also critical of Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been engaged in a holy war aimed at liberating all
Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in successive Middle
East wars. It had claimed responsibilities for several deadly
attacks on
Israeli civilian targets during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The group had been banned by the Jordanian government, but its
presence in the kingdom had been tolerated since 1994 as it enjoyed
sympathy among the Jordanian population, 60 percent of whom are of
Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
However, the government closed all Hamas offices in Jordan
during the recent crackdown, believed to be carried out under
pressure from the Unite States, Israel and the Palestinian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken as a preemptive measure at a time when Israel
and the Palestinians had agreed to resume their final status talks
last September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Hamas activities in Jordan would be
banned in the foreseeable future, despite the petition by the
Muslim Brotherhood to start a dialogue, at least until substantial
progress is made in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

(IMF) opening of an office in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said "our government thinks telecommunication technology is
advanced enough to allow us to communicate across oceans. So such
an office is unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
The IMF plans to open an office in Ankara to supervise the
implementation of its 4 billion U.S. dollar stand-by agreement with
the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Turkish government is reluctant to accommodate
an IMF office because it worries about an impression that it has
completely been surrendered to the IMF in its economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Ministry of Justice plans to build a third prison
in Sincan of Ankara because the Ankara Central Prison is a very
crowed and old building. Apart from Ankara, the construction of six
other prisons in different cities in Turkey is to be completed by
May.
</P>
<P>
The moves aim to solve prisoner chaos which have taken place
frequently in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Intensified Anti-Drug Move Seen in Northern  Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The police drive against drug
trafficking in Central Luzon, northern part of the Philippines
last year resulted in gratifying achievements, Philippine News
Agency (PNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 4,500 illegal drug peddlers and users were arrested,
and more than 200,000 grams of marijuana and some 10,000 grams of
shabu, or methamphetamine hydrocloride, were confiscated, the PNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Calnisan, regional director of the Central Luzon
Philippine National Police was quoted as saying that the
intensified drive against illegal drugs also has solved drug
problems in 764 communities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Police records showed that during the first quarter of last
year, a total of l,413 communities in Central Luzon were under the
influence of illegal drugs traffickers.
</P>
<P>
"About 50 percent of these communities have been freed from the
tentacles of prohibited drug traffickers," Calinisan said.
</P>
<P>
The local Regional Anti-illegal Drugs task force also
confiscated 12 assorted unlicensed firearms during the campaign
against illegal drugs in Central Luzon last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Calnisan, some 2,000 more illegal drug dependents
in the region have volunteered to be treated in drug
rehabilitation centers.
</P>
<P>
Although they have been given necessary medical treatment, many
of them have been considered as out-patients due to the lack of
rehabilitation centers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia in Efforts to Ensure Pepper Price Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, the world's
third largest pepper producer, is making efforts to build up
buffer stock as a way of ensuring price stability.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's pepper is mainly produced in Sarawak, the largest
state of the country. The state exported 22,000 tons of both black
and white pepper worth 400 million ringgit (about 105.263 million
U.S. dollars) last year and the exports was expected to rise at
least to 24,000 tons this year, accounting for 95 percent of the
country's total pepper exports.
</P>
<P>
The Sarawak Pepper Marketing Board (SPMB) is inviting the state
's 50,000 pepper farmers to sell their produce to its buffer stock
to ensure price stability and protect them from declining market
prices, Bernama news agency reported Tuesday, quoting SPMB General
Manager Adnan Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The official said in Kuching, Sarawak State's capital, Tuesday
this is the time for the pepper farmers to grab the offer and sell
their produce at prevailing prices to the board so that they will
not be badly hit when prices slip further.
</P>
<P>
Good pepper prices which enabled many farmers to continue
getting profits even at the height of the economic downturn, had
started to fall since last month, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said world pepper prices were down due to unabated over-
supply from producer countries like Indonesia, India and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He urged local pepper farmers to venture into specialized
pepper products which are less subject to price fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The pepper farmers were among the few in the economic sector
unaffected by the economic downturn in the state, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed sharply
higher in Tokyo Tuesday, led by high-tech issues which rebounded
on the back of Monday's surge on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 657.51 points, or 3.61

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Hospital Leads in Liver Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai,
China's largest metropolis, has taken the lead both domestically
and internationally in treating liver cancer, a major cause of
death in the world.
</P>
<P>
One octogenarian, surnamed Yang, has been cancer-free for 38
full years after receiving treatment at the Shanghai hospital,
setting a world record.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, the hospital has enabled 368 liver
cancer patients to survive for over five years. Of those, 112 have
lived for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The rising survival rate is attributable to a series of major
achievements made in diagnosing and treating the disease at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
During the mid 1970s, doctors at the Zhongshan Hospital have
worked hard and greatly improved the curative effect on liver
cancer by trying to diagnose and treat it in its early stages.
Since 1995, they have created a comprehensive therapy that
combines surgery, and freezing, micro and ultrasonic wave
techniques as well as the use of traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Experts referred to this development as a breakthrough, and
liver cancer patients from a growing number of countries such as
Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have traveled to the hospital to
consult the doctors there.
</P>
<P>
China has a fairly high incidence of liver cancer, with 430,000
cases reported each year, or 45 percent of the world's total.

<HEADLINE> China-US Cable Network Nearly Ready for Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Except for the San Luis Obispo
station in the U.S. state of California and its surrounding areas,
most sections of the China-U.S. cable network have passed circuit
tests and are now ready for service.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom, along with another 15 initial parties and 46
telecom carriers who have bought the cable service, will gradually
open international telecom service in the Asian Pacific region, a
company official said today.
</P>
<P>
The 26,000-km-long fiber-optic cable network, beginning
construction in December 1997, has two stations in the Chinese
mainland and the U.S. respectively. It also has branches which
link China's Taiwan, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
With designed capacity of 80 GB/s for its south and north
routes respectively, the submarine cable will help ease the
shortage of telecom routes from Asia to America, thus promoting
the development of the international telecom service, especially
that of Internet and multi-media services in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The remaining construction on the cable will be completed this
October, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 10 Banks in Indonesia to be Merged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10 banks under the
management of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) will
merge by the end of May this year, said Safrullah Hadi Saleh, IBRA
project manager in charge of merging the banks.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the minister of law and legal affairs would agree
with the merger," he was quoted by the Antara News Agency Tuesday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 10 banks are Bank Danamon, Bank PDFCI, Bank Nusa Nasional,
Bank Tiara, Bank Rama, Bank Pos, Bank Duta, Bank Tamara, Bank
Risjad Salim Internasional and Bank Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said the merger of the 10 banks is expected to enable
them to compete with other Indonesian and international banks.
</P>
<P>
The Letter of Intent signed by the Indonesian government and
the International Monetary Fund has set the target of the merger
by the end of March, but the IBRA team has been facing various
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said the team needs to coordinate with the central bank --
Bank Indonesia, the Indonesian Capital Market Supervisory Agency
and the Ministry of Law and Legal Affairs in merging the 10 banks
which have total assets worth 44.5 trillion rupiah (about 6.3
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The team cannot meet the target without the help of those
institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 banks, Saleh said, only three -- Bank Danamon, Bank
PDFCI and Bank Tiara -- have a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of
more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAR is the ratio between capital and risk-weighted assets.
</P>
<P>
The team concluded that the other seven banks need to be
recapitalized, although some of them have already been
recapitalized, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The IBRA plans to recapitalize these seven banks before May 31
and close them four months later, he said, adding that the team
has agreed to use Bank Danamon as the name of the merged bank.

MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Two unidentified fire volunteers
were hurt when a fire struck early dawn Tuesday at the Chinese
General Hospital here, Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted initial fire report as saying that the two
fire volunteers suffered injuries when they were hit with glass
splinters at the height of the fire.
</P>
<P>
According to senior fire officer Ruben Zagala, also arson
prober of the Manila Fire Department, the fire began at about 1:27

</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Zagala said, there were no patients in Room 123
when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
But many patients from the second floor up to fifth floor were
evacuated to nearby hospitals as the fire raged for two hours.
</P>
<P>
The engine room near Room 123 was also damaged by the fire and
some machines were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Zagala estimated the damage to property at more than 2 million
pesos (50,000 U.S. dollar). The real cause of the fire was still
to be determined.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Expects Higher Economic Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan economy will grow by
two percent in the new year compared to 1.4 percent last year, a
forecast by a local leading stock brokerage indicates.
</P>
<P>
In its forecast, the Dyer and Blair says that the relatively
positive outlook for the Gross Domestic Product is hinged on
several factors including the recent decision by International
Monetary Fund to resume aid talks with the country.
</P>
<P>
The stock brokerage notes that waning investor confidence would
receive a boost from the improved relations with donors, which
would hopefully result in more investment, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The forecast observes that foreign investor jitters is blamed
for the low activity registered at the Nairobi Stock Exchange,
saying the last year,
</P>
<P>
foreign capital inflows fell to 1.86 billion shillings (around
25 million U.S. dollars) from 2.4 billion (about 40 million
dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the forecast disclaims that the positive growth can
only come about if some gains from 1999 are consolidated such as
low inflation, stable politics, financial reform and the
improvement in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Factors that continue to strangle economic takeoff like high
interest rates and ballooning budget deficit must be checked, the
forecast warns.

<HEADLINE> Over 30,000 Zambian Kids Infected With HIV Annually: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Over 30,000 children are
infected with HIV, virus causing AIDS, in Zambia every year
through the mother-to-child transfer, United Nations International
Children's Fund (UNICEF) has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The high death rate from HIV/AIDS illness had resulted in
575,000 orphans in the southern African country to date, UNICEF
resident representative Peter McDermott said at workshop on the
training of health workers on the mother-to-child HIV transfer in
Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mcdermott said that the scale of the response to the HIV/AIDS
scourge in Zambia by the public in general was not commensurate
with the size and extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The pandemic will only be brought under control when there is a
change in the attitude of the Zambian people towards calls for the
control of the problem, the Post newspaper Tuesday quoted the
UNICEF official as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said the transfer of HIV from mother to child needs
immediate attention as many babies have died of infection brought
on them by their mothers.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against breast-feeding of mothers with HIV may
come in as a counteractant to breast-feeding campaigns that have
been promoted by health workers to lactating mothers.

NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Rwanda Country Progress
report has stressed the need in promoting women's "fundamental
rights" to health, the Rwanda News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Access to health services, involvement of women in making
decisions concerning health and promotion of research on women's
health are significant, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Women enjoy less existing health care than men because of
ignorance and financial incapacity for health services in Rwanda,
the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of health programs should take into account
women's specific needs and see to it that primary health care is
affordable, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Particular attention should be paid to little girls' needs and
women's number in responsibility posts in the health sector should
be increased, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan health sector is crippled by a devastated
infrastructure and insufficient medical equipment.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Chinese-made World Map Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have
discovered a world map believed to be the oldest drawn by Chinese.
</P>
<P>
 The map, discovered in Shijiazhuang, capital city of north
China's Hebei Province, was drawn in 1845 by Ye Zipei, an
official of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
 The map consists of eight scrolls, with the first four
depicting the Northern Hemisphere and the rest showing the
Southern Hemisphere. At the center of each scroll is a picture of
the North Pole or the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
 Each scroll is 130 centimeters long and 28 centimeters wide,
showing one eighth of the globe. Chinese characters that read "
Whole map of the land of ten thousand states" can be seen in the
map's margin.
</P>
<P>
 Ye had drawn longitude lines in red and altitude lines in
black.
</P>
<P>
 Archaeologists found the relic recently in the little-known
Museum of Shijiazhuang, where it has been stored for decades.
</P>
<P>
 Li Shengwu, who works at the Shijiazhuang Culture Relics
Department, said that the first group of world maps that appeared
in China were drawn by foreigners, such as Italian priest Matteo
Ricci in 1581 and a Belgian in 1674.
</P>
<P>
 Among all world maps drawn by Chinese, Ye's is believed to be
the oldest, Li said.
</P>
<P>
 He said Ye's world map is detailed, with 400 places across
the world marked. Major mountains and rivers are clearly seen on
it. The map also adds many Chinese places that are not seen on the
ancient world maps made by foreigners. At the same time, Ye
corrected many mistakes made by other cartographers, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Ye, born in Jing county of Hebei, was famous for his detailed
map-making. The Jing County Annals said that he made many maps
that enjoyed high status in China's cartographic history. However,
this world map was not recorded in that book.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman: DPRK Sneakers into China to be Dealt With According to Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigrants from the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) who sneaked into
China will be dealt with according to international norms and
relevant Chinese law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has said
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao said in a regular press conference that China has
always dealt with such incidents in line with international
conventions and law, in a humanitarian manner and taking it into
consideration to maintain peace and stability in the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in response to a question on Russia's
recent hand-over to the Chinese government of seven DPRK citizens
who sneaked into Russia before going to China.
</P>
<P>
There were always some DPRK citizens on China-DPRK border
recently who tried to sneak into China, said Zhu, pointing out
that those illegal immigrants do not belong to refugees either
from the perspective of international law or from their purpose to
cross the border.
</P>
<P>
The seven DPRK citizens handed over by Russia "are no different
from other illegal immigrants and therefore are not refugees as
well, as their background and their purpose to cross the border
show."

<P>
They said the sequencing of the virus's genome, or its genetic
material, will help scientists develop diagnostic tools and drugs
against the leukodermal bacilliform virus, the largest known
animal virus.
</P>
<P>
The virus has been responsible for outbreaks of a contagious
disease in the past few years, resulting in devastating losses in
Asia's prawn farms.
</P>
<P>
Xu Xun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said
he and his colleagues with the No. 3 Institute under the State
Oceanic Administration, determined for the first time in the world
some of the genetic material of the virus, and sequenced 90
percent of the virus' genetic code in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They finished the sequencing work last June, saying that
information available to them has shown they are far ahead of
their international counterparts, who have sequenced only one
percent of the virus' genome.
</P>
<P>
The research began in 1994 with funding from the State Oceanic
Administration, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Fujian
Provincial Government and the State Human Genome Northern Center.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they are in the process of applying for a
patent for the sequencing.

<HEADLINE> Social Insurance Payments Skirted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province in south China
is to use the full force of law to collect overdue social
insurance premium from enterprises, a key provincial official was
quoted by China as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gao Ronghai, director of the Hainan Provincial Social Security
Bureau, said some businesses have failed to pay the social
insurance premium, which is required by a draft regulation passed
early in 1999 by the State Council.the bureau will use the full
force of law to collect the overdue payments.
</P>
<P>
Social insurance premium is required to be paid according to a
draft regulation passed early in 1999 by the State Council. A
penalty of 1,000 to 10,000 yuan (120 to 1,200 U.S. dollars) is to
be carried out if any enterprise fails the payment.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily, firms now owe more than 490 million
yuan (59 million U.S. dollars) just for endowment insurance alone.
</P>
<P>
Following a bureau-sponsored training course on social
insurance that began last week, 12 businesses have paid more than
2 million yuan (241,000 U.S. dollars) that was owned the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Province has been using social insurance payments since
1991 to cover endowments, industrial accidents, unemployment and
medical care insurance.
</P>
<P>
Regional laws were enacted in 1992 to strengthen the social
insurance system, meant to benefit both enterprises and their
employees.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, all provincial social
insurance companies have paid endowment insurance of 1.355 billion
yuan (163.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year, 293 million yuan (35.3 million U.S. dollars) in
pensions were paid to 208,000 retired workers of State-owned
enterprises, which accounts for 70.65 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Tops 1 Trillion Yuan in 1999 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's efforts to crack down on smuggling and
increased demand for imported products as a result of the
government's policies to stimulate domestic demands have resulted
in a 78-percent gain in tariff revenue, which totaled 103.9
billion yuan, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
China's expanding securities market also contributed to the
remarkable tax revenue increase. Statistics show that revenue from
stamp tax on securities transactions rose by 19 percent in 1999 to
hit 24.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The taxation department's efforts to improve its collection and
examination also paid off. It is estimated this has resulted in a
16.5-billion-yuan increase in the nation's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the tax authorities collected 10 billion yuan in back
taxes, compared to 20 billion yuan a year before. Nevertheless,
Jin said 30 billion yuan in arrears remains to be collected.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that China's tax revenue has been increasing at
a speed higher than the growth of the economy over recent years,
Jin denied that his department has gone too far in its job, saying
that the opposite is true and plenty more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
Though state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are still the most
important sources of tax revenue for China, Jin said that doesn't
mean that the SOEs are paying higher taxes. In fact, he said, all
the enterprises, except foreign-fund enterprises, are paying the
same tax rates.
</P>
<P>
He denied that further efforts on tax collection by his
department would have a negative impact on the country's SOE
reforms.

<HEADLINE> Internet Shopping Develops fast in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders spent 126.6
million U.S. dollars on Internet shopping in 1999, IDC NZ reported
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
the local information technology research company predicts that
by 2004, New Zealanders would be spending 2.7 billion U.S. dollars
on business and personal transactions, which would be a big
segment of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The number of people using the Internet to buy goods in New
Zealand, a country with a population of 3.8 million, is expected
to increase tenfold by 2000 to 383,295 from 33,053 buyers in 1997,
and reach more than one million by 2004.
</P>
<P>
The internet user population in the country is expected to grow
from 393,000 now to 1.9 million in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The growing diversity of goods and services available on the
Internet and increasing security measures and confidence in those
measures are fueling the growth, according to the research company.
</P>
<P>
What IDC expects to see is an increasing proliferation of New
Zealand companies using the Web to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
IDC believes that the proliferation of New Zealand Web
businesses will greatly accelerate Internet use, with people
moving from making one-off gadget purchases to regular purchases.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Eager to Play Bigger Sports Role in Asia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liang Jinxiong
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) sets out to bid for the 15th Asian
Games with an aim to boost its international status as a center in
Asia for hosting international sports events in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong's bidding, the first of its kind in the city's
history, was officially begun when Timothy Fok, president of Hong
Kong's Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (SF&AMP;OC), submitted
Hong Kong's application to host the Games at a meeting of the
Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) held in Kuwait in late November.
</P>
<P>
"This is an honor for sports in Hong Kong, " said Fok who
proposed the idea of the SAR hosting Asia's largest sports event --
the Asian Games in June, 2006.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that hosting the Asian Games will elevate Hong Kong
's status as a center in Asia for hosting international sports
events," said a HKSAR government spokesman after the Executive
Council decided to support SF&AMP;OC's bidding proposal.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will submit a formal bid, which will be subject to
the SAR Executive Council's approval, after receiving an
invitation from the OCA - - expected in March next year.
</P>
<P>
OCA members will visit the bidding cities from June before
making a final decision in November.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is likely to face stiff competition from sporting-
venue-packed Kuala Lumpur, where the Commonwealth Games was hosted
last year.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders for the 15th Asian Games are Qatar, Syria, and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Pusan, South Korea is hosting the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
Since the HKSAR government has ruled out building specific
sports grounds for the Games, questions were raised about how Hong
Kong could cope.
</P>
<P>
But Fok said "faith and determination" were the keys to success.
"The substance of the event is more important."
</P>
<P>
"Facilities have always been a problem of concern to sportsmen.
There is now a target for the government to strengthen those
facilities. But I must stress that this plan is not designed for
the 2006 Games," he said, adding Hong Kong should "strengthen
sports facilities to raise our living standards."
</P>
<P>
The biggest sports complex nowadays in Hong Kong is the 40,000-
seat Hong Kong Stadium exclusively for football matches.
</P>
<P>
Some people cited the region's lack of experience in staging
any major international sporting games and expressed concern that
its facilities may not be world class.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, especially after its return to China, Hong
Kong has organized more and more international events. Among them,
the Fourth World Short Course Swimming Championship, the Fifth
world Wushu Championships, the Hong Kong Tennis Open and Diving
Grand Prix, have been hosted in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In early May 1999, Hong Kong successfully hosted the first
national event -- China's National Archery Champions Championship.

<TEXT>
<P>
It shows that Hong Kong has opened the door to the sports world
and wants to play a bigger role in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We have the ability to host the games, and I'm sure it will
benefit Hong Kong in all aspects," a senior government official
has said.
</P>
<P>
With the Walt Disney theme park due to open in 2005, there is
definitely potential for promoting the park and the sports event
together. Staging the Asian Games would do more to promote Hong
Kong's international image than reaping commercial gains.
</P>
<P>
Fok said: "With the help of the HKSAR government, we do have
confidence in bidding for the Games and developing Hong Kong,
especially in the area of sports in depth."
</P>
<P>
In last decades, hosting major Games, like Olympic and Asian
Games, have brought about substantial benefits to the organizing
cities' economy, including major contributions to enhancing
tourism industry, to stimulating sports, to reinforcing its
international city figure and to raising work opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, known for its status as a regional business and
financial center, possesses a stable society, convenient
communications, a forest of hotels, and first-class
telecommunication. But the city is still on the way of recovery
from the setbacks caused by the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the government intends to maximize private sponsorships
and upgrade the existing facilities without building new sports
venues, it does not expect to make money out of the event.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 200 million HK dollars would be needed for
the existing facilities' improvements.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays Hong Kong's sports are amateur. To be accustomed to
the professionalism trend in international sports and to attract
more sponsorships, SF&AMP;OC has deleted the word "amateur" from its
former title early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The big change will enable Hong Kong's sports to stride into a
new era in the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Thai Tennis Duo Make The Nation Proud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej
joined the chorus of praise for Thai tennis aces Tamarine
Tanasugarn and Paradorn Srichaphan, who reached the final stage of
last week's Hopman Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Bangkok Post reported that the king watched the two
Thais throughout the week on television and was very impressed by
their excellent showing.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Tamarine for looking so fit and showing a great
improvement in her overall play.
</P>
<P>
The king reportedly advised Tamarine before the 1998 Asian
Games that she would be a lot more agile if she lost a little
weight.
</P>
<P>
The king also urged more live sport broadcasting of tournaments
featuring Thai athletes. He explained that it greatly helped boost
the morale of the competitors and at the same time gave the people
at home a chance to share the experience.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old king was a distinguished yachtman, who won,
with his eldest daughter, the gold medals for OK class of yachting
in the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT), Charoentat
Rattanaseri, said that the SAT will give special awards to
Tamarine and Paradorn as they have been responsible for the
proudest moments in Thai tennis history.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the SAT will recommend higher royal decorations
for both of them.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Thai duo defeated stronger rivals, including No. 1
seeds, Australia's Jelena Dokic and Mark Philippousis, and reached
the final stage of the eight-nation mixed team Hopman Cup
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Although they lost to South Africa's Amanda Coetzer and Wayne
Ferreira in the final, they won 120,000 Australian dollar (79,000
U.S. dollar prize money, the biggest pay in their careers.
</P>
<P>
Their performance was applauded back home in Thailand, with
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai sending a fax message to the two
after the final, saying the pair had brought fame to the country
and were a good example to young people.
</P>
<P>
The two are scheduled to play in the Australian Open, starting
on January 17.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine will fly back home on February 5 to participate in her
graduation ceremony at Bangkok University while Paradorn, Asia's
No.1 male player, will travel to Singapore, Vietnam and India on
the rankings tour.

<HEADLINE> Court Ruling: Death Sentence for 13 Pirates Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Monday's ruling, the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Court said the death sentence issued in the previous judgment by
the Intermediate People's Court of Shanwei, a coastal city in
Guangdong Province, is fair and correct based on the evidence
presented in court.
</P>
<P>
The Higher People's Court also made minor adjustments to the
previous judgment. It reduced the term of imprisonment for Chen
Yongfan and Chen Yongyu to 11 years and 10 years, respectively.
The two criminals were convicted of robbery but were both
improperly sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
On October 22, the Intermediate People's Court of Sanwei in a
first-instance trial, sentenced a group of pirates convicted of
robbing and murdering sailors in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen criminals including Soni Wee, an Indonesian national,
and Weng Siliang were sentenced to death, 19 received sentences
ranging from life imprisonment to shorter terms, and six suspects
were found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
From August to November 1997, those sentenced robbed three
Chinese and foreign ships, including the Singapore oil tanker
Loishan and the Chinese cargo ship Cheung Son. Twenty-three
Chinese seamen aboard the Cheung Son were killed by the pirates.
</P>
<P>
After the first-instance trial, 16 of those sentenced appealed
to the higher people's court.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Tops 1 Trillion Yuan in 1999 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's tax revenue hit an all-
time high of 1.03 trillion yuan in 1999, the State Administration
of Taxation (SAT) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The amount is 122 billion yuan more than that of 1998, up 13.4
percent, SAT's director Jin Renqing said at a news conference held
by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The tax revenue for the Central Government rose 15 percent to
hit 578.5 billion yuan. That for local governments increased by 12
percent to 452.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The revenue from domestic value-added tax and consumption tax
was 484.6 billion yuan, up six percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jin attributed the tax revenue increase to the stable growth of
the economy and the pick-up of export and enterprises' performance,
resulting from the government's policies to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, tax became an important tool used by the government in
its macroeconomic adjustment. It increased the tax rebate for
export, resumed personal income tax on residents' banking deposits
and cut the fixed asset investment directory tax by half.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the tax rebate for export enterprises totaled
62.8 billion yuan, up 44 percent from 1998. Jin said this has had
a positive impact on China's export growth.

<HEADLINE> Customs Revenue Hits 158 Billion Yuan in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China's customs revenue hits an
all-time high of 158.96 billion yuan in 1999, soaring 80.8 percent
over 1998 and almost doubling the annual target, according to the
General Administration of Customs (GAC).
</P>
<P>
GAC officials attributed the drastic increase to the government
's vigorous crackdown on smuggling and effective measures to boost
domestic demand, which have largely stemmed illegal imports and
substantially increased normal trade volume.
</P>
<P>
GAC statistics show that the total import value in 1999 was 165.
72 billion U.S. dollars, up 18.2 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
China stepped up campaigns against criminal activities
involving foreign currencies and taxation, and dealt firmly with
economic irregularities in areas of exports and imports, finance,
domestic distribution and transportation.
</P>
<P>
China also barred party, government and military institutions
from doing business.
</P>
<P>
Another factor contributing to the revenue jump is that customs
offices throughout the nation have tightened internal discipline
following a high-profile corruption case involving the Zhanjiang
Customs Office, said the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Premier made the remarks while meeting at the Great Hall of
the People with representatives attending a national gathering of
religious officials.
</P>
<P>
In a country that boasts over 100 million of religious
followers, it is extremely important to rally them around the
ruling Chinese Communist Party (CPC), the government and the
modernization drive, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
The Party and the Central Government have attached importance
to religious work, and the Party has always stressed the
importance of the freedom of religious belief and the proper
management of religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels of the Party and government
should pay enough attention to religious issues, support religious
work and enthusiastically carry out the religious policies of the
Party, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu spoke highly of the religious circle's
efforts in promoting the country's political stability, economic
development, ethnic unity and national reunification.

WELLINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The transition to the new
millennium has been free of any significant Y2K problems for New
Zealand businesses, Statistics New Zealand reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, the New Zealand official statistical
department said that it conducted an impact survey of a large
number of businesses on January 1 and 5.
</P>
<P>
"Survey results from January 1 clearly indicated that
businesses experienced minimal Y2K-related problems. Of the nearly
100 large businesses surveyed by Statistics New Zealand that were
due to open on January 1, none reported having any Y2K problems
which prevented them from operating as normal. A number of minor
incidents were reported which had been resolved quickly and did
not have any impact on business operations," it said.
</P>
<P>
Survey results from January 5 proved consistent with those from
January 1, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The chance of industry-wide problems emerging is now too small
to warrant continuing the survey," Statistics New Zealand said.

<HEADLINE> Rookies to Face Second-Year Players at All-Star Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Rookie Game at NBA All-
Star Weekend will have a new twist -- a team with no rookies.
</P>
<P>
Second-year players such as Vince Carter, Jason Williams and
Paul Pierce will take on a team of true rookies in the Rookie
Challenge, part of NBA All-Star Saturday on February 12 in Oakland,
California.
</P>
<P>
Carter, the sensational swingman of the Toronto Raptors and
1999 NBA Rookie of the Year, heads the second-year squad, but
likely will be replaced by another second-year player. He is
leading the Eastern Conference in voting for the All-Star Game to
be played the following day.
</P>
<P>
Williams, the dazzling point guard of the Sacramento Kings,
will be joined in the backcourt by Pierce of the Boston Celtics
and Vancouver's Mike Bibby. Forwards Antawn Jamison of Golden
State, Raef LaFrentz of Denver and Dirk Nowitzki of Dallas and
center Michael Olowokandi of the Los Angeles Clippers comprise the
frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
Top 1999 picks Elton Brand of Chicago, Steve Francis of Houston
and Lamar Odom of the Clippers headline the team of rookies. They
were selected first, second and fourth, respectively and are
battling for 2000 Rookie of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
Brand and Odom are forwards and are joined in the frontcourt by
forwards Wally Szczerbiak of Minnesota and Adrian Griffin of
Boston and center Todd MacCulloch of Philadelphia. Francis, a
guard, will be joined in the backcourt by Andre Miller of
Cleveland and James Posey of Denver.
</P>
<P>
Coaches for the teams will be announced Wednesday. The game has
two 15-minute halves and, if necessary, a two-minute overtime.
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1995, this will be the fifth Rookie Game.
Previous Most Valuable Players include Penny Hardaway, Damon
Stoudamire, Allen Iverson and Zydrunas Ilgauska. Stoudamire and
Iverson used the MVP award as a springboard to Rookie of the Year
honors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator on Asia Pacific Politics, Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator Tuesday
called on nations in the Asia Pacific region to promote mutual
understanding and increase consensus to enhance regional security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Xu Dunxin, vice chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the National People's Congress of China, made the call at the 8th
Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF)
which opened in Canberra on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that a major task facing the regional security
cooperation is to enhance trust and disperse misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
To this end, countries should promote mutual understanding in
the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while
reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
"This is also the major content and an effective way of
regional security cooperation," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Xu believed that the regional security cooperation should
proceed from the actual conditions in the region, instead of
copying models of other regions, adding the regional peace and
stability are determined by many factors and most important is
that each nation should abide by the principles and purposes of
the United Nations Charter and other recognized norms guiding
international relations.
</P>
<P>
On the settlement of international disputes, Xu said that
peaceful means, instead of resorting to force, is the best way to
root out disputes among nations.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening military alliances and arms expansion will only
increase mistrust and bring about a new round of instabilities or
even cause confrontations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu described the overall situation of the region as
comparatively stable, with most countries seeking peace,
development and cooperation as their common policy preferences.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there still exist unstable factors that
influence regional politics and security.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians from more than 20 countries are gathering in
Canberra for the APPF annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues the delegates discuss are East Timor, the
Korean Peninsula, nuclear and missile proliferation in the Asian
region, drugs, money laundering and debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
First staged in Tokyo in 1993, the APPF seeks to provide
opportunities for national parliamentarians of the Asia Pacific
region to identify and discuss matters of common concern and
interest and to highlight them in a global context.

<HEADLINE> U.S. California Plans to Increase Spending on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The state of California
may devote more than 40 percent of its proposed 88-billion-dollar
state budget on education, Governor Gary Davis said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a budget to increase state aid for California's 10,
000 public schools from the current 26.4 billion dollars to 28.2
billion dollars, or from 6,045 dollars to 6,313 dollars per pupil.
</P>
<P>
The budget also plans to provide for 213 million dollars in tax
cuts and credits, 277 million dollars on recruiting and retaining
teachers, particularly in low-performance schools, and create a
pioneering student incentive program.
</P>
<P>
However, that would still leave the nation's most populous
state below the national average both in per-pupil educational
spending and the scores of the state's standardized-test.
</P>
<P>
For students, Davis proposed a 118 million-dollar-a-year
incentive program that would offer 1,000-dollar college
scholarships for 9th-, 10th- and 11th-grade students who score in
the top 10 percent statewide or the top 5 percent of their school
in standard achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
Teaching incentives include 11,000 dollars for the college
education of prospective teachers who agree to work in schools
that rank in the lower half. Top graduates who seek teaching
credentials could compete for 20,000-dollar teaching fellowships.
</P>
<P>
Teachers who become fully certified could get 10,000 dollars
for a down payment on a new home, and they, their schools, could
also receive a 2,000-dollar bonus. The rewards for teachers with
national board certifications would triple to 30,000 dollars for
those in the lowest-performance schools.
</P>
<P>
California's roaring economy eased the task of finding money
for the proposals, said Davis. His planned school spending
package was 36.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the need to find at least 26,000 new teachers a year
for the next decade, Davis proposes to establish five teacher
recruiting centers and let retired teachers keep their full
pensions if they return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
Rewards for teachers are becoming more common since states have
begun to face the need for 2.2 million new public school teachers
nationally over the next decade as the U.S. Department of
Education estimates.

<HEADLINE> Tax Cuts Dominates U.S. Republican Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tax cuts dominated the U.S.
Republican presidential campaign debate in Michigan State on
Monday night, the third one in a week.
</P>
<P>
The party's front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush
described himself as "a tax cutting person" who delivered in Texas
and would as president, while Arizona Senator John McCain said his
tax plan is "far better" for lower- and middle-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest tax cuts in
its history. "I am a tax cutting person," Bush said. "I know how
to get it done."
</P>
<P>
McCain, Bush's major rival for the party's presidential
nomination, said Bush's federal tax cut proposal would spend all
the projected budget surplus and 20 billion dollars more, with two-
thirds of the cut going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
Republican rivals accused Bush of using tax cuts as "a trinket"
to win the party's White House nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Pledges should not be lightly made ... a promise made should
be a promise kept," millionaire publisher Steve Forbes said. "A
pledge should not be a trinket used to win elections."
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised debate, staged at Calvin College in
Michigan State, was also attended by conservative activist Gary
Bauer, radio host Alan Keyes and Senator Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
With the first caucuses of the 2000 election in Iowa on January
24 and the first primary in New Hampshire eight days later, the
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination took on a
sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
The six Republican contenders debated on consecutive nights in
New Hampshire and South Carolina on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
In two previous debates, the candidates also fought over tax-
cutting philosophies. Bush wants 483 billion dollars in reductions
over five years, with some of the money returned to low- and
middle-income Americans to fit his "compassionate conservative"
slogan.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who will announce his detailed tax cut plan Tuesday, is
proposing a 240-billion-dollar, five-year package that expands the
lowest income tax bracket and creates tax-free savings accounts
for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
His plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 63
percent of future budget surpluses to finance social security. He
would also use the surplus on Medicare and reduce the national
debt.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical to Free Lefties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the
biggest software maker in the world, introduced its first truly
ambidextrous rodent which will free lefties around the world,
according to a report published by the PC World Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the just-ended 2000 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
Microsoft Corp. demonstrated the new device, called The
IntelliMouse Optical, which will be available in April.
</P>
<P>
The device will have five programmable buttons, and will use
Microsoft's IntelliEye technology, which uses an optical sensor
along with a digital signal processor chip instead of a mouse ball.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft claims that The IntelliMouse Optical is its first
truly ambidextrous rodent.
</P>
<P>
In a world dominated by right-handed individuals, left-handers,
33 million in the U.S. alone, often have to make do with difficult-
to-use products. And the computer field is of no exception --
especially in the all-important realm of pointing devices.
</P>
<P>
Many companies claim that their mouse devices are equally
useful with both southpaws and northpaws, but most left-handed
people beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
The IntelliMouse Optical will work with Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows NT, and Windows 2000. It can be used with either
Universal Serial Bus ports or PS/2 mouse ports, but not serial
ports.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft offered a list of famous left-handers who may find
the new IntelliMouse Optical useful. The list includes U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, rock singer Sting, Kermit
the Frog, and Bart Simpson.

<P>
SEOUL, January 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-

Kim Jong-pil, who resigned Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Park's nomination will be submitted to the National Assembly
late Tuesday for consideration and the nomination is expected to
be approved Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Park, president of the ruling coalition partner United Liberal

morning and will go back to the ULD to manage the party's race for
the forthcoming general elections scheduled for April this year.
</P>
<P>
Well-known for his business prowess as president of the state-
run Pohang Iron and Steel in the late 1960s, Park has served as
ULD president since he joined the party in November 1997, just
before the presidential election that year.
</P>
<P>
Park, 73, will be the second prime minister to serve in
President Kim's government if the parliament approves the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
President Kim is expected to conduct a cabinet reshuffle
Thursday or Friday, coupled with a shakeup of his senior
secretaries since some ministers and secretaries will participate

<HEADLINE> Colds, Flu Cut U.S. Blood Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A relentless cold and flu
season, two weeks of holiday-reduced blood donations, and the loss
of corporate blood drives due to fear of Y2K problems, have
plunged the U.S. blood supplies to critically low levels, said a
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are already seeing blood centers ask hospitals to postpone
non-emergency room surgeries," said the report from America's
Blood Centers (ABC), whose nonprofit community blood centers
collect almost half of the U.S. blood supply.
</P>
<P>
"The blood supply is extremely fragile and we are providing
blood on an as-needed basis in many states."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control announced
that 19 states were experiencing high flu activity, including
Arizona, California, New York and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
According to the ABC, people who are sick with a cold or the
flu cannot donate until they have been healthy for a week.
</P>
<P>
ABC blood centers serve the majority of hospitals in the flu-
affected states. The organization's largest blood center, the
United Blood Services, which alone collects about 8 percent of the
U.S. blood supply and serves hospitals in 18 states, has launched
critical appeals for blood in 14 of those states.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the rest of the ABC's 72 members also have
critical low inventories of all blood types, especially O-negative,
which can be given to any patient, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ABC, many blood center officials have cited Y2
K as another reason for low donations. Corporate blood drives,
which are blood centers' largest source of blood donations, were
canceled or delayed before the New Year because companies were
preparing for Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
The ABC has called anyone who is healthy, 17 years or older and
weighs at least 110 pounds to donate their blood.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Not to Abandon Charter Change Totally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying in an interview Monday that he
cannot simply give up on what he truly believes to be one of the
solutions to the country's development problems.
</P>
<P>
"I am not abandoning (the charter change) because I believe
that it is one of the solutions to a progressive economy," he said,
adding that he has not received any direct call from Congress
leaders to give up his charter change bid.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came even as Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin
hailed the decision of Estrada to defer action on the Charter
change,which was reportedly aimed at removing the economic
restrictions in the country's current Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to announce his cabinet reshuffle
Saturday,Estrada said that his unpopular attempt to amend the
charter is being"put on the back burner" in a bid to reverse his
sagging popularity.
</P>
<P>
The charter change proposal was hit by two waves of mass
protest rallies backed by the Catholic Church in August and
September in 1999,which triggered the plunging of the president's
approval rating.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey conducted by the Social Weather Station, an
independent pollster, showed his net satisfaction rating has
dropped drastically to the positive five, an all-time low for
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, the paper noted, when asked whether he would go
on with his information campaign on his charter change bid,
Estrada said:"Of course. What I'll do is to disseminate the
information to the people on the advantage of the charter change
because they do not understand it."
</P>
<P>
As for the "right timing" for restoring the charter change at
the forefront of the administration's priority measures, he said:
"That will depend. If it has been fully explained to the people,
they will decide on with Congress. That is out of my hands."

<HEADLINE> Private Investments to Fuel Growth in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's growth of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) will rise to five percent this year due to
the strong boost from private sector investments, the Board of
Investment(BOI) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eleven private sector investments are expected to inject 38.2
billion rupees (530 million U.S. dollars) into the country's
economy this year, a statement from the BOI said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has forecast a five percent GDP growth for the
year 2000 because many sectors in the economy had shown an upturn
during the second half of 1999 which is expected to continue this
year as well.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the GDP growth, which stood at only 2.7 percent
in the first quarter of 1999, had picked up and would be close to
four percent for the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
The BOI statement said that, of the 11 private investments, two
will be made by Sri Lankan Airlines and Sri Lanka Telecom, each
putting over 10 billion rupees (140 million dollars)in expansion
projects.
</P>
<P>
While Sri Lankan Airlines will seek to modernize its aircraft,
Sri Lanka Telecom expansion will include the opening of a number
of new exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Maldives Expects More Investments From Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Maldives has opened its
door for possible foreign business ventures and hopes the Sri
Lankan business community to make the maximum use of this
opportunity, the Maldivian High Commissioner Abdul Aziz Yuusuf
here said.
</P>
<P>
There are more opportunities for the Sri Lankan business
community to explore new avenues for direct investment and joint
ventures in tourism, fishing, Information Technology and garment
manufacturing in the Maldives, Yuusuf told the press here Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that setting up of new businesses in the Maldives will
not only help expand Sri Lankan business activities overseas but
also create employment opportunities for Sri Lankans.
</P>
<P>
Many large Sri Lankan companies have entered into very
successful business ventures in the tourism industry in the
Maldives and are making substantial returns on their investments,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives considers Sri Lanka as its most important business
partner and its gateway to the business world, said Yuusuf, adding
that the Maldivian government has submitted a proposal to the Sri
Lankan government on setting up a joint venture project for
processing tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 20,000 Sri Lankans are in employment in the
Maldives in the garment and tourism sectors. Trade between the two
countries has increased to 34.3 million U.S. dollars in 1998 from
700,000 U.S. dollars in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Body Rules Sikh Boxer can Keep Beard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's amateur boxing
association on Monday ruled that it would allow sikh fighter
Pardeep Nagra to compete without the need to shave off his beard.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a legal battle lasting several months, the local
governing body revoked an earlier decision of having the boxer
excluded from competition in Canada. It now recognised that there
were religious grounds to keep his beard.
</P>
<P>
The association said it would try to change an Amateur
International Boxing Association (AIBA) rule which requires boxers
to be clean shaven to prevent possible injury to opponent's eyes
caused by facial hair.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty strong rule... a safety rule that has been in
place for many years," said Hank Summers, president of the
Canadian association.
</P>
<P>
However, AIBA president Loring Baker is on record as insisting
that the rule should be maintained on security grounds.
</P>
<P>
Nagra obtained a licence in 1998 to fight in Ontario after
pleading discrimination on condition he wore netting over his
beard. But the Canadian association banned him from the 48kg
bouts for violation of international rules, last month, just days
before the Canadian national championship.
</P>
<P>
Nagra appealed that decision and an Ontario court ruled he
should be allowed to fight, only for the association to annul the
competition in the 48kg category.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Targets Production of 200,000 Cars This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Trade and Industry
Ministry has set a production target of 200,000 cars this year,
while the Indonesian Association of Vehicle Producers (Gaikindo)
quoted a more pessimistic 165,000 units.
</P>
<P>
"The optimistic target of 200,000 cars may be reached if the
political situation is stable," Gaikindo's Chairman Bambang
Trisulo was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the achievement of political stability is very
important in order to support the industry, especially in domestic
vehicle production and sales.
</P>
<P>
"The facts show that the sales of cars began to pick up after
the general election went smoothly and generated a legitimate
president and vice president," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of last year, or before the June 7
election, car sales was only 4,717 units, then doubled to 8,858 in
July. Sales continued to increase since that time and reached
their peak in November with 13,708 units sold.
</P>
<P>
Trisulo said between January and November last year, domestic
sales totaled 92,000 while 23,000 cars were exported.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Expected to Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's senior economics
minister and Bank Indonesia said they expected the rupiah to
remain stable at around 7,000 to the U.S. dollar thanks to the
stabilization of the political and security situation.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industry
Kwik Kian Gie said the rupiah should remain stable despite unrest
in Maluku and Aceh provinces.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's (stabilization of the rupiah) because our
social and political situation in general has been stable, except
in Aceh and Ambon," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The stabilization of the rupiah was also a normal consequence
of the recovery process of the economy from the devastating crisis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis struck in July 1997 and deepened in 1998 when the
gross domestic product dropped 13 percent, inflation soared 78
percent and the rupiah hit an all-time low of 17,000 to the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
Kwik Kian Gie said a crisis of such magnitude would not be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would sign a new letter of intent with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on January 20, the day when
the government will present its state budget draft to the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Everything has been settled with the IMF, but the IMF wants to
see developments from now through January 20. These 10 days will
be very critical, so we must work hard (to maintain stability),"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said that
strife in outlying provinces of the archipelago should not affect
the central government and the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the rupiah should not weaken below the level
of 7,000 to the dollar merely because of unrest in the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Raises 1999 Growth Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine has raised its
1999 growth targets after the economy came up with a better-than-
expected performance, fueled largely by the rebound in the
agriculture sector,the leading newspaper Business World said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government now expects last year's gross national product (
GNP)to expand at an average of between 3.5 percent and 4 percent,
against the original target of 3 percent to 3.7 percent, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
An even higher growth is expected this year with the GNP, or
the total value of goods and services produced by the economy plus
income from abroad, estimated to expand between 5.3 percent and 5.
9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The technical report to President Joseph Estrada's achievements
during his one-an-a-half years in office noted the growth figures
indicate the Philippines is recovering from the regional crisis"
better than expected on account of prudent financial policies
alongside structural reforms."
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the economy has not fully
recovered and that its biggest challenge is to overcome the
ballooning budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Poor revenue collections have forced the government to raise
its deficit target for 1999 to 101 billion pesos (2.5 billion U.S.
dollars) from already jacked up target of 96 billion pesos (2.4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector is also expected to boost GNP growth,
posting a 6.3 percent growth rate as of the third quarter. The
figure represents a turnaround from the 6.6 percent contracting in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that the services sector became a growth
catalyst expanding by 3.8 percent from January to September last
year.
</P>
<P>
But the report added that it was government spending that
contributed to the economy's expansion, pointing out that
government consumption in the third quarter increased by 5.8
percent against the 3 percent decline in the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Steel, Still the Choice of Automakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide automakers' use
of steel sheet has outpaced the growth rate of aluminum by 13
percent over the past two decades, making it the fastest growing
automotive lightweight material, the American Iron and Steel
Institute (AISI) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the vast majority of production cars, sport utility
vehicles, and light trucks, along with a profusion of concept
vehicles use steel as their primary material for structures, body
panels, closures, bumpers and wheels, said AISI.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly 8 percent of aluminum usage is in cast
applications such as engine blocks, transmissions and wheels. Less
than 2 percent of auto aluminum goes into body structure and
closures, said AISI, a nonprofit association of North American
companies engaged in the iron and steel industry.
</P>
<P>
According to AISI, steel sheet is an unsurpassed material for
producing crash-worthy vehicles and it offers engineers the
greatest design flexibility for packaging engines, passengers and
cargo as well.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of aggressive steps by competing materials and driven
by vehicle makers to make more environmentally benign vehicles,"
the association said, "the steel industry continues to meet its
customers' requirements and thus has maintained its dominant
position as the material of choice for vital structures and other
applications."
</P>
<P>
Steel is also the world's most recycled metal. It is the main
reason for nearly a 100-percent recycling rate for out-of-service
automobiles. AISI said steel is easy and inexpensive to recycle as
it uses magnetic separation and requires no sorting by alloy in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the steel industry's continuing work is helping
automakers produce vehicles that could reduce emissions of harmful
greenhouse gases. Over the past seven years, AISI said, the U.S.
steel industry has engaged a series of research initiatives for
that purpose. The latest of these is the Advanced Vehicle Concept
project, aiming at achieving anticipated crash requirements for
2004, improved fuel efficiency, better environmental performance
and high-volume manufacturability at affordable cost.

<HEADLINE> Internet Has Great Effects on Americans' Lives: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A new survey released
Monday shows that the Internet is having a dramatic effect on the
way Americans spend their time both at work and at home.
</P>
<P>
Over a quarter of respondents say that the Internet has
decreased the amount of time they spend reading newspapers, and 46
percent of them spend less time watching television, according to
the survey conducted last December by Gomez Advisors, a U.S.
leading provider of E-commerce research and analysis.
</P>
<P>
"This survey shows how dramatic an effect the Internet is
having on people's lives," the research firm said in a report. "
In particular, it shows that the Internet poses a serious threat
to traditional media such as newspapers and television. The
Internet in some ways makes life easier but in others, it is
causing people to work more and in some cases spend less time with
family and friends."
</P>
<P>
The survey of over 4,600 people on line, also indicates that
over 26 percent of people have increased the amount of working
time at home because of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 percent of survey respondents say that the Internet has
decreased their shopping time in stores, and over 10 percent of
respondents say they have spent less time with their families or
friends.

<HEADLINE> TNI Ordered to Act Firmly, Impartially in Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Military (TNI)
Commander Admiral Widodo A.S. Monday told his troops to deal with
the communal conflict in the strife-torn Maluku firmly and
impartially.
</P>
<P>
In his address to troops at Ambon Bay, the admiral also ordered
them to safeguard vital public utilities, mosques, churches and
other sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
"All TNI and police personnel who are assigned to handle riots
here (Maluku) must be able to act professionally and impartially,"
Widodo was quoted by national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Widodo, who was accompanied by newly-appointed Police Chief
Lieut. Gen. Rusdihardjo, arrived on the violence-torn island of
Ambon on Monday. Upon his arrival in Ambon, the four-star navy
admiral immediately held a meeting with sector, company and
battalion commanders.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Ambon, Widodo also visited Ternate, North Maluku,
where the violence has now extended to.
</P>
<P>
Widodo's order came as religious leaders and non-governmental
organizations accused the military of taking sides in the one-year
long conflict between Muslims and Christians in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The turbulence initially began in the greater Ambon area, but
soon spread to become a religious conflict which has enveloped
almost the whole of Maluku.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, a year of conflict in the islands
have left more than 1,134 dead, over 2,300 injured and 8,500
buildings, including 122 places of worship, damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, seeking
refuge with the local military or elsewhere in the country.

<HEADLINE> Dollarization Viewed as Cure for Ecuador's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's government officials
Monday voiced confidence that the introduction of the
dollarization system would help the Andean country out of its
current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
State secretary in charge of production, Juan Falconi, and
Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga told a press conference that the
new economic policy will end the devaluation of the local currency,
the sucre, and bring down both inflation and interest rates to
international levels.
</P>
<P>
Under the move, the U.S. dollar will be used as the accounting
unit in the country's economic activities, with its price staying
at the level of 25,000 sucres per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The measure was announced by President Jamil Mahuad on Sunday
without saying when it will take effect.
</P>
<P>
"After a two-month analysis I have reached the conclusion that
the dollarization system ...is the way out for us and whereby we
must proceed," he told the nation in a televised speech.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's economic growth is believed to have dropped by 7.3
percent in 1999, when inflation reached 60.7 percent, the highest
in Latin America for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
During 1999, the sucre nose-dived 67 percent in value, and
declined by a further 17 percent to end Friday at 25,100 against
the dollar in the first working week of this year.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan to Cooperate in New WTO Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Three Japanese ministers are
expected here Tuesday for the annual ministerial meeting with the
European Union (EU), which is designed to give impetus into the
global trade process following last December's abortive meeting of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Trade and Industry Minister Takashi Fukaya, Foreign
Minister Yohei Kono and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Minister Touichiro Tamazawa will hold talks with European Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy and other top EU officials.
</P>
<P>
Since the Seattle meeting, both the European group and Japan
have made appeals for the multilateral process to continue, and
urged the WTO to launch the new round of talks as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Japan ministerial meeting in Brussels is expected to
reaffirm a joint commitment to push the process forward.
</P>
<P>
Fukaya said recently that he wanted close consultations with
the EU to promote an early launch of the WTO talks to tackle
issues like the perceived lack of transparency in the organization
's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
"The new round must be launched because the WTO has helped
resolve many issues, including Japan-U.S. auto disputes," Fukaya
said recently.
</P>
<P>
But he also warned that it will not be easy to launch a new
round of trade talks by the end of this year as the differences on
key issues are wide.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber of Commerce Favors Normal Trade Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Chamber of
Commerce strongly favors a swift vote on permanent Normal Trade
Relations (NTR) with China, and applauds the Clinton
Administration's plan to provide greater support on the issue, a
press release issued by the chamber said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The chamber welcomes the administration's announcement that
they will aggressively pursue early congressional action on
permanent NTR for China," said Thomas Donohue, president and chief
executive officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Commerce Secretary Bill Deley and White House Deputy Chief of
Staff Steve Ricchetti's appointment to the president's task force
on China NTR will be a valuable addition to the business community
's efforts on Capitol Hill," said Donohue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, President Bill Clinton promised an "all-out"
campaign to win congressional approval for the agreement reached
between the U.S. and China last year on China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and designated Deley and Ricchetti
to lead the effort.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that is in the national interest ... It
should be scheduled for a vote at the earliest possible time, and
if we do that, I think we've got an excellent chance to pass it,"
Clinton told reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-China trade deal is a major victory for American
consumers and businesses, the press release said. It lowers
barriers and tariffs for a variety of American goods and services
and brings China into the rules-based community of trading nations.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-China trade deal is a landmark opportunity to open up
China's vast market to American companies of all sizes, while
ensuring that China abides by international rules and regulations,
" said Donohue.
</P>
<P>
"The Chamber will make sure Congress understands that lower
trade barriers and tariffs mean new opportunities for businesses,
more jobs, better wages and economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a business federation
representing more than 3 million businesses and organizations.

NANNING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China has held a firm hand in
the fight against pirated audio and video publications and has
created a positive environment for the protection of intellectual

</P>
<P>
Information from a recent national conference on these issues
held in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
said that the Chinese Ministry of Culture has been involved in a
full-scale publicity campaign against pirated publications of
audio and video commodities since 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, activities including surprise checkups of business
booths and destroying of confiscated pirated audio or video
commodities have been carried out, and authorities have required
that authentic audio or video copies be sold to curb infringements
of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
To rein in pirated publication of video compact discs (VCDs), a
large-scale crackdown targeting over 30 types of VCDs was launched
nationwide last October, resulting in the confiscation of more
than three million pirated VCDs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also cooperated with the General
Administration of Customs in publishing detailed measures
regarding management of imported audio and video commodities and

the Beijing Asian Games Village Automobile Exchange, sold 1,955
vehicles last December, 14 percent less than the market's monthly
average.
</P>
<P>
The total number of purchases last year were 27,420, only 67
percent of the amount in 1998, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Auto markets in other cities and provinces have also reported a
sales slump.
</P>
<P>
Qie Xiaogang, an exchange manager of the market, was quoted as
saying that the downturn in sales did not necessarily translate
into a shrinking demand.
</P>
<P>
The fact that more people have consulted the market for
information suggested that the desire to own a car is still high,
Qie said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said they believe the slump may be tied to China's
expected entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which
would likely mean cheaper prices of imported cars, according to
the English-language national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that tariffs on imported cars would be
reduced to 25 percent within six years after the country's WTO
entry from the present 100 percent on vehicles with 3.0-litre
engine displacement and above, and 80 percent on smaller ones,
said China Daily.
</P>
<P>
But officials from the State Administration of Machinery
Industry, which oversees the motor sector, have said repeatedly
that auto prices will not be reduced much in the coming two to
three years.
</P>
<P>
China will reduce tariffs but only in a gradual way. A
licensing system will continue to protect the sector, which
officials describe as an infant industry, China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
To foster auto sales, the central government is considering
stopping regional administrations from imposing fees on motor
vehicles and is mulling over a plan to consolidate official levies
into a fuel tax.

<P>
NIO DE JANEIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid beat African
champion Raja Casablanca 3-2 with a last-gasp goal despite having
three players sent off in the World Club Championship in Sao Paulo
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Real have accumulated seven points after the win from three
games in group A and look sure to qualify for the final unless
Brazil's Corinthians beat Al Nassr on the same pitch immediately
afterwards by at least two goals.
</P>
<P>
Real's Roberto Carlos and Jose Gutierrez and Raja's Bouchaib El
Moubarki were all dismissed in the same second half incident.
</P>
<P>
Real defender Christian Karambeu later became the fourth man
sent off by Argentine referee Horacio Elisonde, who dismissed
Manchester United's David Beckham earlier in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Youssef Achami gave Raja a shock first half lead in the 28th
minute but Fernando Hierro and Fernando Morientes replied early in
the second half with two goals in a three-minute spell and then
Mustapha Moustaoudia equalised for Raja in the 59th minute.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes from time Cameroon international Geremi Njitap
scored the last goal with a shot from just outside the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
The incident occured shortly after Raja's second goal.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Carlos, who had predicted a five or six-goal win for
his team before the game, crashed into El Moubarki and was sent
off.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez kicked El Moubarki as the Moroccan was lying on the
ground and was also dismissed, while El Moubarki, who had been
writhing on the ground in apparent agony, leaped to his feet, spat
at Gutierrez, was sent off and led away in tears.Karembeu went
later for a second bookable offence.

MEXICO CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing Council (
WBC) on Monday formally stripped "Prince" Naseem Hamed of the
featherweight title on Monday because he would not relinquish his
World Boxing Organisation (WBO) championship title.
</P>
<P>
Hamed, who won a decision against WBC champion Cesar Soto last
October in Detroit, was required to decide which title he would
keep since the WBC does not accept unification titles with the WBO.
</P>
<P>
But Hamed said to continue as WBO champion out of loyalty to
the organisation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Monday, the WBC said it had ordered a
featherweight title fight between number one contender Luisito
Espinosa of the Philippines and Mexican Guty Espadas, number two
in its world rankings.

<HEADLINE> Italian Midfielder Barred for Gesture toward Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was
barred Monday from the national team's next game for yelling,
gesturing and spitting at the referee during a Division A game,
the Italian soccer federation announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Federation president Luciano Nizzola informed Italy coach Dino
Zoff of the decision, which bans Baggio from the February 23
friendly against Sweden, federation spokesman Stefano Balducci
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Baggio, a member of Italy's 1994 and 1998 World Cup squads, was
ejected by referee Stefano Farina for a rough tackle with 13
minutes left in AC Parma's 1-1 draw against Juventus on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the field, Baggio screamed at Farina, spat in
the referee's direction, and rubbed his thumb and index finger
together_ a gesture widely interpreted as referring to money.
</P>
<P>
Baggio, who moved to Parma from Juventus in 1994, could face a
lengthy suspension from the League. A rule is expected from
Division A's disciplinary panel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder said Sunday he did not remember what he said or
did at the time.
</P>
<P>
"In the moment that you make gestures with your hand about
money, you put the credibility of the referee and the world of
soccer into question," Balducci said. "Right now, there has been
a lot of talk about referees and impartiality. That might have
been central to (Nizzola's) decision on Baggio."
</P>
<P>
The federation's rules allow the president to ban a player from
national team games in cases of "grave behavior.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Nizzola ordered referees and federation officials
to return gold Rolex watches and other pricey Christmas gifts from
Division A club AS Roma. Roma's reported gifts to referees
included Rolexes valued at 13,000 U.S. dollars for two top
officials.
</P>
<P>
Juventus has acknowledged it also gave referees holiday gifts.

<HEADLINE> Private Enterprise Advertises for General Manager on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A pharmaceutical company in
Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, northeast China, recently
placed a help-wanted ad on the Internet for a general manager with
a promised yearly salary of one million yuan (120,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ad said that one-third of the salary will be paid in cash
and the rest will come in stock options, which have never before
been offered in China, where most managers of private businesses
earn no more than 100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Chen Juyu, board chairman of the Shenyang Xiehe Biological
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. , said that his company needs a capable
general manager to turn it into China's leading biological
medicine producer.
</P>
<P>
Chen's company developed the world's first anti-cancer
preparation for clinical use. Total sales of the company hit 40
million yuan (5 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Offering stock options has been used experimentally by some
Chinese companies, especially those dealing in information

<HEADLINE> China Develops Potash Fertilizer Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The output of potash fertilizer
in the Qaidam Basin in northwest China's Qinghai Province is
expected to reach 2 million tons by the end of 2006.
</P>
<P>
The basin has over 40 kinds of mineral resources, including
potash, magnesium, lithium, strontium, asbestos, and limestone,
and also abounds in oil, natural gas, coal, zinc, lead, silver,
and gold resources.
</P>
<P>
The basin's reserve of potash accounts for 97 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1998, Qinghai's potash output stood at 1.5
million tons, contributing greatly to the development of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
However, currently, the country has to import potash fertilizer
to meet domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Yanhu Industrial Group is now preparing to build a
potash fertilizer project at a cost of 750 million yuan which will
have an annual output of 300,000 tons. The project will be
completed in four years.

<HEADLINE> China to Build New Hydropower Project on Qingjiang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- China will construct a new
hydropower project on Qingjiang River, a major tributary of
Yangtze after it passes through the famous Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, a plan for constructing the
hydropower project at Shuibuya was recently approved by the State
Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shuibuya Hydropower Station will be the third hydroelectric
project ever constructed on the Qingjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Geheyan Hydropower Station, 93 km downstream from Shuibuya
Project, has an installed generating capacity of 1.2 million kw
and has been in operation since 1998. Gaobazhou Hydropower Station
further downstream, which started construction in 1997 and is
still under construction, will have an installed generating
capacity of 252,000 kw on completion.
</P>
<P>
Shuibuya Hydropower Project will consist of a 233-meter-high
dam, a number of workshops for generators. It will have an
installed capacity of 1.6 million kw and will be able to generate
3.92 billion kwh of electricity annually when finished. The
reservoir behind the dam will be able to store 4.58 billion cu m
of water.
</P>
<P>
The new project will cost 12 billion yuan. Preparatory work
for the project has been carried out. The first generator will
start generating electricity in 2006 and the entire project will
be finished in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dingguo, chairman of the board of directors with Qingjiang
River Hydropower Development Co. Ltd., the developer of the
Shuibuya project, said the completion of Shuibuya Hydropower
Project will play an important role in regulating water peaks on
Yangtze River during summer flood season and power supply peaks on
central China power grid, enhancing safe operation reliability of
local power grids. It will help reduce direct economic losses from
flooding by 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
On completion, the new water control project will also be of
navigation, tourism and breeding functions and help promote local
economic development in western areas of Hubei Province, where
most of the province's people of ethnic groups live.

<P>
HARBIN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- An international charity program
has helped 1.1 million Chinese cataract sufferers see the light of
day, according to a recent seminar here.
</P>
<P>
The patients owe their restored vision to Sight First China
Action, a program sponsored by the Lions Clubs International
Foundation (LCIF), the world's largest humanitarian service
organization, and the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1997, Sight First China Action programs, aided by
Hong Kong and Macao people, have been carried out in various parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, some 2,400 ophthalmologists have
taken part in the project, returning vision to 1.1 million blind
people with ages ranging from four months to 103. Sixty percent of
the beneficiaries were from rural area.
</P>
<P>
In August of 1997, LCIF granted 15.3 million U.S. dollars to
fund cataract surgery for 1.75 million people, the establishment
of eye clinics in 100 Chinese county-level hospitals, and the
training of 4,000 ophthalmologists in cataract surgical techniques.

<HEADLINE> Tranmere Cup Victory Stands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England ruled Monday that Tranmere Rovers will not have to replay
their controversial FA Cup tie with Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
First Division side Rovers escaped punishment despite
substituting a sent-off player in the closing stages of Saturday's
1-0 win.
</P>
<P>
The FA's Challenge Cup Committee could have ordered the match
to be replayed but after meeting on Monday they decided John
Aldridge's side had not "knowingly and deliberately distorted the
outcome of the game".
</P>
<P>
Sunderland boss Peter Reid accepted the decision with good
grace.
</P>
<P>
"It's not the right decision from Sunderland Football Club's
point of view but we abide by that decision and so be it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Good luck to John and his side and all the best at Fulham."
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said the committee had made a
distinction between the rules of the competition and the laws of
the game.
</P>
<P>
"Competition rules relates to organisation; matters such as who
is eligible to play and extra-time arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"These are matters for the organisers of the competition.
Meanwhile, the laws of the game are the same worldwide. The
referee is the sole arbiter of these laws.
</P>
<P>
"What happened on Saturday clearly relates to the laws of the
game rather than competition rules."
</P>
<P>
"Referees and match officials are under considerable pressure,
not least in high profile cup ties.
</P>
<P>
"Their decisions on the laws of the game are final and for the
good of the game they have to be accepted."
</P>
<P>
The committee considered reports from referee Rob Harris and
other match officials as well as from the two clubs concerned
before making their decision.
</P>
<P>
Tranmere will now meet First Division rivals Fulham in the
fifth round on either January 29 or 30.
</P>
<P>
The farcical situation arose in stoppage time at Prenton Park
when Tranmere fielded 11 players instead of 10 after a
substitution mix-up.
</P>
<P>
The Merseysiders had defender Clint Hill sent off for a second
bookable offence - but no other player was taken off when the
substitution of Stephen Frail was made.
</P>
<P>
Neither referee Harris nor any of the three other officials
present, noticed the error until 20 seconds after the fourth-round
tie had resumed.
</P>
<P>
By that time Andy Parkinson, the player who should have left
the field, had helped his teammates defend a corner.
</P>
<P>
Tranmere blamed confusion on the touchline which led to an
official displaying the shirt number of Hill rather than Parkinson
as the player to be substituted.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation in the English media that the
referee, Harris, could be dropped from the premier league's list
over the error.
</P>
<P>
Harris was scheduled to referee Tuesday's Cup tie between
Gillingham and Bradford but has been replaced. No reason was given
for that decision.

<HEADLINE> English F.A. Look Into New Technology  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
England could have technology which would end rows like the one
which marred Sheffield Wednesday's draw with Wolves on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Monday, the new technology would
be available by the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
Wolves clinched an FA Cup fourth-round replay with the Owls
after Steve Sedgley had a goal credited to him even though
television pictures indicated the ball did not cross the line.
</P>
<P>
The FA has told the game's bosses that it is prepared to be
used as a trial run for the technology when it becomes available.
</P>
<P>
And while it is understood that the idea is unlikely to be put
into practice in time for the 2000-01 season, arguments about
whether a goal should be awarded or not may soon be a thing of the
past in England.
</P>
<P>
Premier League referees' officer Philip Don said: "In terms of
goalline technology, that's a factual decision, not one based on
opinion and the technology could be developed over the next six
months.
</P>
<P>
"The FA has been given permission to draw up an experiment
regarding goalline technology and a prototype is being developed
at the moment," he said.

Jones fights Acelino Freitas for the WBO super-featherweight
title on Saturday, his second fight since being handed back the
licence he was stripped of in 1998 following irregularities in a
routine brain scan.
</P>
<P>
The board's decision has drawn criticism in newspaper reports.
But their new general secretary Simon Block is insisting the
governing body are taking all possible precautions.
</P>
<P>
A board statement read: "The British Boxing Board of Control
rejects utterly an assertion made in a Sunday newspaper that it
has permitted a 'brain-damaged' boxer to continue to box.
</P>
<P>
"The stewards of appeal, who are entirely independent of the
main board, allowed an appeal by Jones against the withdrawal of
his boxer's licence only after consideration of expert medical
testimony, which precluded any specific evidence of there being
brain damage.
</P>
<P>
"Jones has been permitted to continue his career subject to
repeat scans.
</P>
<P>
"Subsequently he has undergone further MRI brain scans to the
satisfaction of the board's medical advisers, including the
independent panel of neuro-radiological advisers.
</P>
<P>
"Far from all this being 'revealed' in the newspaper article,
the main facts of this case have been a matter of public record
since November 4 1998," added the statement.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Counts Cost of Kanu's Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wenger is still seething over the fact that 3.5 million pounds
Nigerian star Nwankwo Kanu will now be missing for up to six weeks
on African Nations Cup duty - at a time when injured Dutch
forwards Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars are already out of the
Gunners' firing line - and yet Arsenal must still pay his wages.
</P>
<P>
"The situation at the moment is just not legally defensible.
The clubs don't want to pay any more when the players are on
international duty and I can see a day coming when the countries
have to pay them instead," said the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
"You can win or lose a championship by just one point and yet
when you lose an important player for six weeks the club still has
to pay him. It is surprising that such a situation exists in our
world today."
</P>
<P>
FIFA, the game's world governing body, have undertaken a
project to try to rearrange the international fixture calendar so
that tournaments like the African Nations Cup and the new World
Club Championship do not, in future, clash with major domestic
programs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But that is a fraught task - and little consolation to Arsenal
where Wenger is already bitter that Manchester United have taken
time out on an abysmally failed mission in Rio at the expense of
defending the FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
And, with Bergkamp and Overmars both out for two more weeks and
Davor Suker set to miss the crucial clash with United at Old
Trafford in a fortnight through suspension, Wenger is looking in
horror at the debris of his disintegrated world-class strike-force.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it is better for United to go to Brazil after all,"
Wenger reflected. "The red and yellow cards their players get
there don't count in the Premiership and they can have a rest in
the sun."
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, though, are left with a tough replay at Filbert Street
a week on Wednesday to add to their daunting League fixture list
in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
And even if they get through to a fifth round date away with
Chelsea or Nottingham Forest on January 29, Kanu - who also misses
Premiership games against Sunderland, United, Bradford and
Liverpool- will still not be back from Lagos for that game either.

<HEADLINE> Forthcoming U.N. Meeting Urged to Help End Conflict in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The political opposition
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has expressed the
hope that a crucial U.N. Security Council meeting on the DRC later
this month would help end the conflict in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the Union for Democracy and
Social Progress (UDSP), made the remarks here on Monday after a
half-hour meeting with South African President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The DRC is in a chaotic state and on the brink of a "popular
uprising", he said, hoping that the U.N. meeting would secure
total respect by all belligerents for the ceasefire agreement
signed in the Zambian capital Lusaka in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
"The only important meeting is inter-Congolese dialogue" under
the terms of the Lusaka accord, between "Kabila and his forces,
the rebels and the internal opposition," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ruling African National Congress, Tshisekedi
came to South Africa on a courtesy visit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy to the United Nations,
said that the aim of the special week-long session starting on
January 24 is to revitalize the peace process and promote an
African solution to the war in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Pardons Militant Islamic Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika issued a decree on Tuesday, granting blanket pardon for
members of the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), the military wing of
the banned Islamic Salvation Front.
</P>
<P>
The decree came two days before the January 13 deadline for all
Islamic militants to lay down arms, which was stipulated in the
Civil Reconciliation Law issued by Bouteflika on July 13, 1999
after being endorsed by the two chambers of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the President's Office said the pardon resulted
from a definitive cease-fire appeal made by Bouteflika after taking
office last April and also came in response to the 1997 unilateral
cease-fire declared by the AIS.
</P>
<P>
The decision was also seen as aimed to open the way for
cooperation between security forces and the AIS in tracking down
Islamic extremists refusing to end their fighting for an Islamic
state.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika has vowed to wipe out Islamic extremists still
committed to armed insurgence after the Thursday deadline.
</P>
<P>
The north African country has been torn by a civil war, murders
and massacres that started in early 1992 after the military-backed
government canceled elections that the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win. So far 100,000 people have died in the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Security conditions have improved after Bouteflika, the first
civilian leader of the country in 24 years, launched his initiative
aimed at national reconciliation since taking office.

KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Saudi official said
Tuesday that Riyadh was seeking help from the United Nations to
bring back the remains of a Saudi pilot who was killed during the
1991 Gulf war to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities were coordinating with the U.N. to "end
the matter without direct contacts with the Iraqi leadership," said
Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister of Defense and
Aviation Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz in the eastern Saudi city of
Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
Sultan accused the Iraqi government of concealing the body of
the Saudi pilot, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohmmad Said Al-Sahaf said
during a visit to Qatar last Thursday that Baghdad had informed
Riyadh through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
that it had found the wreckage of a Saudi warplane shot down in
1991.
</P>
<P>
He also said an Iraqi officer who buried the pilot's body had "
volunteered to go to that area again to identify the location."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf said Iraq and Saudi Arabia "may soon start some kind of
cooperation" to recover the remains of the Saudi pilot.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Saudi relations have remained cool since the 1991 Gulf
war touched off by Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia joined the international forces in driving out
Iraqi troops and it allows the United States and British warplanes
to use its bases for enforcing a no-fly zone over southern Iraq,
imposed by the Western allies after the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah launches 1,713 Attacks in South Lebanon in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic militant group
Hezbollah said it launched 1,713 attacks against Israeli troops and
its proxy militia in south Lebanon in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Tuesday, Hezbollah, or Party of God, said
22 Israeli soldiers and 23 militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
(SLA) were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed guerrilla group said that at the same time
another 111 Israeli soldiers and 87 militiamen were wounded.
</P>
<P>
It added that four SLA members were arrested, an Israeli plane
was shot down, and three tanks and 36 armoured vehicles were
destroyed during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The militant group put its death toll at 33.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a resistance movement in south
Lebanon since Israel set up a self-styled security zone there in
1985 with the declared aim of shielding its north from guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops and its allied militiamen have been bogged down
in a war of attrition with Lebanese resistance groups, with dozens
soldiers killed each other.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has vowed to bring Israeli
troop out of the so-called "Israel's Vietnam", even without a
security arrangement with the Lebanese government.

CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A Turkish bank, Finansbank, will purchase 50.07
percent of the shares of the Bucharest-based Banca de Credit
Industrial si Commercial S.A. Bank, reported the Anatolia News
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Finansbank statement issued Tuesday said the bank's executive
board decided to buy 1,706,566 shares of the Romanian bank. The two

company BOTAS, led by its General Director Gokhan Yardim, left for
Iran on Monday for consultations with Iranian counterparts on
issues relating to energy cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Turks will assure the Iranians that Turkey will complete the
construction of the Turkish section of the Iranian-Turkish pipeline
at the beginning of 2001, and the purchase of natural gas will
start from then on.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on Iran's sale of natural gas to Turkey was signed
in August 1996. Under the pact, Turkey will purchase natural gas
from Iran for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey may catch up with some of the G-7 countries,
the seven most developed Western countries, in 2030s if it
maintains a 4.85-percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Figures of the World Bank indicated that Turkey registered a
growth rate of 4.85 percent between 1980 and 1998 while all the G-7

neighbors, it will benefit both.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has started a project to boost olive cultivation
in the country with an aim to reduce the country's dependence on
import of vegetable oil, an Iranian official said on Sunday.

the Islamic Republic News Agency that the project which was kicked
off in 1993 would increase areas for olive cultivation to 200,000
hectares in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005)
</P>
<P>
The preliminary phase of the project has been completed and all
areas suitable for olive cultivation in the country have been
identified, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran currently imports 90 percent of the vegetable oil
requirements either processed or as raw material, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges to Strengthen Security at U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Tuesday that it
would take all necessary measures to avoid the repetition of
incidents similar to the one that happened a day earlier at the U.
S. embassy in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by the Russian Foreign Ministry following
Monday evening's intrusion of two drunken Russian soldiers into
the embassy compound in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Ivanov, a soldier of a military construction unit
located in the town of Podolsk in the Moscow region, tried to
steal a car in the compound. A U.S. marine guard opened fire when
he failed to heed warnings to stop.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, 19, sustained bullet wounds to the head and chest. He
remained in serious condition after surgery.
</P>
<P>
Another solider, 22-year-old Yevgeny Tailakov, tried to escape
but was later detained.
</P>
<P>
"Proper Russian agencies along with the U.S. embassy in Russia
continue investigating this offense committed against the foreign
embassy's property," the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry
as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Moscow military prosecutor's office
has opened a criminal case against Ivanov for attempt to steal the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
At about 18:45 local time Monday, Ivanov climbed over the
embassy fence, got into a Chevrolet and started its engine. As he
maneuvered in the embassy yard, he damaged three cars, including
the ambassador's.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation does not have reasons to think so far that
the U.S. marine who opened fire at the soldier had acted
inadequately," the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Tailakov remained on the other side of the fence and fled after
hearing the shots. He was detained in the same neighborhood at
about 21:00. Tailakov is now held in a detention facility for
absence without leave.

<HEADLINE> Reports Say INS Has No Plans to Force Cuban Boy's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez Monday ruled
that Elian should remain with his U.S. relatives until March 6 so
the court can hear arguments from Lazaro Gonzalez, his great-uncle,
who is seeking temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press (AP) quoted Mike Gilhooly, an INS
spokesman in Miami, as saying that the agency have "no plans to
take charge of" the child, and "no plans to forcibly remove him
from the home."
</P>
<P>
Another INS spokesman, Russ Bergeron, said in Washington that
the notion of suddenly removing the boy from his great-uncle's
care was never an option. "We have never, from the very beginning,
considered forcibly taking this child into custody," he said.
</P>
<P>
The INS was reviewing the judge's ruling to see what effect it
has on the agency's decision last week to return Elian to his
father in Cuba, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 when he was found clinging to
a tube in the sea near Florida after his mother and stepfather
died when their boat capsized in an effort to illegally come to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father asked the return of the boy, but exiled Cubans
in Florida insist the boy should stay in the United States. Last
week, the INS decided that the boy should be returned to his
father in Cuba by January 14.
</P>
<P>
The boy's relatives in Florida organized a series of protests
against the INS decision and filed a petition.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said in a statement that the boy's Miami relatives
had shown that Elian would face "imminent and irreparable harm" if
he were returned to Cuba, including the "loss of due process
rights and harm to his physical and mental health and emotional
well-being."
</P>
<P>
Elian's relatives will also file "a political asylum" for him.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Engine Defect Caused Rocket Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A Russian government commission
has identified engine defects as the cause that led to the crash
of two booster rockets over Kazakhstan last year, the Interfax
news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The crash of the Protons, on July 5 and October 27 respectively,
seriously strained ties between Russia and Kazakhstan in their
space cooperation. Astana had imposed a ban on the launch of
Protons from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on its territory.
</P>
<P>
In both cases the engines of the second stage started burning
after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The Khimavotmatika designing office in Voronezh studied engine
fragments found at the rocket crash sites and discovered that
outside metal and mineral particles in the engines of the second
stage had caused both crashes, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The engines were manufactured back in 1992 at the Voronezh
mechanical works. But quality control and personnel training has
since deteriorated because it did not receive orders for Protons
for a long time. When the production of rocket engines resumed,
the key technological equipment was not duly checked, Interfax
said, citing experts.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is still trying to persuade Kazakhstan to lift the ban.
If the efforts are successful, the next launch may take place in
mid-February to send a "Gorizont" communications satellite into
orbit, Interfax quoted Proton chief designer Vladimir Gusev as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Concern About Kosovo Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping voiced concern
about the high level of violence persisting in Kosovo, the Italian
Foreign Ministry said after they met here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues examined in the talks were NATO enlargement,
the preparation of a NATO ministerial meeting in Florence in May,
and relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Scharping was in Rome for a meeting of the NATO Defense College.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, the two noted "with concern how the level of
violence has stayed high despite the efficiency shown by KFOR."
</P>
<P>
They voiced the hope that an international police force would
soon be completely deployed and that Kosovo institutions would be
set up and consolidated.
</P>
<P>
The importance of stabilizing Yugoslavia within its existing
borders, helping the Serbian opposition, fighting illegal
trafficking, providing economic humanitarian aid, reinforcing
security and boosting democracy was underscored, the Italian
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said that a democratic Serbia must be a part of
the Balkan Stability Pact, which must be relaunched.
</P>
<P>
On European defense, they stressed the need to map out the
military goals sketched at the recent EU summit, both within the
EU and -- for specific tasks -- Western European Union ambits.
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed the importance of reinforcing NATO's southern
flank, also in relation to the Balkan situation, working with the
EU and other international bodies.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Vows to Stand Against External Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's parliament
Tuesday expressed its determination that the country will never
surrender to any external pressure in safeguarding national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In its letter to the United States' congressman Benjamin
Gilman, the Ethiopian House of Peoples' Representatives Standing
committee for Foreign Affairs said that any arrangement that would
not fully guarantee Ethiopia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity is absolutely unacceptable.  Gilman, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Congress, alleged in an
article published on January 3 in the Washington Post that
Ethiopia had rejected the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
peace plan for ending the border conflict with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is preparing for war against its neighbor, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Gilman's comments as "totally unfair and highly
biased", the Ethiopian parliament said Ethiopia had accepted the
OAU framework agreement and the modalities, which, it said, shows
the country's consistent commitment to observe international rules
and principles.
</P>
<P>
The parliament pointed out that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict is
a very serious tragic conflict rather than minor border dispute.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the technical arrangement concerning the
settlement of the Ethio-Eritrean conflict, the parliament said the
arrangement is unacceptable because it is inconsistent with the
OAU peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the parliament's statement, Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin wrote a letter to the Washington Post, saying that
Ethiopia is always committed to peace and does not need a push for
 peace.
</P>
<P>
Due to border disputes, Ethiopia and Eritrean have been at war
since May 1998. The 20-month-old border war has reportedly claimed
some 30,000 lives of the two countries while hundreds of thousands
of people have become refugees.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Leaf Intake Declines Due to Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea leaf intake
declined in the week to January 4 as major tea growing areas
experienced hot and dry weather, Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient rain and higher temperatures have boosted Kenya's
tea output in the past three months, helping to partly offset the
country's poor performance early last year.
</P>
<P>
But rainfall has become less in December and the Tea Board of
Kenya is projecting the 1999 production at 246 million kilograms
against 294 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The volume of tea leaf intake will continue to fall until more
rainfall is received, ATB said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says not to Push Israel for Deal with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it would not push Israel to have a deal with Syria
without Damascus's guarantee for its security.
</P>
<P>
"We can't push them to make decisions that they believe will be
against their interests," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said. "We wouldn't want to do that."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, about 100,000 Israelis rallied at the Rabin
Square in Tel Aviv to demonstrate against surrendering the Golan
Heights, snatched in the 1967 Mideast war, to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, though having promised to
make a "painful compromise" in territory, said nothing about any
possible withdrawal from the Strategic plateau at the peace talks
with Syrians in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, last week. He
promised to hold a national referendum on the land-for-peace deal
once he strikes with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Washington recognized this was an "
extraordinarily difficult issue for Israel" and since Israel was
going to make a national decision about the ceding of the
territory, the United States would not make pressure on Israel for
a hurried deal.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot urge the parties to go faster in pursuing this
agreement than they are comfortable with. It's their decision.
They're the ones that are going to have to make the decision."
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel will resume their talks on January 19, and the
Clinton administration is asking the two sides for recommendations
on how to proceed and for revisions in a seven-page U.S. document
that could become the basis for a land-for-peace accord.

<HEADLINE> 108-Year-Old Widow to Claim "Oldest Person" Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Widow Agnes Kinnear who
remembers shaking hands with Queen Victoria is set to claim the
title of the world's oldest living person, the Press Association
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Book of Records had given the title to another
woman aged 107 - from the same part of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Margaret McHowat, from Brechin, was born on December 4, 1892,
and was said by the publication to be the oldest person in the
world who can produce records to authenticate their age.
</P>
<P>
But staff at a hospital near Dundee said Mrs Kinnear, alive and
well at 108, was born on November 5, 1891 - a recorded date.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Guinness publication said: "If they send
in records, we will study them. It could well be a new record, but
we need to see her birth certificate."
</P>
<P>
Mrs Kinnear, who has no children, has been in the Ashludie
hospital in Monifieth, near Dundee, since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Born in Glasgow, she spent most of her adult life in the Angus
area where her husband was a landscape gardener while she worked
as a domestic in big country house, said hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, she said: "More than anything else, I
remember shaking hands with Queen Victoria when I was just nine."
</P>
<P>
The Guinness Book of Records is trying to track down a 118-year-
old woman in Poland and a 111-year-old man in Oregon, the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Britain Says Pinochet Unfit to Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11(Xinhua)-- British Home Office said on late
Tuesday that former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet is unfit to be
extradited to Spain to stand trial for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw said he was "minded" to release
General Pinochet after medical reports showed he was not well
enough.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said the "unequivocal and unanimous" conclusion
of a four-strong medical team who examined the 84-year-old on 5
January was that he was "at present unfit to stand trial, and that
no change to that position can be expected".
</P>
<P>
"In the circumstances, the Secretary of State is minded,
subject to any representations he may receive, to take the view
that no purpose would be served by continuing the present
extradition proceedings and that he should therefore decide not to
extradite Senator Pinochet," the home office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Although the statement did not spell out what the government's
next moves would be, it appeared to hold out the prospect that the
84-year-old general would be sent home.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was house-arrested in a London hospital, in October of
1998, while he was recovering from a minor back operation. He was
accused, by a Spanish judge, of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule of Chile
which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
But Pinochet repeatedly denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Straw's decision to release the general is subject to
representations from interested parties including Spain and
Amnesty International, who sought his extradition, as well as
Chile. They now have seven days to make their case.
</P>
<P>
Straw will make a statement to Parliament when the case is
concluded, the Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has refused to allow Spain or other countries with
outstanding extradition requests to see the medical reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister
who has campaigned for Pinochet's release since he was arrested,
said that she "would trust the Home Secretary's judgment."
</P>
<P>
"He is a very fair man," said the "Iron Lady."
</P>
<P>
Some local reports said that the surprise announcement from the
home office on Tuesday came after initial medical reports showed
that the former Chilean head of state, facing charges of human
rights abuses in Spain, was fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
But the Home Office insisted that the new tests were ordered
after an appeal by Chile in October to allow General Pinochet home
on humanitarian grounds, after his health was said to be
deteriorating.

The case was brought by Tanja Kreil, a 22-year-old electrical
engineer specialized in installation technology.
</P>
<P>
After winning the lawsuit Tanja Kreil was asked Tuesday in
Luxembourg whether she still wanted to serve in the German army (
Bundeswehr she answered: "Yes, of course, by all means. If women
are allowed to be soldiers they must claim rights and fulfill
duties."
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Mrs. Kreil had applied to the Bundeswehr to serve in
the branch responsible for the electronic maintenance of weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
She wanted to use weapons and referred an application for it,
but her application was refused because on the basis of the German
law women are barred from all work involving the use of weapons
and may be recruited into the armed forces only for service in the
medical corps or the military band units.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kreil didn't give in and took legal proceedings, but the
German administrative court in Hannover rejected her lawsuit. And
then she referred her legal proceedings to the Court of Justice of
the European Communities.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Justice of European Communities held that the
German legislation prohibiting women in general from enlisting as
volunteers in combat units was violating the Equal Treatment
Directive. It criticized that the effect of the German legislation
in question that most positions within Bundeswehr refuse to admit
women and it meant the sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The German Minister of National Defense Rudolf Scharping who
was just visiting in Italy heard the news and set a high value to
the decision of the Court of Justice of European Communities. He
said on the evening of Tuesday in Rome: "I hold that the decision
is correct and praiseworthy." But at the same time Minister
Scharping turned down the demand that the compulsory military
service also must be applied to women. "The decision had nothing
to do with the compulsory military service at all." said he by the
end of his talks in Rome.

<HEADLINE> Hill, Mourning, Allen Named to U.S. Olympic Basketball Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Forward Grant Hill of the
Detroit Pistons, center Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and
guard Ray Allen of the Milawukee Bucks Tuesday were named to the
United States men's basketball Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
The selections, officially announced by USA Basketball Tuesday,
complete the 12-man squad that will take part in the Summer
Olympics on September 16-October 1 in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
"The three players bring a tremendous amount of additional
talent to our national team," said Rod Thorn, chairman of the USA
Basketball Senior National Team Committee. "Mourning brings a
terrific inside game, rebounding, shot-blocking and the ability to
run the court."
</P>
<P>
"Hill can score and pass, play multiple positions and has
tremendous flexibility, while Allen is a pure shooter who will
help us when we go against a zone defense, plus he's an all-around
athlete who can play many positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Previously named to the team on March 10, 1999 were Seattle's
Vin Baker and Gary Payton, Phoenix's Tom Gugliotta and Jason Kidd,
San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, New York's
Allan Houston, Miami's Tim Hardaway and Portland's Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
A member of the 1996 U.S. team that captured the Olympic gold
medal in Atlanta, Hill had been selected to five previous U.S.
teams. He averaged 9.7 points and 3.5 rebounds on the U.S. squad
that captured the gold medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Allen, the fifth overall pick in 1996, was a member of the 1995
U.S. team that won the gold medal at the World University Games.
He was the second-leading scorer on that club, averaging 15.6
points per game.
</P>
<P>
Mourning replaced Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal,
who recently indicated he did not want to play. O'Neal was a
member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. qualified for the Sydney Olympics by going 10-0 in the
qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico last summer and earned one of
two American Zone berths.
</P>
<P>
Houston Rockets mentor Rudy Tomjanovich will coach the club,
while Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown will serve as assistant.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Olympic squad consisting of NBA players, which became
known as the "Dream Team," was first put together in 1992 and the
Americans went 8-0 in Barcelona, claiming victories by an average
margin of 43.8 points per game.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, the United States also went 8-0, but was
slightly less dominant, winning by an average of 31.7 points per
game.

<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the aid, spread over this
year and next year, was urgently needed to keep illegal drugs off
U.S. shores. The aid would help the Colombian government push into
the coca-growing areas in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The aid will be used in training special counternarcotics
battalions, purchasing 30 Blackhawk and 33 Huey helicopters, and
providing other support.
</P>
<P>
"We have a compelling national interest in reducing the flow of
cocaine and heroin to our shores, and in promoting peace,
democracy and economic growth in Columbia and the region," Clinton
noted.
</P>
<P>
The aid package was announced by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at the White House. "This is not a counterinsurgency
program. This is a counternarco-trafficking program," she told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
She made it clear that the U.S. would ensure that the aid does
not go to military units that have been implicated in abuses in
Colombia.

The U.S. currently provide about 150 million U.S. dollars in
assistance a year to Colombia. Colombian President Andres

<HEADLINE> Tower of Pisa to Re-open Next Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Leaning Tower of Pisa
should re-open to the public next summer after ten years' work
making it safe from collapse, Italian officials said Wednesday as
the final phase of work got under way.
</P>
<P>
The last stage, which is expected to take between 14 and 16
months, involves digging out some 50,000 cubic meters of earth
from the side of the tower away from the tilt.
</P>
<P>
According to the chair of the international panel set up to
save the tower, Michele Jamiolkowski, the work will make the tower
safe "at least for another 200-250 years."
</P>
<P>
As the earth comes out, the tower will straighten up by some 35-
50 cm, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ten iron rings circling the tower will be removed
along with 800 tons of lead counterweights and two gantries
gripping the tower on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the ribbon on the dig, Italian Public Works Minister
Willer Bordon said the project had so far cost 42 billion lire (
about 22 million U.S. dollars) and the last phase would add an
extra 8 to the bill.
</P>
<P>
Referring to past hold-ups, he pledged that the money would
stay on stream on his watch.
</P>
<P>
An exact date for the reopening has not yet been set, but
Bordon promised that "before next fall we will be able to say with
certainty when the tower will be handed back to Pisa, Italy and
the world."
</P>
<P>
When the straightening is complete, the tower is expected to be
about as straight, or leaning, as it was in year of 1700 - about 4
meters out of the perpendicular.
</P>
<P>
Before the efforts to reverse the lean, the eight-story tower
was adding an average of 1mm a year to its 4.5-metre lean out of
the perpendicular.
</P>
<P>
The long operation to save the tower has not been free from
trouble or controversy.
</P>
<P>
The Tower, which is 54.5 meters high, has been closed to the
public since 1990 when experts who regularly monitor its movements
declared it unsafe.
</P>
<P>
This was a big disappointment to the throngs of tourists who
daily climbed the 296 steps up the spiral stairway to the top of
the white marble cylinder, and a huge blow to the local tourist
trade.
</P>
<P>
The tower was begun in 1174 but was only completed in 1350,
when its tilt was already about half what it is today.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Join Mideast Talks in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon would not attend the
proposed multilateral talks on Middle East peace process in Moscow,
before it sees progress in its own negotiations with Israel, a
Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and the United States, sponsors of the multilateral
talks launched in Madrid, Spain, in 1991, had invited Lebanon to
attend the talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Israel and Lebanon, as well as those between
Israel and Syria, stopped four years ago after a series of attacks
carried out by Islamic militants in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the Lebanon-Israel track depends on the
progress Syria, Lebanon's main power broker, makes in its
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Syria-Israel talks, revived last December in the United
States, would tackle the Golan Heights which Israel seized from
Syria in the 1967 Mideast war, sharing of water, security measures
and normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has demanded that Israel unconditionally withdraw from
its south, where Israel set up a self-styled security zone in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. The zone covers about one 10th of the Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
Beirut and Damascus, both technically still at war with Israel,
have boycotted the multilateral Middle East talks from the outset,
saying such talks would be meaningless if they have not achieved
peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow talks, scheduled to start on February 1, are expected
to cover refugees, arms control, economic issues, environment and
water rights.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Georgia Trade Accusations Over Chechen Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia and neighboring Georgia
on Tuesday exchanged accusations over alleged transfer of weapons
to rebels in Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Parliament Speaker Zurab Zhvania told a press
conference in Tbilisi that weapons for Chechen rebels had been
passed to unidentified Caucasians from a Russian military base
located in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Zhvania said the incident was uncovered by the Georgian special
services, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Georgian Security Ministry conducted an operation
foiling an attempt "by people from the Caucasus, who are neither
ethnic Georgians nor Georgian nationals," to transport arms and
ammunition from a Russian military base.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the operation was "a reply to the Russian
circles that routinely, groundlessly and absolutely cynically"
accuse Georgia of conniving with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Russian Defense Ministry dismissed Zhvania's
allegation, saying "special inspections" Tuesday at the ammunition
depots and arsenals on Russian military bases in Georgia" have
found "no loss, shortage or theft of weapons or ammunition."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Zhvania's claim "can to a certain extent be
regarded as provocative," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the main
successor to the Soviet KGB, also denied knowledge of the alleged
transfer of weapons from a Russian military base in Georgia to
rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The FSB "possesses no information to that effect," FSB
spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nor has any information come from Georgian special services
under the partnership agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman repeated allegations that "Chechen fighters had
come into contact with Georgian criminal elements with the aim of
organizing provocation against the Russian military base in
Vaziani in Georgia."
</P>
<P>
"Accusations against Russian servicemen allegedly supplying
weapons to the Chechen bandits were to become the goal of possible
provocation," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Honduras to Talk About Military Exclusion Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eduardo Montealegre said Tuesday he will talk with his
Hondurean counterpart, Roberto Flores, Wednesday and Thursday on
defining a military exclusion zone.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's conflict with the northern neighboring country will
be solved at the International Court of Justice of The Hague, not
at these meetings, explained the diplomatic head.
</P>
<P>
The meeting to begin Wednesday at the Organization of American
States (OAS) headquarters won't be the last one for defining a
zone of military exclusion between both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On December 1999, the two foreign ministers sat for the first
time in Miami, almost one month after Honduras' Congress ratified
a limitation treaty with Colombia.
According to the Nicaraguan government, this treaty takes away
from Nicaragua 130,000 square kilometers of territorial sea and
continental platform on the Caribbean Sea. In this sense, the
Nicaraguan government presented last December 8 this demand before
the court at The Hague.

<HEADLINE> Phone Call Reveals Location of French Serial Killer Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The location of France's most
hunted serial killer suspect, Sid Ahmed Rezala, was found by
French police when he made a phone call to his ex-girlfriend in
France Monday, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Rezala, who is suspected of killing at least three young women
in France, was arrested Tuesday in Lisbon by Portuguese and French
agents after one month of intensive hunting by French police.
</P>
<P>
Police intercepted a phone call by Rezala to his ex-girlfriend
Nadia, with whom he had a baby, and found that the suspect was
hiding in someone's home in Baixa de Banheira near Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Two French agents immediately flew to Lisbon to join the
operation to arrest Rezala, said officials.
</P>
<P>
Rezala, a 20-year-old French citizen of Algerian origin with a
crime record, was suspected of killing Corinne Carillaux and
Isabel Peake on two separate night trains in October and December.
</P>
<P>
He was also suspected to have killed Emilie Bazin in December
in Reims, northern France.
</P>
<P>
Rezala is expected to be extradited by Portugal to France after
being presented Wednesday morning to a court in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
A judge of the Court of Appeal of Lisbon will validate the
arrest with an international arrest warrant delivered by a French
judge.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Spend More Money on National Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton is to submit his budget to Congress on February 7,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
In his 2000 budget, Clinton added 6.6 billion dollars to the
NMD, and Defense Department officials estimated deployment of such
a system will cost 12.7 billion dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will determine by July the feasibility of the NMD, but
not whether the technology and equipment are ready to be deployed.
The final version of the interceptor, for example, is not
scheduled to be tested in flight until 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon claimed that the United States faces a growing
threat from missile attack by other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The threat is real, (and) it will, in all likelihood,
intensify in the coming years as countries continue to acquire
chemical, biological and nuclear capabilities," Defense Secretary
William Cohen said last month.
</P>
<P>
Critics said that the NMD is unlikely to provide a reliable
defense against ballistic missiles and that it will require the
United States to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty, which many consider the bedrock of arms control.

<HEADLINE> 1st Purely Online Banking-Brokerage Company Approved in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal regulators
announced Tuesday the approval of online brokerage ETrade Group
Inc.'s acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which will create
the first soup-to-nuts financial services company entirely based
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The approval by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which has
regulatory authority over Telebanc, cleared the way for the merger,
which shareholders voted to approve last month.
</P>
<P>
As a condition of its approval, the thrift agency said it is
requiring the new company to make "clear distinctions" between
financial products that are insured by the government, such as
bank deposits, and uninsured ones such as securities investments.
</P>
<P>
The two companies said they expect the merger to be completed
Wednesday, allowing customers to trade stocks, pay bills and make
other banking transactions on the same Web site. ETrade says it
has some 1.5 million investment customers.
</P>
<P>
Sweeping legislation approved last year removed Depression-era
legal barriers, allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
"This merger... positions us to win the core consumer
relationship by launching a host of revolutionary new products and
services," Mitchell H. Caplan, president and chief executive
officer of Telebanc, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the stock-swap acquisition announced last June,
ETrade will acquire Telebanc for stock worth about 1.8 billion
dollars. The combined company will carry the name ETrade.
</P>
<P>
ETrade, which started offering Internet investing in February
1996, made its name as an online stock brokerage but has been
trying to diversify. The company already sells mutual funds and
has a venture with online mortgage provider E-Loan Inc. that
allows ETrade's customers to apply for home mortgages on the
Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
54th General Assembly, Theo-Ben Guirirab, Tuesday announced the
reappointment of the ambassadors of New Zealand and Guatemala to
the United Nations as Joint Coordinators of the Open-ended Working
Group on the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on Tuesday afternoon, the president,
who is also the Namibian foreign minister, said that Michael John
Powles, the permanent representative of New Zealand to the United
Nations, and Gert Rosenthal, the permanent representative of
Guatemala to the United Nations, were reappointed as the joint
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
"These experienced diplomats served previously as Vice-
Presidents of the aforementioned Open-ended Working Group," the
statement said. "They did an excellent job for which I am most
grateful."
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of their expertise, institutional memory and
competence, I have, after consulting them, decided to reappoint
Ambassadors Powles and Rosenthal in the same capacities, effective
as of January 10, 2000," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that I can rely on their invaluable assistance
and expect to benefit from their competence," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all the delegations of the United Nations Member
States to cooperate with Ambassadors Powles and Rosethal and
provide any assistance they may require," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The joint coordinators will collect opinions from the countries
worldwide and report to the current General Assembly session in
preparation for the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Summit, also known as the Millennium Assembly,
is the 55th General Assembly, which, to be convened in September
this year, is expected to attract heads of state across the world.
They will gather at the first General Assembly session in the new
millennium to hammer out the further U.N. role in the future.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Treaty Targets Financing of Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of the day, the convention had been signed by seven
countries, namely, Finland, France, Malta, the Netherlands, Sri
Lanka, the United Kingdom and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The latest in a series of interlock conventions intended to
combat terrorism, the International Convention for the Suppression
of the Financing of Terrorism, was adopted by the U.N. General
Assembly on December 9, 1999 without a vote.
</P>
<P>
The convention will enter into force when it has been ratified
by 22 states. States who sign a treaty demonstrate their intention
to ratify.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following its adoption, Canadian
Ambassador Philippe Kirsch, who chaired the working group that
drafted the legislation, called the convention a model instrument.
</P>
<P>
It recognizes the fundamental importance of the international
problem posed by the financing of terrorism, he said, adding that
it establishes the act of financing terrorism as an independent
crime.
</P>
<P>
It does not require that an act of terrorism actually be
committed, he said, adding that it contains important provisions
on the liability of legal entities, such as organizations or
groups -- a new concept in the struggle against international
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The convention aimed at an end to the movement of huge
quantities of money under electronic environment for terrorism. If
a significant number of countries become state parties, the
convention will provide powerful enforcement possibilities to
governments who want to put an end to acts of terrorism.
