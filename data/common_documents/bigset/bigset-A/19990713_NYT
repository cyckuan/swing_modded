CLINIC SEARCHES FOR EMBRYO DONORS BEFORE DESTRUCTION DATE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ After 16 years of working miracles in the eyes of
infertile Arizonans, Dr. Robert Tamis is retiring and closing his
Phoenix clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know where your children are?
</P>
<P>
   The embryos of about 50 donors are stored in 35-liter metal
containers in a stark white room at the clinic near 24th Street and
Thomas Road. Unless their donors are located by July 31, they will
be destroyed, along with unclaimed vials of frozen sperm from as
many 70 donors.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers started to search in early May for donors whose records
are out-of-date, scanning telephone books and sending out certified
letters to last known addresses.
</P>
<P>
   They ran a classified ad in ``The Arizona Republic'' on June 27,
asking, ``If you feel you have embryos or sperms stored with
Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine, please contact us
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an awkward task _ in part because of patient privacy issues
and in part because of the ethics of destroying the embryos and
sperm.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, people who work in the field of assisted
reproduction have worried about just this situation, said Robert
McGaughey, an Arizona State University professor and an expert on
the ethics of human reproduction. He also works with the Arizona
Center for Fertility Studies, having frozen and implanted more than
3,400 embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Embryos are created by fertilizing an egg with sperm in a
laboratory and letting it divide into eight cells before being
frozen and stored. When a woman wants to try to conceive, some of
the embryos are thawed and implanted in her uterus.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies, a branch of
the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has clear _ and
regularly updated _ guidelines on cryopreservation, the freezing
and storage of embryos and sperm.
</P>
<P>
   It strongly recommends that patient and clinic sign an agreement
about how long specimens will be stored and whether they can be
donated to other couples. The group's ethics panel decided that
clinics could destroy embryos unclaimed after five years.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that is a mandate.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision is clear for Tamis' staff. Come month's end, if
the donors do not claim the embryos, Fink said, they will be
allowed to thaw and will be discarded as medical waste.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, she says, has no choice. The embryos cannot be
donated to other couples without the permission of both egg and
sperm donors. Nor would any other facility take responsibility for
abandoned embryos.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have found about half of the embryo owners, and all
but 15 of the men who store sperm there, said Kathy Fink, patient
coordinator for the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult,'' she said, ``because what kind of
message do you leave on an answering machine? Talk about opening a
can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   The donors can either have the specimens transferred to another
facility or destroyed. The possibility of the latter choice
outrages abortion opponents and even makes doctors and ethicists
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, that's destroying lives,'' said Tom Takash, a
member of Children of the Rosary, an anti-abortion group that
routinely holds prayer vigils outside another clinic where Tamis
works in east Phoenix. ``There's life there. It's been created,
it's growing and put in a state of suspended animation.''
</P>
<P>
   John Jakubczyk, president of Arizona Right to Life and a lawyer,
says the abandoned embryos raise endless questions: Who decides
when they will be destroyed? Why can't they be given to other
couples for adoption? Could they be declared wards of the state?
</P>
<P>
   Tamis started having patients sign agreements that spelled out
what would be done with any abandoned embryos several years ago,
but some of the specimens date back to the `80s and early `90s,
when record keeping was done by hand and there were no such
contracts. In such cases, the embryos are so old that they likely
would not survive inside a womb.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethical questions are so disturbing that Fink is even
looking for those who signed agreements just to double check.
</P>
<P>
   Tamis, 68, who produced Arizona's first test tube baby in 1984,
among other innovations in assisted reproduction, is retiring this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tamis, who is considered one of the Valley's leading fertility
specialists, was the first to fertilize an egg by injecting it with
a single sperm in 1987. In 1986, he helped a woman without ovaries
conceive and deliver a baby. And, in 1996, he helped a woman
conceive a baby with testicular sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Tamis is on vacation this week, so Fink spent most of Monday
talking with media across the country and in England.
</P>
<P>
   Fink said the clinic placed the newspaper ad to show that it had
made all efforts to reach the donors and and to stem off any
potential legal problems if someone surfaces after the specimens
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the clinic) have made and are making the efforts to
contact the people, that's about all you can expect,'' said Steven
Hoffman, an ASU microbiology professor and expert on biomedical
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the onus to keep in touch with the clinic should rest
with the donors, the would-be parents of any resulting offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you considered it that important to yourself, you would
have maintained contact, left a change of address or something,''
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 50 patients had as many as 16 frozen embryos at the
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Some donors moved and left no forwarding address. Other embryos
belong to people who may have stored eight embryos and conceived
four children and may have simply forgotten the rest were there.
Some may have given up their quest to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men who banked sperm at Tamis' clinic did so either
because they were getting vasectomies or had testicular cancer and
would be undergoing treatments that could damage their fertility.
</P>
<P>
   In a certified letter sent to donors, Tamis told donors to
contact the office and make plans for their specimens, or they
would be destroyed by July 15. That deadline has since been pushed
back to July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Fink contacted some by telephone after receiving confirmation
that they had received the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were surprised to hear from me. They said, `Well, you
said in the letter that you would just destroy them,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of these people don't contact us because then
they don't have to make the decision. They want us to make that
decision and discard it for them.'' &QL;

PHOENIX KIDS LIVE IN TWO CITIES, TWO WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They're all Phoenix kids.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn, Antoinette, Ray, Carson. They're all growing up together
in the same big, bright city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they're worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs. They shoot by my house,'' complains Ray Gamez, 10,
who will be a fifth-grader at J.B Sutton Elementary School in
southwest Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Scala, 10, has his worries, too: ``Our next-door neighbor
built this thing really close to the wall, like a ramada. It blocks
the view of the mountain.'' Jeff is a fifth-grader at Copper Canyon
Elementary School in northeast Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Ray both live in America's fastest-growing big city,
with low unemployment, surging population and a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the hometown they will all remember.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhoods surrounding Sutton and Copper Canyon schools
reflect the differences that tear Phoenix into two distinct worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Differences that show up next door, across the street, around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   What children encounter there, day after day, shapes their
lives. Research shows that it can help root them in peace, trust
and stability _ or help shatter their security, destroy their joy
and derail their futures.
</P>
<P>
   The two different Phoenixes don't have clear boundaries. Many
children grow up in areas that contain elements of both. Kids of
all colors struggle to grow up in impoverished, crime-ridden
neighborhoods scattered throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Copper Canyon is at one extreme, surrounded by airy, multistory
homes with red-tile roofs, manicured, flowery front yards and
mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is at the other, surrounded by a far more crowded
neighborhood thick with children who live in apartments and small
houses, some with families struggling to keep them maintained and
others that have surrendered to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the neighborhoods also shows up in
statistics. In the past 12 months, for example, police arrested
2,152 adults within a 2-mile radius of Copper Canyon for domestic
violence, violent crimes and property crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For the same area around Sutton, that number is 12,375.
</P>
<P>
   Children arrested for those same offenses _ domestic violence,
violent crimes and property crime _ in the Copper Canyon
neighborhood over the past 12 months total 197.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sutton neighborhood, the total is 932.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are gangs around it,'' Ray says of his street near
Sutton. ``They kill too much and smoke too much.``
</P>
<P>
   The Sutton students will tell you about the neighbors who shoot
off guns _ sometimes into the air, sometimes at each other. Mean
dogs run in their alleys, their homes are violated by break-ins,
their pets killed, their walls smeared with graffiti or damaged
when speeding cars crash into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There lives some gang members there and drunk people drive
there,'' says Marco Anguiano, 10, complaining about his busy road.
``One time one crashed into a wall _ my wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Patino, 10, says his street doesn't have as many cars;
it's the foot traffic that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They throw stuff. People. Like sodas and cans and coffee,''
explains Tomas. ``It's nasty. If you have grass in the front yard,
it gets messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they break into your house and steal stuff. Bikes,
money, jewelry. They take good stuff and it's hard to replace it,''
says Juan Abreo, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many gang members, and they tag on your wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to the core, Marco says, ``I don't like nothing about my
street. I stay inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The children up north, in the other Phoenix, have complaints
about their neighborhood, too.
</P>
<P>
   What irritates Copper Canyon student Bryce Sirrine, 11, are
those big hills that stand between him and his dirt bike trails and
force him to get off his bike and walk.
</P>
<P>
   The noise on Bell Road was so intense that 9-year-old Carson
Park's parents had to install a waterfall in their pool to block it
out.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy Johnson, 11, lives just a block from Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night there was an accident. I heard the siren and
saw the red and blue lights. That bothered me and I couldn't
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody denies that even small worries can loom large in any
child's life. But officials like state Superintendent of Public
Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan say they're tired of trying to cope
with the large worries, trying to shape schools for devastated
neighborhoods instead of reshaping neighborhoods into safe,
nurturing places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have to come up with a way to teach children who
live in that environment,'' Keegan says. ``We should solve the
problem of bullets flying through back yards.''
</P>
<P>
   People with power and money have to make a ``huge'' shift in
policy, Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you've had a child look you in the eye and say, `I
don't want to die,' you'll never understand,'' Keegan says.
``They'd see these old, old eyes in children. They've (the
children) seen much, much more than you or I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Cuspard is 23 now, an assistant to a Phoenix City Council
member, father of two, a homeowner. He wishes every Phoenix child
could live on peaceful streets with mountain views.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on West Buckeye Road, a giant of a child who followed
his older brothers into gang life. He lived with streets filled
with crackheads and drug dealers. He was mugged in an alley at age
12; at 13 he saw his first dead man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never really home because you never feel safe,'' Cuspard
recalls. ``When you're in bed and you hear gunshots, how can you
feel safe if one of those bullets hits someone you know, or comes
through and hits someone in your house?''
</P>
<P>
   You stop thinking about the future, Cuspard says, and survive
day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Mom and Grandma can eat today,'' he says, ``that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   John Loredo, 31, also grew up in the meaner Phoenix. Every day,
around the corner or across the street, lurked a decision that
could have changed his life forever, Loredo says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deck is stacked against them,'' says Loredo, now a state
legislator, about the children who live in the other Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   These desperate, violent neighborhoods are filled with good
people and children, he says. ``But the opportunity to deviate from
the straight path is increased by 100 percent over those other
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Phoenix's children have fears about the streets where
they live. But some are easier to survive than others.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live near Copper Canyon say they fear mostly what
MIGHT happen, and far less about what does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really, really huge snake, like 3 feet long,'' Bryce
begins. ``One day it crossed the street and Dad said to watch it
and I didn't hear him and we don't know where it went.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't Bryce's only story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had troublemakers on our street and they egged our cars,
but they only had two eggs, and we thought it was them. But the
next day their house was (toilet-papered).''
</P>
<P>
   For the kids from Sutton, it's not snakes and eggs, it's
burglaries and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear gunshots,'' Antoinette Ordaz, 10, says about what
scares her. She's a talkative little girl who continually adjusts a
tiny shoulder bag. ``Last time it scared me when my grandma's house
got robbed. I thought they'd get my house. They got away because
the police took forever.``
</P>
<P>
   Juan says, ``Nothing scares me, except when they shoot a lot in
the night. Sometimes they do it for fun, but it might hit someone.
They might end up killing someone I know, like my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Children like Juan who live with violence risk becoming numb to
it, reports Michael Kelley, an Arizona State University professor
in child development.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley worked for Issac School District, which includes Sutton,
and saw preschool children come in with ``a gleam of life in their
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. ``You interview them at 8 or 9 and that gleam is
gone. They build a core or crust around their bodies to survive,''
Kelley says. ``They do become very different human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are beginning to track anti-social behaviors in
children as young as 4 who live in impoverished areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about survival,'' he says, ``not the pursuit of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Phoenix children _ in Copper Canyon and Sutton _ remain
alike in many ways. They say their parents make them do homework
before they can play. They have big plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Sutton, Marco wants to be a NASCAR driver or a scientist,
while Tomas is thinking about becoming a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either a teacher, a nurse or an astronaut to go to Mars or the
moon,'' Antoinette says.
</P>
<P>
   The kids at Copper Canyon are a little more detailed in their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Keith, 10, expects to have two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my early life, I'll probably be an engineer,'' she says,
but noted that her family also owns a hardware store. ``So, in my
30s or 40s, I'll probably take over the company with my cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy wants to be a news reporter or manage a clothing store or
be a fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed with Nordstrom,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce thinks he'll go into construction contract management,
like his dad. ``If not that, I want to work for a monopoly,'' Bryce
explains. ``Some corporation that has a nice monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the neighborhoods' deep differences never disappear, and the
sadness of everyday heartbreak seems to haunt some streets more
than others.
</P>
<P>
   Ray is only 10, but when he talks about his neighborhood he
watches the floor, his arms folded across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend's brother grabbed a little cat I liked so much
and gave it to dogs,'' says Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering his dead pets, his soft voice suddenly fills with
sarcasm: ``Oh, that was so funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's voice softened again. ``Sometimes they take dogs I like,''
he said. ``I like animals too much.'' &QL;

COMPUTER HACKERS SENTENCING DELAYED IN DISPUTE OVER RESTITUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Mitnick, possibly the world's most notorious
computer hacker, should pay $1.5 &UR;  &LR; million in restitution because of
his enormous earning potential from book and movie deals,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitnick's attorney told a U.S. Federal Court judge Monday in
Los Angeles the hacker shouldn't pay any restitution because he is
penniless, has no college degree and will be barred from using
computers, his most marketable skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of restitution should be ordered due to my client's
indigency,'' said attorney Donald C. Randolph. ``The only thing he
knows is computers, and he will not be able to use them under his
plea agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter said $1.5 &UR;  &LR; million
is ``a conservative estimate'' of what companies lost when Mitnick
stole telecommunication services and they had to make repairs and
investigate the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could make money selling his story,'' Painter said, adding
he could also become a computer journalist. He pointed out that
convicted computer hacker Kevin Poulson, who was in the courtroom
covering the hearing, now works as an Internet journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are possibilities for him,'' Painter said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the former Monroe High School student's agreement
with prosecutors, he will turn over any money he makes from movie
or book deals to the companies he victimized.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer told Mitnick he would
have to stay away from computers _ and from working in the computer
industry _ for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaelzer had expected to sentence Mitnick on Monday, but granted
a two-week delay so his attorney has time to file a motion
challenging the prosecution's restitution request.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt the amount of victim loss is gigantic, but
the question is, Does Mitnick have the ability to pay?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To allow him no restitution would allow him to escape
responsibility,'' Painter said. ``He caused a substantial amount of
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's computer hacking exploits fueled Web sites, books and
a coming movie. The 36-year-old became a hero to that hacking
underground while he was on the run, and by the time he was
captured in February 1995 he was the first hacker to make the FBI's
Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick pleaded guilty in March to computer and wire fraud
charges. If Pfaelzer approves, the deal with prosecutors means he
could be free by December because of time already served in jail.
</P>
<P>
   State computer fraud charges filed in Van Nuys Superior Court
are pending against him.
</P>
<P>
   Pfaelzer delayed sentencing until July 26 because Randolph
complained he did not have time to respond to prosecutors' request
for $1.5 &UR;  &LR; million in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick's exploits drew a small fan club to court Monday in
support of their cyberspace hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in jail more than four-and-a-half years. How much
restitution do they want him to pay?'' said supporter Josh Cohen.
``Some of the victims are multibillion-dollar corporations. What is
$1.5 &UR;  &LR; million going to do?''

MONEY FOR NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is no summit planned, no meetings of the
Dodgers and Fox Group's brain trust to decide whether to dissolve
the season or press onward.
</P>
<P>
   None is needed. The answer will be available in a few weeks. At
least, by the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers get back into the playoff race _ or think they're
back in the race _ massive changes might not be made. If they
falter, expect some deals as the Dodgers will try to bolster the
farm system while unloading salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could get to that point and . . . we're hopeful that's not
something we have to consider,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said. ``I don't think you establish any deadline for
yourself because things keep changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all our options and our first choice is we
get on a roll and play winning baseball, and all the questions we
have will be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Why wait for a few weeks to see what's going to happen? Let's
take a shot at answering it now based on one of the worst first
halves in Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson's team doesn't pitch well or hit well, and
it especially doesn't hit well in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are on a four-game winning streak as they sit for
three days, idle during the All-Star break, but they're eight games
under .500 (37-49), in last place in the NL West and trailing
first-place San Francisco by 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   They have little maneuverability in the trade market, thanks to
multiyear contracts at nearly every position, so a blockbuster deal
to prop up the team is unlikely. Instead, any deal would be
considered a retooling.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has gone right for the team so far, so why should it
change when the personnel remains the same? There are 76 games
left. There's enough time to turn the season around, or so the
Dodgers say.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's also plenty of time to drop further
below .500 while earning the inglorious title of the worst team
money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction belonged to the New York Mets a few years ago.
Baltimore took the title last year and will have to stave off the
Dodgers for that honor this season.
</P>
<P>
   No one could have guessed it would be this bad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season, the Dodgers spent more than $160 million on
free agents and contract extensions. There was spring talk of the
World Series based on the Dodgers' starting pitching and offense.
The $105 million acquisition of Kevin Brown, complete with
chartered flights for his family, was the capper, a near guarantee
of baseball in October.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the first half brought 86 games of misery, frustration,
an ill-conceived scissors kick and the embarrassment of last place.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists could point to the current four-game winning streak as
a sign the Dodgers have turned it around, but a second-half
resurgence isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a switch to be flicked so the Dodgers would
understand the importance of moving runners over with a ground
ball, or not trying to hit every pitch out of the ballpark, it
would have been found.
</P>
<P>
   If said switch existed, Chan Ho Park and Carlos Perez wouldn't
be on their way to the second- and third-worst ERAs in Los Angeles
Dodgers' history. Perez (2-9, 6.95 ERA) has outdueled Park (5-7,
6.52) in the race to dubious distinction. For pitchers with at
least 10 starts, only Danny McDevitt's 7.50 ERA in 1958 was higher
than Park and Perez's current ERA.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers don't hit with runners in scoring position (.242),
and they rarely get runners on base. Among National League teams,
they lead only San Diego in batting average at .263. They're 12th
in runs scored (397), ninth in home runs (95) and 14th in on-base
percentage (.336).
</P>
<P>
   Their inability, or unwillingness, to sacrifice for the team is
best exemplified in their 22 sacrifice flies, which ties for the
third worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers' inadequacies in manufacturing runs have forced
Johnson to use the running game, even though they're not a speedy
team. Dodgers basestealers have been thrown out 39 times, third
most in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   There is time. There are 76 games left. But that means little
because three days of rest won't solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
   All the tangible issues the Dodgers talked about during the
first half exist today.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lack a left-handed power hitter, lack range on the
right side of the infield, lack the ability to play fundamentally
sound baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The season began with questions about the bullpen and the
catcher. Those have given way to fears about the starting pitching
and offense.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the Dodgers' season was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   The second half doesn't figure to improve. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DODGERS REPORT CARD &QL; 
First base &QL; 
Karros is on pace for his usual season; 30 homers, 90 RBI. However,
he's hitting .230 with runners in scoring position and average
defense hurts the right side of the infield. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
Second base &QL; 
After beginning the season on a stolen-base tear, Young fell into
his old habit of hitting the ball in the air. That killed his
on-base percentage, and nagging injuries have limited his
base-stealing ability. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
Shortstop &QL; 
Grudzielanek missed four weeks after punching a wall (at least he
showed fire). Failure to hit with runners in scoring position _
he's 10 for 62 (.161) _ has plagued him the most. Defense has been
solid if unspectacular. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
Third base &QL; 
Beltre has been the only pleasant surprise. He's made 16 errors,
but his defense is among the best in the league. After hitting .215
last season, he's been near .300 this year and has shown power. &QL; 
Grade: B &QL; 
Catcher &QL; 
Who to blame: GM Kevin Malone or manager Davey Johnson for not
keeping Hundley in extended spring training? Hundley has worked
hard and is throwing well now. Angel Pena and Paul LoDuca combined
to hit .167 as backups. &QL; 
Grade: D- &QL; 
Left field &QL; 
Remember the negative hubbub surrounding Sheffield moving from
right to left? It never materialized. He has been solid and is the
team's lone all-star. &QL; 
Grade: B+ &QL; 
Center field &QL; 
Three years, $9 million was a lot to give a 36-year-old White,
who's missed 12 games with injuries and left a few other early.
Still, the Dodgers wanted 120 games from him and he's on pace for
that. Plus, he glides in the outfield. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
Right field &QL; 
How to judge? Mondesi hit 18 homers through May but has only one
and 10 RBI since. He's made four errors but usually from trying to
do too much. No one plays harder. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
Starting pitching &QL; 
The strength of the team coming out of spring training has been
terrible. The starters have a combined 4.95 ERA. Chan Ho Park's ERA
is 6.52 since being suspended in early June. Brown's 9-6 mark is
offset by Park and Carlos Perez going 7-16. &QL; 
Grade: D- &QL; 
Relief pitching &QL; 
It's been spotty, but Borbon might be the real all-star. After not
pitching in the big leagues for two years, his ERA is 1.64. Jeff
Shaw is 19 of 20 in save chances. &QL; 
Grade: B- &QL; 
Bench &QL; 
It's one of Johnson's pets and it's had injuries (Todd
Hollandsworth and Jose Vizcaino). The lack of depth shows in that
unknowns Brent Cookson and Chance Sanford played in the majors this
season. Hansen and Trenidad Hubbard have been solid. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
Manager &QL; 
Johnson hasn't been able to use his bullpen and bench because of
injuries and ineffectiveness. Lack of a lefty power hitter has been
the sorest spot. Even though it's been a horrible first half, he's
kept the clubhouse relatively complaint-free. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
Front office &QL; 
The decision to bring Hundley west to begin the season was wrong
and firing pitching coach Charlie Hough hasn't turned around the
pitching staff. GM Malone's maneuverability is nearly nil because
of the long-term contracts he inherited. &QL; 
Grade: C- &QL; 
OVERALL GRADE
</P>
<P>
   There's a D in Dodgers for a reason. Last place and 10 games
out, they don't play fundamentally sound baseball and fail to do
the little things _ hit cutoff men, hit behind the runner, take the
extra base _ that good teams do. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
FIRST-HALF LOWLIGHTS &QL; 
__ 1. They open the season with a 5-1 homestand then don't go over
.500 on another homestand until they sweep Seattle. &QL; 
__ 2. In a cost-cutting move, pitcher Dave Mlicki is traded to
Detroit for three players no one in baseball, outside of the
Dodgers, would ever call prospects. There's a big difference
between $84 million and $80 million. &QL; 
__ 3. Fernando Tatis hits two grands slams off Chan Ho Park . . .
in the same inning. &QL; 
__ 4. Eric Karros botches a rundown that costs the Dodgers a run in
what was a one-run game. Afterward, he says it's no big deal
because it's only May. &QL; 
__ 5. Kevin Brown, who's already smashed a commode in spring
training, takes his frustration out on a toilet stall after giving
up six runs in Philadelphia. &QL; 
__ 6. Carlos Perez misses a start after suffering a mysterious knee
injury in Montreal. &QL; 
__ 7. St. Louis' Shawon Dunston and the Dodgers' Jamie Arnold brawl
after Dunston was hit with a pitch. &QL; 
__ 8. Pitching coach Charlie Hough is fired after the first game of
a nine-game road trip. The Dodgers say it's because the starting
pitchers haven't been properly prepared. Dodgers starters were
19-16 and fourth in the league with a 4.19 ERA. At the halfway
point, they'll be 31-37 with a 4.95 ERA. &QL; 
__ 9. Park gets suspended for seven games after punching and
kicking Angels pitcher Tim Belcher. &QL; 
__ 10. The Dodgers and Mariners have a 15-minute brawl in the last
game before the All-Star break. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Sweating out near-record temperatures and high
humidity, Southern California residents suffered through another
wacky weather day with thunderstorms, lightning, a flood watch and
a statewide power alert.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills in the San Fernando Valley was the hottest spot
in Los Angeles on Monday, with a 107-degree high and a ``misery
index'' of 130 _ meaning the humidity was so high it felt like 130
degrees, compared with a normal index in the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   And it's expected to be just as bad today: More hot and humid
air with a chance of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In an area where the humidity usually runs about 20 &UR;  &LR; percent,
readings of 45 &UR;  &LR; percent Sunday and Monday in the Valley and as high
as 65 &UR;  &LR; percent downtown left everyone cranky and looking to escape
the heat.
</P>
<P>
   So Sandy Fink's physical education classes at Mark Keppel
Elementary School in Glendale, Calif., can expect to spend its
exercise periods today in the auditorium playing paddle ball and
other games. Fink moved her classes at the year-round school off
the hot asphalt schoolyard by 9:30 a.m. Monday to beat the
stifling, sapping heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just blazing,'' Fink said. ``The kids went out for
their morning recesses and that was it and then we were in for the
rest of the day. The playground doesn't get a chance to cool down
overnight so once the sun hits it, it's horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot, dry weather that makes brush fires far more likely than
rain storms in summer has been mugged by monsoonal moisture.
</P>
<P>
   The humid air moved in over the weekend from the four-corners
states to the east, where the monsoon season is a summer staple. A
strong high pressure system on the California-Oregon border helped
draw the air flow into Southern California, said David Sweet, a
National Weather Service meteorologist in Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's getting it right now,'' Sweet said. ``It's a bit of
an extreme case of a situation that does affect us at least once
every summer. Normally it's a little bit later in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Add a dose of hot air driving daytime temperatures 10-15 degrees
above normal on the coast and in the valleys and you have a recipe
for both dangerous rain and heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Service posted flash-flood watches for the mountains
of Ventura and Los Angeles counties.
</P>
<P>
   Search dogs prowled mud and debris for more bodies Monday after
flash-flood waters 25 feet high swept homes, boulders and cars
through the mountain hamlet of Forest Falls. Bulldozers snaked a
path through the vacation community of 3,500 awash in debris that
included giant pine trees, wreckage of automobiles and propane
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk from the extreme heat are infants and children up
to age 4, the elderly, overweight adults, and people with health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes forget they can't keep up their usual
routines when they are exposed to the brunt of summer heat,'' said
Jonathan Fielding, the Los Angeles County director of public
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When temperatures climb, you should take simple preventive
measures,'' he said. ``Obviously you don't want to exert yourself
too much outside. One of the most important things is often you
don't feel as thirsty as you are, so drinking fluids is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Coastal beaches offered some relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the heat over in the Valley, they're coming. It's picking
up. Everybody's down here,'' said Lorry Haddock, a Los Angeles
County senior lifeguard based at Zuma Beach in Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said the cooler coastal temperatures only eased the
effect of the sticky air. ``It's pretty sticky. We're getting the
high clouds pushing all the way over here. We don't usually get
that down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning wasn't an option for animals at the Los Angeles
Zoo, but a 2-year-old misting system offered cooling comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every animal that we have here has a shaded environment
and, depending on the animals, they have either a misting system or
if it gets hot, as they do in the wild, they will lie down and go
to sleep,'' said Michael Dee, the zoo's general curator.
</P>
<P>
   The misting systems were turned on in recent days to keep a fine
spray of water flowing from midmorning to early evening. The water
will cool environments 10 degrees or more, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking particular advantage of the cooling, constant water spray
were the ostriches. They soak in the water and then ruffle feathers
before taking in more.
</P>
<P>
   The chimpanzees resort to splashing each other with water from a
recirculating creek in their exhibit. Keepers drenched elephants
with cooling water from hoses.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning surged with the beginning of the workweek,
triggering a Stage One Emergency in response to the hot and humid
weather. Both the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and
Southern California Edison reported the greatest single-day
electricity usage of the year. The increases were as much as
20 &UR;  &LR; percent compared with a normal summer day.
</P>
<P>
   One factor is people turning up systems in the middle of the day
when temperatures and homes are hottest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes that long for the homes to get really uncomfortable
to the point where people really crank up the air,'' said Darlene
Battle, DWP spokeswoman. ``We're asking people to try to set the
air conditioner at 78 degrees, keep draperies drawn and windows
closed and limit appliances that use a lot of electricity during
the peak part of the day.'' &QL;

FUTURE OF WOMEN'S PRO SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ OK, we've had a good two days to lower
ourselves from the pedestal created by the Women's World Cup in the
past three weeks. Perhaps that's not enough time to begin thinking
realistically again, but we'll give it a shot anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, this commentary isn't going to be one of those
women-bashing, soccer-bashing soliloquies we've come to expect in
this country on the downside of such a huge event.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was thrilling to be a small part of history in
watching the American team live up to the hype that surrounded its
World Cup victory over China.
</P>
<P>
   The images and emotions will last a lifetime, much the same way
those from the 1994 men's World Cup did when it was played in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   We're being told a women's professional soccer league is coming.
I plan to be there watching with my daughter when it happens, but I
also know I'm in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Before our emotions get the best of us, let's take a step back
and realize what we witnessed Saturday at the Rose Bowl isn't
likely to be duplicated in our lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   We also must realize another professional sports league only
means another fragmentation of an already jaded sporting public
with diverse interests.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there is room for another league, and for that matter,
there is just cause to finally open opportunities for women never
before seen in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the landscape of the American sporting scene may change in
the next century, but let's keep the expectations realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men's soccer team surely captivated our nation when it
advanced to the second round of the '94 tournament. After beating
world power Colombia, enthusiasm was at a fever pitch, inspiring
such headlines as ``Miracle on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer never had been bigger or of greater interest in this
country. Television ratings went through the roof. Surely, this
would mean the sport was here to stay, right?
</P>
<P>
   Even then, however, the sport struggled to gain popularity at
the pro level in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it isn't here to stay, mind you. Major League Soccer
likely will persevere, but just not at the same level of a World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   MLS, which began two years after the '94 Cup, continues to
struggle at the gate and in television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, these were many of the same American men who had inspired
this nation like no other soccer players had before, playing there
in MLS. Cobi Jones, Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola, John Harkes, Eric
Wynalda, Paul Caligiuri. Remember them?
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't that league taken off? It likely never will, but that
doesn't mean it needs to be eradicated. We simply should remember
to keep it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   And this has nothing to do with the fact the best men's soccer
in the world is played elsewhere. That argument fails when we
consider the plight of track and field in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, during every Olympic Games, Americans can't seem to get
enough track and field. We wave our flags, we tear up at every
gold-medal moment and we want it all to go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   But take Carl Lewis or Michael Johnson or Jackie Joyner-Kersee
or any other world-class American athlete who has given us
goosebumps during an Olympiad and put them in a ``regular'' meet.
For some reason, as a public, we really don't care.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Track and Field Championships were held last month in
Oregon. But did we care? Not really. There were no sellout crowds,
no TV ratings bonanzas.
</P>
<P>
   Why is that, you ask? It's because Americans support events, but
for whatever reason have a hard time doing the same when it comes
to the doldrums and the ordinary existence of a season's worth of
games.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the NFL, no other professional sports league has the
power to consistently captivate crowds outside its own individual
markets.
</P>
<P>
   That won't change with a women's professional soccer league. But
as long as those in the know realize, it doesn't mean a league
can't be successful on a number of levels.
</P>
<P>
   Determining what ``success'' means is open to interpretation.
And surely there will be those naysayers who will be standing by
with their ``I told you so's'' when the numbers begin to trickle in
for a women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What defines the success of a league will be different for
different people,'' U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg said. ``In
our opinion, it doesn't need to be TV ratings and attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement may be nothing more than an attempt to provide
cushion down the road to what surely figures to be a drastic fall
from the moment's glory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact we're sitting here in the summer of '99 debating
the merits and prospects of a women's professional soccer league
should be looked upon as a victory in itself.

FBI USES HOLLYWOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS TO UNCOVER MUDER-FOR-HIRE PLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Using Hollywood special effects experts to
fake the death of an assassination target, FBI agents reported that
they foiled a complex plot that started with bribe offers for false
testimony and ended with a murder-for-hire scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were arrested _ the intended victim's wife, a
former travel agent convicted of robbery and his brother, who is
accused of working out a scheme designed to free him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This depraved bid to avoid the consequences of criminal
behavior prompted swift and decisive action by law enforcement
authorities,'' U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were filed against Kristine Gagukovna Arutunyan, 29;
Garen Zakarian, 35, who is serving an 85-year prison sentence for
robbing a fellow Glendale travel agent; and Archak Zakarian, 30.
They were accused of conspiring to use interstate facilities to
murder and engaging in a plot to obstruct justice by corruptly
influencing the testimony of various people to get Garen Zakarian a
new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Arutunyan and her husband, Artur Simonian, 35, reportedly were
promised $50,000 to falsify testimony that would help win a new
trial for Garen Zakarian, who had been acquitted of murdering the
woman he was convicted of robbing.
</P>
<P>
   Simonian apparently backed out of the deal, leading his wife and
Archak Zakarian to seek out a go-between for hiring an assassin,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The middleman turned out to be an FBI informant, and authorities
set about exposing the plot. This involved the drama's last act _
proving the ``hit'' had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   For that, agents employed show-business makeup and special
effects to manufacture photos of a bloody corpse of a man who had
been shot in the head and stuffed into the trunk of a car. To
complete the ruse, Simonian was in custody while the FBI put its
plan to work.
</P>
<P>
   The photo was given to the informant to turn over to the
plotters, who were arrested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the recorded testimony and all the evidence, the
picture put the stamp on the case,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Stephen Larson, chief of the organized crime strike force.
</P>
<P>
   The plot was part of an elaborate scheme to overturn the
conviction of Garen Zakarian by making up new testimony, said Thom
Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, a U.S. District Court judge sentenced Garen
Zakarian to 85 years in federal prison for robbing rival Glendale
travel agent Benita Mikailian, who was killed in October 1994. The
judge said he believed Zakarian planned Mikailian's murder but in
December 1995, a Pasadena Superior Court jury acquitted Zakarian of
that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Garen Zakarian owned an agency, EconoTrans, that provided air
transportation between Armenia and the United States and had tried
to buy 80 airline tickets from Mikailian so clients stranded in
Paris could return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mikailian found out he did not have the $42,000 price for the
tickets and refused to turn them over. She was shot four times in
the heart while seated in her office Oct. 5, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Zakarian's fingerprint was found on the silencer of the
.380-caliber Baretta that ballistics tests showed to be the weapon
used. It, along with a machine gun and a pair of ski gloves, were
discovered in a bag several blocks from Mikailian's travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   The defense in Zakarian's murder trial said he found the
silencer on the floor of a car in which he was riding and picked it
up, thinking it was a shock absorber. The defense also suggested
that Garen Zakarian was framed by ``unknown Armenian Mafia''
members.
</P>
<P>
   Garen Zakarian's sister, Anait Zakarian, also was charged with
the travel agent's murder. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department accidentally released her from custody in 1995 and she
is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI affidavit released Monday, the goal of the
trio's plot was to reopen the case by getting an unidentified man
from Armenia, who was to be paid $100,000, to falsely confess to
killing Mikailian. The man was willing to do it to provide his
family with the money, the affidavit says.
</P>
<P>
   Archak Zakarian told an FBI informant in February that he would
pay him $5,000 for providing a false alibi for his brother at the
time of the Mikailian murder.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said an FBI informant was told Simonian and
Arutunyan had been promised $50,000 and that it was Simonian who
provided Garen Zakarian with the silencer used in the travel
agent's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, Arutunyan gave the FBI informant a
slip of white paper with her husband's name and address and other
personal data. She also reportedly gave the informant a color photo
of her husband, and a black-and-white photocopied picture of him.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18, Arutunyan reportedly gave $3,500 to the government
witness as a down payment for the killing. The witness told
Arutunyan the job cost $10,000, court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   When federal authorities searched Archak's Zakarian's Glendale
apartment last week, they found police photos of Mikailian's
bullet-riddled body inside his 1999 calendar. It was unclear how he
had obtained the photos, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. magistrate denied bail to Arutunyan and Archak Zakarian
on Monday. An indictment against all three defendants is expected
to be returned late this month. Their arraignment is scheduled for
Aug. 2.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers caught a break when Angel
Pena's injured left forearm was diagnosed as a strain by Dr. Frank
Jobe on Monday at Centinela Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who is listed as day-to-day, was hurt during the brawl
with the Seattle Mariners on Sunday. Since the team is off for
three games because of the All-Star break, Pena could be available
when the Dodgers begin a three-game series Thursday against the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions from the brawl could be announced either today
or Wednesday. Catcher Todd Hundley, reliever Pedro Borbon and coach
Rick Dempsey were all ejected from the game.
</P>
<P>
   The National League will handle the Dodgers' suspensions. The
American League will discipline Seattle's offenders.

his first stint as a reliever. Osuna allowed three hits in two
shutout innings, walking one and striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, recovering from the removal of a bone spur in his
pitching elbow, is scheduled to pitch today. If all goes well, he's

   PROTEST-HIGHWAY ST. LOUIS _ Janette Hill figured what she and
several hundred others did Monday morning was justified _ even if
it meant blocking busy Interstate 70 during rush hour. ``When all
else fails you have to try this,'' the former Kansas City resident
said as demonstrators gathered early Monday about five miles west
of downtown St. Louis. ``If political leaders can't take control,
people have to take control.'' Fueled by chants of ``Shut It
Down,'' the protesters did just that. They shut down I-70 for
nearly an hour because they said there were too few minorities
working on state highway projects in the St. Louis area. Police
arrested 125 demonstrators and charged them with impeding traffic
and disobeying a police officer, a St. Louis police spokesman said.
Those arrested were released by noon. They face August court

headed the protest, and three Missouri lawmakers. By WILL SENTELL.

COURT BACKS ASYLUM FOR WOMAN WHO FLED FROM GENITAL CUTTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court has issued a decision
supporting the asylum petition of a 29-year-old native of Ghana who
fled her country, she said, because she was afraid that tribal
elders were going to cut her genitals.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, lawyers for the woman, Adelaide Abankwah, said on
Monday, marked the first time that a federal court had recognized
fear of genital cutting, which is performed on millions of women in
about 26 African countries, as a legitimate claim in requests for
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, which was made on Friday and released to her
lawyers on Monday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan ruled that Ms. Abankwah had provided sufficient evidence
to demonstrate that her fear of genital cutting was real and
reasonable. The court cited State Department reports indicating
that although female genital cutting was outlawed in Ghana in 1994,
15 percent to 30 percent of Ghanaian women are still forced to
undergo the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling challenges the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which had denied her petition for asylum. Ms. Abankwah was
detained by immigration officials on March 29, 1997, when she
arrived with false immigration documents at Kennedy International
Airport. Since then, she has been held at the Wackenhut Detention
Center in Queens and is considered its longest-serving prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Her detention, and the decision by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to deny her petition, sparked widespread
protests this spring among immigrant rights groups and legislators
from New York. The protesters said the immigration service's
position on Ms. Abankwah's case demonstrated that the agency was
not committed to protecting asylum seekers who flee sex-based
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Female genital cutting was outlawed in the United States in
1996. In that same year, the INS recognized the practice as a valid
form of persecution for immigrants seeking asylum. The decision in
that case, based on the petition of another African native, became
part of a series of guidelines on sex-based persecution that were
issued to immigration judges.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for refugees say the guidelines are inadequate
because they are not binding. Immigration judges are not required
to rule that persecution based on an applicant's sex constitutes a
valid claim for asylum, and they rarely do so without public
pressure, the advocates have said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the 2nd Circuit Court sends the case back to the
Board of Immigration Appeals. A decision could take three to four
weeks. Ms. Abankwah's lawyer, Jonathan Rauchway, said he would
petition the INS to release Ms. Abankwah immediately on
humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of the end of their
resistance,'' Rauchway said of the INS. ``Sooner or later, Adelaide
will be free.''

RESIDENTS EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT SLAYING OF NEIGHBOR

   OSAWATOMIE, Kan. _ Five months have passed since police fatally
shot Willie Heard during a drug raid at his house in this Miami
County city, but many people who attended a community forum Monday
night were still worried that the same thing could happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, the U.S. attorney's office, the U.S.
Department of Justice's Community Relations Service, the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Osawatomie police advisory board
answered questions from about 65 persons at the forum. City and
police officials were invited, but the city's insurance company
advised them not to attend because Heard's family is pursuing a
civil lawsuit in his death, said City Manager Ted Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   Heard, 46, was shot about 1:25 a.m. Feb. 13 when police and
Miami County sheriff's deputies rushed into his house with a
warrant, searching for crack cocaine that they thought was being
sold there. His daughter said she screamed for Heard when she woke
to the shouts of strange men around her. Officers found Heard with
a rifle in his bedroom and shot him. Police found a small amount of
what they believe was marijuana, but no cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute meeting Monday at Osawatomie's municipal
auditorium was scheduled to discuss police policies and citizens'
rights, but the discussion often focused on the situation from five
months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most about what happened to
Willie Heard is it was 11 seconds from entry to death, and I think
a lot of us are concerned about, `What if it happens to me?' &UR; ''
said Henry Gueary III, president of the NAACP's Olathe branch. His
group organized the forum.
</P>
<P>
   People need to talk about the problems in their communities and
they have to work closely with police, participants said. They also
need to register and vote for officials who share their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   There are no absolute solutions, but people must work to reduce
the chance that such a death will occur again, said Joe Rodriguez
of the Community Relations Service.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions dealt with processes by which police obtain
search warrants and what the rules for arrest are, but a common
thread was a discussion of ways to build better relations between
police and the rest of the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tragedy that it took a death to bring our community
together,'' said Gloria Anderson of Osawatomie, a friend of
Heard's. ``But now that we are together, we need to work to keep
this from happening again.''

FORT WORTH TRACK SUCCESS HINTS AT ECONOMIC BOON AHEAD FOR KANSAS
CITY, KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ If there's a Johnny Appleseed out there for
economic development projects it might be a state-of-the-art motor
speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Pat Svacina, a spokesman for City Hall in Fort Worth,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has been beyond our expectations,'' he said of the
spin-off businesses sprouting up around the 200,000-capacity Texas
Motor Speedway that opened two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like what? Restaurants? Hotels and motels? Retail shops and
office buildings? More entertainment venues?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the above,'' Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Kansas City, Kan., wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-based International Speedway Corp., is building a $224
million Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kan., north of Interstate
70 just west of the Interstate 435 interchange. The track is
expected to open in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Fort Worth's experience is any guide, the metropolitan area's
most economically depressed community could enjoy a breathtaking
revival in the first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen overnight,'' warned Eddie Gossage, general
manager of the Texas track.
</P>
<P>
   But stacked up against the past few decades of economic history
in Kansas City, Kan., another two- or three-year wait before an
economic boomlet would be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous opportunity for our community,'' said
Wyandotte County Unified Government Administrator Dennis Hays.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the opportunity is not missed or muffed, the Unified
Government within weeks will begin a formal search for a master
developer to plan and oversee economic growth on 400 or so prime
acres of land around the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a temptation to grab the first deals that come
along,'' Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be selective and pick projects that
ensure a long-term quality and benefit to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Would-be developers already are lining up at City Hall with
plans and proposals tucked under their arms, Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   A New York-based water theme park developer was the first to go
public with its blueprints for a family recreation center in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   Hays confirmed that several national hotel and restaurant chains
are looking hard, as are local investors.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth traveled the same road about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing wasn't really big around here'' before the track,
Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unknown factor for us was whether there was a (local fan)
market and whether people would drive here from other parts of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth officials had their answer even before the first race
weekend when the city's hotels were booked to capacity and overflow
crowds were forced to find lodging in Dallas, Arlington and other
cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, he added, ``folks spend a lot of bucks'' during
their weekend racing jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   That fact certainly wasn't lost on the local and national
developers and entrepreneurs who are financing Fort Worth's
spin-off building boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism dollars are the best dollars you can get,'' Gossage
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 40 percent of the people who come to auto races are
local,'' he said. ``The rest require accommodations, restaurants,
night clubs ... they forgot their toothbrush and they have to shop
at the local store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they go back home and leave all that tax money behind,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motor Sports Inc. built the Texas racetrack and a
nine-story office, condo and private club and restaurant next door
that is helping to keep the track and the surrounding area hopping
with traffic and other events about 300 days a year, Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Speedway will have about half the seating of Texas _
75,000 plus thousands more temporary seats _ at least for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   Local track president Grant Lynch announced last week that plans
are already under way to increase the number of luxury suites. And,
he noted, the track is designed for the easy addition of up to
75,000 more grandstand seats. And most likely they will be built,
Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The maxim in professional motor sports racing the past few years
has been: Build it and the crowds will come.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels, restaurants, condominiums and office parks have been
bursting out of the Texas soil around the track for two years,
Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a major announcement of a luxury hotel resort
being built in conjunction with a business park and golf course,''
Svacina said. ``The developers cited the racetrack as one of the
major reasons they came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cooper is general manager of a 102-room Hampton Inn &AMP;
Suites that opened in February at the nearby Alliance Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we would have chosen this spot if it wasn't for
the Texas Speedway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is wonderful. We're full,'' she said, even when the
company bumps up its room rates about 30 percent on big race
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   And Cooper said her company recently broke ground next door for
a 140-room Hawthorne Suites operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of standing reservations,'' Cooper said.
``Mostly it's for the racing teams and our regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only book 50 weeks out. But we know as soon as we're able
to book them, they'll be in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said a new shopping center is expected to be announced
soon for a site across the highway from the track. It will probably
include a grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Texas track employee Linda Snelson said on race days one Fort
Worth grocery chain loads up an 18-wheel tractor-trailer rig and
sets up shop outside the track selling everything from cold cuts to
toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people really appreciate that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On race weekends, Svacina said Fort Worth sales tax and hotel
room tax collections jump about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our amazement the (racing fans) market didn't have to
grow,'' Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived full-grown.

FORT WORTH TRACK SUCCESS HINTS AT ECONOMIC BOON AHEAD FOR KANSAS
CITY, KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Kan., has heard this siren song of economic boom times
before.
</P>
<P>
   When The Woodlands pari-mutuel dog and horse racing tracks
opened in 1989, city leaders heralded the event as the springboard
for an economic development explosion along the same I-435 corridor
at the city's western fringe.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   While auto racing has leaped to major spectator-sport status
nationwide in recent years, The Woodlands opened in the late '80s
as the U.S. pari-mutuel racing industry lay wheezing on its
deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, riverboat and tribal gambling swept the
Midwest. A succession of casinos opened and they are still thriving
in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday early years, The Woodlands hastened the demise of
the struggling Ak-Sar-Ben track in Nebraska by grabbing Kansas
City's racing market for itself.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, however, The Woodlands was in steep decline and then
was staggered by Kansas City's glitzy riverboat competition. The
track filed for bankruptcy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Unified Government's Hays said experts who have studied the
motor sports marketplace do not expect the Kansas Speedway to
reprise The Woodlands' financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racing industry is in a major growth mode,'' Hays said.
``And we will virtually be the major track in a 500-mile market
radius.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays said the tax-incentive table is being set now for
developers by virtue of last month's Unified Government approval of
a master land-use plan for western Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Using state tax-incentive laws, the Unified Government
essentially will allow new retail developers within a specially
designated track ``tourism district'' to keep every penny of the
6.9 percent state and local sales taxes they collect to help pay
off their construction debts.
</P>
<P>
   According to state law, Hays said, those sales tax rebates will
be the only tax dollars those new developers will receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be on the property tax rolls,'' Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally watched race days aren't the only moneymakers for
speedway neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the top-of-the-line NASCAR races, other major
sanctioning bodies use speedways _ among them the Sports Car Club
of America, the American Motorcyclist Association, North American
Sport Bike as well as truck and go-kart racing groups.
</P>
<P>
   The big Sunday NASCAR races _ usually two or three dates a year
for established tracks _ attract crowds to town as early as
Thursday for qualifying heats and practice runs, Fort Worth's
Svacina said.
</P>
<P>
   Racing isn't all that tracks offer.
</P>
<P>
   Svacina said the Texas track is being used more and more for
concerts and other large-crowd gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first music festival out here, the night of the concert,
you couldn't get a hotel room within 100 miles of this place,''
track employee Snelson said.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. Gossage
said the track's first and last rock 'n' roll festival drew more
than 400,000 people over a weekend, overwhelming local facilities.
``We haven't done that again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the track's Speedway Club has become a popular
venue for meetings, weddings and other gatherings. One couple got
married on the track surface, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said his Texas track is used about 200 days a year for
``racing school,'' a sort of fantasy camp for race fans who pay to
get behind the wheel of a race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get going about 150 miles an hour,'' Gossage said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Speedway's Lynch said similar race schools and other
non-racing uses for the track are being looked at here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to use the track all we can,'' Lynch said. ``We
promised to bring the people in.''
</P>
<P>
   After the track opens, Lynch said, local civic groups can look
to it for fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be looking at civic groups to come in and man the
concession stands for us'' just as the Kansas City Royals and other
entertainment venues have done here.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the track will employ about 60 people year-round _
but will need as many 3,000 workers on race weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who also is president of both the Talladega Superspeedway
in Alabama and the Talladega, Ala., Economic Development Authority,
is sensitive to what a community needs and wants from its tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is confident a track-fueled tourism industry will
grow up quickly in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city already has the infrastructure in place,'' he said,
unlike many new racing venues that are built at the undeveloped and
underpopulated fringes of major metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Hays said he is typical of many people in the metropolitan area
who know little about pro motor racing, and he is learning as the
project proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   This spring he attended his first big-time race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different culture than going to a Chiefs game,''
he said.

SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS BOUND FOR OKLAHOMA TO CHECK OUT DEMPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three Kansas City Board of Education members
will travel to Oklahoma City Wednesday to look into the background
of Benjamin Demps Jr., a candidate to be the next superintendent of
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to talk to people who have interacted with him,'' said
board President John Rios. ``We want to find out about his
management style, about his credibility. We're hoping to find out
what other people feel about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The board will meet Wednesday night to determine whether to
offer the job to Demps and to begin contract negotiations. Demps,
65, is a retired Federal Aviation Administration official who also
headed the Oklahoma Department of Human Services in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said attorneys for the district would try to
schedule interviews with Demps' former associates at the FAA and
the state agency, as well as civic leaders and minority groups such
as the Oklahoma City Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk to some grass-roots groups,'' said board member
Helen Ragsdale, who will travel to Oklahoma for the day with board
members Connie Clark and Sandy Mayer. ``I want to meet with some of
the people who casually know him.''
</P>
<P>
   No interviews had been scheduled by Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple last week gave the school board
until July 19 to hire a superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Demps is the only one of four finalists identified by a
screening committee who did not later withdraw as a candidate. Even
so, several board members on Monday said he was not a shoo-in for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether a board majority would support Demps, board member
Lee Barnes said: ``It's real close.''
</P>
<P>
   Members said they had not formulated a plan in case they do not
reach agreement with Demps. That discussion will take place
Wednesday if necessary, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We better have something to give the court on Monday
morning,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee has said
it may recommend that it appoint an interim superintendent if the
board can't meet the court's deadline. The interim superintendent
would report to the DMC, not the school board. The board could then
continue its search for a permanent superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Board members on Monday also agreed to have district
representatives contact another finalist, retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Jay T. Edwards, to tell him he is not being considered for
superintendent at this time. Edwards withdrew last month and then
later said he was still interested in the post. He contacted
several board members in recent days expressing his interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an option right now,'' Mayer said. ``We're focusing
on Demps.''

PROTEST OVER MINORITY HIRING CLOSES INTERSTATE 70 IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- PROTEST-HIGHWAY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Janette Hill figured what she and several hundred
others did Monday morning was justified _ even if it meant blocking
busy Interstate 70 during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all else fails you have to try this,'' the former Kansas
City resident said as demonstrators gathered early Monday about
five miles west of downtown St. Louis. ``If political leaders can't
take control, people have to take control.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by chants of ``Shut It Down,'' the protesters did just
that. They shut down I-70 for nearly an hour because they said
there were too few minorities working on state highway projects in
the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 125 demonstrators and charged them with impeding
traffic and disobeying a police officer, a St. Louis police
spokesman said. Those arrested were released by noon. They face
August court appearances on the city charges.
</P>
<P>
   The list of persons arrested included the Rev. Al Sharpton, a
New York civil rights leader who headed the protest, and three
Missouri lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters streamed across the highway about 6:30
a.m., halting six lanes of eastbound and westbound traffic.
Supporters on a nearby overpass cheered them on.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said there were about 900 people at
the march. Organizers earlier said they hoped to attract 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop James C. Christmas of St. Louis said he brought several
hundred dollars in his pocket and was prepared to go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate America wants black folks to take a small piece of
the pie,'' Christmas said. ``I don't think we want a slice. We want
the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   But the morning rush hour tieup also triggered complaints from
some of those caught in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to get...out of my way so I can go to work,'' said
Gabrielle Dyer of O'Fallon, who works for TWA in St. Louis and was
one of the motorists who had to grind to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the way to go about it,'' Dyer said of
the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Many commuters used alternate routes because threats of a
protest had been publicized for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Hindmon, who heads a group that represents minority
contractors, said protesters want minority firms to account for 25
percent of state highway projects in the city of St. Louis and for
minorities to represent 35 percent of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Taegel of the Missouri Department of Transportation said
the statewide goal is to have 10 percent representation by
minority- and female-owned firms on state highway projects. Exact
figures vary depending on location and types of projects, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A $19 million highway and bridge project in St. Louis that drew
most of the protesters' ire has about 14 percent minority
representation, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, chief of staff for Gov. Mel Carnahan, defended
the state's highway practices and said Monday that contractors have
voluntarily agreed to boost minority participation on the St. Louis
project.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement for minority participation depends on location
of the project and what type of work is being done, Taegel said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Lewis &AMP; Clark Viaduct stretch of I-70 in
downtown Kansas City requires that 10 percent of the project's work
be awarded to disadvantaged business enterprises _ those owned by
minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the Bruce R. Watkins Drive project require 15
percent; many rural projects have no minority requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Several contractors in 1995 unsuccessfully sued the state
Highway and Transportation Commission. They said several firms on
the Watkins project were not legitimately allocating work to
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Malone, a board member of the Minority Contractors
Association of Greater Kansas City, said Missouri's highway
department has a ``very good program'' to include minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for people to feel like their community is
part of the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's protest followed a weekend of talks between state
officials and organizers of the rally. The talks were aimed at
reaching an agreement that could have prevented the blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters started gathering around 5 a.m. for Monday's rally.
Organizers hawked $5 ``Shut Them Down'' T-shirts. Sharpton and
others led protesters in a variety of chants while several
television helicopters swirled overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a moment we are going to move to the highway,'' said
attorney Eric Vickers, one of the leaders. ``We're going to shut it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later a group of marchers bolted down an on-ramp to I-70
and waved travelers to a halt. Dozens more protesters, many
shouting and waving their fists in the air, followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a message to the administration of the state,''
said state Sen. Jet Banks, a St. Louis Democrat and one of three
lawmakers arrested on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not getting our fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   The other lawmakers arrested were state Reps. Charles Quincy
Troupe and Paula Carter, both St. Louis Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 minutes after protesters took over the highway, St.
Louis Police Department Col. Everett Page approached the
demonstrators, many of whom were sitting on the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't move yourself from the highway you will be
arrested,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later Sharpton was the first to be led to a nearby St.
Louis law enforcement van as supporters cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were anything but a 1960s-style showdown between
police and marchers. Both sides were cordial. Some police officers
chatted easily with those they took into custody. Some callers to
St. Louis radio stations complained that police accorded protesters
kid-glove treatment.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Police Chief Ron Henderson defended his department's
handling of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some inconvenience to motorists, protesters made their
statement and no one was hurt, he said.

KC SOUTHERN INDUSTRIES GETS TAX-FREE STATUS FOR PLANNED SPINOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. on
Monday finally got official tax-free status for its planned spinoff
of its Janus and Berger mutual fund families into a separate public
company.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern also revealed that the new fund company
would be called Stilwell Financial Inc. Spokesman Bill Galagan said
the name honored the Kansas City financier who founded Kansas City
Southern Railway more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur E. Stilwell, a New York state native, moved to Kansas
City in 1888 and formed plans for the railroad. He even traveled to
Holland during an economic depression in the United States to raise
money to stretch the railroad to the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The approval Monday came from the Internal Revenue Service.
Kansas City Southern had sought IRS assurances that the spinoff
would not trigger taxes for its shareholders. Kansas City Southern
had been seeking the approval for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff plan calls for shareholders of Kansas City Southern
to receive shares of Stilwell Financial in the fourth quarter. A
date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Galagan said the distribution of shares couldn't proceed until
after Oct. 22. The plan approved by the IRS requires Kansas City
Southern to have owned Berger Associates Inc. for at least five
years. Kansas City Southern acquired majority ownership of Berger
in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's shares are expected to trade on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SV. Kansas City Southern
would continue to trade on the New York exchange under the ticker
symbol KSU.
</P>
<P>
   Stilwell Financial will own Janus Capital Corp., the $160
billion Denver-based mutual fund giant; Berger Associates, its $4
billion neighbor; Nelson Money Managers PLC in England; and 32
percent of the shares of DST Systems Inc. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern will continue to operate its railway
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS approval came the same day an article in Barron's
reported pleas from the Janus fund group to be spun off into a
separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Galagan said officials from Janus and Kansas City Southern spoke
about alternative plans for the spinoff at recent meetings in New
York. But he said the plan the IRS approved would be the plan the
company would use.
</P>
<P>
   ``This IRS ruling is worth between $2.5 (billion) and $5.5
billion to our shareholders'' because of its tax-free structure,
Galagan said. ``If someone could come up with another plan with
that kind of value to our shareholders ... we would do it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ For years, he was known as Ramon Martinez's little brother
_ the skinny kid who former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy
Lasorda thought was too little to be an effective starting pitcher
in the big leagues.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His frame was so slight, pitching coaches used to discourage him
from running between starts because they felt it would take too
much of a toll on his diminutive body.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez never got much bigger in physical stature. But
despite a 5-11, 170-pound frame, he's living quite large these
days. Ask anyone in Boston, and they'll tell you he's the biggest
star among the star-studded group gathered for tonight's 70th
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Martinez will be the American League's starting
pitcher at Fenway Park, where he is absolutely revered.
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling is the National League's starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a big deal for the fans,'' Martinez said.
``They're going to be very loud. I know my fans. They're probably
going to be banging on the walls and rooting my name. It's going to
be fun. I'm pretty sure we're going to see some crazy things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to pitch the way I always pitch, and I'm not going
to try to do anything special. It's a fun game, and that's the way
I'm going to approach it. With this being the last (All-Star) game
of the millennium and it being at Fenway, that makes it even more
special. It's a historic game, and I'm glad to take part in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of history, Martinez is chasing a piece of it this
season. He cruised to the All-Star break with a 15-3 record and has
a chance to become the major leagues' first 30-game winner since
Denny McLain won 31 games for Detroit in 1968. Dizzy Dean (1934)
was the last man to accomplish the feat before McLain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never won 20 games,'' said Martinez, who established a
career high with 19 victories in 1998. ``So I'm not even focusing
on 30. With all we've seen from Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Juan
Gonzalez, Manny Ramirez and a lot of the offensive guys, I think it
would be great to have something like that from the standpoint of a
pitcher's contribution to the game. Of course, 30 wins means
something to me. But it's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, things never have been easy for Martinez, who had
plenty of doubters when he was a minor-league pitcher in the
Dodgers organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people doubting me my whole life, people who didn't
know anything about the game,'' said Martinez, whom the Dodgers
traded to Montreal, which shipped him to Boston in a salary-dump
trade after he won the National League's Cy Young Award in 1997.
``But those people who doubted me have to be banging their heads
right now. To understand what I went through to get here, you would
have had to live it. That's the only way I can explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even doubted myself sometimes. I looked at myself in the
mirror and thought, `Maybe you're not good enough. Maybe you won't
make it.' But I remember going to Los Angeles in 1990 to visit my
brother, and I saw a lot of guys who didn't throw as hard as me.
Then I said to myself, `Why can't I do it?' I think all of that has
made me appreciate all of this more.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 2.10 ERA and 184 strikeouts in 132 innings this season,
Martinez is nowadays being compared to the likes of Nolan Ryan and
Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good start to the season,'' Martinez said. ``It's
been all roses for me so far, and I hope I can keep it up. I take a
lot of pride in being considered with guys like that. It's a great
compliment. But I don't think I belong in the same category with
those guys, because I haven't done what they've done yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez won't be able to say that if he wins 30 games. And
while it would be difficult to imagine the 27-year-old righthander
duplicating his win total in the second half of the season, it's
not out of the question. Even Martinez, whose humility is perhaps
his most charming quality, believes he has an outside chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have to go right,'' he said. ``If you get 35
starts in a season, it could happen. Why not? I don't know who's
going to get it, but I hope it's me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get close to 30 _ like 25 _ I'll be asking to pitch every
day. Realistically, if I have a shot at it, I could probably make
three starts in nine days. But I'm not going to be stupid about it
and risk an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan already has concerns about
Martinez's workload over the first half of the season. Martinez is
averaging an American League-high 112.59 pitches per game this
season, and he averaged 114.12 pitches last year, second only to
Roger Clemens in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   To buy Martinez a little time, Kerrigan plans to put him at the
end of the Red Sox's rotation after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get a little vacation there, a little break,'' Kerrigan
said. ``I think he needs it body-wise. We want to make sure he
comes out strong in the second half. We feel by giving him the
little vacation break, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has proved to be a slightly more productive pitcher in
the first half of the season throughout his career. Excluding 1999,
he is 46-20 with a 2.87 ERA before the All-Star break and 38-26
with a 3.11 ERA afterward. He's 7-11 with a 3.27 ERA in September,
including a 1-3 record with a 4.15 ERA last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a lot of pitches, has a lot of strikeouts, and he
may wear down more than the average guy,'' Kerrigan said. ``That's
why you really track his number of pitches and the number of days
he has between starts. I think he'll be OK in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he falls short of 30 wins, Martinez is in the process of
putting together one of the best seasons for a pitcher in the last
half of this century, which isn't bad for a short, skinny kid who
some thought wouldn't last in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought I could pitch in the big leagues, but I never
thought I'd be at the point I am now,'' Martinez said. ``I never
thought I'd be given a chance. But looking back, no one gave it to
me. I earned it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ So this is what being an All-Star is all about.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Wagner was introduced to a Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton shared an elevator with baseball's hottest pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   And Jose Lima was, well, Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attention might take some getting used to, but the
Astros' contingent of first-time All-Stars did their best Monday to
get acquainted with the new surroundings. They mingled with fellow
players, spoke with hordes of media, signed plenty of autographs
and stood in awe as they looked out at historic Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The experience, they say, will be hard to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner walked through a crowd of people at a downtown hotel,
holding his 11-month-old son, Will, in his arms. He entered a
hospitality room, where he was introduced to Hall of Famer Frank
Robinson. The Astros closer turned to his infant son and whispered,
``You'll never know whom you met.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk, whom Wagner watched play growing up, passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too scared to say anything,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton casually walked around the hotel lobby before entering
an elevator. Standing beside him was none other than Boston Red Sox
ace Pedro Martinez, tonight's American League starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like everybody else,'' Hampton said of his encounter
with Martinez. ``He's easy to talk to. He doesn't let the stardom
go to his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima spent the morning entertaining crowds of reporters who
gathered around the table where he sat. He spoke of his 13
first-half wins, of the Astros' chances in the final three months,
even about the state of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And that was only the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his arrival at Fenway Park, Lima was in the
outfield, cap turned backward, dancing to the beat of merengue
music blaring from the public address system.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Martinez, a fellow Dominican, approached Lima and
playfully bowed in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the attention,'' Lima said. ``I'm so excited. I don't
know what to say. It's going to hit me when I see everybody hitting
bombs out of the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of taking center stage in one of baseball's biggest
events slowly began to sink in for the Astros' representatives on
the plane ride from Kansas City to Boston late Sunday night. They
celebrated with a bottle of champagne as Jeff Bagwell shared
memories of his three previous All-Star appearances.
</P>
<P>
   As the group headed to baggage claim, autograph seekers spotted
Bagwell. Wagner just kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baggy was stuck back there,'' Wagner said. ``That's the price
of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was a particularly special day for Wagner, 27, who spent
the morning walking around Boston with his wife, Sarah, and family
members. Wagner has been in the majors full-time only three years,
but his wait to be an All-Star goes back further.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached his locker and saw his All-Star jersey hanging
up, Wagner had a tough time convincing himself he belonged. After
all, he never was an All-Star even in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was the coach, and he told me flat-out I was
terrible,'' Wagner said. ``I pitched, and that didn't work out.
Then he put me in right field; that's where you put all the shoddy
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different when your dad is the coach. He didn't
want all the other parents getting mad if he takes his son and not
the other guy's son. This is a little better than the ninth-grade
All-Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner watched his first major-league game at Fenway Park in
1992 _ Red Sox vs. Milwaukee Brewers _ while playing in the Cape
Cod League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking up the runway and seeing the Green Monster
and being in awe of the whole thing,'' Wagner said. ``Now that I'm
pitching here, it's not a big deal. If a guy hits a home run off
me, that ball is way out of there anyway. It doesn't matter how
high that fence is.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting players from the American League was the highlight
Monday for Wagner, Hampton and Lima. Tonight, they hope to enter
the game and help the National League to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to throw a strike and not embarrass myself,''
Wagner said.

 Midsummer Classic a dream for first-time All-Stars  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years ago, Jeff Zimmerman was living off baguettes
and cheap red wine, playing before 40 people a night in a country
that doesn't understand why it is poor etiquette to steal bases
when a team is down 15 runs.
</P>
<P>
   When you've played for the Montpellier Barracudas of France's
National Baseball League _ not to mention the Winnipeg Goldeyes of
the Northern League _ you appreciate a day like Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little bit intimidated,'' said Zimmerman, a Texas
Rangers reliever and an American League All-Star. ``I was going
down the elevator with Cal Ripken, and I wanted to introduce myself
to him, but I didn't. It was pretty full, and he was talking to
other people. I didn't want to interrupt his conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Stars aren't supposed to be sheepish. But Zimmerman is. So
is Kent Bottenfield. And Paul Byrd. And Jeromy Burnitz. And a host
of other first-time All-Stars who have come a long way in a short
time.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz, a Milwaukee Brewers outfielder, will be the National
League's starting left fielder Tuesday night at Fenway Park in
baseball's 70th All-Star Game. As he looked around a hotel ballroom
Monday, he saw a lot of stories that read something like his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we've got 15 or 16 first-time guys,'' said Burnitz,
who has been traded twice. ``I don't know _ is that normal?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, and it's even more dramatic than Burnitz estimated.
Twenty-four All-Stars have never participated in a midsummer
classic, including 17 on the National League roster. (The record
for first-time Stars is 30, in 1988.) Albert Belle, Barry Bonds,
Kevin Brown, Roger Clemens, Juan Gonzalez, Greg Maddux, Alex
Rodriguez, Frank Thomas and Mo Vaughn will have the same seat as
you _ at home, on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Brad Ausmus was last year, and every year before
that. The Detroit Tigers catcher is a veteran of five organizations
and has been asking Tigers coaches and veterans what to expect at
his first All-Star Game. This much he knows: ``It gives me a better
seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Twins third baseman Ron Coomer didn't believe it when
a club official told him he'd made the team. Coomer spent nine
years in the minor leagues and is with his fourth organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many miles I've logged on buses, but that's
the way it goes,'' Coomer said. ``Everyone's road to the big
leagues is a little different, and mine was just a little longer.
It makes you realize and appreciate how fun it is to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus and Coomer are having solid seasons, but they probably
owe their spots to the requirement that each club be represented.
Ausmus acknowledged as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why players get upset,'' he said. ``But if you
step back and look at the whole picture, that controversy brings
more attention to the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other unknown All-Stars who were not their
club's only selection. Burnitz has company in teammate Dave
Nilsson, an Australian catcher who is a first-timer in his 13th pro
season. Bottenfield, a pitcher with the St. Louis Cardinals, is a
teammate of Mark McGwire. Zimmerman has three other Rangers on the
roster; Byrd two other Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, fans are not the only star-gazers in Boston this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be professional about it,'' said Bottenfield, who
brought a video camera. ``But at the same time, it's like being a
kid. It's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, whose career record was 18-27 before this season,
leads the National League with 14 wins. He was released once,
signed a minor league contract three times and often considered
quitting. Since making the All-Star team, he said, he's been
congratulated by general managers who once gave up on him. ``I
guess I made a mistake,'' one told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an ordinary person; playing baseball is the only
difference between me and somebody else,'' Bottenfield said. ``I
know it can go as quickly as it came. I know how fast it can leave.
The talent is too good inside and outside this room. Guys could
beat you into the ground and you could never come back up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, Bottenfield was teammates with Jose Lima, the
Houston Astros right-hander who went 8-16 with a 6.24 earned run
average in parts of three seasons with the Tigers. Pitchers like
himself and Lima, Bottenfield said, were taught to throw hard and
didn't have success until they learned to back off, change speeds
and locate their pitches better.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who is 13-4, enjoyed four bottles of champagne (the small
kind, he said) with his fellow Astros All-Stars on the flight to
Boston Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Detroit, I never thought I was going to be at this
point, being an All-Star,'' Lima said. ``I've come a long way.
That's the biggest (story) in Detroit right now: I can't believe
they traded Lima.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Atlanta must have the same trouble believing their club
let Byrd get away on waivers. The Phillies became his fourth
organization when they claimed him last August, and the
right-hander has gone 16-7.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, Byrd said, that players often get labels they
can't shake. His success, and that of fellow first-time/long-road
All-Stars, makes him wonder how many more potential All-Stars are
never discovered.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also evidence of just how unpredictable things can be
in baseball. Because if the Bottenfields and Byrds can dress next
to the Griffeys and Ripkens, just about anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows that as long as you have a uniform,'' Byrd said,
``you always have a chance.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BOSTON _ On good knees, Mike Hampton Sr. might have won.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the father of Astros All-Star pitcher Mike
Hampton has bad knees _ quite the contrary, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always used to challenge my dad, but I never beat him in a
race until I was 16,'' said Mike Jr., whose football coaches at
Crystal River High in Florida clocked him at a sizzling 4.45 in the
40-yard dash. ``My dad can run. He's a great athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Mike Sr.'s youngest son, Cody, continued the long
family tradition by challenging his father to a footrace as they
were sightseeing near Fenway Park on Sunday night, Mike Sr.'s knees
still were wobbly from the first commercial flight of his life
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to cheat at the start, but I'm 46, and I could have
gone my whole life without that airplane ride,'' said Mike Sr., who
previously has gotten in his car and driven up to 37 hours to watch
Mike Jr. play ball. ``I couldn't eat; I couldn't do anything on
that flight. I hated every minute of it scared to death. When they
told us it was going to last two hours and 40 minutes, I was
counting the minutes off one by one.''
</P>
<P>
   But a promise is a promise. Especially the ones you make to your
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone that if Mike ever made it to the All-Star
Game, I'd fly to wherever it was,'' Mike Sr. said. ``They almost
had to drag me onto that plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton indeed has made it. But it hasn't been with much
fanfare or noise.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Monday when the world's media gathered to visit
with the National League All-Stars, there were more than 30
reporters watching an empty chair _ jockeying for position in front
of the seat that belonged to St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the adjacent seat, Hampton sat looking wide-eyed
and in awe of it all, with never more than four or five reporters
talking to him. Most often, it was just one or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried I'd be sitting here by myself,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   He joked about how when he and Astros closer Billy Wagner walked
through a hotel lobby Monday morning with Arizona ace Randy
Johnson, the fans thought Johnson had brought his kids with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like, `Daddy, can we get some candy?''' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   For Hampton, this All-Star experience isn't about pounding his
chest, signing autographs or acting too good for it all, like Big
Mac did, for example, never showing for Monday's mixer with the
media.
</P>
<P>
   It's about hearing the screams on the other end of the telephone
line when he called home and told his mother and father he had made
the All-Star team. It's about all those days when he was the one
challenging his father to a footrace, going to the park to play
catch, sharing a dream with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bruised and bloody a lot trying to keep up with my
dad,'' Hampton said. ``And then when I got home, my mom would clean
me up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about seeing the looks on his parents' faces when he walked
into their hotel Monday and was an NL All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have a real close-knit family,'' Hampton said. ``We
support each other, and it's always been that way. My dad has
always been the one that could do anything. I used to ask him,
`Hey, let's play tennis.' And when you go out there, he plays
great. It's the same in basketball, anything. He's just got a lot
of ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many dads, Mike Sr. often dreamed about his son making it
to a stage such as this one. But who knew Mike Jr. would be among
McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a hillbilly from Tennessee,'' Mike Sr. said. ``We
never had a whole lot growing up. And when we moved to Florida, I
pretty much had to work to help out. I just can't believe all this
is happening for Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sr. married young and was just 19 when he and Joan Hampton
had Mike Jr. He coached his son in Little League and high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Mike and I grew up together,'' Mike Sr. said. ``We
were strict on him and always wanted Mike to be respectful of
people and do the right thing. But a lot of times we were just two
kids competing with each other. He'd come home from school and
always want to go out and play ball. I did, too. This is like a
dream seeing him here.''
</P>
<P>
   But whose dream is it? Mike Sr.'s or Mike Jr.'s?
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this is they're here to watch me,''
Hampton said. ``It wouldn't be the same if they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bad part about it all comes Wednesday morning. Mike Sr.
has to get back on an airplane and fly home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care much for looking at stuff getting smaller
under my feet,'' Mike Sr. said. ``And I wouldn't mind if I never
rode in an airplane again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he won't have to _ for a while, anyway. Next year's
All-Star Game is in Atlanta, an easy drive from Orlando. But then
there's the 2001 game. In Seattle.

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Sometimes, it's self-serving when golfers
predict gloom and doom about how tough a course will play. When
they finish with a decent score, it makes them look all the more
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the British Open, which begins Thursday at
Carnoustie, forecasts of bogeymania are a case of the truth being
too obvious to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie is so nasty that players are saying an aggregate
score of 300 probably will be competitive Sunday afternoon. That's
4-over-par 75 on each day. The last time 300 won the Open
Championship was 1925, when Jim Barnes shot that number at
Prestwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course is great,'' Steve Elkington said, ``as long as
it's a par-76.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, par will be 71, and nobody is expecting to beat it over 72
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it blows hard, I don't know,'' Elkington said. ``They may
have ruined the course. It's a really great course. But you've got
fairways that are 19 yards wide. It's playing to 7,361 yards with
the potential to play a lot longer with the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Sunday, they can take all the red (under-par) numbers and
throw them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, these comments came Monday, a day that was
picture-perfect for Houston and virtually unmatched by Scottish
standards. A light breeze, sunshine and temperatures in the 70s
made scoring as easy as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tight fairways, knee-length rough and sloping greens all
had players wondering what things will look like by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two holes, I felt like it was such a claustrophobic
course,'' Lee Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champion, said. ``The
fairways just aren't very wide. And if you're in the rough and try
to advance the ball, you can just get deeper and then you're
looking at a really big number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par will be a great score. And I think higher than that will
win. And that's in good conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course really will beat up guys who are on the edge (of
playing mediocre). I think this is the first time you'll hear guys
saying the British Open is more unfair than the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfair'' is a word used cautiously by golfers. Everybody plays
the same course. So nothing should be viewed as unfair, in some of
their minds. But several fairways at Carnoustie are less than 20
yards wide at the landing area. And they get even narrower for
longer hitters. With few of the fairways level, moguls can kick a
ball 10 or 15 yards in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got 470-yard par-4s where even a drive straight down
the middle doesn't end up in the fairway,'' Janzen said. ``That's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rough is severe. The club at Carnoustie installed an
upgraded sprinkler system last year, and the rough has been watered
and fertilized. Even though it's weeds and heather, it still has
sprouted up knee-high in many places. And even the shorter ``first
cut'' is deep enough to require a search crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it in conditions that just don't exist,'' said U.S.
Open champion Payne Stewart. ``It was just a fabulous day for golf.
But the fairways are very narrow. And if you spend a lot of time in
the rough, you're not going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie has grown up and honed his game in Scotland.
He loves windy, misty, cold conditions. But even he knows
Carnoustie might be over the borderline beyond a fair test of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most difficult (course he could remember), by a
long, long way,'' said Montgomerie, who is fresh from a victory
last week at Loch Lomond. ``And that's on a glorious summer's day
with very, very light breeze. If it becomes a wind, you'll see
scores higher than we've ever, ever seen before in any British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does blow at all, the 300 mark _ people talk about the
300 mark not being (realistic) _ but it might well be, because I
don't think 4 over par is a bad round here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are seven par-4s that are 459 yards or longer. Many will
play into the teeth of the wind. There are predictions that ``a big
blow,'' as Tom Watson called it, will be heading into the area
Thursday. And then, life will be miserable for the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'll hit 3-iron, 3-wood and then hopefully I'll be
able to find it,'' Montgomerie said. ``Hopefully it'll be a brief
search.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of the harsh conditions, Elkington believes the
championship is up for grabs perhaps more than it ever has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tournament is going to be a lot closer event,'' he said.
``Everybody is in it. Somebody could be seven or eight shots back
on Sunday, shoot even-par and be right there at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big hitters have no advantage, because they'll be hitting
irons off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie agreed that accuracy will be more important than
length, even though the course is playing so long. Better to make
bogey from the fairway than double bogey from the deep rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to be champion here on Sunday evening,''
Montgomerie said. ``I feel as confident as anybody. But it's a
matter of being very, very patient.''

GRIFFEY WINS ALL-STAR HOMER CONTEST FOR THIRD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For several days, usually without prompting, Ken
Griffey Jr. had dropped hints about the All-Star Home Run Derby. He
hadn't been invited, he said. He wanted to bring his own batting
practice pitcher, he joked. His sore left knee might keep him out.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise, then, that when the contestants were first
announced Monday, Griffey's name was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   And it was no surprise that after testing the knee in batting
practice, the Mariners' center fielder took part anyway _ and won
it for the third time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe five minutes,'' he said, when asked how close he came to
not participating. ``It's still a little sore, so I've got to do
what's best for my team and the organization under the
circumstances. We've still got a chance in the second half to make
a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Griffey's team is the American League All-Stars,
and it's a group among whom he thrives. Even Griffey's opponent in
the final round, Jeromy Burnitz of the Milwaukee Brewers, knew he
was overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much knew I was going to lose,'' Burnitz said. ``He
got down to like one or two outs to stay in the round, and then hit
a bunch. You're talking about guys that can do it at will. And when
he had to, he did it. And he does that quite often.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey won last year's derby in Denver, silencing the boos he
got from the Coors Field crowd after first declining to take part.
He also captured the 1994 contest at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers
Stadium and became the first player to hit the warehouse at Oriole
Park at Camden Yards during the 1993 derby in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey was one out away from elimination in the first round
Monday. He had only one homer in his first 10 swings, but homered
twice to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, which also included Burnitz, Houston's Jeff
Bagwell and St. Louis' Mark McGwire, Griffey homered 10 times,
including his longest, a 460-foot blast to the wall behind the
center field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz homered twice in the last round, and Griffey had no
homers after three swings. But he homered on his next three swings,
the last a 438-footer over the bullpen in right field, to win.
</P>
<P>
   He had 16 homers overall, tied with McGwire for the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going out there and having a lot of fun, that's the
main thing,'' said Griffey, whose son Trey joined him on the field
during the contest. ``Going out there, putting on a show for the
fans, and watching Mark hit them 500 feet. You're getting them over
like 420, 430, and his balls are doing the postal service (thing),
just flying by you and dropping mail off at your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homers averaged 420 feet. McGwire's averaged 438, and
he hit most of his to left field. At Fenway Park, that means over
the Green Monster and onto Landsdowne Street and its mosh pit of
fans. McGwire set a single-round record with 13 homers in the first
round, one of which hit the lights and the last of which traveled a
Derby-long 488 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how many you hit,'' Griffey said. ``I think
the distance is the most important thing that the people
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire easily outshined his 1998 home run comrade, the Chicago
Cubs' Sammy Sosa. Sosa, who admitted, ``I'm not too good hitting
BP,'' had just one 371-foot homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enjoying it just like everybody else was,'' McGwire said
of his heroics. ``I was having fun. I love doing these things.
Earlier in my career, when I didn't accept myself as a home run
hitter, I didn't like doing these things. But now I enjoy them. I
think sometimes it's better than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire noted that last night's event was carried live, instead
of on tape delay as in the past. ``The home run,'' he said, ``has
really taken over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime American Leaguer, he also made a pitch to save Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baseball, and it's going to be sad to think that they're
going to have to make a new one here,'' McGwire said. ``It's hard
to think that they can't just redo this in a way where they can
make it more comfortable, more stands here. I thought they should
shut down Landsdowne Street and put bleachers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, McGwire's wish won't be granted; the Red Sox are hoping to
replace their 87-year-old home with a ``New Fenway'' by 2003. But
he gave Landsdowne Street an unforgettable farewell.

MYSTERIOUS RAMIREZ ON VERGE OF GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cleveland Indians slugger Manny Ramirez was accused of
using a corked bat during a May series against the New York
Yankees. No way, several Yankees argued, could Ramirez flick his
bat at an ankle-high pitch and send it to the stands with such
ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had Ramirez's bat checked, but nothing illegal was
found.
</P>
<P>
   One joke, however, that quickly made the rounds suggested
Ramirez's head, not his bat, was filled with cork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some people think that way of me, and there's nothing I
can do to change that,'' Ramirez said. ``I'm not someone who gets
involved in many serious things. I like to keep my life simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughable part of the bat incident is Ramirez's choice of
lumber changes from day to day and, sometimes, at-bat to at-bat.
Teammates have often had to persuade Ramirez to stop using their
bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever bat feels comfortable to him at that moment he
uses,'' Indians second baseman Roberto Alomar said. ``If it feels
good in his hands, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez is one of the most mysterious players in the game,
someone whose burgeoning talent has him on the verge of being
mentioned as the greatest run-producer in the majors these days.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, whose 96 RBI at the All-Star break have him on pace to
reach 178 this season, could challenge Hack Wilson's single-season
record of 191.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big reasons I don't like to do many interviews is
that I want to focus all my energies and concentrate fully on the
RBI record,'' Ramirez said. ``I want to give my all for that
record. I know I have a chance this year, and who knows, I may
never be in this position again.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, some wonder just how good Ramirez, who was born in
the Dominican Republic and moved to New York City at age 13, can
become. He has already hit 179 home runs and has 613 RBIs in his
barely 5-year-old career.
</P>
<P>
   Say one thing for Ramirez: He managed to concentrate on sports
while growing up in the Washington Heights section of New York, an
area where some youths head into a life of drugs and crime.
</P>
<P>
   It's also sometimes easy to forget how uncomfortable Ramirez is
with his English language skills. He's an introverted person who
seems to speak freely only in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny is a special talent,'' said Cleveland Manager Mike
Hargrove. ``Early in his career a lot was made about his lack of
concentration. But we're beyond that. I don't know why anyone
should be surprised by anything Manny does with the bat. And he's
also worked hard to make himself into one of the better defensive
right fielders in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his numbers seem to only be improving and his peak
seasons should arrive in the next six years or so, exactly where
Ramirez will wind up is mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just incredible, he's amazing,'' said former star
reliever Dennis Eckersley. ``He can become a monster in this game
if he keeps it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, ``He's just starting to
scratch the surface and come into his own. Who knows how good he
can become? He needs to continue what he's started over time.
That's what really separates the good ones from the great ones.''
</P>
<P>
   On the best hitting club in the majors, Ramirez stands out as
its biggest bopper. What remains unknown is where Ramirez fits in
among the Indians' best players.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong arguments, even within the Indians' clubhouse,
as to who Cleveland's MVP is in 1999. Some believe Kenny Lofton or
Alomar might be more vital to Cleveland's offensive dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always appreciated Manny's game and now that I see him
every day, I appreciate it more,'' Alomar said. ``He's an
unbelievable hitter and a real smart hitter. Maybe it doesn't come
across because he's a quiet guy. He's definitely the MVP of our
team and the entire league.''
</P>
<P>
   To back up that claim, consider that Ramirez missed nine games
in the first half because of either injury or suspension. The
Indians were 3-6 and averaged 4.6 runs per game in those games.
With Ramirez they are 53-25 and averaged 6.9 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers speak for themselves,'' said Baltimore pitcher
Mike Mussina. ``Mistake pitches to him mean nothing. He can hit
anything anywhere. You don't drive in that many runs waiting for
just center-cut fastballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, Ramirez came close to winding up with the Oakland
Athletics. The Indians and A's had agreed to a deal that would have
sent Ramirez to the A's in exchange for Eckersley. It was the A's
who vetoed the deal at the last minute, a prominent major league
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about that deal,'' Ramirez said. ``Who knows what
would have happened to me if I'd ended up in Oakland. Thankfully,
it didn't happen. To me, Cleveland is the best city to be playing
baseball in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who often shuns reporters, was the only American League
All-Star not to appear at the mandatory mass interview session
Monday. None of which came as a great surprise to any of those who
know the right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying he won't show,'' said Diamondbacks third baseman
Matt Williams, who played with Ramirez in 1997. ``He'll probably
show up (today), go 3 for 4 and win the MVP award and not even know
what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who missed his flight from Cleveland to Boston Sunday
night and then missed a few more Monday morning before finally
showing up, did make it to the afternoon workout.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Ramirez was making himself a thorn in the
side of Indians' management. Over a one-week stretch, Ramirez, who
turned down a seven-year, $56 million extension because he wanted
more, took batting practice while wearing spikes with messages on
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free me,'' ``Justice will be served,'' and ``Can't we all just
get along,'' were some of the messages. But it wasn't Ramirez who
wrote them. With Ramirez's blessing, a Cleveland clubhouse manager
was responsible. &QL;

CHANGE NOT ALWAYS FOR BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The elevator was filled with kids clutching autograph
books, and as the door opened, they sprinted into the lobby, hoping
to fill a few more pages.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the elevator, Ozzie Smith smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess they didn't know who I am,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like baseball in Boston, and no better way to
close the century than an All-Star Game at Fenway Park. If you look
closely, there's a striking juxtaposition at work, a contrast
between old and new, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   There is still some doubt whether baseball has truly entered a
renaissance period, but as you glance at the names assembled for
tonight's game, you need both hands and a couple of feet to count
potential Hall of Fame candidates.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder whether the new breed of dynamic athletes can save
the sport from all its peripheral problems. Or whether it has
thrown the game completely off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, the hitters are way ahead of the curve,'' Yankees
pitcher David Cone said. ``I just hope they raise the mound. It's
the least invasive change they can make to help the pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, Ozzie Smith was an All-Star just because of
his glove and Cal Ripken Jr. was in a class with Robin Yount and
Alan Trammell. Ripken is still here, but the bar has been raised.
Tonight, he will share a dugout with Derek Jeter and Nomar
Garciaparra. The talent level at shortstop has changed so
dramatically that Alex Rodriguez didn't even make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution exists at all positions except pitchers, and if
you think otherwise, please explain Jeromy Burnitz and his 38 home
runs in 1998. A plateau that Hank Aaron passed only nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came along, the amount of opposite-field home
runs was very few, the home runs to center field were very few and
the outside part of the plate was a safe place for pitchers to
go,'' Ripken said. ``That has all changed, and it's a matter of
bigger, stronger and faster. And I think it exists in all sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But has the change enhanced baseball? It is a touchy subject for
the suits that run the sport because offense means interest,
because last year's home run derby sparked the resurgence, and
really, who doesn't want to see Sammy Sosa bat in front of Mark
McGwire?
</P>
<P>
   Still, such tipping of the scales doesn't agree with everybody,
especially the purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look up at the scoreboard, and all the time, there are
five-run innings, seven-run innings, (scores like) 13-4, 12-11,''
Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the All-Star Game was a diversion, a showcase for hitters.
Once, the home run hitting contest was a nice quirk. Now, both are
reflective of a pervasive mentality, a game in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into the game, there weren't any weight rooms in
most of the ballparks,'' Cone said. ``George Brett never lifted a
weight. It was really frowned upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's hitters have learned to lift weights and retain their
flexibility. The strike zone and the ballparks are smaller. And the
average American League ERA is 5.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a five ERA when I came in, you were back down in
the minor leagues,'' Cone said. ``Now, you're an average pitcher.
And if you're in the mid-fours, you're doing pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   A hitter's game, from statistics to mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you even come close to hitting anybody, and guys are
stepping from the dugout, guys are wanting to fight,'' Tampa
reliever Roberto Hernandez said. ``Things have changed a lot in the
past few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, you will see Fenway Park in all its glory. You will see
the Green Monster and a pitching mound once used by Cy Young. You
will be flooded with memories and escorted to the past.
</P>
<P>
   A past quickly buckling under to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Once, John Kruk was smoking a cigarette outside Veterans Stadium
in Philadelphia. He was approached by a woman appalled at his vice,
given his status of professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, I'm not an athlete,'' Kruk said. ``I'm a baseball
player.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, times have changed. &QL;

 THE VIEW FROM DIMAGGIO DECK  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Weird town.
</P>
<P>
   Whattaya mean, what do I mean? Look around.
</P>
<P>
   We try to honor Joe DiMaggio, and his lawyer bullies us. Tells
us we can't do anything without the lawyer's permission. And
whatever we name after DiMag had better be huge, like SFO or the
Bay Bridge or Willie Brown's ego.
</P>
<P>
   Look, Mr. Lawyer, if we name the airport after a famous local
Italian American sports hero named Joe who launched flying objects,
it might not be DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   I say we pick the DiMaggio tribute we deem appropriate and dare
Mr. Lawyer to take legal action. If a judge sentences everyone in
San Francisco to a month in jail for misdemeanor mis-honoring of a
local hero, Terence Hallinan will have us all back on the street
and into a diversion program by noon.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, we can't place a monument to DiMaggio at the airport
because the airport is lost, like Atlantis. I tried to find it
Monday, and all I could see was a huge cloud of construction grit.
Maybe we should name SFO after Dusty Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Or, because it's such a massive construction project, name it
Carol Doda International.
</P>
<P>
   In defiance of Mr. Lawyer, Lou Bristol named his rooftop the Joe
DiMaggio Memorial Sun Deck, and from that perch Lou has noted a
fashion epidemic in Joe's old 'hood. In the wake of Saturday's USA
soccer win, the Brandi Chastain shirtless look, jog bra only, is
sweeping the Marina.
</P>
<P>
   THE CITY continues to march to its own drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Our most famous works of art, on my current list, are: a
rejected foot, a fiberglass doggie head now as protected as the
statue of David and an erased drawing that got defaced with a cat.
</P>
<P>
   The cat project reinforces this feeling: I don't understand art,
but I  &UR; really  &LR; don't understand artists.
</P>
<P>
   Circa 1953, artist Robert Rauschenberg asked artist Willem De
Kooning for a piece of De Koonig's art, to be erased. De Kooning
sent a drawing, which Rauschenberg erased, creating a smudged piece
of paper titled ``Erased De Kooning,'' which now hangs in SFMOMA,
inspiring blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   Many art fans were livid at Rauschenberg's erasing of a great
artist's art, but most of us worked through our grief and anger
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not local ``plop'' artist Richard List, who has plopped bicycles
and toilets in public spaces around the Bay. Last week, List and an
accomplice sneaked a cat doll into MOMA and Velcroed it to the wall
just above ``Erased De Kooning,'' then ran like hell.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for MOMA told me she was unaware of the prank.
Thus, SFMOMA has erased all memory of List's art work (``Defaced
Erased De Kooning''?), which means that the work is now a double
negative and twice as valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In other local bizarre artsy news: Del Close was co-founder here
(with Alan Marsten) of the Committee, legendary '60s improv group.
He later moved to Chicago, and he died last March. Close willed his
skull to Chicago's Goodman Theater, where it will play the role of
Yorick in productions of ``Hamlet.'' Or, says a friend of Close,
the skull will ``just lie around in some desert scene. He wasn't
fussy.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing Close didn't leave his skull to San Francisco. It
would be kicked around art committees and Board of Supervisors
debates until it gathered moss and lost face.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who needs a skull? Tony Bennett left us his heart, and
Tony's lawyer isn't trying to tell us how to display it.
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST we're hip. Antonio Lara saw a panhandler at Market and
Van Ness with a sign: ``WWW.SPARECHANGE.COM.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is one city that does not discriminate against blind
drivers. R. McLeod notices that the drive-up window at the
Serramonte Mall's Wells Fargo has instructions in braille.
</P>
<P>
   NO OPINION goes unchallenged here. Manuel Gutierrez of Southern
California contests my claim that San Francisco lags behind L.A. in
cutting-edge-obnoxious/ostentatious cell-phone use.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez recently landed at Montana-Baker-Doda-Doda Airport and
ducked into a rest room. In the next stall, a man on cell was
loudly berating his limo service for not picking him up.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gutierrez dropped in at a North Beach flower shop, where
the young clerk chatted on her cell in lieu of acknowledging
Manuel's presence or offering her assistance, except to take his
money.
</P>
<P>
   Then at Roma on Columbus, Manuel sat near a man who was
operating, simultaneously, the morning newspaper, a cup of coffee,
a lap-top computer and, of course, a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your heart out, Vishnu, you four-handed underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma man was demonstrating the new standard for
coordination, which in simpler times was defined as the ability to
walk and chew gum at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez quickly fled back to the bosom of normalcy in Los
Angeles. (Legal disclaimer follows.) Which is not to imply that
bosoms in L.A. are normal.

 WHITE SUPREMACIST SUSPECT FOLLOWED PATH TO EXTREMISM  &HT;     By JAXON VAN DERBEKEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For years, Benjamin Matthew Williams drifted,
trying to find his place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Navy and was stationed in Washington, then left a
fiancee and their young daughter to go to Idaho, where he attended
college and soon joined what he later called a religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   He left the cult devastated, only to develop a fascination with
the white supremacy movement, eventually going so far as to mail
bizarre, hate-filled reading materials to friends for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Williams and his younger brother, James, are being held
in Shasta County Jail, suspected of slaying a gay couple near
Redding, Calif., and torching three synagogues in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Shasta County Sheriff's Department is expected to file a
homicide case against the brothers with the district attorney's
office as early as Wednesday, at which time prosecutors will decide
whether they have enough evidence to prosecute the pair on two
counts of murder.
</P>
<P>
   As a task force of federal and local authorities continues to
investigate the Sacramento arson fires, friends and former
acquaintances described the older Williams brother's gradual
descent from religious seeker to right-wing zealot under
investigation in hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he felt lost, really. We all felt lost,'' said former
fellow cult member Michael Godbold.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 31, was deeply religious, strictly adhered to a
vegetarian diet and regularly attempted to purify his body and
soul, Godbold said. Godbold described him as both charismatic and
gullible and said he dominated his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Godbold said he helped recruit the older Williams into the
Living Faith Fellowship in Moscow, Idaho, where Williams studied
engineering and biology at the University of Idaho from 1993 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship was described as a cult by former members, who
said that the leader, Dr. Karl Barden, preached a fundamentalist
Christian gospel. The group had as many as 500 members who attended
twice-weekly services and gave 231/3 percent of their income,
Godbold said.
</P>
<P>
   Barden also allegedly kept files of embarrassing facts on
members, cut them off from family members and forced them to endure
arranged marriages.
</P>
<P>
   It was as part of a recruiting questionnaire, which Godbold
claimed was used against members who later broke with the group,
that Williams revealed that he had briefly served in the Navy and
had a daughter who lived in another state.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams heard allegations that the leader of the sect was
keeping files on members of the group, he quit almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Barden and other members of the group did not return calls
seeking comment but have insisted in earlier published accounts
that their group demands devotion from its members.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in a local newspaper a month after he
left the group, Williams described how he was taken in: ``You are
young, your mind isn't fully formed, you are a long ways from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Godbold, who left the group before Williams, helped his friend
get out. Afterward, Williams was devastated, Godbold said. He cried
for hours and talked about bombing the church and assassinating
Barden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was completely lost,'' said Jeff Monroe, another friend
from Pullman, Wash., just across the state line from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Friends tried to soothe Williams, but it was not long before
Williams found the King James Only movement on the Internet,
Godbold recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The King James Only movement is an independent Baptist church
that shares fundamentalist Christian values and believes that the
King James Bible is the definitive version.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a true believer,'' said Monroe. ``Whatever he (Williams)
is involved in, he is involved in absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe said that in the summer of 1995, not long after leaving
the fellowship, Williams also threw himself into a one-man tax
crusade, explaining how people could avoid paying taxes based on
loopholes in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   From taxes came politics during what Monroe called a ``six-month
developmental period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just became very insistent that we all join his little tax
revolution,'' Monroe said. ``He became extremely intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax thing was a stepping stone to the very
ultra-conservative. ... He was so far out there. He became very
interested in militia-type information.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Williams was struggling financially, Monroe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a long, long series of bad luck,'' he said. ``It
got so bad, Matthew just started selling off some of his stuff. He
sold his computer, stereo, near everything he had. The tax thing
became all-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief period, James Williams visited his older brother,
apparently wanting to get away from their parents. But James
Williams soon confided to Monroe that he wanted to get away from
his domineering brother, and he returned to California.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Benjamin Williams left Idaho, telling Godbold that he
wanted a better climate to grow his edible plants, with which he
had become fascinated. Godbold figured he was just homesick.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before he left, there were signs that Williams'
fascination with the white supremacy movement had become far more
serious, Godbold said. Williams would go on ``verbal fishing''
expeditions, making negative references about interracial couples.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe said Williams initially encountered the racist philosophy
while searching the Internet for health miracles ranging from
fungus teas to eye exercises that were supposed to improve vision.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Williams called Godbold to ask about a mutual
friend. When Godbold told Williams the friend was gay, Williams
became extremely upset.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Christmas package full of hate literature that
Williams sent from his home address in Palo Cedro, Calif., outside
Redding, to mutual friends. His friends showed Godbold the letter,
which began with a ``Merry Christmas'' greeting, then explained
that he was including reading materials about the ``TRUTH.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspected that was where Matthew was heading, to be honest
with you,'' said Monroe. ``I hoped I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Monroe said he feared Williams was heading on an apparently
self-destructive, racist mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, there was no authority I could call _ he hadn't
done anything,'' Monroe said. ``But,'' he said, ``I figured the
next time I'd hear about Matthew, he'd end up in the media having
killed somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard, it was like, `Oh my God, I hoped that would
never happen.' ''

TALK OF A NEW FENWAY THE TALK OF THE ALL-STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Upstairs, Bud Selig and John Harrington were pitching
their latest thoughts on a new Fenway Park, claiming a new Fenway
would be a ``classic new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, on the field, those National Leaguers making their
first visit were selling nothing but words from the heart. To
players like Tony Gwynn, Larry Walker, Jay Bell, and Billy Wagner,
Fenway Park is simply a classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to play here with all the legends who've played
in this park,'' said Rockies slugger Walker. ``It's going to be an
evening never to forget . . . everything from taking a swing at the
Monster to actually seeing how short the dugout (roof) really is,
whether I'll bang my head if I jump up or how tiny the (visitors')
clubhouse really is. I've heard a lot of things about that
clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was surrounded by vivid sketches, a colorful model
drawn to scale, artistic renderings _ as he said ``Camden Yards was
the inspiration of all the classic new ballparks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn virtually jumped off the bus that had brought him and his
NL teammates to the ballpark ``so I could go out and see Fenway for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   All day long, Gwynn had searched for that first view, opening
the drapes in his room at the Westin Hotel early in the morning
``and I was looking around to see if I could see Fenway. You know
that sign that's over the left-field wall? I was looking for that
sign. But I couldn't find Fenway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' Sammy Sosa talked about when he was signed by the Red
Sox in 1994 but was nullified because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great, it's great here, Fenway, but I'd never change this
ballpark for Wrigley Field,'' said Sosa, the response virtually
jumping from his lips and heart. ``Wrigley Field is the best to me.
But Fenway, it is a great ballpark, too. Both are tradition
ballparks . . . ballparks that bring a lot of memories back from
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Classic new'' ballparks perhaps may never inspire the response
given by Matt Williams of the Diamondbacks, even though Williams
visited Fenway during his one season with the Indians in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``First thing, I'm going to try and pepper some balls off that
wall out there and have some fun,'' said Williams. ``But most of
all, you just walk out onto the field here at Fenway and you see so
much tradition. You're thinking, `A lot of great players played on
that same field you're on now.' It's unique . . . the uniqueness of
this place is the big draw.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, in other ballparks, baseball calls on mascots,
fireworks, and diversions to attract fans. But Boston is Boston and
baseball is enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson, formerly of the Mariners, spoke
of one reaction he always had when pitching at Fenway. ``Any time a
ball went over my head, I always thought the ball was going off The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the history of the game. If you'd come down to the
basement of my house you'd see how much baseball history I have
there. Did you know Kid Nichols won 30 games seven years in a row _
and going into a certain park, I realize the players who've played
in those parks. I remember coming into Fenway the first time and
just thinking of all the great players who've played on this
field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I came to my very first (major league) ball
game,'' recalled the Astros' Wagner, ``I had a day off in the Cape
Cod League and came up and watched the Red Sox. You couldn't help
but fall in love with this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner remembers ``walking up the runway . . . seeing the lights
. . . the Green Monster popping up right in front of you. I
remember saying, `This is the big leagues. This is what it's all
about. I always said since that day when I first came here that
Fenway was my favorite ballpark.''

EVEN PLAYERS AWED BY CONSTELLATION OF TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They worry about the game when they get to the game.
The All-Star player quickly learns that it is the totality of the
entire experience that really matters.
</P>
<P>
   So while Gary Sheffield, Kirby Puckett, and Roberto Alomar might
remember the 1993 All-Star Game in Baltimore because each hit a
home run, Mike Piazza will always remember that night in Baltimore
because of a conversation in the players's lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the coolest thing,'' recalls Piazza, who can usually
make his All-Star reservations on the first day of spring training.
``I was walking across the clubhouse and I saw Mark Grace, John
Kruk, Darren Daulton, and Ryne Sandberg sitting in the lounge. I
had no intention of joining them. I was a rookie. I wasn't going to
walk right in there. I would have felt out of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the talented rookie was en route to a .318, 35,
112 season and was clearly one of the great hitting prospects
baseball had seen in years. He was a rookie. He knew his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Grace yelled at me to come in and sit down,'' continues
Piazza, who will be batting seventh in Bruce Bochy's National
League lineup against Pedro Martinez. ``I couldn't believe it. It
was like being promoted. I felt accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   That was six All-Star Games ago. Mike Piazza has established
hmself as a serious candidate to be known as the greatest hitting
catcher of all-time. He is the perennial fan choice as the National
League catcher. And there just might be a rookie on his team who
would be equally flattered if Piazza were to allow
(itals)him(unitals) to join in what we might call the reindeer
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so looking forward to meeting some of these guys and just
being on the same team as them,'' gushes Cincinnati's Casey, the
young first baseman who arrives here hitting .371. ``You're talking
about future Hall of Famers, the best players in the game. I'm
really looking forward to having a conversation with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For most players, this is what the All-Star experience is all
about. Be it baseball, basketball, football, or hockey, the thing
that turns on these great players is their own company. In some
cases, it is renewing old acquaintance. In others it is satisfying
curiosity. The great ones really want to know what makes the other
great ones tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting some of the young guys,'' says
the ever-surprising Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Tony Gwynn to turn the idea on its head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see how they go about their business,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has struggled these past two months with a sore calf and
will not be participating in this year's game. But even though he
can't play, he is going to get himself yet another All-Star
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come full cycle,'' he says. ``In my first All-Star Game
(San Francisco, 1984), I was the youngest player on the team. In my
last two, I've been the oldest (that was before 40-year old Harold
Baines was named to replace Jose Canseco). In that first one, I was
the one asking all the questions. Where do you go? How do you
dress? What are you supposed to say? Now it's the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   No National Leaguer more appreciates the uniqueness of Fenway,
and it's just not fair that he can't get at least one at-bat here
because he'll never have another (A Padres-Sox Series before they
tear down Fenway? In your dreams). He'll just have to satisfy
himself simply by hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I like best,'' he claims. ``I just love the
atmosphere of the clubhouse in an All-Star Game. The laughing. The
joking. Talking to guys. That's what makes this great.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing it here in what Boston sports broadcaster Clark Booth long
ago labeled our ``baseball basilica'' makes the 1999 game even
nicer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember first seeing that logo on the wall last year and
finding out that the game would be in Boston,'' points out
Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff, a 33-year-old first-time All-Star. ``I
thought, `That's a great place for the All-Star Game to be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there's no better place, for no other ballpark offers
the range of interesting possibilities Fenway can provide. With
good luck the game will include a line-drive single off the wall
that would have been a home run in 29 other parks; a lazy fly ball
that just drops over the wall close to the foul pole that would not
have been a home run anywhere else; a titanic blast high over the
screen that invites speculation as to just how far it really did
go; a shot down the right-field line that eludes the right fielder
and rolls to the visiting bullpen for a triple, or even an
inside-the-park home run; a ball ricocheting off the scoreboard
ladder; a ball hit toward the bullpen area that allows the right
fielder to make a bring-'em-back-alive grab, perhaps accompanied by
a backward tumble into the pen itself; a ball rolling back and
forth inside the left-field door; a ball to the triangle, and a
couple of pop fouls that would have been outs in a ballpark with
normal foul territory, and which are then followed by a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply,'' maintains Cal Ripken Jr., ``a place like Fenway
Park is a very special place to play in and when you take the best
players in the National League and the American League and put them
in this park, it is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. is baseball's resident All-Star Game elder
statesman. This is his 17th game, and his 16th consecutive game as
a starter. He's had some nice All-Star Game moments. Yet to him,
the best thing about being an All-Star is something none of us will
ever see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown in this experience,'' he explains. ``In my first
game (Comiskey Park, 1983), I didn't know how to act. I couldn't
speak to veteran players. I spoke when spoken to. I played the
rookie role. Now what I love best is the clubhouse experience. I
like batting practice. I like the game. But the best part is just
being in the clubouse and talking to the other guys. There is great
excitement for me in just being assembled as a team for that brief
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this context, they're all just big, impressionable kids. ``So
I'm on the elevator,'' beams Gwynn, ``and who gets on? Randy
Johnson!''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Tony. You sure it wasn't a case of mistaken identity?

GWYNN'S PRESENCE A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Tony Gwynn was dressed like a spokesman _ gray
double-breasted suit, gold tie, commemorative blue All-Star Game
cap _ as he gently picked apart Juan Gonzalez's decision to boycott
the game because the fans didn't elect him as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have handled it a little differently,'' Gwynn said.
``By being here, I think you show the fans that you appreciate it.
If you don't want to go, you can say you're hurt or whatever, but
when you flat-out say that you don't want to go unless you're
starting, I think it leaves a bad taste in fans' mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is unable to play because of a calf injury that has kept
him out seven of the past eight weeks, but he came to Boston anyway
to represent the Game and serve as interpreter for the young
players who have made this All-Star Game one of the more anonymous
ones in recent memory. A combined 24 players are making their first
appearance, including 17 on the National League roster.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 39, is 18 hits shy of 3,000 in 18 seasons with the San
Diego Padres, who have returned to volatile mediocrity after last
year's World Series appearance. This is his 15th All-Star selection
(only Cal Ripken, with 17, has more among this year's Stars), and
he has seen the game evolve from a hardcore sporting event into an
entertainment spectacle in which the players are used as marketing
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is uneasy about some of the changes _ ``They've got us
dressed up in all kinds of things now,'' he said before putting on
the National League's gaudy two-toned costume during Monday's EA
Sports All-Star Workout Day _ but he is still enthusiastic for the
game and the opportunity to impart his wisdom to the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my job here is to plant the seed and let these guys
know that it's a great honor to make the All-Star Game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the newcomers, being on the All-Star team seemed
scarcely real. ``I'm still taking it all in,'' said Phillies
catcher Mike Lieberthal, who earned a spot by hitting .308 with 18
homers and 61 RBIs in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal was standing alone near the visitors dugout in the
late afternoon, ignored by a 10-deep media horde that ringed the
field. He was staring up at the Prudential building beyond right
field, looking like someone who had wandered in from Kenmore Square
and was surprised to find that he could go on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought about being on the same roster with Gwynn,
he laughed: ``You mean, besides being afraid to talk to him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through this so many times _ as a young player you
don't want to come off as too cocky and say the wrong thing,'' said
Lieberthal, who grew up in Southern California. ``God, I watched
him all the time in high school. I'm just going to take it in and
watch him. If you get a chance to talk to him, that's great, but
it's just great to be here with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Casey, the 25-year-old Reds first baseman who is tearing up
the National League, said of Gwynn: ``Oh, man, I just idolize that
guy.'' Casey was wandering around the field with a video camera,
and as he whirled it around he found himself staring at Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you've had that camera on all day long,'' said Gwynn, who
was making his way to the batting cage. ``It's time to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has won the batting title eight times. He has hit over
.300 in 16 consecutive seasons. He was recently named as one of the
top 100 players of the century and is a certain Hall of Famer. But
doesn't believe he should be mentioned in the same breath with some
of the all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I belong on the same list with Willie Mays, Ted
Williams, and Hank Aaron and all those great players,'' he said.
``The fact that I'm on that list, I'm honored. I never saw Ted
Williams play, but I read a lot of books and talked to a lot of
people, and in my mind there's no way, there is just no way I
belong on the same field.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's contribution to the game, he said, is ``to put the bat
on the ball; that's what I do.'' He said he has barely thought
about reaching 3,000 hits because of his recent injuries, but said
it would be ``a validation'' of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn seemed almost baffled by Gonzalez's decision to take a
pass on the game. ``The negative of that is that it's not going to
be any easier to be voted in,'' he said. ``You can hit 50 home runs
by the break, and it's still going to be one of those things that
fans are going to remember. I wish he would have reconsidered.''

NO ROOM FOR ALL THESE STARS TO ROAM AT ONCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Nomar? Derek? ARod? Omar? No easy choices exist at
shortstop in the American League, either for fans voting or a poor
manager trying to fill out his All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Garciaparra, Jeter, Rodriguez, and Vizquel are all great
players, and the first three appear to be heading to Cooperstown in
20 years (sorry, Omar, but you started your march a bit late). They
are all star shortstops, but four into three doesn't go. But before
any of them start wallowing in self-pity, they should hear about
Hank Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1935. When the AL assembled its team for the third
All-Star Game, Greenberg, the Tigers' first baseman, was leading
the league in home runs, RBIs, hits, and doubles. He was second in
runs scored. His RBI total was 103.
</P>
<P>
   So where was Hank Greenberg during the All-Star Game? Home. Lou
Gehrig was the starting first baseman. Jimmie Foxx, the third base
starter, would serve as a potential backup at first.
</P>
<P>
   There was a surprising lack of outcry, although the Associated
Press did observe that Greenberg was ``strangely missing from the
All-Star ranks at a time when a couple of his long-range blows
would be most welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL really did not need him. Gehrig was 0 for 3 with a run
scored. Foxx had a three-run homer. The AL won, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Now move up 20 years. As good as our aforementioned shortstops
might be, they don't represent the best glut of talent at any one
position. Consider what took place in the National League from 1954
through 1971, when true giants (including one Giant) roamed the
outfield for the Senior Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, and Frank Robinson
all either solidified themselves as major leaguers or entered the
league in a three-year period from 1954 through 1956. These men
would combine for 12,997 hits, 2,241 home runs, 7,317 RBIs, and
7,481 runs scored over their careers, each breezing into the Hall
of Fame. But when the All-Star Games came, someone had to sit.
Occasionally, someone even had to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's competition.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was the first of the four to start an All-Star Game. He
was the starting left fielder as a rookie in 1956. Mays couldn't
beat out Cincinnati center fielder Gus Bell. Aaron and Clemente had
to yield to Stan Musial in right.
</P>
<P>
   Mays received the first of his 18 All-Star starts (covering 15
seasons) in 1957. Aaron got his first start the same year. Clemente
didn't start until 1961 because, well, because he was a right
fielder and so was Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years there was a great deal of juggling. Clemente
replaced Aaron in a game. Aaron replaced Clemente. Robinson
replaced Clemente. Aaron replaced Mays. Clemente replaced Mays.
Robinson bounced around, playing left, right, and even first base,
entering the second game in 1959 as a replacement for Musial at
first.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1961, the right field starting spot became a
battleground. It went like this: 1961 _ Clemente. 1962 _ Clemente.
1963 _ Aaron. 1964 _ Clemente. 1965 _ Aaron. 1966 _ Clemente. 1967
_ Clemente. 1968 _ Aaron. That was the start of a major Aaron run
that reduced an exasperated Clemente to a substitute through 1971,
his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a starter in 1957, became the odd man out. He didn't
start another All-Star Game until 1966, by then an American
Leaguer, having been traded to Baltimore in one of the worst front
office blunders in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   One fact emerges from all this: Willie Mays was The Man of his
time. Aaron played both right and center as an All-Star, as did
Clemente. Once ensconced (he played a little right field in 1956),
Mays played one position and one position only for the next 16
years as an All-Star. He owned center field.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar, Derek, and ARod are very good. But take another look at
those Aaron-Clemente-Mays-Robinson numbers. These young lads have
much to accomplish before they become fully anointed.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As a dream sequence to close out the century, only the
Red Sox winning the World Series probably could surpass what will
take place with the 70th All-Star Game, the first in Boston in 38
years and the last to be played in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the 80-year-old Red Sox Hall of Famer who inspired
fiction's Roy Hobbs to wish that when he walked down the street,
people would say, ``There goes the greatest hitter who ever
lived,'' will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. On the
receiving end will be Carlton Fisk, the New Hampshire block of
granite whose 1975 World Series home run off the left-field foul
pole reverberates yet through New England.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez, the slender native of the
Dominican Republic whose brilliance has reclaimed a niche for
fearless pitchers in a game dominated by muscle-bound sluggers,
will be on the mound as the starting pitcher for the American
League All-Stars. His first pitch, to Barry Larkin of the
Cincinnati Reds, will be thrown to the backdrop of thousands of
flashbulbs popping.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's halfway to 30 wins,'' marveled Baltimore Orioles pitcher
Mike Mussina of Martinez, who has an outside shot at becoming the
first pitcher since Detroit's Denny McLain in 1968 to win 30.
``That would be a tremendous accomplishment. Except for the days he
playing against us, I jhope he takes a run at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And playing behind Martinez will be the people's choice at
shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, who in his third season with the Red
Sox has yet to cause Williams to reconsider the stunning
proclamation he made this spring at his museum, when he said,
``Boy, I'm looking at someone who is going to be as good as anyone
who has ever played the game. I say that, and boy, I believe it,
too. And the best thing about it is he's a terrific kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is not alone among Hall of Famers with admiration for
Garciaparra. During batting practice Monday afternoon, Hall of Fame
outfielder Frank Robinson, a player known for his ferocious will
who later became the game's first African-American manager,
approached Garciaparra with pen in hand and a piece of hotel
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I have your autograph?'' Robinson asked Garciaparra, who
looked shocked. ``Seriously, I want your autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   After Garciaparra obliged, Robinson said that he'd never asked a
ballplayer for an autograph before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This autograph is for me,'' Robinson said. ``I've admired him
ever since he came in the major leagues. I just love the way he
plays the game and how much fun he has when he plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan maintains that you have to
go back 30 years to find such an overpowering pitcher as Martinez
and such a complete position player as Garciaparra on the same
team. ``There hasn't been anything like them,'' Kerrigan said,
``since Juan Marichal and Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal, now the minister of sport in Martinez's Dominican
Republic, and Mays are in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone as the star of the first rank will be the
87-year-old ballpark itself, which with a fresh application of
lipstick and a new coat of makeup should prove irresistible yet
again, even if the wrecking ball looms in the not-too-distant
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably an important moment for a lot of us,'' said
Ken Griffey Jr. the splendid center fielder for the Seattle
Mariners who received more votes than any player in the American
League. ``And as we go out there, maybe we'll take something, chip
some paint off the wall, stick it in the bag and take it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that I will take out of this ballpark before
I leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer of the Minnesota Twins, one of 24 first-time
All-Stars whose qualifications rank among the most modest of
players here, said playing at Fenway would make this a cherished
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smell of this stadium is very unique,'' Coomer said. ``Old
beer, stale hotdogs, and peanuts. A great smell.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been some uncertainty about Garciaparra's
participation here, after he aggravated a strained left groin and
missed the Red Sox' last nine games before the All-Star break. But
despite the reservations expressed by Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams, who is here as a coach for American League manager Joe
Torre, Garciaparra said he felt compelled to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very special,'' said Garciaparra, who overtook Derek
Jeter of the New York Yankees and Omar Vizquel of the Cleveland
Indians in the fan balloting, then took out ads in the Sunday
Boston papers, thanking the fans for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here, the people of Boston have been so great to me,
I love playing for them, day in, day out, going out there for them.
Then, to have an event like this, to be able to go out there again
for them, it's special.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be an opportunity to do it again in Fenway
Park, and the fact that it is in Boston, and the last game of the
century, I wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra dismissed concerns that he was risking aggravating
his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize it's an exhibition game,''
Garciaparra said. ``If we (the Red Sox) had a game today, I'd be
dressed and ready to go,'' Garciaparra said. ``This is like a
workout. I won't be playing a full nine. I'll probably just play an
inning or two, whatever. It will be a good test.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra made the All-Star team as a rookie reserve in 1997,
when he had one at-bat and flied out. But he also won the rookie
home run derby, and graduated to the main event, when he took on
such celebrated sluggers Monday night as Mark McGwire of the St.
Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we'll all be even,'' Garciaparra joked, ``until we take
our first swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra spent much of the afternoon Monday answering
questions about the other elite young shortstops in the American
League _ Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners. Jeter
was added as a reserve by Torre. Rodriguez, the AL starter in each
of the last two years, missed 32 games and was left off the team,
even though he had 19 home runs, more than both Garciaparra and
Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   As often as they are linked together, they might as well just
shuffle the name cards. Derek Garciaparra. Alex Jeter. Nomar
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me, one reporter said to Garciaparra at the media interview
session, which one of you is the best-looking?
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra laughed. ``Them,'' he said. ``That's all I can tell
you. Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles ironman Cal Ripken, in the twilight years of a
career in which he served as the prototype for shortstops like
Garciaparra who can field, hit and hit for power, smiled when asked
about the three gifted successors to his throne.
</P>
<P>
   This is Ripken's 17th All-Star appearance, more than any other
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeter, Nomar, and A-Rod, they're going to be here for a long,
long time,'' Ripken said. ``They'll be sitting here 17 years from
now, discussing the same things I am now.''

PEDRO MARTINEZ SEEN AS A MAGICIAN ON THE MOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Connect all the dots, and you have Pedro Martinez by
the numbers. His pitch for history is there for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen wins at the All-Star break, tying Roger Clemens's Red
Sox record while becoming the first pitcher to win 15 at the break
since Atlanta's Greg Maddux, the four-time Cy Young Award winner,
went 15-3 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A 2.10 earned run average, the lowest in the major leagues. A
1.80 ERA in Fenway Park, best ERA in the league at home. A 2.50 ERA
outside of Yawkey Way,the best ERA in the league away from home.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred eighty-four strikeouts, most in the American League.
An average of 12.48 strikeouts per nine innings, the highest rate
in the majors. A career-best 16 strikeouts against the Braves June
4 in Fenway Park. Seven straight games of 10 strikeouts or more, 46
10-K games in his career. Thirty-three consecutive innings in which
he struck out at least one batter. Eleven times in 132 2/3 innings
in which he has struck out the side.
</P>
<P>
   A strikeout-to-walk ratio of 7.67, the best in the major
leagues, with a chance to have one of the greatest differentials of
any pitcher ever to strike out 300 batters in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Fewest hits per nine innings in the American League, 7.02 per
game. Fewest base runners-per-nine innings, a shade over 9. The
lowest batting average against, .213. The lowest slugging average
against, .292. Fewest home runs-per-nine innings, 0.34 (five in 132
2/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I've got to pinch myself,'' Red Sox pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan said. ``I mean, Wow, this guy is doing something very
special here in front of our eyes. Sometimes you have to step back
and say, `Do you realize what's going on here? (itals)What's going
on here?(unitals)''
</P>
<P>
   The man himself is not unaware of what he has achieved by the
midpoint of this season. But for Martinez, the numbers offer just a
partial glimpse of his handiwork on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I appreciate the most?'' Martinez said. ``I guess the
team in general. The way my team feels when I'm out there. I think
that's the most important thing about what's happening now. They
feel we have a chance to win whenever I'm out there, and they try
for it. That's probably why the results are the way they have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about my record, really. What I care about is
what Nomie (Nomar Garciaparra) has to say after a game. How every
one of my teammates comes up to me and says, `Way to battle out
there, way to pitch your heart out.' They do that for me, I do that
for them. We stick together, that's what's really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was Montreal's pitching coach when Martinez was traded
to the Expos by the Dodgers in 1993, when Dan Duquette, then
general manager of the Expos, parted with second baseman Delino
DeShields for a skinny Dominican kid who never made it out of the
bullpen with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I saw him,'' Braves manager Bobby
Cox said on the night Martinez struck out 16. ``He looked like he
was 140 pounds, and he was throwing 130 miles an hour. I thought,
`My God, his arm is going to fly off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Martinez was the National League Cy Young Award winner
for the Expos, but as rapid as his ascent was, there were growing
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his early moments there where he would drift,''
Kerrigan said. ``He would drift sometimes for 30 or 40 pitches. He
would lose his focus, walk a couple of batters, then there'd be a
first-pitch fastball home run, boom, and he'd be down, 3-0. Then
he'd wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments he'd be unfocused, but you never see them
now. They're long gone. Youth will be served. That's where it came
from, his youthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duquette traded again for Martinez at the expansion draft
in Arizona after the '97 season, Kerrigan was reunited with the
pitcher best suited to be the first star of the new millenium. He's
only 27, he hasn't missed a start in five years, and he has a
repertoire of pitches unmatched in either league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this many times to many people,'' Kerrigan said,
``but what impresses me most about Pedro is his humility. He's a
very humble man. What he's achieved, he's very much taken in
stride. He doesn't boast about what he's done, though he very much
has a right to. He puts it in its proper perspective. He just
worries about the next game and how his body is going to feel the
next time he goes out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great in this day and age, when people are pounding their
chests over mediocrity, in this day and age of the athlete who's
showing off all the time, I think he's a breath of fresh air in
that he's a very humble man.''
</P>
<P>
   There remains, of course, the how of the equation. How this
``little man,'' as he was called by Expos manager Felipe Alou _ who
not only is loved by Martinez like a father but bears an uncanny
resemblance, the pitcher says, to his real father _ is able to
transcend the transparent limitations of his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felipe's expression was, `We have to take care of the little
man,' '' Kerrigan said, responding to a question about Martinez's
longevity. ``That's always in the back of our minds, taking care of
the little man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a loose arm. It's almost like a `Slinky' arm. He has
great mechanics, so I think that's a reason why he hasn't had any
arm trouble and hasn't missed a start in five years. He has that
great loose arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Dennis Martinez, who was the closest thing as
far as his build. Dennis was 170 pounds, with a baby-like arm, real
skinny arms. Dennis never had a bad arm until he was 40. Even if
Pedro lost a little bit off his fastball, suppose he had to come
down to 90 miles an hour instead of 94 or 96, because of his
command and his changeup and curveball he'd still be a great
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God came down tomorrow and took five miles off his
fastball, he'd still win 15 to 20 games because he's all about
control now, control and command.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the palette of pitches from which Martinez chooses. His
changeup is universally regarded as the best in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the best nonfastball pitch in baseball,'' Kerrigan
said. ``He throws it with the same arm action as his fastball and
it has great tight spin with it. The velocity he creates with that
arm action and the spin he has created allows it to go down like a
screwball. It is a screwball, not even close to a straight
changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Fastball?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to throw a rising fastball,'' Kerrigan
said. ``(Jeff) Reardon used to have that. You get under the ball
just a little bit and the ball has the illusion of rising.
Actually, it stays straight but it has a little hop at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that ability and he practices it all the time, the high
fastball in the zone. He gets underneath it just a little bit with
his wrist and the ball does seem to rise and take off. That's a
true art form, and he practices it all the time. It's part of his
repertoire while he warms up, and when he throws on the side. He
works at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sit in on a Pedro Martinez warmup session, and this is what you
would see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does he practice throwing to the zones low and away
on both sides of the plate, he also practices the zone high inner
half to both sides,'' Kerrigan said. ``He has that sign with his
catcher (Kerrigan runs his hand across his jersey) that means he's
going to throw the ball up. It's like that Whiffeball `whoooosh,'
it takes off like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason Martinez went through a stretch where his
strikeout numbers were down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing a lot more people swinging at the first or
second pitch against him,'' Kerrigan said. ``Felipe used to have a
saying: People who do that don't want to stay around for the fight,
they don't want to stay in the ring for the fight with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to deal with that changeup. They don't want to
deal with that rising fastball with two strikes. So I think you see
more people go after him on the first or second pitch, which is
great. It keeps the pitch totals down. He doesn't care about the
strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Kerrigan acknowledges, Martinez wears down by the end of
the season, which is why he and manager Jimy Williams go to such
great lengths to give him an extra day's rest whenever they can.
Remember the controversy during the playoffs against the Cleveland
Indians last October, when Williams gave the ball to lefthander
Pete Schourek for Game 4, ignoring the option of bringing back
Martinez on three days' rest? Now it can be told: Even though
Martinez intimated otherwise at the time, there was no way he could
have pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nonissue,'' Kerrigan said. ``I caught him in between
(two days after his Game 1 start) and he had absolutely nothing, no
arm strength left. If we'd thrown him out there on three days'
rest, we might have permanently injured him. He didn't have
anything left to give.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Martinez was saved for another day. Perhaps this one, when
he takes the mound at Fenway Park as the starting pitcher for the
American League All-Stars, in a town that may have no choice but to
place him, one day, in a pantheon of stars that includes Orr, Bird,
and Teddy Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't he almost there already?'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   That answer will be revealed in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very positive person,'' Martinez said. ``I believe in
God, I believe God protects you, because otherwise I don't think
I'd be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm also very realistic. I know things can happen at any
time. An injury, or your heart might not be there. You have to take
full advantage of the time you have to do something, you have to
enjoy it while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Let him enjoy this while it lasts. Let us enjoy him while we
can.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ His popularity with fans surprises even him. For a
variety of reasons, Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey has emerged
not only as the top vote-getter for the 70th All-Star Game at
Fenway Park (for the fourth consecutive season) but also as one of
the most marketable athletes in pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   Fans don't care about his $8.5 million contract or his lucrative
multiyear deal with Nike. Or the fact he picked up an extra
$125,000 for making the American League team. They only regret he
doesn't play for their team _ and they hold out hope the Mariners
will be foolish enough to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's because I wear my emotions on my sleeve,'' said
Griffey when asked how a 29-year-old player is rated so highly in a
sport in which the art of stuffing the ballot box is reaching new
heights. ``I go to the ballpark and I just want to play baseball. I
want to play hard, winning baseball. I want to try to make
everybody around me have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do is not that big of a deal to me. I'm just the one
who lives it every day. Most people want to see their hero or
whomever they think is going to the All-Star Game. So anytime
someone else chooses you, it's nice. Maybe they know I've gone
through two hand injuries, shattered one wrist and broke the other.
The game to me is a day-to-day challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a legitimate icon. He will be a starter in the midsummer
classic for the eighth time, after finishing the first half of the
season second in the American League in both home runs (29) and
RBIs (81). Because of his relative youth (29 years old), Junior has
an excellent shot at surpassing Hank Aaron's record of 755 career
home runs. Especially after averaging 53 homers the last three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it. It's an honor that he (Aaron) says
it and people say it. But I still play the game one day at a time
and do what I can to help my team. I can still hit one out. If I
don't, I don't. Truthfully, I take more pride in my defense than I
do in going out there and swinging a bat.''
</P>
<P>
   As for playing in an All-Star Game at a stadium with the
tradition of Fenway Park, Griffey said, ``This is the midsummer
classic and they are all about the same. But in certain ballparks
there is a lot of tradition behind them and this is one of them.
It's fitting that if they're going to tear it down, they have an
All-Star Game here. This is an important moment, without a doubt.
Maybe I can take something and chip some paint off the wall. Stick
it in a bag and take it home. There's something I will take out of
this park.''
</P>
<P>
   The crown he wears is heavy. Despite his abundant talent, there
have been a plethora of issues surrounding his tenure in Seattle,
where people feel the chances of keeping him for 10 more years
diminish every day.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week his name came up in a rumored deal with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let myself get overwhelmed,'' he said when confronted
with the latest report of his pending departure from Seattle. ``I
don't worry about things. I try to stay as levelheaded as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of living and working on the West Coast, you'd
think Griffey might be wearing down a little. He has been the heart
and soul of the Mariners, who earlier in the decade were struggling
for survival. Things changed when Seattle made the American League
playoffs in 1995 and '96. The excitement those teams _ featuring
Junior, Alex Rodriguez, Jay Buhner, and Edgar Martinez _ created
turned on the entire upper Northwest. You can bet when the new
Safeco Field opens later this week in Seattle, it will be called
The House That Junior Built. But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake as to how the Mariners feel. Without Junior,
there would be no success; probably no Seattle franchise. It wasn't
all that long ago (1970) that Seattle lost the Pilots to Milwaukee.
They've made their commitment in the form of building new stadiums
twice. A defection of a great player would be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players like Junior only come around every once and awhile,''
reminded his manager, Lou Piniella. `You pay him what you have to.
Then put the best club you can around him to win. He's the only
player I've been around who is consistently cheered in opposing
ballparks. That's hard to believe, but I've seen it happen. He's
got that infectious grin that people associate with, people like.
When he gets walked in opposing parks, the pitcher gets booed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is home to Griffey. But he is not without frustrations.
Last year, he hit 56 home runs and got scant notice in the media
and from the fans because of Mark McGwire's race to 70. Despite his
easygoing nature and financial security, there are things out of
his control. His father won two World Series rings. Junior has
none.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming the new Michael Jordan of the sports marketing
world: ``Mike's a little different. He's way on high. We're still
climbing. Mike's problem is that he went up too fast and he didn't
bring anybody up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   On his secret to making the All-Star team: ``Sure, I've got some
people working for me. I pay my dad about $30 a week just to go out
and punch ballots. We don't even talk about baseball unless we have
to. When we go on vacations, I make dad pay for them. He brought me
into this world. He's got to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   For Griffey to remain in a Seattle uniform requires a commitment
from the Mariners and from himself, not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't go out there and feel like I'm contributing to the
ball club, I will retire no matter what the circumstances,'' he
said. ``If I feel I'm no longer doing the things of which I'm
capable, I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Piniella, that would be a shame. ``In 30 years of
being on the major league scene, I've got to watch all the great
players,'' he said. ``When you start to talk about the five tools
of baseball, Junior ranks at the very top.''

SOSA TRULY A POP HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He stood at the podium during Monday's All-Star Game
press conference at the Westin Hotel, where the managers, honorary
captains, and leading vote-getters of the American and National
leagues were recognized. Gracious as ever, Sammy Sosa accepted a
glass trophy from NL president Leonard Coleman for being the
league's top vote-getter with 2,315,204, about 600,000 fewer than
Seattle's Ken Griffey, who for the fourth year in a row led the AL.
</P>
<P>
   The honor particularly humbled Sosa, because, as he said, ``for
me it's the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning to the tardy Griffey, who had just settled into
his seat after accepting his trophy, the affable Cubs slugger drew
laughter from the assembled media when he asked, ``How many times
for you, Ken?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say I'm happy to be here again,'' said Sosa, a
three-time All-Star, who was forced to sit out last year's
midsummer classic at Coors Field in Denver because of left shoulder
stiffness. ``And this time I'm going to play, this year I hope
everybody enjoys the same way that I am enjoying, and thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to thank anyone, really.
</P>
<P>
   At the Home Run Derby at Fenway Park, fans showed their
appreciation for the captivating summer Sosa and fellow bash
brother Mark McGwire _ the Nos. 3 and 4 hitters in the NL's
All-Star lineup _ provided last year in their stirring home run
chase in which Sosa hit 66 and McGwire 70.
</P>
<P>
   It was The Summer of Sam and Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun to watch,'' said Griffey, who also
challenged Roger Maris's season home run record but fell off the
pace at the end. ``Every time you turned on the TV somebody was
getting excited. And I think that was a lot of fun not only for
myself, but for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and the rest of the AL players got to watch the NL's
history-making home run hitters take turns swatting 'em over The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor for me to be together with Mark again,'' said
Sosa, who was at Busch Stadium last year when McGwire crashed his
record-setting 62d homer off Cubs pitcher Steve Trachsel. ``With
everything that we did last year and to come here together this
year _ I'm going to hit in front of him, and he's going to hit
behind me. Not only for me, but for the fans and everybody that
loves baseball and everybody that loves what we do and what we did
last year, it's an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot-stovers warmed their hands last winter with talk of the Red
Sox landing a power hitter, in 1995 the Sox almost landed a big one
_ Sosa. A deal for Sosa had been struck and signed, but was voided
by then interim commissioner Bud Selig because there was no
bargaining agreement in place in that strike-truncated season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was close to being here in Boston,'' said Sosa, who is
hitting .286, with 32 home runs (four more than McGwire) and 74
RBIs this season. ``I remember my agent and I _ I was ready to come
here, but it never happened. If I were to play here, maybe I
would've hit 72.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of laughter rippled through the audience.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he had ever homered at Fenway, Sosa shook
his head with incredulity. ``What a question,'' he replied, as more
laughter filled the room.
</P>
<P>
   How could Sosa ever forget his first major league homer? It came
at Fenway Park in 1989 when he was with the Texas Rangers, and it
came against Roger Clemens, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing the ball about 100 miles an hour that day, he
was throwing hard,'' Sosa recalled. ``When I got the first one off
him, it was like a dream come true, especially at this place.
Clemens was one of the dominating pitchers then _ and still he is _
but it made me real proud of myself. From that day on, I said to
myself I can play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   And after last year's performance, NL fans agree, making him
winner of this All-Star popularity contest.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a vast turnaround from three years ago when Sosa led
the league in home runs but was snubbed for the All-Star Game, not
even being selected as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was hitting the home runs, and not picked to come to
the All-Star Game,'' he said, ``that was a sign for me that I
needed to keep working and keep showing the people that I could do
it and I never gave up. Pretty much last year was the year that
everybody recognized me the way I was supposed to be recognized.
And this year, (being) the leader in votes, that's something that
shows me the appreciation right there. I feel very proud of
myself.''

PAST SNUBS DON'T DISCOURAGE STARTER PALMEIRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For the past two weeks, baseball people have been
compiling their annual list of All-Star Game snubs. They've been
talking about all the players who enjoyed a great first half of the
season but were not voted starters by the fans or not chosen as
reserves by the managers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all part of the system. Fans are going to vote for
their favorite players, regardless of whether those players'
statistics warrant a start in the All-Star Game, and managers
filling out their rosters often will lean toward players from their
teams. So it's pretty much a given that a handful of deserving
players are going to be left to come off the bench or even left at
home, victims of what some consider to be a popularity contest.
</P>
<P>
   A perennial member of the snub club has been Texas Rangers first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro. Few players have been as consistent during
the past decade _ or as overlooked. This year marks his fourth
selection to the All-Star Game, yet he has never been a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The fans this season voted Cleveland's Jim Thome to start at
first base despite a far more stellar first half of the season by
Palmeiro. You compare: Palmeiro is batting .355 with 22 homers and
76 RBIs, placing him among the American League leaders in each
category; Thome, meanwhile, is batting .280 with 14 dingers and 50
RBIs. Yet Thome got more than 1.3 million votes to Palmeiro's
700,000. Think Palmeiro was robbed of a spot in the starting linuep
for the 70th All-Star Game at Fenway Park?
</P>
<P>
   For those who think he was, justice was done Monday when manager
Joe Torre named Palmeiro the AL's designated hitter, replacing fan
selection Jose Canseco, who is out with an ailing back. There was
some speculation that the New York manager would move the Red Sox'
Nomar Garciaparra, who has missed the last nine games after
aggravating a strained left groin, from shortstop to the DH spot
and put Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter in the starting lineup. But
Torre chose to avoid possible controversy and go with Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to fill in the starting lineup,'' said Torree, ``he
jumped out at me because of what he's doing this year and what he's
done over the past years offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who went 2 for 2 with an RBI in last season's All-Star
Game in Denver, will finally get a long overdue honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty exciting,'' Palmeiro, now in his 12th season in
the majors and second stint with the Rangers, said of his starting
assignment. ``I wasn't expecting that. I really didn't think that
it would happen. I didn't even think about it. But it's real nice
and it will be a pretty nice emotional deal when they call my name
and I run out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He harbors no bitterness for the man voted in ahead of him at
first base. ``Jim Thome is a great player. He's had a great career,
and he deserves to be voted in,'' said Palmeiro. ``You know last
year he went in there and competed in the home run hitting contest
and did very well, so fans don't forget that. I'm not disappointed
at all. I'm here, and this just tells me I'm having a good year.
It's nice that Joe thought enough of me to put me in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro will bat seventh in the AL order, behind former Orioles
teammate Cal Ripken Jr. and in front of current teammate Ivan
Rodriguez. Because of the aftereffects of two knee surgeries this
spring, a lot of Palmeiro's at-bats have come as the Rangers'
designated hitter. He has flourished in the role. He got his
2,000th career hit earlier this season and is on pace to eclipse
his career high of 43 home runs, set last season with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The only player to play in more games in the '90s than Palmeiro
is Ripken. Every year, Palmeiro is up around 30 home runs and 100
RBIs. Yet he's never been voted by the fans as a starter. Yet he,
unlike teammate Juan Gonzalez, who skipped the All-Star festivities
because the fans did not vote him the starter in right field, is
simply happy to be here. Starter or reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor for me,'' he said. ``Of course, I've never won
an MVP and I've never been voted in. Juan's won two MVPs and was
voted by the fans last year to start. He has a point. I can
understand where Juan is coming from. I kind of support him in that
matter, but I'm in a different situation. And we're two different
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out and do my thing and keep putting my numbers up.
I keep saying that eventually, when it's all said and done, people
are going to realize that I was a pretty good player. As far as
being appreciated, as long as I'm appreciated by my teammates and
respected by my peers, that's all I can ask for.''

PHILLIES' ACE SCHILLING HOPES HE CAN CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's taken a long time for Curt Schilling to gain a
measure of revenge against the Red Sox. Now he has a chance to toss
the first stone and make it count.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old Schilling, the ace of the Philadelphia Phillies,
will lead the charge by the National League against the American
League in the 70th midsummer classic at Fenway Park. Schilling was
the choice over Arizona's Randy Johnson, the NL strikeout leader
(211), and it would make the former Red Sox farmhand happy to pitch
two or three scoreless innings against Boston's Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, he said Monday. ``I'm ecstatic. I'm nervous as
hell. There is only one All-Star Game a year. . . . There is only
one major league game on earth. And I'm starting for one side. It's
pretty awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling doesn't talk about revenge against the Red Sox. On the
contrary, he looks back to the 1988 trade that sent him and Brady
Anderson to Baltimore for Mike Boddicker as one of the turning
points in his career. Success did not come overnight. But after a
one-year stint in Houston (1991), he has hit his stride in
Philadelphia, where he has become one of baseball's most powerful
and durable pitchers. And he has the numbers to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   His 13-4 record and a 3.13 earned run average got him the
starting nod over Johnson. But then it's hard to pass over a power
pitcher who has recorded back-to-back 300 strikeout seasons for a
team that never seemed to get him enough runs. He was 15-14 last
year with 15 complete games. This year he has seven complete games
and is having a great time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park hasn't been too good to me the last year or two,''
said Schilling. ``But I don't dwell on the Red Sox. I'm going to
try to have as much fun as I possibly can. I thanked Bruce Bochy,
our manager, for the selection and the start. He did his
homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling said he would not have felt slighted if Johnson had
been chosen ahead of him. He respects the Big Unit and what he has
accomplished. The admiration is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually goes out and finishes what he starts,'' says
Johnson. ``That makes him one of a dying breed of power pitchers.
Over a period of time I don't have as many complete games as him.
My teammates are out there for nine innings, why shouldn't I?''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling will be appearing in his third All-Star Game and the
first without the specter of a trade hovering. As far as he knows,
he is off the market and a Phillie for two more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mute point,'' he said. ``I'm not going anywhere. I
think (general manager) Eddie Wade has made that pretty clear to me
and a lot of people. I'm a Phillie. I think we've got a legitimate
shot to contend for a postseason spot. The key right now is we're
playing better when I pitch. We score runs and have played
consistenty solid defense the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling has mixed emotions facing Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a totally respectful way I'm looking forward to facing all
of them,'' he said. ``But I really don't want to face any of them,
especially not in the same game. I'm going to take the generic
approach. Throw a lot of fastballs and try to get outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is somebody I've always watched with admiration. He is
the rare guy who is not only a power pitcher but he also has a
strikeout changeup. Watching him this year is like being a Triple A
player watching the major leagues. It's been enjoyable.''

GOWDY: YAWKEY GOT A CHARGE OUT OF '61 POWER OUTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Curt Gowdy was in the booth in 1961 when the last
All-Star Game was played at Fenway Park. With hitters like Hank
Aaron, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Willie Mays, Roberto Clemente,
and Maury Wills in the lineups, sportswriters were predicting the
score would be in the high teens, considering the size of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey didn't like all the talk about the high
scoring and grumbled to Gowdy throughout the day that Fenway was
not that easy of a park.
</P>
<P>
   Yawkey was right. The game ended in a tie, 1-1, and maybe two
players actually hit The Wall in left field. ``There was brilliant
pitching and there was a wind coming up making the balls just hang
up in the air,'' said Gowdy in a recent interview. ``And I
remembered running into Mr. Yawkey in the dining room after the
game. He raised a glass as a toast. `Here's to little ol' Fenway,'
Yawkey said. `They didn't score all the runs they thought they
would. We did pretty good today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was. All those great hitters licking their chops to
knock one out only to receive pitches low and away, resulting in
infield grounders.
</P>
<P>
   Gowdy doesn't have any predictions for this year's game. He
remembers how difficult it was to call the 16 All-Star Games he
worked before retiring. ``Those games were the toughest to call,''
Gowdy said. ``You had a lot of different players shuttling in and
out. It was hard keeping track.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, NBC used only four cameras. And the network didn't
have all the assistants and spotters to help the announcers in the
booth. That wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Its game coverage was
solid, largely because the announcers had personal relationships
with the players.
</P>
<P>
   Gowdy was particularly close to Ted Williams. ``We used to talk
a lot when we were on the road together,'' Gowdy said. ``He would
talk a lot about his elbow. One time, I saw him in his room and he
was flexing his arm. `You know, Curt, my elbow has never been the
same.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was referring to an operation he received after the
1950 All-Star Game when he broke his elbow smashing into the wall
at Comiskey Park trying to catch a Ralph Kiner fly ball. Gowdy said
that Williams told him that he lost some snap in his swing and had
to overcompensate and study more to remain a splendid hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Gowdy told Williams: ``It doesn't look like your elbow is
hurting you too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gowdy was the kind of announcer that allowed the game to come to
him. He didn't use a lot of catch-phrases or create artificial
excitement. ``My theory was that my job was to cover the game,''
Gowdy said. ``I was there because of the game. The game was not
there because of me.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thinking has not gone away. Joe Buck is calling the
game, and while he is one of the biggest baseball fans around, he
said he doesn't plan to ``trample over'' the action on the field.
``I'm going to let the game breathe,'' Buck said. ``The game is
more of a celebration and my task is to not overwhelm the viewers
with a lot of overtalking. The game and the atmosphere around
Fenway will carry our coverage. I'm just there to accent things.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck may be low key _ his wife is expecting their second child
any minute _ but Fox is going all out. Even Buck concedes that the
network has gone ``Hollywood'' with its ``Field of Dreams'' opening
and Kevin Costner voice-overs for the game. ``It's going to be one
those kinds of games that people sit back and hang on for a while.
I've been doing games for a while and this one has been like an
island for me. I knew it was on the schedule and just couldn't wait
to watch it.''

 &HT;    There's nothing like a fair-weather Web friend
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My good friend Gail _ the one who moved to
the Oregon coast a few years back with little more than a basket of
books and a featherbed _ has had a bit of bad luck. Seems she lost
her most recent beau to an Internet seductress.
</P>
<P>
   Gail has been single for many years, ever since her husband
discovered his secretary was younger and thinner than his wife. The
experience left her a little touchy where men are concerned. In
fact, she has worked out her own philosophy in a terse six words:
They're ruled by their anxieties. Sometimes, if she's feeling
particularly modern, she'll substitute an expletive for
``anxieties.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Gail a handsome woman of 56, a retired judge and lawyer,
blessed with intellect and charm ... (SET ITAL)and(END ITAL) ... a
little sports car, seldom dates. The men who do ask her out, she
explains, are either married or senile. Frequently, both.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago, a likely candidate (we'll call him Albert
because that's his name and we're not trying to protect him from
anything) walked into the art gallery where she works weekends, and
struck up a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Albert, 73, had been recently widowed and wanted to talk. It was
a slow afternoon and Gail is an expert listener. Two hours later,
she'd agreed to meet him for dinner at a nearby fish house.
``Meet'' is the key word here because that's what cautious single
ladies do on a first date, which assures them of two things:
transportation, and no awkward moments at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Gail and Albert had a marvelous time and decided to
spend the next day together visiting galleries and walking the
beach. Albert talked. Gail listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she confided that evening in one of our marathon phone
calls that keeps AT&AMP;T stockholders fat, ``I've made the big move.
I've invited him to dinner.'' Albert had proved to be good company
as well as an honorable man. ``He's polite, intelligent, and
realizes it's too soon to become seriously involved, so we're just
friends,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail and I talked daily. She filled me in on Albert's remarkable
attributes. ``He doesn't smoke, he'll drink a glass of wine with
dinner, and he enjoys reading as much as I do,'' which is no mean
task since Gail digests six to eight books a week. She says it's
what she does instead of housework.
</P>
<P>
   Albert and Gail drove up and down the Oregon coast searching out
used bookshops. On rainy afternoons, they sat together in her
oversized easy chair in front of the big window looking onto the
bay, counting eagles and sharing confidences. ``His dreams for the
future are the same as mine. I think I may have found the right
one. We're giving it a lot of time, just to be sure,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, she called to share some news. ``You
know how I hate computers?'' I knew. She refuses to have one in the
house, along with television. ``Well, Albert bought one today and
he's at home right now setting it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The next evening, she said Albert wasn't there because he had
been on the phone with IBM for four hours. ``Can you believe he's
spent the entire afternoon trying to figure out where to plug in
the toaster.'' I mentioned that in my modest experience with
computers, I'd never run across one that made toast. She guessed
she'd heard him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Albert was still a no-show. ``He has learned
how to get on the Internet and spends all of his time surfing. He
said I could come over if I'd bring sandwiches. I took him pastrami
with sprouts, but he didn't have time to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, all of Albert's conversation was in print. He'd discovered
chat rooms. Gail decided to wait it out, until the novelty wore
off. She went back to her books.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Gail called Albert to be sure he hadn't
slumped over his keyboard from exhaustion. He was alive, well, and
sincerely apologetic. ``I can't see you any more,'' he said,
``because I'm getting married to a lady I met on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail was incredulous. ``She's a 71-year-old woman he picked up
in a chat room on Wednesday night. Thursday she drove 400 miles to
his house, and they're getting married on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for progress.

 &HT;    Questions aside, does Bush's money make election irrelevant?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The best _ most ominous? _ indicator of what's
happening in the race for the White House is the sudden interest in
a stretch of Texas dirt along Prairie Chapel Road.
</P>
<P>
   Reports say Gov. George W. Bush is interested in that property
seven miles from Crawford, Texas. With those reports the
population-631 berg became Insta-Cam City. And of course there was
insta-talk about land speculation. Where to house the Secret
Service agents for the next president of the United States? Who
will sell them their Big Gulps in a Texas August?
</P>
<P>
   Readers who missed the news that Bush had already won the
presidency can be excused for being disoriented. This time, rather
than use the traditional means of electing a president, we've gone
to the auction-barn method. And bids apparently have closed. Sold,
to G.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever raised this much money this early _ $36 million
in the first half of 1999. Bush's figure doubles the $18 million
raised by Al Gore and leaves the entirety of the GOP field looking
like fleas on Bush's socks.
</P>
<P>
   Though in fact it is way too early to hand him the GOP
nomination, the war chest alone wins him the equivalent of a
half-dozen primaries simply by raising to nose-bleed heights the
implausibility of several GOP candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is going to take some hits in the primaries from whoever
manages to survive the money-raising season. Billionaire Steven
Forbes, for one, is guaranteed survival, and is going to take away
much of his right flank. Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole are
going to contend for moderates. And in cranky New Hampshire,
Patrick Buchanan can still make George's day miserable, as he did
once for George's father.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's money edge _ more than an edge, this is the
continental shelf _ is already winnowing the GOP field. Hard-right
candidate Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire has announced he's
bolting the party to run as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   These chain reactions are happening, this train of invincibility
chugging, though most Americans have no clue about this man.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't feel left out. The Washington Post's David
Broder, one of the nation's most astute political observers, admits
not having a clue either.
</P>
<P>
   ``His five-year record in office largely is unexamined,'' Broder
writes. ``His views on most issues are unknown. And yet, on the
basis of public opinion polls and even more his bank account, the
New York Times said his third week as an announced candidate _
devoted largely to fund raising _ 'has the feel of covering a
general election nominee.'''
</P>
<P>
   Broder wonders about the ``lack of public indignation'' that a
distinguished GOP field would be rendered inconsequential by a
question-mark mysterian and his money.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls? How could anyone outside of Texas have any
opinion about George Bush? Granted, the name sounds very familiar.
Didn't he used to be president?
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance watchdog Common Cause attributes Bush's
remarkable success to a group of money-raisers tagged the Pioneers
_ ``insider money men who each have committed to raising $100,000
for the campaign . . . the new class of political power brokers
whose status and access are determined by the big money they
bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts observe that Bush is in a position to turn down federal
matching funds. This sounds altruistic. Rather, it is conniving. It
would mean Bush wouldn't be subject to many post-Watergate campaign
spending limits which come with public financing. Reportedly, Gore
is considering the same. Yahoo. No holds barred _ the equivalent of
campaign-finance nuclear war. It will be televised.

 &HT;    MONEYTALK: Personal finance books to read ... and avoid
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers often ask what books would help them get smart about
investing in general and the stock market in particular.
</P>
<P>
   That's no surprise. A lot more people have investments these
days because they have 401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Others have gotten interested because they keep hearing about
the booming stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers know this hunger exists. That's why there are so many
investment advice books in the stores and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those books are very good.
</P>
<P>
   But some are them are awful, as Charles A. Jaffe notes below.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for investment books at a public library, go
for the ones numbered 332. Many will be grouped in the subsection
332.6.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wading through the offerings at a bookstore, here's a
rule of thumb: Avoid any book that promises to make you rich in the
next 30 days or that claims to have a secret investment strategy.
You can't do the first, and nobody knows the second.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some good places to start:

More,'' by Seth Godin. Makes investing easy to understand, even on
some of the more-complicated topics. Includes a clear explanation

investment strategies and an extensive list of further resources.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Green Magazine Guide to Personal Finance: A No B.S. Book
for Your Twenties and Thirties,'' by Ken Kurson. $12.95. Strong on
explaining the basics in an informal way; oriented toward young
people.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Investing for the Financially Challenged,'' by Walter
Updegrave of Money magazine. A basic personal finance book for
anyone who might otherwise have bought a Dummies or Idiot's book _
a nomination from Charles A. Jaffe.
</P>
<P>
   If you're past square one
</P>
<P>
   _ ``One Up on Wall Street'' and ``Beating the Street,'' by Peter
Lynch. Very popular books by the retired manager of the huge
Magellan Fund. He explains how everyday experiences can help
beginners make investment choices.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Zebra Among the Lions,'' by Ralph Wanger. The witty and
widely respected chief of the Acorn mutual funds describes his
``growth at a reasonable price'' investing style.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stocks for the Long Run,'' by Jeremy Siegel. Practical
advice on how the market works and how to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Intelligent Investor,'' by Benjamin Graham. One of the

the best book on investing ever written.''
</P>
<P>

Loeb; or ``The Wall Street Journal Lifetime Guide to Money,''

 &HT;    Slate.com aims to reach into readers' palms
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Another new day has dawned at Slate.com, the online
journal of politics and opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Slate has always been notorious for keeping its light under a
bushel and in the shadow of that other popular online magazine,
Salon. But now it seems that Slate may have finally found a
combination of editorial, commerce and alternative revenue streams
to push the Microsoft-owned site into mainstream acceptance after
three years of failed attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in the Web site's daily e-mail ``morning delivery,''
there was a note from famed editor Michael Kinsley talking up
Slate's latest efforts aimed at reaching a broader audience and
tapping into current Web trends.
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved Slate _ it seems like Slate is always
reinventing itself as new and improved _ has taken a huge leap into
the next century with versions now available for PalmPilot and
Windows CE users.
</P>
<P>
   Slate's attempt to score with the hand-held crowd is a growing
strategy being adopted by CNN, the Weather Channel and a host of
other news-and-information Web sites that want to reach out to the
Web surfer who doesn't always surf from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Slate Publisher Scott Moore says the extension of Slate from the
PC to hand-held devices is an ideal move from both an industry and
product perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``These devices are proliferating right now, and for us, it's a
natural way to extend our brand because it's a very low-cost
distribution channel,'' he says. ``It's also exposure to an
attractive audience that really uses these products. We view part
of our mission as being a laboratory for these newly developing
products. This type of thing works for Slate because our audience
tends to be very sophisticated and a lot of readers are `early
adopters' and the people who are using these devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Slate is also taking a leap into the world of downloadable
digital audio files via a deal with Audible.com. Slate will provide
all of its content to Audible.com for users who want to listen to
Slate, as Kinsley put it, ``on the treadmill or in the car.''
Actors will be reading the content, and users will be able to
purchase a digital player to download the files. The product is
available from Audible.com for about $80.
</P>
<P>
   These new developments put Slate on the bleeding edge of
Internet technology, and Moore thinks the timing is perfect as
Slate begins its coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign. While
many like to compare Slate with Salon, Moore says there are some
very distinguishable differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I would say Salon is a direct competitor,''
he says. ``Editorially, we are slightly different. We have more
coverage of politics and current events.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead toward Campaign 2000, Moore says Slate is poised
on the front lines of what could be a watershed year for politics
and the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think back to the Kennedy-Nixon debates,'' he says. ``Kennedy
was the first politician to realize how to use television. Nobody
has started spending advertising dollars online. We've talked to
all the campaigns, and we know they are all thinking hard about how
to use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore says Slate has a long way to go before it reaches the
profitability it's struggling so hard to achieve, but taking away
the subscription barrier, adding the shopping resources of the
Microsoft Network to the site and being promoted on most of the MSN
sites have resulted in a big boost for advertisers and readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we are on the path to profitability and we do take a
long-term view of success,'' says Moore. ``We've only been at this
for three years. Most magazines take about five or six years to
become profitable. But Kinsley always says Slate will really have
made it when you can take it into the bathroom and read it.''

 &HT;    Stroke won't stop actor's return to `Sports Night'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robert Guillaume, Emmy-winning star of TV's ``Benson''
and ``Soap'' and currently co-star of ``Sports Night,'' walks
slowly and gingerly, leaning on a cane. The effects of the stroke
he suffered in January are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But then he sits down, flashes a wide smile and starts to talk,
and it's clear he hasn't been slowed at all in the ways that
matter. Guillaume, 71, was in Atlanta last week to receive a Legacy
Award for show business achievement from Jomandi Productions.
Sitting in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel, he talked about his
stroke and his future as irascible boss Isaac Jaffe on ``Sports
Night'' (9:30 Tuesday's on ABC), which starts shooting season two
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Normally when people say ``How are you?'' they don't really
want to know. But in your case people do want to know: How are you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm recovering. I'm doing my speech therapy, physical
therapy, occupational therapy (relearning skills such as bathing
and brushing his teeth). I've been doing that since January. It's
like one step at a time. Good today, weak tomorrow, stronger the
next day. My wife (Donna) is my biggest booster. She won't be
satisfied until I'm running alongside the car, pushing a
wheelbarrow.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The original news reports called it a mild stroke. Did it
feel mild to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course not. It sort of makes life a random universe. Your
foot may act right or not act right. It ends your life as you knew
it. For me, it was like mild depression, constantly thinking if you
want to do something: How much time is it going to take, and is it
worth it?
</P>
<P>
   It could be very depressing. When you're older there's a certain
vanity involved, so that you don't want to be seen stumbling about,
hobbling about. But all my limbs work to a more or less degree. And
I didn't lose my speech and I didn't lose any cognitive powers _
whatever I had before. (He laughs). In that sense, it was a mild
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you concerned Isaac might not return to ``Sports
Night''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There was always that concern that I wouldn't come back
sufficiently to warrant being written back in again. (Executive
producer) Aaron (Sorkin) came to see me in the hospital, and I
think he was relieved. We talked about the logistics of getting
around the set, whether I'd have to use a wheelchair. But it was
agreed I could come back, and they'd write it into the character.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you talked about how Isaac will be in season two?
</P>
<P>
   A: I suspect it will have something to do with the brass
upstairs and how they feel about whether Isaac can perform his job:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't think you can cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes you think I can't cut it? I'm doing exactly the
same thing I was before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't like the way you look.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be some sort of ongoing battle like that. It could be a
new chapter, one we haven't seen before in sitcoms.

 &HT;    Spa living, sports training are pet academy's specialty
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTTO, Texas _ You drop them off for the week, choose what
they'll eat from a laminated menu, and set up a personalized
schedule that includes swimming, nature walks and romping after a
flying disc.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't day care for the kids. It's summer camp with a
decidedly doggy flair, and if you want your pooch to participate,
you'd better book early. It's just one of the offerings at the
Triple Crown Dog Academy, where canine aficionados are heading from
across the country to board, train and show their animals.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a reflection of a national trend for owners to do more
with their dogs. As Triple Crown owner Jerry Wolfe says, ``Dogs
that sit in the backyard all the time aren't as happy as dogs that
do things.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Wolfe glides by a refrigerator loaded with frozen
snacks for dogs, past a shelf stacked high with plastic puzzles for
canines, and sweeps his arm out, showing off the $3.5 million,
360-acre spread 30 miles north of Austin, Texas, where dogs rule
the roost.
</P>
<P>
   The huge facility opened in April 1998 near Hutto, and it since
has become a Central Texas hot spot for boarding and training as
well as promoting competitive canine activities such as dog
agility, flyball and schutzhund, a sort of Iron Dog Triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   In agility competitions, dogs run an obstacle course consisting
of tunnels, narrow bridges, jumps and a series of poles they must
weave through. The activity got its start in England, where it
developed as an exhibition sport between equestrian events.
</P>
<P>
   In flyball, the dog is timed as it runs through a short course
of jumps, hits a box that makes a ball pop out, grabs the ball and
returns. In schutzhund, dogs compete in a series of tracking,
obedience and protection events.
</P>
<P>
   The academy offers classes and contests for dogs of all
abilities in all these events, plus training for police and
protection dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a place for your dog to stay,'' Wolfe said.
``Almost every dog sport you can compete in, we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened, Triple Crown has hosted almost 40 events, and
the calendar is booked through next June. A dog agility trial
scheduled for July 17-18 is expected to draw hundreds of
competitors from all over Texas and neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 members of the Travis Agility Group practiced Tuesday
at the Cameron Equestrian Center in Austin for the upcoming
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs are members of our family,'' said Carol Rabago, vice
president of the group, as a dachshund-heeler mix named Misty Leigh
cruised across a teeter-totter.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stewart, Misty Leigh's owner, says the sport made his dog
what she is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes wonder where she would be if we hadn't done
agility,'' he said. ``I don't think she'd have the same level of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the boarding and summer camp facilities that draw many
pet owners to the Hutto academy.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when some people bring their dogs to work and spend
thousands on veterinary care, clients here have no problem shelling
out $33 a day or $165 a week for summer camp. Boarding without all
the extra frills is less _ $16 a night or $112 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give them time to sit around and sulk and be alone,''
Wolfe said. ``We know if the dog's having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case you're not convinced, clients receive a photo
montage of their pet partaking in his or her favorite activities, a
canine spin on the tradition of human campers sending letters home
to parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients ship their dogs to Austin on commercial airliners
for summer camp or training. Employees then pick up the animals
from the airport and transport them to the academy.
</P>
<P>
   John Romaka, 55, a retired stockbroker living in New Mexico,
sends his German Shepherd, Lucky, to Triple Crown for schutzhund
training. The posh digs are nothing new for the 80-pound Lucky, who
has spent the night at the Renaissance Hotel in Austin and La
Mansion on the Riverwalk in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better behaved than most children you see at these
hotels,'' Romaka said.
</P>
<P>
   Romaka drove his 2 1/2-year-old purebred to Hutto in March and
will pick him up in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than monthly dues at a country club,'' Romaka
chuckles. ``Each of us has his own hobby, and some are more
expensive than others. It could be worse, it could be golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he came up with the concept for the academy after a
frustrating search for a place to leave his dog when he went out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I was going to build a place I would board my dog,
where he would have fun,'' he said. ``I figured there had to be at
least one other nut like me.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought the old ranch outside Hutto in September 1996 and
quickly went to work creating a dog's _ and dog lover's _ paradise.
The result is a place that pipes New Age music and purified air
through its 120 boarding kennels, which all have rubber-padded
floors. There are event playgrounds and special jet-action massage
showers, and Wolfe plans to add a special canine water park and a
certification program for dog trainers sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   There's a climate-controlled, 32,000-square-foot event center, a
lighted sports field, ponds for retriever training, a clubhouse and
barbecue area, RV parking and a bathhouse for humans _ with a
separate tub out back to scrub dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants first-class accommodations for their dog,''
Wolfe said. ``You're just seeing a total awakening to the human-dog
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Some clients bring along favorite toys, blankets or snacks for
their dogs. ``One lady showed up with two suitcases,'' Wolfe said.
``They were for the dogs _ full of toys and bedding.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jessy Gabriel, a trainer, took three summer campers
swimming at one of the five ponds on the premises. Trixie, Pepper
and Shetan barreled down a grassy peninsula and soared into a
glassy pond when she tossed in a rubber toy.
</P>
<P>
   In the kennel area, an employee walked by carrying Sami, a Jack
Russell terrier, in a wicker basket. Around the corner, a Great
Dane named Shorty and a basset hound named Lily trotted by, a
trainer following close on their heels. ``Dogs aren't perfect when
they leave here, but they're a lot better than when they came in,''
said Keith Benson, general manager of the facility.

 &HT;    Modern video games feature more graphic violence, gore
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's trouble in Raccoon City.
</P>
<P>
   A virus has turned the inhabitants into flesh-hungry zombies.
And their posture is lousy. When a crowd of these lurching
subhumans breaks into a gun store, they feast on the proprietor
like pigs around a trough, throwing up a mist of blood in the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Joe D'Avanzo, 26, starts pumping them full of lead.
``It takes three shots to the head,'' he says, as the zombies drop
like sandbags. ``Or about six shots to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules in ``Resident Evil 2,'' one of the gorier
video games available for Sony's PlayStation console. Later in the
game D'Avanzo's on-screen persona, Leon, can acquire a shotgun,
which does the job better.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shotgun blast will take their head clean off,'' D'Avanzo
says. ``But the problem with that is you have to wait until they're
real close.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Avanzo, manager of Software Etc., is a connoisseur of the
latest in violent video games, in which players blast, cut and
bludgeon opponents, leaving piles of bodies in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Violent games have come under scrutiny this summer because the
teen-agers responsible for the bloodbath at suburban Denver's
Columbine High School were also dedicated fans of ``Doom,'' the
granddaddy of all violent games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doom'' was one of the earliest and most successful in a genre
called the ``first-person shooter.'' These games put a weapon in
the hands of the player and show the world from his point of view,
as he charges down passageways and wipes out an endless horde of
enemies. Killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris turned their own
high school into a scenario right out of ``Doom,'' littering the
hallways with very real corpses.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High killings have prompted lawsuits against the
makers of ``Doom'' and cries for a government crackdown on violent
video games. But most parents are probably unaware that ``Doom'' is
kid stuff compared with the games that are coming out now.
</P>
<P>
   This month Xatrix, maker of such genteel entertainments as
``Redneck Rampage,'' released ``Kingpin: Life of Crime,'' a
foulmouthed killing fest that will give mothers and fathers a new
reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kingpin,'' the player is cast as a thug who works his way
up the underworld ladder by killing and stealing. Due to its
hyper-realistic gore and R-rated language, the game is being sold
with the strongest warnings ever placed on a computer game. Both
the soundtrack, by the rap group Cypress Hill, and the dialogue
employ liberal use of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage in ``Kingpin'' is also more convincing than the
cartoonish deaths in ``Doom'' and its follow-up, ``Quake.'' You can
actually have conversation with your human opponents before you
kill them, and their body parts can be blown off, one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A participant identified as ``Menace'' gave ``Kingpin'' high
marks in an Internet discussion group, writing: ``It's plenty of
fun. I like setting (people) on fire then pulling out the shotgun
and blowing their flaming head off while they're running around
screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Kingpin'' is going to be like catnip to the
serious gamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the most vile and reprehensible games in the
history of mankind. And, put it this way, I'm going to buy it,''
says a chuckling D'Avanzo. Retailing for $54.98, the game is
already moving briskly at his store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingpin'' is rated ``M'' for mature audiences, which means
that Daniel Beruvides, 17, is just old enough to buy it. A neatly
dressed, bespectacled high school student, he doesn't seem like
someone who'd be prone to violent, antisocial rage. He is a rising
senior, scored a 4.0 grade-point average last year, and is
college-bound in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Beruvides enjoys violent games such as ``Resident Evil.'' He
points out that even well-adjusted kids need outlets for anger.
``Have you ever wanted to kill anybody?'' he quipped. ``Well, this
lets you do it without getting arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Other game players concur that part of the attraction of violent
games is the opportunity to harmlessly blow off steam. ``If you're
looking for someone's (rear end) to beat cause you're (angry) with
the world, you can do it with a keyboard,'' says Patrick Ogletree,
22, a prep cook at an Athens brew house who enjoys multiplayer
games of ``Doom'' on the Internet. ``Everybody should have stress
relief like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Game designers are happy to oblige. Developers in the $6.5
billion video game industry know that explicit violence can pull
players into a game, just as a bloodthirsty killing can pull
viewers into a Quentin Tarantino movie. The racks of specialty
stores such as Software Etc., and electronics superstores such as
Best Buy are stacked with 31 flavors of mayhem, suitable for play
on video game consoles or on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with absurd violence, such as ``Redneck
Rampage,'' which offers a brand-new way to utilize a chicken and a
stick of dynamite. There are games that inject sex into the story
line, such as ``Duke Nukem,'' in which combatants pursue each other
through strip bars and porno movie houses.
</P>
<P>
   There are games with creepy violence, such as ``Parasite Eve,''
in which the lead character causes victims to spontaneously burst
into flames. There are strategy games, such as ``WarCraft'' and
``StarCraft''; hunt-and-shoot games, such as the James Bond-themed
``Goldeneye 007''; parody games, such as ``Deer Avenger,'' in which
deer give hunters their comeuppance; and sword-and-sorcery games,
such as the hugely popular ``Legend of Zelda'' series. All involve
killing, to a greater or lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
   The goriest games are usually on CD-ROM, for play on personal
computers, because they're produced by independent developers who
are not answerable to large companies like Sony or Nintendo. Yet
the games created for the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo consoles
also have a fair amount of carnage; ``Doom'' and ``Quake'' were
both released in console format, and PlayStation offers ``Resident
Evil'' and Nintendo has ``Duke Nukem.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of nonviolent video games, including
sports games, flight simulators and strategy games. But why do so
many games involve killing?
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the nature of the device and the people drawn to
it, say gamers. Many of the earliest games, including such
``Paleolithic,'' 1970s games as ``Space Invaders'' and
``Asteroids,'' required the player to manipulate a weapon to shoot
down opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't consider `Space Invaders' a violent game,
but it is just as violent a game in concept as `Doom,' `Tomb
Raider' or `Quake,''' says Theodore Beale, 30, a game designer and
a reviewer of games for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``There's
only so many game concepts out there, and games are largely
designed by guys who like to blow things up.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed are the graphics. New technology, including 3-D
accelerator video cards, have taken on-screen violence from the
silly, one-pixel gunshots of ``Contra'' to the grotesque,
face-ripping transformations of ``Parasite Eve.'' Games with
built-in artificial intelligence, such as ``Half-Life,'' also can
provide characters with real human unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in video games entered the cultural radar in 1993, when
the fighting game ``Mortal Kombat'' moved from coin-op arcades into
home use on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles.
</P>
<P>
   Combatants in that game could dispatch a victim by tearing off
his head (with spinal column still attached), or by ripping out his
heart. Parents were aghast and politicians thundered for video-game
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a ratings system firmly in place, ``Mortal Kombat''
looks like a quaint artifact, its 2-D characters disporting against
a flat background.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's 3-D games place the player inside a truly
realistic environment. Details make the scenes believable. In
``Parasite Eve,'' the Dolby Surround Sound allows the player to
hear, according to one afficionado, ``the flesh ripping from the
bones.'' In ``Kingpin,'' you can see the track marks on hookers'
arms. There is even a preference in ``Kingpin'' that the player can
set to determine how long splattered blood will stick to the walls.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other technical advances in video game
production, but the graphics are the most visible _ and the most
lucrative, says Johnny Wilson, editorial director at Computer
Gaming World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullet wounds are more visible than artificial intelligence,''
says Wilson. ``Special effects are king in terms of sales, and the
bigger, the badder, the more extravagant, the more popular they're
going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, though a gaming enthusiast, decries the violence in
``Kingpin.'' In a column for his magazine, Wilson writes that the
game's wholly unredeemed characters are the ``worst thing that
could happen to the hobby'' of computer games, and suggests that
the developers and publishers share a responsibility for the
long-term effects that such violent entertainment has on the
national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are already being tested in the courts. The
families of the three victims in the 1997 Paducah, Ky., school
shootings have filed suit against video game giants Sony, Nintendo
and Sega, charging that the killer Michael Carneal was influenced
by their products. One lawsuit claims that Carneal was trained by
video games to become a better shooter, citing the fact that the
Marine Corps uses ``Doom'' to beef up marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The current climate has caused some sweaty palms at Interplay,
publisher of ``Kingpin'' and one of the 25 defendants named in the
Paducah lawsuit. After the Colorado massacre, the company tried
vainly to recall some of its provocative magazine ads for
``Kingpin,'' which scream in a huge typeface ``You're Gonna Die!''
according to product marketing manager Alison Quirion. ``The timing
couldn't be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Quirion points out that ``Kingpin'' is intended for adults, and
that those who object don't need to buy it. But video games,
advertised in comic books and sold in toy stores that cater to
kids, can easily slip into younger hands, says James Alan Fox, a
criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, and a critic
of the games. ``You put an `M' on the box, and then you put them in
a store that panders to a 12-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no consensus that the video games, for all their
gore, really are dangerous. In fact, when analyzing 27 different
studies on video games, Purdue University Assistant Professor John
Sherry found the immediate correlation between game play and
aggression to be small.
</P>
<P>
   Two studies of college undergraduates playing ``Mortal Kombat''
were particularly intriguing, says Sherry: The students who played
longer demonstrated less aggression than those who played for only
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry adds, however, that the data is slim, and that there are
no studies on long-term effects. ``My guess is as good as yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Game players themselves aren't concerned. ``Usually video game
people are too busy playing video games to do anything,'' jokes
Wade Lorenzen, a 26-year-old tile setter.
</P>
<P>
   The grotesque fiends in ``Quake'' ``are meant to look twisted,''
says Roxanne Hanke, a 20-year-old student at Atlanta College of
Art. ``It's the same thing that people look for in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of violent games is misdirected energy, she says.
``Don't they think they should work on schools, instead of video
games?'' says Hanke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some adults need to get a life,'' says Beruvides. ``These
characters are fictional. They're not real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence started well before video games,'' the teen-ager
concludes philosophically. ``If you try to get rid of violence,
you'll have to get rid of man.''

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   _ There are 3.5 million serious gamers in this country. On
average, each of these avid hobbyists spends $720 a year on video
games, buys 20 games a year and spends $2,500 every two years to
upgrade his or her computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A larger audience of gamers includes 20 million who play some
kind of game every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 90 percent of computer games are purchased by people
older than 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ Game consoles, including the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64,
account for about three-quarters of the gaming industry.

 &HT;    `Cool' bandanna helps take edge off heat
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Determined to mow the grass and work in the
garden this week? Here's another product designed to help you play
it cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say you tie one on and chill out,'' says Teresa
Doenges of Lima Medical Supplies, who sells a scarf called the
Miracool Bandanna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been carrying these for the past four years and sell a
lot on our retail floor and also to our industrial accounts,'' she
explains. ``I sell thousands each year to factories that aren't
air-conditioned. It's a safety issue when you're working in a
factory and you want to make sure people are alert.''
</P>
<P>
   The special scarf is filled with polymer crystals that absorb
water. Soak it in cool water for a half-hour and watch it plump up
slowly. It isn't necessary to freeze the scarf. Then just drape it
around your neck. The scarf stays cool for a full day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works by evaporation, just like when you come out of a pool
or the shower,'' explains Laura Vermeire, executive vice president
of marketing for OccuNomix, the New York company that manufactures
the product. ``Evaporation creates a cooling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Her company also uses the cooling crystals to make headbands,
visors, baseball caps and hard-hat inserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have them for dogs and horses, too,'' Vermeire adds.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Crisp, a safety engineer at DTR Industries, says she buys
the scarves ``100 at a time'' for employees who then purchase them
at cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plant isn't air-conditioned, and we do a lot of curing
processes, which are very hot,'' she explains. ``When someone is
suffering from heat stress, you want to cool off the back of their
neck. Employees put the scarves around their necks, and it helps
them to keep cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The scarves, which retail for about $4.99, come in more than 40
colors and patterns ranging from American flag prints to Balinese
batiks. They can be rinsed and reused.

 &HT;    Cough remedy nothing more than 'voodoo' in heart attack scenario
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Coughing will not prevent a heart attack, in case
anyone was wondering.
</P>
<P>
   The question came up after a recent e-mail message circulated
with the virulence of a chain letter. It says that anyone who feels
heart attack symptoms while alone should cough ``repeatedly and
very vigorously,'' repeating a breath ``about every two seconds. .
. until help arrives, or until (a normal heartbeat returns).''
</P>
<P>
   The advice even cites some impressive sources.
</P>
<P>
   But it is wrong on so many levels, say both the American Heart
Association and Dr. Gary Fishbein, a cardiologist with the Dayton
Heart Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right up there with voodoo as far as I'm concerned,''
Fishbein says.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue is that the message begins with the scenario of
someone driving home at 4:17 p.m. ``after an unusually hard day on
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that job,'' Fishbein says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while it correctly identifies heart attack symptoms as
severe chest pain that radiates into the arm and jaw, the faintness
the imaginary patient feels is a sign not of a heart attack but of
cardiac arrest, from which fewer than 5 percent of people revive.
</P>
<P>
   With a heart attack, Fishbein says, ``You usually fall over
without any warning'' of faintness. ``But they say to call 911
between breaths. I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately calling 911 is the only smart move for a person who
feels heart attack symptoms while alone, say Fishbein and the Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   According to Heart Association spokeswoman Allison Dubbs in
Columbus, Ohio, the keys to surviving cardiac arrest are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Early recognition of warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taking immediate action, including the 911 call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) from a medical
professional or someone who is trained in CPR, although even those
whose CPR skills are rusty should try to help rather than allow a
cardiac arrest to proceed without intervention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting early access to automated external defibrillation
(AED).
</P>
<P>
   _ Receiving medical attention from paramedics and trained
emergency room staff as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fishbein wasn't surprised to learn the message appears verbatim
on a Web site for urban legends
(urbanlegends.miningco.com/library/blcpr.htm?pid2733&AMP;cobhome). The
</P>
<P>
   researcher there traced it to a later retracted report in a
newsletter for heart attack survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece of garbage has some truth to it,'' Fishbein says,
and he thinks he knows how this might have started.
</P>
<P>
   During heart catheterization procedures, the replacement of
blood in the heart by contrast dye can induce a heart attack,
although it happens less often with dyes currently used. When that
happens, Fishbein says, some doctors have the patient cough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coughing can force blood back into the heart and help in
squeezing the blood that's left in the chest up to the head,'' he
says. It won't restore normal heart rhythm, but it will buy a few
seconds to give the patients better odds of revival with CPR.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to survive a heart attack is to avoid it altogether
by getting early treatment for heart problems, Fishbein says. ``If
you think you might have heart disease,'' he says, ``get checked
out.''

 &HT;    Built-in safeguards highlight of UGA research center
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ When the new Animal Health Research Center opens,
University of Georgia veterinarian Dr. Barry Harmon will no longer
have to collect in biocontainment bags and incinerate the
by-products of his research on E. coli O157:H7, the deadly bacteria
that sickened children at White Water Park.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million facility has built-in safeguards designed to
capture, contain, decontaminate and sterilize everything coming out
of it, including the wastewater, air molecules and incinerator ash.
The building will allow researchers to study a variety of
contagious pathogens such as campylobacter, chlamydia psittaci and
Salmonella DT104, which infect humans as well as animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian government has already contacted us about
hiring vet school faculty to investigate Exotic New Castle Disease,
which doesn't exist in the U.S.,'' said Corrie Brown, head of the
College of Veterinary Medicine's pathology department. ``It's a
poultry disease that they didn't have in Australia until a little
while ago. They've have to slaughter 2 million chickens because of
it. In the new building we could study the disease safely.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years in the making, with federal and state
funding, the new research center is the only nongovernmental
facility in the country designed to accommodate a wide range of
animals, said Mike Mispagel, the facility manager and the quality
assurance manager for the entire university. With special features
like gates, tie-rings and high ceilings, the animal rooms are large
enough for horses, cows and pigs, as well as for rodents and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Mispagel expects scientists from agencies outside the
university, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to use the
AHRC for their projects in collaboration with UGA researchers. He
also plans to schedule research on noninfectious diseases for the
first six months the building is open ``to work out any bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when the idea of constructing a secure, safe
laboratory setting first surfaced among vet school officials, there
had been outbreaks of Legionnaires Disease, aflatoxin and various
avian diseases, all of which were studied ``under less than ideal
conditions,'' said Mispagel. UGA officials brought in a team from
the USDA who determined that there was a need for such a facility
in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This building will provide an additional level of safety and
control,'' said Mispagel. ``The engineered design gives you more
scientific control. You can control the microorganism within a
confined space and avoid the possibility of contaminating other
animals. If you're trying to study an organism, you want to have as
much control as possible over all variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders will be invited to an Aug. 12 dedication, when
the building will be open for tours. Vet school experts have given
tours to Athens fire department personnel and have been working
with local public safety officials to devise a plan should a fire
occur in the facility. As the AHRC comes on line, the UGA Biosafety
Committee, which has also toured the facility, will be closely
involved in oversight responsibility, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000-square-foot, bunkerlike building has had its own
maintenance staff for the past six to nine months. An electrician,
a plumber and a systems engineer have been learning the building
inside and out, even as architects and construction crews ready it
for final tests and inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the building seems unremarkable, just a brightly
lit lobby, a reception area and a hallway of offices, one of which
will house a person to monitor the animals being used in research.
Without a key card providing access, visitors are restricted to the
lobby; with a key card, one can enter the locker rooms and showers
that lead to the laboratory areas. Everyone going into these areas
showers before leaving the building.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 16 animal research rooms, the labs for toxicology,
surgery and necropsy _ animal autopsy _ have special features to
minimize exposure to deadly organisms. With $5,000 in airtight
doors, the rooms are all depressurized, meaning that air flows only
into them _ the outgoing air circulates through a special filter
before being released. There are autoclavs that sterilize equipment
with high temperatures; biosafety cabinets, which are filled with
sterilized air; and downdraft tables that pull fumes away from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor of the building isn't finished yet, but
Mispagel said it will house the laboratories of the eminent scholar
in vaccinology the Georgia Research Alliance is planning to hire.
The air handling system for the building is on the top floor; the
incinerator, wastewater holding tanks and emergency generator are
in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much redundancy built into the system that this is
going to be the safest building on campus,'' Mispagel said. ``It's
going to really help give the university a leg up in research. It
will provide a resource for UGA to be able to investigate
microorganisms in a safe environment that otherwise wouldn't be
able to be investigated.''

 &HT;    Let the Indians win something first
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The assignment is difficult _ the old compare
apples to oranges cliche, except in this case it is comparing
giants, like watermelons to cantaloupes.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Are the 1999 Cleveland Indians comparable to the 1976
Cincinnati Reds, The Big Red Machine?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   It is an assignment designed to make people angry, but also to
get people talking and, no, the results won't be biased. Yes, the
writer covered the 1976 Reds, saw nearly every game, covered the
sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League
championship series and covered the sweep of the New York Yankees
in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the writer grew up in the shadow of old
Cleveland Municipal Stadium, the dark and dank Mistake on the Lake,
and rooted shamelessly for the Tribe through the best of times,
through the worst of times . . . and the worst of times far
overshadowed the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   So, on with The Show:
</P>
<P>
   CATCHER: Johnny Bench or Sandy Alomar? As Reds manager Sparky
Anderson said, when asked if Yankee catcher Thurman Munson was as
good as Bench: ``Don't ever embarrass any catcher by comparing him
to Johnny Bench.'' Alomar is good, very good, but Bench may not
have invented the position, but he personifies it.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Bench.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST BASE : Tony Perez or Jim Thome? Amazingly, both Perez and
Thome were converted from third base to first base. This time we
spin back in time to Reds manager Dave Bristol, who had Perez in
the early stages of The Big Dog's career. ``If there is a way to
win a baseball game, Tony Perez will find a way to win it,''
Bristol said. Thome is very good, a clutch hitter, but Perez is
acknowledged as one of the best clutch hitters ever.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Perez.
</P>
<P>
   SECOND BASE: Joe Morgan or Roberto Alomar? Alomar may be the
final piece the Tribe needed to push its way over the top, just
like Morgan was the final piece added to the Big Red Machine in a
dynamic trade with Houston. Morgan won back-to-back MVPs and Alomar
has won . . . well, none. Little Joe was a big, big man.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   SHORTSTOP: Dave Concepcion or Omar Vizquel? Both Concepcion and
Vizquel couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle early in
their careers, but Concepcion became a solid hitter later in his
career, just as Vizquel is. Concepcion had few peers in his day
while Vizquel plays in the shadow of offensive-minded shortstops
like Derek Jeter, Nomar Garciaparra and Alex Rodriguez. Vizquel,
though, continues to make plays that can't be made by flesh and
blood.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD BASE: Pete Rose or Travis Fryman? The temptation is to
say, ``Next category, please. No discussion needed.'' Fryman is a
solid player. Rose was Mr. Baseball throughout his playing days.
Throw aside his personal off-the-field problems that landed him on
the outside looking in on the baseball scene, Rose was the ignition
switch on the Big Red Machine and for every team on which he
played.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Rose.
</P>
<P>
   LEFT FIELD: George Foster or David Justice (or whomever)? Foster
was the most underrated and least talked about player of his era.
For seven years, he averaged 32 home runs and 107 RBIs with his
Black Beauty Bat (few players used black bats then) and in a time
when home runs weren't cheaper by the dozen. Justice does as much
DHing as he does playing in the field and is an excellent run
producer, but he nor anyone else the Tribe sticks in left field,
can match Foster.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Foster.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER FIELD: Cesar Geronimo or Kenny Lofton? Geronimo was one
of those guys who made a living with his glove and his arm, a
good-field, no-hit guy who Anderson could stick in the No. 8 hole
and forget about, a luxury The Big Red Machine could afford. He did
hit .300 one year with a series of bloops and seeing-eye grounders
and the team called his bat, ``The Magic Wand.'' Lofton, though, is
The Complete Player . He plays defense, he runs the bases, hit hits
for average and some pop. He is far superior to Geronimo, who, with
his name, should have played with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   RIGHT FIELD: Ken Griffey Sr. or Manny Ramirez? Griffey was good,
very good. He was better defensively than Ramirez and, by far, a
better base-runner _ a master of the infield hit. He had 37 infield
hits one year. Ramirez, though, is a run-producer . . . a lot like
Perez, a guy who can hoist a team upon his shoulders and carry it.
And sometimes, the way Ramirez runs the bases, it looks as if he is
carrying something heavy on his shoulders. But he is The Big Man on
the Tribe and Griffey was merely an integral part of The Big Red
Machine.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING PITCHERS: Are you kidding? Neither team has produced a
Cy Young winner, or even come close. Neither team needed much
starting pitching because they used the hammer-them-to-death
method. No lead by the opposing team was or is safe. The Reds had a
legitimate No. 1 in Don Gullett, while Jack Billingham and Freddie
Norman were adequate. The Tribe has Dave Burba and Charles Nagy and
Bartolo Colon and Jaret Wright . . . all very serviceable, all very
average. It was Billingham who made up a very bad poem about his
team scoring runs for him: ``Seven (runs) is heaven, eight we
skate, nine is divine, ten we win.'' As a poet, he matched his
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Nobody . . . a draw.
</P>
<P>
   RELIEF PITCHERS: Are you kidding again? The Big Red Machine had
a couple of excellent guys to finish games (they weren't called
closers then) in left-hander Will McEnaney and right-hander Rawlins
Jackson Eastwick III. And there was Pedro Borbon, the rubber-armed
guy of many goofy deeds. The Tribe has a true closer in Mike
Jackson and a bunch of other ever-changing parts. Neither team
needed or needs much of a bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Nobody . . . a draw.
</P>
<P>
   MANAGERS: Sparky Anderson or Mike Hargrove? As Bench once told
Anderson, ``Just stay out of our way and we'll win you some
championships.'' And for the most part, he did. He put the same
eight guys in the lineup every day, then earned his nickname,
``Captain Hook,'' by manipulating his pitching regularly and often.
Hargrove has had to manage around an abundance of injuries and done
a masterful job of bandaging and patching. With the DH, he doesn't
have to use much strategy. Anderson is headed for the Hall of Fame
and Hargrove is still trying to head for his first World Series
ring.
</P>
<P>
   WINNER, Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMING UP: Even by giving the 1999 Cleveland Indians the
advantage at DH because there was no such animal in 1976, The Big
Red Machine wins, 6-4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe is very, very good, but what has it won? Nothing, yet.
In fact, it still has to prove it is better than the New York
Yankees this year. The Big Red Machine was far and away the best
team in 1975 and 1976, winning the World Series both years.
</P>
<P>
   When the Indians win a World Series, don't come back. Win two in
a row first.

 &HT;    Quite a load when big back gets big bucks
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jamal Anderson will get the money he wants, or most of
it. He'll get his new contract soon enough, probably after training
camp begins but before the second exhibition game. And he'll be
happy, and he'll have another big season, and probably the Atlanta
Falcons will, too. Question is, what happens when this extended
contract hits Year 4, Year 5, Year 6?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is the Falcons' best and most marketable player, the
most compelling reason to buy a ticket to go watch this
increasingly compelling team. Today, he's almost worth the $10
million signing bonus he wants for agreeing to remain with the
Falcons beyond the millennium. The only guarantee that tomorrow can
offer is that Anderson won't be as good in 2001 as he is today.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson turns 27 the last day of September. Emmitt Smith and
Barry Sanders, the best backs of this decade, are both 30 and have
begun the inevitable descent toward retirement. Neither Smith nor
Sanders absorbs the full-on blows that Anderson does. Neither Smith
nor Sanders has carried 410 times in the course of a regular
season, as Anderson did last season. Nobody else ever has, either.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks and offensive tackles can get better with age.
Running backs cannot. It's not humanly possible to be hit in the
knees and ankles so many times and keep your speed. A little
running back can stretch his career by becoming a Dave Meggett, a
third-down specialist who runs away from people. A big running back
doesn't have that option. As he ages, a big running back will get
only disproportionately worse.
</P>
<P>
   There are antecedents aplenty _ Christian Okoye, Pete Johnson,
James Wilder, even the great Gerald Riggs of the Falcons _ but the
most apt is Earl Campbell. Equipped with Anderson-like thighs and
an Anderson-like will, Campbell had five 1,000-yard seasons in his
first six NFL years, the powerful string broken only by the 1982
strike. Came the seventh season, Campbell was just another
beaten-up back. This will be Anderson's sixth NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are differences. Anderson did little his first two
years, rushing only 41 times; Campbell had 670 carries in his first
two seasons. But Anderson has rushed 700 times these past two
seasons, and the workload doesn't stand to ease much when he
returns. The Falcons won the NFC largely because of Anderson's
pounding, and their use of a second-round pick to draft Reggie
Kelly, a blocking tight end, points to an even greater emphasis on
power, if that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Figure Anderson will get between $25 million and $30 million
over five or six years. Not all of that will be guaranteed, but
most will. That's money well-spent in the short run _ after three
decades of muddling, could the Falcons not re-sign their MVP now
that they have something to defend? _ but it stands to buy little
toward the contract's end. By 2001, the Falcons will be seeking a
new Anderson, even as the old one remains on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a weird bit of business, it's really just
the way of this front-loaded world. To get Jamal Anderson into
camp, the Falcons will have to promise to keep paying him later.
But they won't need him later. They need him now.

 &HT;    Desmond Hunt: World-class jumper...and getting a doctorate, too
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many athletes are looking forward to 2000, the
year of the Summer Olympics in Sydney. But for triple jumper
Desmond Hunt, next year will be doubly significant. That's also
when he's scheduled to complete his doctoral work in kinesiology at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy do what he's doing,'' said Dan Pfaff,
assistant track coach at the University of Texas. ``He's in the top
10 in his event and he's getting a doctorate in a top 10 program.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical day for Hunt begins at 7:30 a.m. in the lab, where he
works until 3 p.m. Training sessions start right after that and run
almost three hours. After a dinner break, Hunt goes back to the
classroom, where he teaches until 9:30 p.m. Then, it's back to the
apartment to say hi to the dog, catch up on some reading and get
ready to start the routine all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where I'm uncomfortable not being
busy,'' said Hunt, who would like to teach at a university or do
research after he receives his doctorate. Hunt is in his fifth year
here of working on post-graduate degrees.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent U.S. outdoor track and field championships in
Eugene, Ore., Hunt, who graduated from Iowa State in 1994, finished
second in the triple jump. Provided Hunt meets qualifying
standards, he will qualify for the world championships in August.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of July, Hunt left the United States for Europe
to compete in some meets, but also to get some much-needed rest and
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Dual careers in academia and track and field seemed unlikely
paths when Hunt was growing up in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Illinois, basketball is life. It's like football is in
Texas,'' Hunt said. At Zion-Benton High School, Hunt was a lanky
basketball shooting guard. He didn't start start triple jumping
until late in his high school career but did manage to finish third
in the state in his senior season of 1989. That was good enough to
get the long-striding jumper some nibbles in college track offers,
including one from Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, however, acknowledges that he did little more than get by
in the high school classroom and wasn't really prepared for
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some tremendous difficulty getting grades,'' he said.
''It's not that I couldn't learn the material. I didn't know how to
study. I didn't go to some classes, and if I did go, I'd just sit
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hunt came back home for Christmas break during his freshman
year, his mother, Shirley, picked him up at the airport and gave
him an earful during the ride home. She told him that if he wasn't
going to work in the classroom he might as well quit school and get
a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a 3.5 after that,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Success in track also followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to work your way up there if you didn't run distances
(races),'' Hunt said. While the foreign-born distance runners were
often the stars, Hunt was usually in the background as a solid
performer in an often overlooked event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who don't even know what the triple jump is,''
Hunt said. ``They've never seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year, he finished second in the Big Eight and 14th
in the NCAA meet. His career best was still shorter than 54 feet
and it looked like his jumping days were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We throw people out on the street after undergrad,'' Pfaff
said. ``Other countries find a way to take care of their people.
Here, you can't get into meets. We let them in all-comers meets,
but there might be only three guys in that. You can't get very
excited about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Track athletes who want to continue their careers after college
usually buck a triple whammy. In addition to the lack of
competition, there can be a lack of training facilities and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In track there's maybe 10 or 15 guys who are making a
living,'' Pfaff said. ``If you look at golf, the 125th guy is
making good money. If you look at the 125th athlete in track and
field, you'd cry. They're not driving sports cars, they're hoping
to keep the rent guy away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt kept jumping because he found a conducive atmosphere at UT
and a coach/friend in Pfaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan said that track and field used to be an art, but now it's
a science,'' Hunt said. ``He knows what's going on and he's open to
new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Austin, Hunt's triple jump has increased by about two
feet. But he has no endorsements. He doesn't even get free shoes.
In the outdoor championships, he ran in a borrowed uniform from a
sprinter. Last year, because of his academic workload, he didn't
even compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the ability to be a top 10 performer in the world,''
Pfaff said. ``He needs more competition and fewer financial worries
and time constraints. But, his intelligence and maturity are a
plus. It's an event of wisdom; it takes a lot of years to figure it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt will get some much-needed competition in Europe, but unlike
his previous trips there, he won't be focusing solely on the meets.
He'll be staying with a friend in Madrid and plans to do some
sightseeing and take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take the opportunity to enjoy the cultures and
the history,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   After that it will be back on the dual treadmill that will only
accelerate as 2000 approaches.

 &HT;    Jack-of-ALL-trades
 &HT;    By Leigh Allan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're a klutz around the house and yard,
Chuck and Jay say thanks. And keep up the bad work.
</P>
<P>
   I opened the mail at home. A note from our bug people, AAbel.
Nothing interesting there.
</P>
<P>
   Then, out fell the fliers:
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Lawn Care
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Paver Systems
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Landscaping
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Appliance Service
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Home Assessment
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Home Improvement
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Carpet Cleaning
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Duct Cleaning
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Heating and Air Conditioning
</P>
<P>
   AAbel Airline and Nuclear Power Plant Construction, all at the
same Kettering, Ohio address.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, the last two weren't really there, but only because Chuck
Norman and Jay Moran haven't had a crack at them yet. In a few
years, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The AAbel EEmpire seemed unusual. There's a connection between
lawn care and landscaping, but exterminating and appliance service?
Other than they both try to get the bugs out?
</P>
<P>
   At least the assemblage seemed odd until Norman, 51, a CPA, and
Moran, 41, a management major, explained it. Then I saw what was
really unique was their business philosophy, one based on an
observation many have made but not acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   The observation is simple _ there are lots of tradesmen who are
very good at their crafts, but abysmal at business. And because
they lack financial and management skills, they fail or just scrape
by.
</P>
<P>
   Norman and Moran's actions are simple, too _ they find a company
that provides good service but is shaky on the business side, buy
it, and leave the skilled person in charge with an ownership cut
while they handle the books and marketing and personnel and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a common-sense idea you'd think it would be common
practice, but Norman and Moran say they know of no one else going
their way. Companies often expand within one service line by buying
up similar outfits, but not across services.
</P>
<P>
   The duo got the entrepreneurial urge while both worked with Jet
Express trucking in the '80s. They and a Jet owner wandered into a
chance to buy a Miamisburg, Ohio company making auto sub-carpet
matting. Five years later, they sold to a bigger firm.
</P>
<P>
   Norman and Moran went on their own in 1990, when a man told them
his aunt and uncle wanted to sell AAbel Exterminators, which had
ambled along since 1937 as a mom-and-popper with a good reputation.
They saw a big opening in the insect-slaying game between tiny
operations that would have trouble coping with new regulations on
toxic chemicals and national firms with no personal touch, and
bought the first AAbel before they knew anything about
exterminating.
</P>
<P>
   They learned and grew.
</P>
<P>
   The same thought process added the other businesses. The idea is
to become an all-in-one home service center. The coming
opportunity? Home spa maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon homeowners will be unable to do anything for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that should be UUn AAble.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Don't be misled by the GOP's silence on
abortion. The issue has not gone away. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ With each day comes new protests in
Yugoslavian towns. The protesters want Slobodan Milosovic removed
from office. While that may be comforting to the U.S. State
Department and NATO, I find something quite discomforting about it.
The protesters seem to want Milosovic removed for the wrong reason.
(Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.). 17. MOVED
MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My good friend Gail _ the
one who moved to the Oregon coast a few years back with little more
than a basket of books and a featherbed _ has had a bit of bad
luck. Seems she lost her most recent beau to an Internet
seductress. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ PARIS _ There is a love story being written
here at every turn. But it is not simply lovers embraced on park
benches. It is more than that. All of Paris is in love. All of
Paris is in love with Paris. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I'll miss the national debt. It was
something you could count on. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Readers who missed the news that Bush had already
won the presidency can be excused for being disoriented. This time,
rather than use the traditional means of electing a president,
we've gone to the auction-barn method. And bids apparently have
closed. Sold, to G.W. Bush. But Bush's money edge _ more than an
edge, this is the continental shelf _ is already winnowing the GOP
field. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ALLAN-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're a klutz around the house
and yard, Chuck and Jay say thanks. And keep up the bad work. I
opened the mail at home. A note from our bug people, AAbel. Nothing
interesting there. Then, out fell the fliers: AAbel Lawn Care.
AAbel Paver Systems. AAbel Landscaping. AAbel Appliance Service.

layout is now available.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET WHEELS 0713 _ The 10th anniversary special edition of the
MX-5 Miata clearly isn't for everyone who wants a two-seater
because of its inflated price. But it does stand out in a niche
market segment catering to traditional sports car enthusiasts.
(DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes 3-column color

interior.

<P>
   SHARP DRIVING _ Whether you are making an out-of-state car trip
or just a short ride to a nearby lake or mountain retreat, don't
spoil your summer vacation by letting the heat and the boil of
traffic get the best of you. (Sharp, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
Includes 1-column color photograph of columnist.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP-DRIVING _ A review of the new Saturn midsize L-Series.

   TESTDRIVE-IMPALA _ A test drive of the 2000 Chevrolet Impala
(DeVault, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL FINANCE
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ Readers often ask what books would help them get
smart about investing in general and the stock market in
particular. That's no surprise. A lot more people have investments
these days because they have 401(k) retirement plans. Others have
gotten interested because they keep hearing about the booming stock
market. Publishers know this hunger exists. That's why there are so
many investment advice books in the stores and libraries. Some of
those books are very good. But some are them are awful. We list
some good places to start. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT/ARTS
</P>
<P>
   TVSERIES-MINORITIES _ When the NAACP took on the networks Monday
at its annual convention, blasting them for failing to include
minority actors in prominent roles in new series set to debut on in
the fall, they were partly right. And partly wrong. A comment from
the AJC TV critic. (Kloer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GUILLAUME _ A talk with actor Robert Guillaume about his
resurgent career as one of the stars in ``Sports Night'' and his
real-life stroke and recovery that also played a big role in the
season ender of the ABC show. (Kloer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE
</P>
<P>
   DOGGY-CAMP _ HUTTO, Texas _ You drop them off for the week,
choose what they'll eat from a laminated menu, and set up a
personalized schedule that includes swimming, nature walks and
romping after a flying disc. No, this isn't day care for the kids.
It's summer camp with a decidedly doggy flair, and if you want your
pooch to participate, you'd better book early. It's just one of the
offerings at the Triple Crown Dog Academy, where canine aficionados
are heading from across the country to board, train and show their
animals. (LeBlanc, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOGAMES-VIOLENCE _ The killings at Columbine High School
prompted lawsuits against the makers of Doom, the granddaddy of
violent video games, but Doom looks like child's play compared to
the games that are out now, including Kingpin, just released last
week, which allows you to form your own mafia (not the trenchcoat
kind) shoot your victim in 15 different body parts. A look at
violoent video games, and those who play them. Photo tba. art from
boxes of games, frame grabs available. (Emerson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 60. MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOGAMES-WHO _ Who plays video games, how much, etc... by the
numbers. (Emerson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   COOL-BANDANA _ The Miracool Bandana is designed to beat the
heat. Just soak it in water, wear it around your neck, and stay
cool. (Moss, Dayton Daily News). MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE/HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   HEARTATTACK-COUGH _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Coughing will not prevent a
heart attack, in case anyone was wondering. The question came up
after a recent e-mail message circulated with the virulence of a
chain letter. It says that anyone who feels heart attack symptoms
while alone should cough ``repeatedly and very vigorously,''
repeating a breath ``about every two seconds. . . until help
arrives, or until (a normal heartbeat returns).''
</P>
<P>
   The advice even cites some impressive sources. But it is wrong
on so many levels, say both the American Heart Association and Dr.
Gary Fishbein, a cardiologist with the Dayton Heart Center. ``It's
right up there with voodoo as far as I'm concerned,'' Fishbein
says. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   VETS-HIGHTECH _ With depressurized rooms, high-tech air filters
and waste water steam cleaners, the new Animal Health Research
Center at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary
Medicine will allow scientists to safely study organisms heretofore
deemed too deadly. On the drawing board since the late 1970s, the
ARHC will have cost about $20 million_which has been split by the
federal government and the state of Georgia_once it opens in a few
weeks. Administrators believe the unique facility, which is
designed to accomodate animal species of all types, will be used by
researchers from cross the country. The Australian government has
already contacted the Vet School about doing some research for it
on Exotic Newcastle Disease, which has infected poultry in that
country and necessitated the slaughter of 2 million chickens. We
tour the facility and write about it and what it will mean.

 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's Saturday afternoon in New York, and the Backstreet Boys _
except for Howie Dorough, who's across town rehearsing for a skit
on ``Saturday Night Live'' _ are trying on clothes.
 &HT;    These aren't just any duds, mind you _ these are the Tour
Costumes, the threads that for most of the rest of the year will
have to hold up under screaming loud enough and shrill enough to
pop stitching and summon dogs from every corner of the planet to
wherever the Backstreet Boys happen to be playing that night.
 &HT;    Yes, the Boys are back, complete with their new album, the
mightily hyped ``Millennium'' (Jive Records, 1999). It's the
eagerly awaited followup to ``Backstreet Boys'' (1997), which in
the process of selling 27 million copies worldwide launched a batch
of hits such as ``Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),'' ``As Long
As You Love Me'' and ``Everybody (Backstreet's Back),'' and made
the world safe again for Tiger Beat subscribers and the sugary pop
of boy bands.
 &HT;    But theirs is a notoriously fickle audience, one that's prone to
capricious changes of loyalty. So all concerned seemed relieved
when ``Millennium'' _ which set a sales record with more than 1.1
million first-week copies blowing out of stores _ shook out as the
biggest pop-culture happening this side of ``The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, radio stations have jumped all over ``Millennium's''
first single, ``I Want It That Way,'' making it the most added song
of the year so far. And the media blitz accompanying the album's
release has taken the Boys everywhere, from ``Saturday Night Live''
to Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, from ``Rosie'' to the World
Music Awards, not to mention into a tongue-in-cheek he-man ad
campaign.
 &HT;    ``It's kind of like, `Whew, that's a weight lifted off our
shoulders. They're still responding,''' says Kevin Richardson, at
27 the oldest member of the band.
 &HT;    ``It was great to be overseas a few weeks ago to promote the
single and do TV shows and stuff,'' he adds. ``We did `Top of the
Pops' in London with a live studio audience, and the first time we
went through the song, even though they had never heard it before,
they were singing it with us. That was a great sign.''
 &HT;    Richardson and his mates _ Dorough, Nick Carter, Brian Littrell
and A.J. McLean _ were well aware of the high expectations that
confronted ``Millennium.'' Coming on the heels of the Spice Girls'
success, the Orlando, Fla.-based quintet had created a phenomenon
that opened the pop-market doors for a slew of similar ``boy
groups,'' including 'N Sync, 98 Degrees and C-Note.
 &HT;    But the Backstreet Boys are the first of those bands to test its
audience's loyalty with a true followup to its breakthrough album.
Some of the others have exploited their success through the release
of quick-hit fodder such as holiday albums, but not through an
actual followup record. The pop trio Hanson, for instance, cashed
in with a live album and a collection of archival recordings, but
still hasn't released its next ``proper'' album.
 &HT;    But the Boys _ who deny persistent rumors of intense rivalries
with any of the other ``boy groups'' _ passed up such gap-fillers
in favor of concentrating on an album of all-new material. With the
success of ``Millennium,'' the gamble seems to have paid off.
 &HT;    ``We put the pressure on ourselves just to make better music,''
Richardson says. ``We're not really looking at the sales _ if you
make good music and keep trying to outdo your last album as far as
quality of music, the sales will come.
 &HT;    ``Something I came to realize in the past year _ which initially
bothered me but now I've accepted it _ is the fact that you just
can't please everybody,'' he says. ``Everybody is not going to like
our music, or us.
 &HT;    ``But we just want people to know that everything they hear on
the album is real, it's us. It's our voices singing. It's us coming
up with the treatments for our videos and the ideas for our stage
show.
 &HT;    ``We're not just the guys that are told what to do, where to be,
what to sing, how to look,'' Richardson says. ``We just want people
to know that this is us, not somebody else's idea of us.''
 &HT;    If Richardson sounds sensitive on that point, it's no wonder _
it's been an issue since last year, when the Backstreet Boys parted
ways with Lou Pearlman, the Orlando-based entrepreneur who brought
them together. Inspired by the success of the early-1990s group New
Kids on the Block, he recruited the Boys, beginning with
Richardson, from aspiring performers working at theme parks and
other venues around the Orlando area.
 &HT;    The group's 1995 debut made only a marginal splash in the
modern-rock-infatuated United States, though it was a big hit in
Europe. Two years later, however, ``Backstreet Boys'' cracked the
American market and made the Boys pinups around the world.
 &HT;    But a disagreement over finances led to a lawsuit against
Pearlman, who had built a stable of other pop acts, including 'N
Sync. Eventually the case was settled out of court.
 &HT;    The lawsuit, along with several family deaths and open-heart
surgery for Littrell, made what should have been a celebratory 1998
into what Richardson calls ``the hardest of my 27 years on the
planet.''
 &HT;    ``Millennium'' represents a new approach, he adds. Crucial
players from the last album remain, notably songwriter/producer Max
Martin _ who also scored recently with Britney Spears _ but
Richardson says the five singers themselves took a greater role in
creating and overseeing the music this time around. He co-wrote
``Back to Your Heart,'' while Littrell co-wrote three, including
the album-closing ``The Perfect Fan,'' a tribute to his mother
featuring his high-school choir.
 &HT;    ``We want to get involved and write more,'' says Richardson,
adding that the other members wrote songs that were not chosen for
the album. ``But, at the same time, we realize it's a growing
process _ we don't want to just jump into it and say `OK, we're
going to write this whole album ourselves.' They still have to be
of a certain caliber, no matter who wrote them.
 &HT;    ``We feel like we've grown on this album,'' he concludes. ``The
album's deeper, lyrically, but it's not over our young fans'
heads.''
 &HT;    Richardson says the group is acutely aware of the delicate
balance between delivering on fans' expectations and stagnating.
 &HT;    The heavy radio play for ``I Want It That Way'' was, he says,
``kind of like a weight being lifted off our shoulders. They're
still responding.'' Edgier dance tracks such as ``Don't Want You
Back'' followed, giving their fans a chance to digest the album a
bit first.
 &HT;    ``We're just trying to evolve with the times in order to stay in
the pop-music scene,'' Richardson says, ``just like Madonna's done,
just like Janet and Michael, so we have a long career.''
 &HT;    And the Boys _ who are touring Europe throughout the summer
before bringing their in-the-round stage production to North
America _ don't expect much help from the critics, who as a rule
don't give much respect to this kind of aim-to-please pop.
 &HT;    ``Critics are critics,'' Richardson says. ``We're not trying to
be the Joni Mitchell of our time or the Jimi Hendrix of our time.
We're just trying to make good music and make people happy and
forget about their problems. We're not trying to send a message.''
 &HT;    The criticism is frustrating, he admits.
 &HT;    ``But what can you do?'' he says with a shrug. ``We're happy
with what we're putting out, and so are millions of other people.
We're happy about that, too.''

 (Includes a color slide of Rupert Everett with Michael G. Hagerty
in a scene from ``Inspector Gadget.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rupert Everett doesn't much care if people think it's possible
for an openly gay man to be a major Hollywood star.
 &HT;    But if he can't, maybe it isn't possible, because in every other
respect Everett is the ideal big-screen leading man. He's drop-dead
gorgeous in the old-fashioned, movie-star way, with rugged, dark
looks, a sculptured body, a full head of dark, wavy hair and a
voice that's smooth as silk.
 &HT;    All of the above were on ample display in his breakthrough
performance as Julia Roberts' gay editor in ``My Best Friend's
Wedding'' (1997). Despite her starpower, Everett stole the picture
with his deadpan wit, his subtle smile and his killer rendition of
``I Say a Little Prayer For You.''
 &HT;    Despite the fears of closeted stars, past and present, Everett
says that his open homosexuality hasn't hurt his career in the
least.
 &HT;    ``Coming out is one of the best things I've ever done,'' Everett
says. ``Let's face it, I'm just a sex machine to both genders. And,
frankly, it's very exhausting _ I need a lot of sleep.''
 &HT;    He looks like it early one morning as he enters a suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, visibly hung over, to talk about his
new film, ``Inspector Gadget,'' which will open July 23. In a
switch from his typically elegant image, Everett plays the vampy
villain Claw in the children's movie, opposite title hero Matthew
Broderick.
 &HT;    At 40, Everett has the charm of a young Cary Grant, even before
his order of aspirin arrives. Cutting a handsome figure in black
pants and a sweater, he has a voice that rumbles low and sexy until
one recurring question lends an edge of serious anger.
 &HT;    Over and over again for days, journalists have asked him if an
openly gay man can become a sex symbol in Hollywood, and he's
frankly tired of the question.
 &HT;    ``I don't mean to sound defensive, but sexuality is not an
issue,'' he says tightly. ``A gay person can play a straight role
and a straight person can play a gay role. It's just acting, isn't
it?''
 &HT;    Everett ought to know about acting. His two most recent films
have offered plum roles from the pens of William Shakespeare, as
Oberon in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1999), and Oscar Wilde, as
the witty womanizer Lord Goring in the current ``An Ideal
Husband.''
 &HT;    After such high-toned fare, he says, he jumped at the chance to
play a Disney bad guy.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to make a movie for children where I could
play the nasty,'' he says. ``Children enjoy these characters so
much.''
 &HT;    His own childhood was largely free of such pleasures, he says.
Growing up in a strict British military family, he wasn't
encouraged to indulge his natural instinct toward performing.
 &HT;    ``I was expected to go into the armed forces or into the stock
exchange,'' he recalls, ``but I was too much of a celebrity seeker
for those professions. I was always dreaming of being famous _ I
even prayed for fame and celebrity.''
 &HT;    He dropped out of boarding school at 15 to study acting in
London, but at 17 was kicked out of acting school for
insubordination. Broke and on the streets, Everett didn't know
where to turn.
 &HT;    ``I fell into prostitution,'' he admits. ``I was a struggling
actor who got propositioned one day outside a subway station. The
guy offered me a massive amount of money.''
 &HT;    That period in his life lasted only briefly, he adds. Some early
acting opportunities and modeling work helped him straighten out
his life.
 &HT;    By this time he had come to terms with his sexual orientation.
 &HT;    ``I think I always knew I was gay,'' he says. ``For a while I
thought I might also be heterosexual, because I enjoyed being with
women. The problem was, a girlfriend was never enough for me and I
wasn't enough for them. Things had to change.''
 &HT;    From a career point of view, it really wasn't a big deal, he
adds.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd be working in America,'' he says, ``so it
really didn't matter. In Europe, people are not hung up on
sexuality, especially when it comes to entertainers. They judge
them on merit and talent.''
 &HT;    His early film career featured strong performances in ``Another
Country'' (1984), ``Dance With a Stranger'' (1985) and ``Duet for
One'' (1986), but it wasn't until ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' that
he broke through to the fame he'd always longed for.
 &HT;    Predictably, it wasn't everything he'd hoped.
 &HT;    ``The horrible thing about fame is that it fluctuates all the
time,'' Everett says. ``You get used to everyone loving you, and
then it hurts when they stop. Then it's very weird when they start
loving you again.
 &HT;    ``It's also like being on this treadmill,'' he adds. ``I know
there's always someone else who is going to get the job I want.
There's always someone coming up _ someone in front of you, someone
behind you, someone who does it better.
 &HT;    ``Of course, you can take all this with a pinch of salt,'' he
says, ``but I don't like salt!''
 &HT;    In the meantime, though, Everett is having a ball, especially
making ``The Next Best Thing'' _ about a woman who has a son with
her gay best friend, and the ensuing complications _ with his
friend Madonna.
 &HT;    ``She's a pro at handling fame,'' the actor says. ``But the
problem is that Madonna has energy like no one else _ she just
drives through every obstacle.''
 &HT;    Of course, he adds, he himself is much the same way.
 &HT;    ``One of my best friends is an English guy,'' he says, ``and he
never wants to see me _ he says I have too much energy and I make
him feel depressed.''
 &HT;    Currently in the works is Everett's first stab at screenwriting,
a script that would reunite him with Roberts in a story that is
bound to be controversial _ if only behind certain closed doors in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I will play the most famous stars in America,'' he
says eagerly. ``I'm a big action hero, she's Miss American Pie.
We're been married for 15 years. We're People magazine's No. 1
couple every year. We're Bill and Hillary's best friends.''
 &HT;    The twist: It's all a sham, a marriage of convenience _ one of
them is gay.
 &HT;    Asked if this is based on any specific Hollywood actor, actress
or marriage, Everett laughs wickedly. Then ignores the question
entirely.
 &HT;    Actually, he says later, there are days when he's sorry the
public knows he's gay.
 &HT;    ``When you're an actor, I think it's better when the public
knows nothing about you,'' Everett says. ``I think the public
should be able to make you into what they want you to be.
 &HT;    ``In the old days in Hollywood, an actor's persona was made up
by the studio,'' he adds. ``These public images had nothing to do
with the reality of these actors as human beings. In a way it kept
careers going, because the public wasn't interested in the actor _
they were interested in their films.''
 &HT;    One thing's for sure, he says: He has no interest in being a
spokesman or poster child for out actors.
 &HT;    ``From my point of view,'' he says, ``if I had to wear a banner
across my chest and write something on it, I wouldn't write `gay.'
I'd write `actor.'''

GHOST STORY: JAN DE BONT DIRECTS `THE HAUNTING'

 (Includes a color slide of Jan De Bont directing a scene from ``The
Haunting.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jan De Bont's latest film, a sentimental, low-budget drama about
four old ladies swapping sad stories over tea in the English
countryside, is about to ...
 &HT;    Yeah, right.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I think about doing smaller films, but right now I
have a lot of energy and I need to be on big films,'' says De Bont,
the high-powered, Dutch-born director of ``Speed'' (1994),
``Twister'' (1996) and ``Speed 2'' (1998). ``I might get a little
bored, though I think directors who do smaller films are really
great.
 &HT;    ``Directors should do the things they're better at,'' he says.
``Making my kind of movie is very hard and not always a lot of fun,
because there's a lot more pressure from the studio, a lot more
press, and it's nerve-wracking to get them done.
 &HT;    ``That's the kind of pressure I could sometimes really do
without,'' he says with a chuckle, ``and I don't think you have as
much of it on a small drama. But I'm happy doing what I do.''
 &HT;    In other words, staging emotional roller-coaster rides for his
audiences _ and De Bont is back doing that thing he does with ``The
Haunting,'' a $75 million horror film based on Shirley Jackson's
1959 novel, ``The Haunting of Hill House.'' Her chilling tome also
served as the source material for Robert Wise's 1963 film classic
of the same name.
 &HT;    The new film unfolds in contemporary times, and stars Liam
Neeson as a psychologist whose work takes him, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson into an ominous New England
manor dominated by a tentacled bed, helix-shaped staircases, marble
griffins, a 14-foot chandelier and a massive stone fireplace.
 &HT;    All hell breaks loose as the house comes to life to scare the
bejabbers out of the group and, hopefully, the audience.
 &HT;    A thriller in the psychological-horror tradition of ``The
Innocents'' (1961), ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968), ``The Exorcist''
(1973) and ``The Shining'' (1980) _ all of which De Bont says
served as inspirations _ ``The Haunting'' opens nationwide on July
23.
 &HT;    In his version of the story, Wise created a palpable sense of
menace without ever letting his poltergeists appear on screen. De
Bont promises plenty of goose bumps, too, but he chose to employ
state-of-the-art special effects to show his evildoers in action.
 &HT;    ``The movie will not bombard you with effects,'' he says in his
tombstone-thick accent during a telephone call from a sound-editing
room at Skywalker Ranch, George Lucas' production facility just
north of San Francisco. ``We have 110 or so effects shots, which is
nothing compared to most summer movies.
 &HT;    ``There was a lot more written in the book than Robert Wise was
able to put on the screen,'' he adds. ``That doesn't mean that all
of a sudden we're going to show you everything _ there's still a
lot you have to imagine.''
 &HT;    Besides, De Bont says, in the age of ``Scream'' (1996) and
``Hannibal'' (1999), even the most gruesome special effects don't
have the impact they once had. With ``The Haunting,'' he's
returning to the idea that less is more.
 &HT;    ``It's not only what you can't see, but what you can hear and
can't see that can scare you,'' he says. ``It's quite often the
smallest sound that starts the imagination going. You can have a
big, dark room, but it doesn't mean much until something _ that
little sound _ sets off the imagination.''
 &HT;    So crucial was the aural element, the director adds, that he
recorded sounds prior to filming. On the set, he had this library
of digital sound effects available at the touch of a button _
helpfully marked ``Moaning,'' ``Loud Creak'' and so on.
 &HT;    This emphasis on sound is new for a director who began his
career as a cinematographer, providing visuals for such films as
``Die Hard'' (1988), ``Flatliners'' (1990), ``Basic Instinct''
(1992) and ``Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992). But for this project, he
felt, he had no other choice.
 &HT;    ``Each time before when I'd done a movie, either as a director
or a director of photography, the actors had problems reacting to
things that were not there,'' he says. ``It was hard for them to
imagine what would be where.
 &HT;    ``In this case, the house is such a major character that it had
to be reacting. There had to be something for the actors to react
to, something to stimulate their fears,'' De Bont says. ``By having
the sound effects there, I could instantly deliver a sound, in
between lines even, so that the actors could always react to
exactly the right thing at the right time and in the right
direction.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't any guesswork, and that helped the actors
tremendously.''
 &HT;    Such concern for his actors might surprise longtime De Bont
observers. After all, he's widely known as a driven, demanding and
sometimes impossible-to-work-with director, to the point of
inspiring a reported crew mutiny during the filming of ``Twister.''
 &HT;    ``It's partially true,'' De Bont admits. ``On `Twister,' all I
did was explain to the actors and the crew about things that
weren't there. That leaves you so little time to spend on the other
things that are needed for the rest of a scene.
 &HT;    ``On `The Haunting,' I had time to sit with the actors and
rehearse, before we started the movie and on the set,'' he says,
``On my other films we'd always been victims of the effects,
because they were kind of catapulting the story. On `The Haunting,'
it's the actors who propel the story.
 &HT;    ``That's a huge change, such an interesting and exciting
change.''
 &HT;    While finishing editing ``The Haunting,'' De Bont has his eye on
several percolating projects. In the coming year he'll serve as
executive producer on Steven Spielberg's sci-fi epic ``Minority
Report,'' to star Tom Cruise, and will also produce ``The
Paperboy,'' popular Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's
English-language debut.
 &HT;    Despite the flurry of activity, however, De Bont will be closely
watching the reaction to ``The Haunting.'' So will the Hollywood
studios, he knows: The director stumbled mightily with the
disastrous ``Speed 2,'' and a second consecutive misfire won't be
so easily forgotten or forgiven.
 &HT;    ``I think the stakes are high for any director on any new
movie,'' says De Bont, who lives with his wife and children in Los
Angeles.
 &HT;    ```Speed 2' was a little bit of a victim of not having a
finished script before we started to shoot,'' he admits. ``There
were many times, even in pre-production, that I said, `We shouldn't
make this movie. It's not ready yet.'
 &HT;    ``The studio wanted the movie, and once there's no turning
around you just try to make the best of what you have,'' he adds.
``You cannot make these big movies, with effects _ with water,
which is the most horrible thing to do _ and write it on the set as
you go.''
 &HT;    De Bont pauses.
 &HT;    ``Listen, you're only as good as your last movie,'' he says
without anger. ``It doesn't matter who you are, what you are or
what the stakes are.
 &HT;    ``Also, if you do something that's good again, people really
embrace you,'' De Bont says. ``I've learned from working with a lot
of directors that nobody makes hit after hit after hit. It just
doesn't exist.
 &HT;    ``You can't guess what will happen. Audiences' tastes change
constantly, even by the month.''

 (Includes a color slide of Eddie in a scene from ``Frasier.'') 
 By CATHERINE DAWSON and BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every television star is a hot-air generator who dreams of
directing between on-the-set temper tantrums and off-season demands
for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't even have a bad word to say about anyone they've ever
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Check out our exclusive look behind the scenes with four
frequently underappreciated but always valuable prime-time pooches.
 &UR; EDDIE OF `FRASIER' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who can tell what's really going on in Eddie's mind during those
unnerving long stares at Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer)?
</P>
<P>
   Well, trainer Mathilde deCagny has a fair idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a connection between us,'' she says. ``It's kind of
interesting to watch his thoughts going on ... sometimes I can see
him think, `What's next, what's next?'''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer and Moose _ Eddie's real name, inspired by his hefty
25 pounds and 14-inch stature, both large for his breed _ live with
six other acting dogs in Venice, Calif. According to her, the
longer the show runs, the harder it gets to keep Moose interested
in his ``Frasier'' scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose is an old pro, he's been in the business too long,
almost,'' deCagny says. ``It's at the point where to work him is
really challenging. He wants to outsmart everybody _ and he can, he
knows the routine. If I rehearse him too much, then he'll know too
much. I have to keep him guessing a little bit. It's a very fine
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Moose's 4-year-old son Enzo has come aboard as his stand-in
during rehearsals, and also has taken over the more athletic
stunts. At 9, deCagny says, Moose still has a lot of energy, but
using Enzo as an understudy helps keep the Jack Russell terrier
from getting bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very obnoxious little dog, annoying,'' she adds of
Moose. ``The character he plays on `Frasier' is pretty much what
he's like in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the average dog that is loving,'' deCagny says.
``Moose is independent and has a selfish side _ yet he's very
lovable, extremely attractive and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of Moose's early years will be revealed in a book to be
released next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Moose's life story from his point of view,'' deCagny
says. ``Before and after `Frasier,' the celebrities he's met. It's
not just about work, but his home and dog life too.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; HAPPY OF `7TH HEAVEN' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven's'' Happy wasn't too jolly the day trainer Shawna
Hamann tried to slip her paws into rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   But what could Hamann do? The script called for the Camden
family dog to walk onto the set in rain boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had velcro closures,'' Hamann recalls, ``and she'd lift
up her feet real weird. Happy finally learned to walk in them, but
she didn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old, terrier-mix mutt dresses up often on the show
and, Hamann says, it's never easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had to learn to wear a lot of stuff,'' the trainer
recalls. ``She had to wear a tutu in one show, bow ties and feather
boas around her neck. That's the hardest thing, getting them used
to stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy has to handle every trick because she's a crossbreed, and
Hamann can't find a matching stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between her ears, her hair coat and her hair color, we've had
a really hard time finding another dog,'' she says. ``And we go
looking at pounds all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy is herself a rescued stray, so named because ``she was so
enthusiastic when we found her,'' Hamann recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven'' is Happy's first crack at acting, and Hamann says
her skittish nature sometimes makes training harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was probably abused before we got her,'' the
trainer says, ``because she's a bit wary of some men. If somebody
is there that she doesn't know, she gets a bit shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she learns stuff really fast, and she's really smart.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; MURRAY OF `MAD ABOUT YOU' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maui isn't as dumb as Murray, the sitcom character he portrayed
for seven seasons on the recently concluded ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   On the series, when Murray wasn't inexplicably creating piles
out of Paul's socks he was ramming headfirst into walls. But in
real life, the 11-year-old border-collie mix has a reputation as a
consummate professional.
</P>
<P>
   The son of two actors, Maui get his start in the business when
he began doubling for his mother on the set of the 1991 movie
``Bingo!'' Soon after he auditioned for ``Mad About You'' and won
the job, replacing the dog initially cast in the pilot, who the
producers thought was too enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his extensive trick repertoire, Maui's best work came
when there was little for him to do. In the real world, most dogs
aren't constantly upstaging their owners. Instead, they can be
found lounging on the couch or hanging around the supper table.
</P>
<P>
   Maui was perfect in that role, serving as the silent comic foil
to Paul and Jamie's zaniness. Evidently, producers saw fit to
reward the floppy-eared canine. During the run of ``Mad About
You,'' Maui basked in his celebrity status with limo rides, an
air-conditioned trailer and even his own stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike many Hollywood stars, Maui is as likable offscreen
as on. When he wasn't working, he spent his spare time in support
of worthy causes, including cancer- and AIDS-research events and
Humane Society benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Mad About You'' has ended, Maui is enjoying
semi-retirement at Boone's Animals for Hollywood in Castaic,
Calif. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; WISHBONE OF `WISHBONE' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is one in a million _ or at least one in a hundred.
That's how many other dogs the 11-year-old Jack Russell terrier had
to beat out to win the coveted role of Wishbone, PBS's
history-hopping pooch.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a dream job for an actor, canine or otherwise.
``Wishbone'' is a children's series that takes an innovative
approach to works of classic literature, casting Soccer in such
diverse roles as Pip from ``Great Expectations,'' Dr. Frankenstein,
Hercules, King Midas and even the notorious Dr. Jekyll.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Wishbone'' isn't the Connecticut-born terrier's only
acting experience. He's appeared in a number of dog-food
commercials for Mighty Dog and Chuck Wagon, and in print ads for
Nike. Soccer also recently completed his first feature-length film,
``Wishbone's Dog Days of the West,'' which is currently available
on home video.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Soccer is often upstaged by his ``Wishbone''
wardrobe, for which designer Stephen M. Chudej won an Emmy Award.
On the show, Wishbone is seen as everyone from Quasimodo to Robin
Hood, providing impressive challenges to the dog's ability to
maneuver in the elaborate getups _ challenges to which, so far, he
has always proven equal.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, who earned his name because of his predilection for the
black-and-white ball, has completed 40 episodes of the
award-winning ``Wishbone'' since 1995 _ but not without some
professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Like many human actors, Soccer has an entourage to help get him
through the day. No fewer than four stand-ins provide relief when
the work becomes too much, while comedian/voiceover artist Larry
Brantley supplies Wishbone's vocals.

 (Includes a color slide of the Backstreet Boys performing live on
stage.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's Saturday afternoon in New York, and the Backstreet Boys _
except for Howie Dorough, who's across town rehearsing for a skit
on ``Saturday Night Live'' _ are trying on clothes.
 &HT;    These aren't just any duds, mind you _ these are the Tour
Costumes, the threads that for most of the rest of the year will
have to hold up under screaming loud enough and shrill enough to
pop stitching and summon dogs from every corner of the planet to
wherever the Backstreet Boys happen to be playing that night.
 &HT;    Yes, the Boys are back, complete with their new album, the
mightily hyped ``Millennium'' (Jive Records, 1999). It's the
eagerly awaited followup to ``Backstreet Boys'' (1997), which in
the process of selling 27 million copies worldwide launched a batch
of hits such as ``Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),'' ``As Long
As You Love Me'' and ``Everybody (Backstreet's Back),'' and made
the world safe again for Tiger Beat subscribers and the sugary pop
of boy bands.
 &HT;    But theirs is a notoriously fickle audience, one that's prone to
capricious changes of loyalty. So all concerned seemed relieved
when ``Millennium'' _ which set a sales record with more than 1.1
million first-week copies blowing out of stores _ shook out as the
biggest pop-culture happening this side of ``The Phantom Menace.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, radio stations have jumped all over ``Millennium's''
first single, ``I Want It That Way,'' making it the most added song
of the year so far. And the media blitz accompanying the album's
release has taken the Boys everywhere, from ``Saturday Night Live''
to Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, from ``Rosie'' to the World
Music Awards, not to mention into a tongue-in-cheek he-man ad
campaign.
 &HT;    ``It's kind of like, `Whew, that's a weight lifted off our
shoulders. They're still responding,''' says Kevin Richardson, at
27 the oldest member of the band.
 &HT;    ``It was great to be overseas a few weeks ago to promote the
single and do TV shows and stuff,'' he adds. ``We did `Top of the
Pops' in London with a live studio audience, and the first time we
went through the song, even though they had never heard it before,
they were singing it with us. That was a great sign.''
 &HT;    Richardson and his mates _ Dorough, Nick Carter, Brian Littrell
and A.J. McLean _ were well aware of the high expectations that
confronted ``Millennium.'' Coming on the heels of the Spice Girls'
success, the Orlando, Fla.-based quintet had created a phenomenon
that opened the pop-market doors for a slew of similar ``boy
groups,'' including 'N Sync, 98 Degrees and C-Note.
 &HT;    But the Backstreet Boys are the first of those bands to test its
audience's loyalty with a true followup to its breakthrough album.
Some of the others have exploited their success through the release
of quick-hit fodder such as holiday albums, but not through an
actual followup record. The pop trio Hanson, for instance, cashed
in with a live album and a collection of archival recordings, but
still hasn't released its next ``proper'' album.
 &HT;    But the Boys _ who deny persistent rumors of intense rivalries
with any of the other ``boy groups'' _ passed up such gap-fillers
in favor of concentrating on an album of all-new material. With the
success of ``Millennium,'' the gamble seems to have paid off.
 &HT;    ``We put the pressure on ourselves just to make better music,''
Richardson says. ``We're not really looking at the sales _ if you
make good music and keep trying to outdo your last album as far as
quality of music, the sales will come.
 &HT;    ``Something I came to realize in the past year _ which initially
bothered me but now I've accepted it _ is the fact that you just
can't please everybody,'' he says. ``Everybody is not going to like
our music, or us.
 &HT;    ``But we just want people to know that everything they hear on
the album is real, it's us. It's our voices singing. It's us coming
up with the treatments for our videos and the ideas for our stage
show.
 &HT;    ``We're not just the guys that are told what to do, where to be,
what to sing, how to look,'' Richardson says. ``We just want people
to know that this is us, not somebody else's idea of us.''
 &HT;    If Richardson sounds sensitive on that point, it's no wonder _
it's been an issue since last year, when the Backstreet Boys parted
ways with Lou Pearlman, the Orlando-based entrepreneur who brought
them together. Inspired by the success of the early-1990s group New
Kids on the Block, he recruited the Boys, beginning with
Richardson, from aspiring performers working at theme parks and
other venues around the Orlando area.
 &HT;    The group's 1995 debut made only a marginal splash in the
modern-rock-infatuated United States, though it was a big hit in
Europe. Two years later, however, ``Backstreet Boys'' cracked the
American market and made the Boys pinups around the world.
 &HT;    But a disagreement over finances led to a lawsuit against
Pearlman, who had built a stable of other pop acts, including 'N
Sync. Eventually the case was settled out of court.
 &HT;    The lawsuit, along with several family deaths and open-heart
surgery for Littrell, made what should have been a celebratory 1998
into what Richardson calls ``the hardest of my 27 years on the
planet.''
 &HT;    ``Millennium'' represents a new approach, he adds. Crucial
players from the last album remain, notably songwriter/producer Max
Martin _ who also scored recently with Britney Spears _ but
Richardson says the five singers themselves took a greater role in
creating and overseeing the music this time around. He co-wrote
``Back to Your Heart,'' while Littrell co-wrote three, including
the album-closing ``The Perfect Fan,'' a tribute to his mother
featuring his high-school choir.
 &HT;    ``We want to get involved and write more,'' says Richardson,
adding that the other members wrote songs that were not chosen for
the album. ``But, at the same time, we realize it's a growing
process _ we don't want to just jump into it and say `OK, we're
going to write this whole album ourselves.' They still have to be
of a certain caliber, no matter who wrote them.
 &HT;    ``We feel like we've grown on this album,'' he concludes. ``The
album's deeper, lyrically, but it's not over our young fans'
heads.''
 &HT;    Richardson says the group is acutely aware of the delicate
balance between delivering on fans' expectations and stagnating.
 &HT;    The heavy radio play for ``I Want It That Way'' was, he says,
``kind of like a weight being lifted off our shoulders. They're
still responding.'' Edgier dance tracks such as ``Don't Want You
Back'' followed, giving their fans a chance to digest the album a
bit first.
 &HT;    ``We're just trying to evolve with the times in order to stay in
the pop-music scene,'' Richardson says, ``just like Madonna's done,
just like Janet and Michael, so we have a long career.''
 &HT;    And the Boys _ who are touring Europe throughout the summer
before bringing their in-the-round stage production to North
America _ don't expect much help from the critics, who as a rule
don't give much respect to this kind of aim-to-please pop.
 &HT;    ``Critics are critics,'' Richardson says. ``We're not trying to
be the Joni Mitchell of our time or the Jimi Hendrix of our time.
We're just trying to make good music and make people happy and
forget about their problems. We're not trying to send a message.''
 &HT;    The criticism is frustrating, he admits.
 &HT;    ``But what can you do?'' he says with a shrug. ``We're happy
with what we're putting out, and so are millions of other people.
We're happy about that, too.''

BAD GUYS HAVE ALL THE FUN: RUPERT EVERETT SINKS HIS CLAW INTO

 (Includes a color slide of Rupert Everett with Michael G. Hagerty
in a scene from ``Inspector Gadget.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rupert Everett doesn't much care if people think it's possible
for an openly gay man to be a major Hollywood star.
 &HT;    But if he can't, maybe it isn't possible, because in every other
respect Everett is the ideal big-screen leading man. He's drop-dead
gorgeous in the old-fashioned, movie-star way, with rugged, dark
looks, a sculptured body, a full head of dark, wavy hair and a
voice that's smooth as silk.
 &HT;    All of the above were on ample display in his breakthrough
performance as Julia Roberts' gay editor in ``My Best Friend's
Wedding'' (1997). Despite her starpower, Everett stole the picture
with his deadpan wit, his subtle smile and his killer rendition of
``I Say a Little Prayer For You.''
 &HT;    Despite the fears of closeted stars, past and present, Everett
says that his open homosexuality hasn't hurt his career in the
least.
 &HT;    ``Coming out is one of the best things I've ever done,'' Everett
says. ``Let's face it, I'm just a sex machine to both genders. And,
frankly, it's very exhausting _ I need a lot of sleep.''
 &HT;    He looks like it early one morning as he enters a suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel, visibly hung over, to talk about his
new film, ``Inspector Gadget,'' which will open July 23. In a
switch from his typically elegant image, Everett plays the vampy
villain Claw in the children's movie, opposite title hero Matthew
Broderick.
 &HT;    At 40, Everett has the charm of a young Cary Grant, even before
his order of aspirin arrives. Cutting a handsome figure in black
pants and a sweater, he has a voice that rumbles low and sexy until
one recurring question lends an edge of serious anger.
 &HT;    Over and over again for days, journalists have asked him if an
openly gay man can become a sex symbol in Hollywood, and he's
frankly tired of the question.
 &HT;    ``I don't mean to sound defensive, but sexuality is not an
issue,'' he says tightly. ``A gay person can play a straight role
and a straight person can play a gay role. It's just acting, isn't
it?''
 &HT;    Everett ought to know about acting. His two most recent films
have offered plum roles from the pens of William Shakespeare, as
Oberon in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1999), and Oscar Wilde, as
the witty womanizer Lord Goring in the current ``An Ideal
Husband.''
 &HT;    After such high-toned fare, he says, he jumped at the chance to
play a Disney bad guy.
 &HT;    ``I always wanted to make a movie for children where I could
play the nasty,'' he says. ``Children enjoy these characters so
much.''
 &HT;    His own childhood was largely free of such pleasures, he says.
Growing up in a strict British military family, he wasn't
encouraged to indulge his natural instinct toward performing.
 &HT;    ``I was expected to go into the armed forces or into the stock
exchange,'' he recalls, ``but I was too much of a celebrity seeker
for those professions. I was always dreaming of being famous _ I
even prayed for fame and celebrity.''
 &HT;    He dropped out of boarding school at 15 to study acting in
London, but at 17 was kicked out of acting school for
insubordination. Broke and on the streets, Everett didn't know
where to turn.
 &HT;    ``I fell into prostitution,'' he admits. ``I was a struggling
actor who got propositioned one day outside a subway station. The
guy offered me a massive amount of money.''
 &HT;    That period in his life lasted only briefly, he adds. Some early
acting opportunities and modeling work helped him straighten out
his life.
 &HT;    By this time he had come to terms with his sexual orientation.
 &HT;    ``I think I always knew I was gay,'' he says. ``For a while I
thought I might also be heterosexual, because I enjoyed being with
women. The problem was, a girlfriend was never enough for me and I
wasn't enough for them. Things had to change.''
 &HT;    From a career point of view, it really wasn't a big deal, he
adds.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd be working in America,'' he says, ``so it
really didn't matter. In Europe, people are not hung up on
sexuality, especially when it comes to entertainers. They judge
them on merit and talent.''
 &HT;    His early film career featured strong performances in ``Another
Country'' (1984), ``Dance With a Stranger'' (1985) and ``Duet for
One'' (1986), but it wasn't until ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' that
he broke through to the fame he'd always longed for.
 &HT;    Predictably, it wasn't everything he'd hoped.
 &HT;    ``The horrible thing about fame is that it fluctuates all the
time,'' Everett says. ``You get used to everyone loving you, and
then it hurts when they stop. Then it's very weird when they start
loving you again.
 &HT;    ``It's also like being on this treadmill,'' he adds. ``I know
there's always someone else who is going to get the job I want.
There's always someone coming up _ someone in front of you, someone
behind you, someone who does it better.
 &HT;    ``Of course, you can take all this with a pinch of salt,'' he
says, ``but I don't like salt!''
 &HT;    In the meantime, though, Everett is having a ball, especially
making ``The Next Best Thing'' _ about a woman who has a son with
her gay best friend, and the ensuing complications _ with his
friend Madonna.
 &HT;    ``She's a pro at handling fame,'' the actor says. ``But the
problem is that Madonna has energy like no one else _ she just
drives through every obstacle.''
 &HT;    Of course, he adds, he himself is much the same way.
 &HT;    ``One of my best friends is an English guy,'' he says, ``and he
never wants to see me _ he says I have too much energy and I make
him feel depressed.''
 &HT;    Currently in the works is Everett's first stab at screenwriting,
a script that would reunite him with Roberts in a story that is
bound to be controversial _ if only behind certain closed doors in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I will play the most famous stars in America,'' he
says eagerly. ``I'm a big action hero, she's Miss American Pie.
We're been married for 15 years. We're People magazine's No. 1
couple every year. We're Bill and Hillary's best friends.''
 &HT;    The twist: It's all a sham, a marriage of convenience _ one of
them is gay.
 &HT;    Asked if this is based on any specific Hollywood actor, actress
or marriage, Everett laughs wickedly. Then ignores the question
entirely.
 &HT;    Actually, he says later, there are days when he's sorry the
public knows he's gay.
 &HT;    ``When you're an actor, I think it's better when the public
knows nothing about you,'' Everett says. ``I think the public
should be able to make you into what they want you to be.
 &HT;    ``In the old days in Hollywood, an actor's persona was made up
by the studio,'' he adds. ``These public images had nothing to do
with the reality of these actors as human beings. In a way it kept
careers going, because the public wasn't interested in the actor _
they were interested in their films.''
 &HT;    One thing's for sure, he says: He has no interest in being a
spokesman or poster child for out actors.
 &HT;    ``From my point of view,'' he says, ``if I had to wear a banner
across my chest and write something on it, I wouldn't write `gay.'
I'd write `actor.'''

GHOST STORY: JAN DE BONT DIRECTS `THE HAUNTING'

 (Includes a color slide of Jan De Bont directing a scene from ``The
Haunting.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jan De Bont's latest film, a sentimental, low-budget drama about
four old ladies swapping sad stories over tea in the English
countryside, is about to ...
 &HT;    Yeah, right.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I think about doing smaller films, but right now I
have a lot of energy and I need to be on big films,'' says De Bont,
the high-powered, Dutch-born director of ``Speed'' (1994),
``Twister'' (1996) and ``Speed 2'' (1998). ``I might get a little
bored, though I think directors who do smaller films are really
great.
 &HT;    ``Directors should do the things they're better at,'' he says.
``Making my kind of movie is very hard and not always a lot of fun,
because there's a lot more pressure from the studio, a lot more
press, and it's nerve-wracking to get them done.
 &HT;    ``That's the kind of pressure I could sometimes really do
without,'' he says with a chuckle, ``and I don't think you have as
much of it on a small drama. But I'm happy doing what I do.''
 &HT;    In other words, staging emotional roller-coaster rides for his
audiences _ and De Bont is back doing that thing he does with ``The
Haunting,'' a $75 million horror film based on Shirley Jackson's
1959 novel, ``The Haunting of Hill House.'' Her chilling tome also
served as the source material for Robert Wise's 1963 film classic
of the same name.
 &HT;    The new film unfolds in contemporary times, and stars Liam
Neeson as a psychologist whose work takes him, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson into an ominous New England
manor dominated by a tentacled bed, helix-shaped staircases, marble
griffins, a 14-foot chandelier and a massive stone fireplace.
 &HT;    All hell breaks loose as the house comes to life to scare the
bejabbers out of the group and, hopefully, the audience.
 &HT;    A thriller in the psychological-horror tradition of ``The
Innocents'' (1961), ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968), ``The Exorcist''
(1973) and ``The Shining'' (1980) _ all of which De Bont says
served as inspirations _ ``The Haunting'' opens nationwide on July
23.
 &HT;    In his version of the story, Wise created a palpable sense of
menace without ever letting his poltergeists appear on screen. De
Bont promises plenty of goose bumps, too, but he chose to employ
state-of-the-art special effects to show his evildoers in action.
 &HT;    ``The movie will not bombard you with effects,'' he says in his
tombstone-thick accent during a telephone call from a sound-editing
room at Skywalker Ranch, George Lucas' production facility just
north of San Francisco. ``We have 110 or so effects shots, which is
nothing compared to most summer movies.
 &HT;    ``There was a lot more written in the book than Robert Wise was
able to put on the screen,'' he adds. ``That doesn't mean that all
of a sudden we're going to show you everything _ there's still a
lot you have to imagine.''
 &HT;    Besides, De Bont says, in the age of ``Scream'' (1996) and
``Hannibal'' (1999), even the most gruesome special effects don't
have the impact they once had. With ``The Haunting,'' he's
returning to the idea that less is more.
 &HT;    ``It's not only what you can't see, but what you can hear and
can't see that can scare you,'' he says. ``It's quite often the
smallest sound that starts the imagination going. You can have a
big, dark room, but it doesn't mean much until something _ that
little sound _ sets off the imagination.''
 &HT;    So crucial was the aural element, the director adds, that he
recorded sounds prior to filming. On the set, he had this library
of digital sound effects available at the touch of a button _
helpfully marked ``Moaning,'' ``Loud Creak'' and so on.
 &HT;    This emphasis on sound is new for a director who began his
career as a cinematographer, providing visuals for such films as
``Die Hard'' (1988), ``Flatliners'' (1990), ``Basic Instinct''
(1992) and ``Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992). But for this project, he
felt, he had no other choice.
 &HT;    ``Each time before when I'd done a movie, either as a director
or a director of photography, the actors had problems reacting to
things that were not there,'' he says. ``It was hard for them to
imagine what would be where.
 &HT;    ``In this case, the house is such a major character that it had
to be reacting. There had to be something for the actors to react
to, something to stimulate their fears,'' De Bont says. ``By having
the sound effects there, I could instantly deliver a sound, in
between lines even, so that the actors could always react to
exactly the right thing at the right time and in the right
direction.
 &HT;    ``There wasn't any guesswork, and that helped the actors
tremendously.''
 &HT;    Such concern for his actors might surprise longtime De Bont
observers. After all, he's widely known as a driven, demanding and
sometimes impossible-to-work-with director, to the point of
inspiring a reported crew mutiny during the filming of ``Twister.''
 &HT;    ``It's partially true,'' De Bont admits. ``On `Twister,' all I
did was explain to the actors and the crew about things that
weren't there. That leaves you so little time to spend on the other
things that are needed for the rest of a scene.
 &HT;    ``On `The Haunting,' I had time to sit with the actors and
rehearse, before we started the movie and on the set,'' he says,
``On my other films we'd always been victims of the effects,
because they were kind of catapulting the story. On `The Haunting,'
it's the actors who propel the story.
 &HT;    ``That's a huge change, such an interesting and exciting
change.''
 &HT;    While finishing editing ``The Haunting,'' De Bont has his eye on
several percolating projects. In the coming year he'll serve as
executive producer on Steven Spielberg's sci-fi epic ``Minority
Report,'' to star Tom Cruise, and will also produce ``The
Paperboy,'' popular Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's
English-language debut.
 &HT;    Despite the flurry of activity, however, De Bont will be closely
watching the reaction to ``The Haunting.'' So will the Hollywood
studios, he knows: The director stumbled mightily with the
disastrous ``Speed 2,'' and a second consecutive misfire won't be
so easily forgotten or forgiven.
 &HT;    ``I think the stakes are high for any director on any new
movie,'' says De Bont, who lives with his wife and children in Los
Angeles.
 &HT;    ```Speed 2' was a little bit of a victim of not having a
finished script before we started to shoot,'' he admits. ``There
were many times, even in pre-production, that I said, `We shouldn't
make this movie. It's not ready yet.'
 &HT;    ``The studio wanted the movie, and once there's no turning
around you just try to make the best of what you have,'' he adds.
``You cannot make these big movies, with effects _ with water,
which is the most horrible thing to do _ and write it on the set as
you go.''
 &HT;    De Bont pauses.
 &HT;    ``Listen, you're only as good as your last movie,'' he says
without anger. ``It doesn't matter who you are, what you are or
what the stakes are.
 &HT;    ``Also, if you do something that's good again, people really
embrace you,'' De Bont says. ``I've learned from working with a lot
of directors that nobody makes hit after hit after hit. It just
doesn't exist.
 &HT;    ``You can't guess what will happen. Audiences' tastes change
constantly, even by the month.''

 (Includes a color slide of Eddie in a scene from ``Frasier.'') 
 By CATHERINE DAWSON and BRIAN HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every television star is a hot-air generator who dreams of
directing between on-the-set temper tantrums and off-season demands
for more money.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't even have a bad word to say about anyone they've ever
worked with.
</P>
<P>
   Check out our exclusive look behind the scenes with four
frequently underappreciated but always valuable prime-time pooches.
 &UR; EDDIE OF `FRASIER' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who can tell what's really going on in Eddie's mind during those
unnerving long stares at Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer)?
</P>
<P>
   Well, trainer Mathilde deCagny has a fair idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a connection between us,'' she says. ``It's kind of
interesting to watch his thoughts going on ... sometimes I can see
him think, `What's next, what's next?'''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer and Moose _ Eddie's real name, inspired by his hefty
25 pounds and 14-inch stature, both large for his breed _ live with
six other acting dogs in Venice, Calif. According to her, the
longer the show runs, the harder it gets to keep Moose interested
in his ``Frasier'' scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose is an old pro, he's been in the business too long,
almost,'' deCagny says. ``It's at the point where to work him is
really challenging. He wants to outsmart everybody _ and he can, he
knows the routine. If I rehearse him too much, then he'll know too
much. I have to keep him guessing a little bit. It's a very fine
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Moose's 4-year-old son Enzo has come aboard as his stand-in
during rehearsals, and also has taken over the more athletic
stunts. At 9, deCagny says, Moose still has a lot of energy, but
using Enzo as an understudy helps keep the Jack Russell terrier
from getting bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very obnoxious little dog, annoying,'' she adds of
Moose. ``The character he plays on `Frasier' is pretty much what
he's like in real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the average dog that is loving,'' deCagny says.
``Moose is independent and has a selfish side _ yet he's very
lovable, extremely attractive and smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of Moose's early years will be revealed in a book to be
released next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Moose's life story from his point of view,'' deCagny
says. ``Before and after `Frasier,' the celebrities he's met. It's
not just about work, but his home and dog life too.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; HAPPY OF `7TH HEAVEN' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven's'' Happy wasn't too jolly the day trainer Shawna
Hamann tried to slip her paws into rubber boots.
</P>
<P>
   But what could Hamann do? The script called for the Camden
family dog to walk onto the set in rain boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had velcro closures,'' Hamann recalls, ``and she'd lift
up her feet real weird. Happy finally learned to walk in them, but
she didn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old, terrier-mix mutt dresses up often on the show
and, Hamann says, it's never easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had to learn to wear a lot of stuff,'' the trainer
recalls. ``She had to wear a tutu in one show, bow ties and feather
boas around her neck. That's the hardest thing, getting them used
to stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy has to handle every trick because she's a crossbreed, and
Hamann can't find a matching stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between her ears, her hair coat and her hair color, we've had
a really hard time finding another dog,'' she says. ``And we go
looking at pounds all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy is herself a rescued stray, so named because ``she was so
enthusiastic when we found her,'' Hamann recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``7th Heaven'' is Happy's first crack at acting, and Hamann says
her skittish nature sometimes makes training harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was probably abused before we got her,'' the
trainer says, ``because she's a bit wary of some men. If somebody
is there that she doesn't know, she gets a bit shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she learns stuff really fast, and she's really smart.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; MURRAY OF `MAD ABOUT YOU' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maui isn't as dumb as Murray, the sitcom character he portrayed
for seven seasons on the recently concluded ``Mad About You.''
</P>
<P>
   On the series, when Murray wasn't inexplicably creating piles
out of Paul's socks he was ramming headfirst into walls. But in
real life, the 11-year-old border-collie mix has a reputation as a
consummate professional.
</P>
<P>
   The son of two actors, Maui get his start in the business when
he began doubling for his mother on the set of the 1991 movie
``Bingo!'' Soon after he auditioned for ``Mad About You'' and won
the job, replacing the dog initially cast in the pilot, who the
producers thought was too enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his extensive trick repertoire, Maui's best work came
when there was little for him to do. In the real world, most dogs
aren't constantly upstaging their owners. Instead, they can be
found lounging on the couch or hanging around the supper table.
</P>
<P>
   Maui was perfect in that role, serving as the silent comic foil
to Paul and Jamie's zaniness. Evidently, producers saw fit to
reward the floppy-eared canine. During the run of ``Mad About
You,'' Maui basked in his celebrity status with limo rides, an
air-conditioned trailer and even his own stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike many Hollywood stars, Maui is as likable offscreen
as on. When he wasn't working, he spent his spare time in support
of worthy causes, including cancer- and AIDS-research events and
Humane Society benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Now that ``Mad About You'' has ended, Maui is enjoying
semi-retirement at Boone's Animals for Hollywood in Castaic,
Calif. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; WISHBONE OF `WISHBONE' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is one in a million _ or at least one in a hundred.
That's how many other dogs the 11-year-old Jack Russell terrier had
to beat out to win the coveted role of Wishbone, PBS's
history-hopping pooch.
</P>
<P>
   The role is a dream job for an actor, canine or otherwise.
``Wishbone'' is a children's series that takes an innovative
approach to works of classic literature, casting Soccer in such
diverse roles as Pip from ``Great Expectations,'' Dr. Frankenstein,
Hercules, King Midas and even the notorious Dr. Jekyll.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Wishbone'' isn't the Connecticut-born terrier's only
acting experience. He's appeared in a number of dog-food
commercials for Mighty Dog and Chuck Wagon, and in print ads for
Nike. Soccer also recently completed his first feature-length film,
``Wishbone's Dog Days of the West,'' which is currently available
on home video.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Soccer is often upstaged by his ``Wishbone''
wardrobe, for which designer Stephen M. Chudej won an Emmy Award.
On the show, Wishbone is seen as everyone from Quasimodo to Robin
Hood, providing impressive challenges to the dog's ability to
maneuver in the elaborate getups _ challenges to which, so far, he
has always proven equal.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, who earned his name because of his predilection for the
black-and-white ball, has completed 40 episodes of the
award-winning ``Wishbone'' since 1995 _ but not without some
professional help.
</P>
<P>
   Like many human actors, Soccer has an entourage to help get him
through the day. No fewer than four stand-ins provide relief when
the work becomes too much, while comedian/voiceover artist Larry
Brantley supplies Wishbone's vocals.

 &HT;    BRAZIL: DOWN THE AMAZON
 &HT;    Just east of Manaus, the dark, rapid Black River meets the
creamy, tranquil Solimes. The two clash for about five miles in the
same channel, mixing slowly.
 &HT;    It's no easier to mix the modes of cargo transportation on the
Amazon or throughout Brazil. But one company has found a way to
conquer not only Amazon logistics, but other intermodal barriers
blocking inland cargo from the Brazilian coast.
 &HT;    The privately held Andre Maggi group has spliced together a
network of trucks and river barges to move hundreds of thousands of
tons of soybeans from its headquarters in the Mato Grosso interior
town of Chapada dos Parecis to the Amazon and out to sea to Japan,
Italy and other foreign markets.
 &HT;    It's quite a journey for a country that moves only slightly more
than 10 percent of its cargo by river, even though Brazil has one
of the biggest navigable river networks in the world. ``We don't
have the river systems of Europe or the United States,'' says the
company's chairman, Blairo Maggi. ``But we are developing one.''
 &HT;    That kind of development costs money _ about $28 million just to
build the company's port at Itacoatiara, where the Madeira River
meets the Amazon and where the soybeans are transshipped to larger
seagoing ships.
 &HT;    It can also create a lot of paperwork. In Brazil, a shipper,
carrier or consignee needs a new set of documents every time a
piece of cargo changes from a truck, barge, ship or plane to
another form of transportation. ``You cannot move cargo from Minas
Gerais and consolidate with more in Sao Paulo without needing to do
customs in both places,'' says Leonardo D.M. Abreu, director of Sao
Paulo logistics company Circle International Group.
 &HT;    The government is studying a law to ease the intermodal process
for logistic companies and those, like Maggi, who want to move
their own cargo. ``We want to use different modes for the
transportation of cargo,'' insists Brazilian Transportation
Minister Eliseu Padilha, noting the country's underdeveloped river
network.
 &HT;    But the gears of the Brazilian government grind slowly when it
comes to new transport regulations. And companies like the Maggi
group, the biggest soybean producer in Brazil, can little afford to
waste their time waiting.
 &HT;    Before setting up its current structure, Maggi was trucking its
soybeans south and east to the seaports of Santos and
Paranaguaabout the same distance between Atlanta and Baltimoreat a
cost of about $110 a ton. Between 60 percent and 70 percent of the
country's freight moves by truck, and the carriers have carved up
their own regions, setting high rates with little fear of
competition. ``It's very expensive,'' Maggi says.
 &HT;    The choice of ports proved even more expensive. The soybeans
would wind up waiting seven days in Paranagua and up to 12 in
Santos, the busiest port in all of Latin America. So the Maggi
group built its own port in the Amazon. Now the company trucks the
soybeans from Chapada dos Parecis north and east to Porto Velho, in
Rondonia, where they are transshipped and barged down the Madeira
River to Itacoatiara and finally down the Amazon and out to foreign
markets.
 &HT;    The cost is about $65 per ton. During the last harvest, the
company's shipping group, Hermasa Navegacao, moved about 550,000
tons of soybeans through Itacoatiara. ``We have been doing this for
three years now,'' Maggi says. ``And it's been going very well.''
 &HT;    While such intermodalism may be in its infancy, the Maggi
network is far from primitive. For example, it uses global
positioning satellites to help navigate its river course. And the
company now has plans to expand. It is looking at a possible grain
terminal on the banks of the Tapajos River in Santarem farther down
the Amazon. From there, the company can transfer its cargo to
bigger ships _ with a displacement of up to 120,000 tos. The
freight cost to Rotterdam, for example, could drop to as low as $14
or even $10 a ton.
 &HT;    Tourists and fishing boats know that the meeting of the rivers
provides just the right mix for fish and fowl. And just a bit
downstream, the Maggi group has found the perfect intermodal mix
for logistical success.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO: BORN IN East L.A.
 &HT;    In neighborhoods like Baldwin park, Pico Rivera, el Monte and
Rosemead in East Los Angeles, small taco stands sell
Michoacan-style carnitas every Sunday and other Mexican dishes
throughout the week. Last Cinco de Mayo, though, Mexican
supermarket chain Grupo Gigante went for the whole enchilada,
opening its first store outside of Mexico.
 &HT;    The investment is small _ a mere US$3 million _ but if all goes
well in East L.A., the company has big plans for Los Angeles. The
city is home to more than 14 million people, including 4.8 million
Hispanics, most of whom are Mexican. ``Demographically, it is a
heavy Hispanic market and the name recognition factor is very
important for us,'' says Justo Frias, director of the Baja
California division of Grupo Gigante.
 &HT;    Store shelves will carry mostly U.S. products, but as much as 15
percent of the space will be set aside for products imported
directly from Mexico. They also teamed up with La Opinion, one of
the nation's largest Spanish-language newspapers, allowing them to
lease space in the store to sell everything from classified ads to
pre-paid phone cards.
 &HT;    Bringing goods from the ``old country'' won't give Gigante much
of an edge in Southern California. Conchas y Piedras, a local chain
with eight stores and $250 million in annual sales, has been doing
it for years. Another store, Hollywood-based supermarket chain
Jones, devotes an entire aisle to everything from cilantro to mole
poblano, soap, cooking oil _ all ``the best of Mexican products,''
And, of course, there's Superior, a Korean-owned supermarket chain
that stocks such delicacies as the sweet pastry known as Orejas de
Elefante (Elephant Ears).

 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRASIL: BAJANDO POR EL AMAZONAS
 &HT;    Justo al este de Manaus, el oscuro y rapido rio Negro se une con
el pastoso y apacible Solimes. Los dos coinciden en un tramo de
ocho kilometros en el mismo canal y se mezclan lentamente.
 &HT;    No es facil mezclar las modalidades de transporte de carga en el
Amazonas. Pero una compania ha encontrado la manera de conquistar
no solo la logistica del Amazonas, sino tambien otras barreras
intermodales que obstaculizan el traslado de carga desde el
interior hasta la costa del pais.
 &HT;    El grupo Andre Maggi ha creado una red de camiones y barcazas
para trasladar cientos de miles de toneladas de soya desde su sede
en Chapada dos Parecis, en el interior de Mato Grosso, hasta el
mar, rumbo a Japon, Italia y otros mercados extranjeros.
 &HT;    Es un viaje considerable en un pais que solo mueve el 10 por
ciento de su carga por los rios, a pesar de tener uno de los
mayores esqueletos fluviales navegables del mundo. ``No tenemos los
sistemas fluviales de Europa o de Estados Unidos,'' dice Blairo
Maggi, presidente del directorio de la empresa. ``Pero lo estamos
desarrollando.''
 &HT;    Esa clase de proyecto cuesta dinero, unos US$28 millones solo
para construir el puerto de la compania en Itacoatiara, donde el
rio Madeira se une al Amazonas y donde la soya se pasa a barcos
mayores que salen al mar.
 &HT;    Ademas, esta la burocracia. En Brasil, una compania naviera,
transportista o consignataria necesita documentos nuevos cada vez
que un cargamento pasa de un camion, barcaza, barco o avion a otro
medio de transporte. ``No se puede transportar carga desde Minas
Gerais y combinarla con mas carga en Sao Paulo sin pasar por la
aduana en los dos lugares,'' dice Leonardo D.M. Abreu, director de
la firma de logistica Circle International Group, de Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    El gobierno estudia una ley que facilite el proceso intermodal
de las companias de logistica y de empresas como Maggi que quieren
transportar su carga.
 &HT;    Pero el gobierno brasileno es muy lento a la hora de cambiar las
normas del transporte. Y las companias como el grupo Maggi, el
mayor productor de soya de Brasil, no pueden darse el lujo de
perder tiempo.
 &HT;    Antes de crear su estructura actual, Maggi transportaba su soya
en camiones hacia el sur y el este, con destino a los puertos
maritimos de Santos y Paranagua, a un costo de US$110 la tonelada.
Entre el 60 por ciento y el 70 por ciento de la carga del pais se
mueve en camion, y los transportistas han delimitado sus regiones y
fijado altas tarifas, con poco temor a la competencia. ``Es muy
costoso,'' dice Maggi.
 &HT;    La eleccion de los puertos resulto mas costosa. La soya tenia
que esperar siete dias en Paranagua y 12 en el puerto de Santos,
que es la terminal mas activa de toda Latinoamerica. De modo que el
grupo Maggi construyo su propio puerto en el Amazonas. Ahora la
empresa envia la soya en camion desde Chapada dos Parecis hasta
Porto Velho, en Rondonia, donde se pasa a barcazas y se traslada
por el rio Madeira hasta Itacoatiara, y finalmente por el Amazonas,
rio abajo, hacia los mercados extranjeros.
 &HT;    El costo es de unos US$65 la tonelada. Durante la ultima
cosecha, el grupo naviero de la compania, Hermasa Navegacao, movio
unas 550.000 toneladas de soya a traves de Itacoatiara. ``Llevamos
tres anos haciendo esto,'' dice Maggi. ``Y nos va muy bien.''
 &HT;    Aunque ese proceso intermodal quiza este en la infancia, la red
de Maggi no tiene nada de primitiva. Por ejemplo, sus embarcaciones
usan sistemas de navegacion por satelite.
 &HT;    Y la compania tiene planes de expansion. Busca una posible
terminal de granos a orillas del rio Tapajos, en Santarem, rio
abajo en el Amazonas. Desde alli, la compania puede trasladar su
carga a barcos grandes. Por ejemplo, el costo del flete hasta
Rotterdam, Holanda, podria bajar a US$14 la tonelada o incluso a
US$10.
 &HT;    Los turistas y los pescadores saben que la confluencia de los
rios es un lugar ideal para pescar y cazar. Solo un poco mas rio
abajo, el grupo Maggi ha encontrado el lugar ideal para alcanzar el
exito en sus planes de transporte.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO: EL SABOR DE CASA
 &HT;    En las comunidades angelinas de baldwin park, Pico Rivera, El
Monte o Rosemead, no es extrano encontrar expendios de tortillas,
puestos de tacos al carbon e incluso carnicerias que cada domingo
vende carnitas al mas puro estilo de Michoacan.
 &HT;    Pero ahora esa zona predominantemente latina es tambien sede de
otro icono de la cultura comercial mexicana: el pasado 5 de mayo,
coincidiendo con las festividades del aniversario de la batalla de
Puebla, el Grupo Gigante inauguro su primer supermercado fuera de
Mexico.
 &HT;    La inversion es pequena (US$3 millones) pero si todo sale bien,
la compania tiene grandes planes para Los Angeles. La ciudad
alberga a mas de 4,8 millones de hispanos, la mayoria mexicanos.
Gigante unio esfuerzos con La Opinion, uno de los mayores diarios
en espanol de Estados Unidos, permitiendole arrendar espacio en la
tienda para vender desde anuncios clasificados hasta tarjetas
telefonicas.
 &HT;    ``Demograficamente es un mercado muy latino y el factor de
reconocimiento de marca es muy importante para nosotros,'' dice
Justo Frias, director de la division de Baja California de Grupo
Gigante. El establecimiento ofrecera principalmente productos
estadounidenses, pero se espera que reserve el 15 por ciento de
espacio para productos mexicanos que la tienda importara
directamente.
 &HT;    Gigante tendra que competir con otros establecimientos. Conchas
y Piedras, una cadena local con ocho establecimientos y US$250
millones en ventas anuales, lleva anos ofreciendo todo tipo de
alimentos mexicanos. Otro supermercado pequeno que la comunidad
latina considera como ``el mejor para encontrar productos de
Mexico'' es Jones, en la zona de Hollywood, que vende desde mole
poblano, aceite y detergentes mexicanos, hasta los pasteles
conocidos como Orejas de Elefante.

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH CITIES HAVE AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    With TECH-LIST.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Cities that have transformed themselves into
high-tech hot spots will have a head start as their economies head
into the new century, according to a study released Tuesday by the
nonprofit Milken Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Santa Monica, Calif., research group found that
a strong technology component helps a region's economy in two ways:
first by boosting wages and tax revenues directly, and then
filtering wealth down to traditional workers as tech employees
purchase local goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1990-91 recession, growth in the high-tech sector has
been four times as large as in the aggregate economy.
</P>
<P>
   In that period companies that invent or improve technologies
have not fanned out evenly across the landscape, preferring to
cluster in certain communities, the Milken study found.
</P>
<P>
   The list of pumped-up places is topped by the San Jose, Calif.,
area, the 500-ton gorilla of the high-tech world. No other region
comes close to the Silicon Valley in terms of technology-driven
jobs and output. The study found that with 279,000 tech workers,
San Jose's weight in the information economy is more than triple
that of the next closest competitor, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many other regions are flourishing in the post-industrial
world, giving the Top Ten list some surprising winners, such as
Chicago and Atlanta, cities known more for their airports than
their Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   The Milken study created a weighted index to rank metropolitan
areas based on the concentration of high-tech industries and their
economic output. Its ``high-tech'' universe encompasses 14
industries, from computer makers to telecommunications firms to
drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas came up with the No. 2 ranking because of its diversified
technolgy base. The metro area is home to seven high-tech
industries, giving it both large pools of workers and a rich mix of
company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The next three cities were the Los Angeles-Long Beach area,
Boston, and the Seattle-Bellevue-Everett region, all well-known
tech centers.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the next five cities were more surprising:
Washington, Albuquerque, N.M., Chicago, New York and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is usually associated with lawyers, lobbyists and
bureaucrats, but its suburb of Fairfax County, Va., is home to
America Online, UUNET and PSINet. The study found that more than
half the nation's Internet traffic passes through firms in
Washington's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which grew up on meat packing and transportation, has
become an important center of communications equipment
manufacturing, thanks largely to the presence of Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta, which started as a center for freight
transportation, has become a center of information transportation,
with jobs growing rapidly in telecommunications services, computers
and data processing services.
</P>
<P>
   What can cities do to attract or create more technology jobs,
given their importance to a regional economy?
</P>
<P>
   The study found that many firms still look for traditional
location factors, such as tax rates, energy costs and rents.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors were even more important. They include: access
to a trained and educated work force; close proximity to excellent
educational facilities and research institutions; an existing
network of suppliers; availability of venture capital; climate, and
other quality-of-life factors.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Wong, an economist who worked on the study, said the 1999
list of high-tech winners won't necessarily dictate which cities
will flourish in the next century. Tech companies can hop cities
easily because they are ``about content and ideas, not physical
inputs' such as iron ore or timber, he said. ``High-tech companies
are a lot more easily moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong said metro areas that want to attract and keep high-tech
companies should concentrate on improving infrastructure, such as
roads and sewers, to keep pace with the increase in demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech brings high growth and a lot of new people,'' he
said. ``If (city officials) commit themselves to higher growth,
they have to face the risk that the local economy will be
transformed beyond recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, San Jose was a relatively sleepy town a generation
ago. Today, its streets are clogged and even the smallest homes
sell for more than $300,000, forcing many young families to have to
leave the area where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid growth ``can be a blessing, but you really have to plan it
out better'' than most cities have been doing, he said.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have to hang a very heavy, framed mirror on my living room
wall, so I was advised to mount it with screws or hooks that go
into the studs, rather than merely depending on hollow drywall
anchors of any kind. However, the spot where I want the mirror to
hang does not work out for properly spaced studs _ even though the
mirror is considerably wider than the space between the studs.
Fastening to one of the studs would mean the mirror could not hang
level. Is there a method that will enable me to fasten to the
studs, yet insure that the mirror will hang level?
</P>
<P>
   A: Use a stud finder to locate the studs, then screw a length of
1x6 lumber several inches shorter than the width of the mirror to
two or three of these studs so it bridges them and will be centered
over the area you want the mirror to hang (as shown in the
drawing). You can then fasten two hooks, properly located to hang
the mirror level, by screwing them to this board.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our wall-to-wall carpet was installed five years ago and has
rippled up slightly so that it now has small ``waves'' in the
carpeting. How can we level this out, and how can we prevent this
happening again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your carpet has apparently stretched so that it is no longer
tight against the flooring. This is usually due to improper
installation when the carpet was first put down _ it was not
stretched as tightly as it should have been. The solution now is to
pull it up around the edges where it is held by the tackless strips
along one side of the room, then re-stretch the carpet properly
before tacking it back down again. Since this requires some special
tools, and techniques most homeowners are not familiar with, it is
usually best to call in a professional to do this job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a concrete driveway that has an uneven or wavy finish
with numerous depressions in the surface. As a result water puddles
and does not run off completely when it rains. Is there any way of
leveling this off so that it will slope properly and cause water to
drain off completely when it rains?
</P>
<P>
   A: A concrete driveway that does not slope properly usually has
to be torn up and replaced. However, in some cases it can be
resurfaced with a special cement that can be applied in thin
layers, after first roughing up the original surface. However, this
will raise the level of the driveway anywhere from one-half to one
full inch, depending on the depth of the depressions. This is a
sizable project that requires familiarity with concrete work, so
for most people I would recommend calling in a masonry contractor
for this.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My kitchen floor has a parquet wood floor which I plan to
have sanded and refinished in the near future. I have spoken to two
carpenters about this and one advised using a rotary sander, while
the other said that a drum sander should be used. What do you
think?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rather than a carpenter I would suggest calling in a floor
finishing contractor who also will do the sanding. Traditionally,
most use a drum sander on wood floors, but if your floor is not a
solid wood parquet and is merely laminated wood ``tiles'' with a
thin veneer of plywood on top, then it may be that a rotary sander
would be safer. An experienced floor finishing contractor could
determine this.

   PCHICK: Last year, greater prairie chickens were added to
Missouri's endangered species list. They number less than 1,000,
and those birds are scattered in dangerously small flocks on
prairie remnants. If population trends continue, they will vanish
in the next decade. Yet the deeper trouble is that all grassland
birds are declining in the Midwest. Kansas, a prairie stronghold,
has seen prairie chicken numbers drop in the southeast and the
southwest. Now, an unprecedented effort between public and private
agencies is under way to save the lowly prairie chicken. Bill

<P>
   Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a decade ago. The
country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and right-wing
militias _ have never been better armed and financed or held more
territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious effects, is
as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out of options.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the only major Latin American country that did not have
to renegotiate its foreign debt in the 1980s has sunk into a deep,
unrelieved recession, exacerbated by the earthquake that devastated
its coffee-growing region in January.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1988, following the abduction of a prominent politician,
former Colombian President Misael Pastrana Borrero remarked, ``Last
year I said we were on the verge of the abyss. Today, I think we
are in it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pastrana's son Andres _ who has himself led Colombia
since August 1998 _ has reason to be even more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the current crises from the many Colombia has
weathered in the past is the inability of the country's leaders to
respond effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new peace talks announced on May 3, the guerrillas'
willingness to engage in serious negotiations remains in doubt. And
ordinary Colombians _ the vast majority of whom are committed to
peace _ have grown more divided than ever. Mistrust lies at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's deterioration has made its neighbors apprehensive and
spread serious concern as far as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Central America's guerrillas have demobilized and Peru's
rebels have been crippled, in Colombia two of the hemisphere's
oldest insurgencies are militarily and financially stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Colombia's principal guerrilla organizations _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National
Liberation Army (ELN) _ have combined revenues of about $900
million a year. About $500 million of that is derived from taxes on
coca producers and the rest comes from kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to see the guerrilla groups as
common criminals or drug mafias (although some of the FARC's fronts
seem to closely fit that mold). Their criminal activities help
sustain a political agenda. Nor are they rigid ideologues,
resistant to reason. The rebels should instead be viewed as
fundamentally pragmatic actors, out to advance political, economic
and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be said for Colombia's many criminal gangs. Colombia
has a long history of illegal economic activities; emeralds, for
example, were once the subject of a huge illegal traffic. And for
at least two decades now Colombia has been one of the main engines
driving the international drug trade (an engine fueled largely by
U.S. demand).
</P>
<P>
   Though reliable data are hard to come by, drug proceeds amount
to an estimated 25 percent to 35 percent of the country's total
exports. Meanwhile, with the effective elimination of the Medellin
and Cali cartels over the past several years, the drug industry has
become more fractured, making it harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   Today narcotics have penetrated nearly all spheres of Colombian
society, politics and economics. The cumulative effects of drug
trafficking and the spreading insurgencies _ coupled with a
rampantly corrupt political system that has long excluded large
sectors of the citizenry _ have exacerbated the country's immense
institutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians have long been aware of their many problems and have
sought to address them in various ways. Meanwhile, Colombia has
somehow managed to hold election after election despite its many
crises. The region's oldest insurgencies coexist with South
America's longest stretch of civilian, constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Colombian administrations have launched a variety
of peace efforts, also with mixed results. Colombians have paid a
tremendous price _ in financial, institutional and most tragically,
human terms _ to fight drugs and curb their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing symptom of the failure of Colombia's
institutions has been the exponential growth of the paramilitary
forces, now estimated to number 4,000 to 5,000 combatants. These
militias, frustrated by the country's demoralized and debilitated
security forces, seek to counter insurgent advances. They have
grown more sophisticated over the years since the army and
landowners first organized them as self-defense units in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Like the insurgents, the paramilitaries are now spread out and
are often fueled by the drug economy. In some cases they have
developed right-wing political identities and agendas and have
shown a keen interest in Colombia's political game.
</P>
<P>
   The existence and nature of the militias' links to the army are
hotly contested. Direct connections between the two have been
established in some cases. More often, state agents have merely
looked the other way when paramilitary units have committed
atrocities. Chiefly as a result of growing international pressure,
there have been a number of recent attempts to break such ties. In
April, Pastrana dismissed two generals with reported paramilitary
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence, the drug economy and an acute institutional
crisis have contributed to the most dire human-rights situation in
the hemisphere. Roughly 10 Colombians are killed every day in
political violence. All the country's armed factions commit gross
abuses. But both credible human-rights groups and the State
Department blame the paramilitaries for the lion's share _ three-
quarters of all of Colombia's political killings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Human Rights Watch, Colombia has the fourth-largest
internally displaced population in the world. The poor are also the
principal victims of Colombia's pervasive social and criminal
violence, which accounts for some 85 percent of the country's
30,000 annual homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's murder of three American human-rights workers in
Venezuelan territory in March underlined the brutality of
Colombia's civil war and its mounting regional repercussions. For
most of this century, the two countries have enjoyed close and
friendly relations, in part because of Colombia's exemplary
economic management and its adherence to civilian, constitutional
government since the early 1960s. For many years, Washington held
Colombia up as a model of good governance and a close partner in
President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress aid program.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia's entanglement with the drug trade in the mid-1980s
changed all of that. Since then, U.S. Colombia policy has been
nearly indistinguishable from U.S. antinarcotics policy. About 80
percent of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia, along with
roughly three-quarters of the heroin seized by authorities on the
east coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that U.S. Colombia policy tends to be
single-minded, inflexible and driven by the desire to look tough on
drugs. As a result, it is often counterproductive. Any option that
might conceivably soften antidrug efforts is deemed unacceptable by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the United States reached a low point during the
1994-'98 presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was credibly accused of
having accepted some $6 million from the Cali drug cartel in his
1994 campaign. Samper's U.S. visa was revoked and, in 1996 and
1997, the United States fully decertified Colombia for failing to
cooperate in the fight against drugs. Decertification demoralized
and alienated Colombians and undermined their government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the election of Pastrana last June has
substantially improved the relationship. This was reflected by the
recertification of Colombia in March 1999 and Congress' approval in
October 1998 of some $289 million in counternarcotics assistance
(tripling the amount previously provided).
</P>
<P>
   The increased aid includes about $40 million for an air-mobile
army battalion to help in the antidrug effort. This marks a
significant development. U.S. aid to the Colombian army had been
suspended in 1996 because of its troubling human-rights record.
(The money went to the national police instead.) Today, support is
still restricted and should be carefully monitored in accordance
with U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense, State and Justice departments, the Office of
National Drug Control Policy and key congressional representatives
_ are all competing to shape policy. Skeptics in the U.S. Congress
have taken sharp public aim at the meetings between State
Department officials and FARC representatives, especially in light
of what they regard as the insurgents' stubborn behavior and
unreasonable demands (and the FARC's designation as a ``terrorist''
group). And members of Congress have been critical of Pastrana's
meetings with Fidel Castro to explore a Cuban role in brokering a
settlement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Most Colombians long for peace but are divided over how to
pursue it. Only if Pastrana can shape a national consensus _ and
inspire his people to remain a part of it _ will he finally help
the country out of the abyss his father anticipated more than a
decade ago.

   Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a decade ago. The
country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and right-wing
militias _ have never been better armed and financed or held more
territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious effects, is
as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out of options.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the only major Latin American country that did not have
to renegotiate its foreign debt in the 1980s has sunk into a deep,
unrelieved recession, exacerbated by the earthquake that devastated
its coffee-growing region in January.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1988, following the abduction of a prominent politician,
former Colombian President Misael Pastrana Borrero remarked, ``Last
year I said we were on the verge of the abyss. Today, I think we
are in it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pastrana's son Andres _ who has himself led Colombia
since August 1998 _ has reason to be even more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the current crises from the many Colombia has
weathered in the past is the inability of the country's leaders to
respond effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new peace talks announced on May 3, the guerrillas'
willingness to engage in serious negotiations remains in doubt. And
ordinary Colombians _ the vast majority of whom are committed to
peace _ have grown more divided than ever. Mistrust lies at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's deterioration has made its neighbors apprehensive and
spread serious concern as far as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Central America's guerrillas have demobilized and Peru's
rebels have been crippled, in Colombia two of the hemisphere's
oldest insurgencies are militarily and financially stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Colombia's principal guerrilla organizations _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National
Liberation Army (ELN) _ have combined revenues of about $900
million a year. About $500 million of that is derived from taxes on
coca producers and the rest comes from kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to see the guerrilla groups as
common criminals or drug mafias (although some of the FARC's fronts
seem to closely fit that mold). Their criminal activities help
sustain a political agenda. Nor are they rigid ideologues,
resistant to reason. The rebels should instead be viewed as
fundamentally pragmatic actors, out to advance political, economic
and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be said for Colombia's many criminal gangs. Colombia
has a long history of illegal economic activities; emeralds, for
example, were once the subject of a huge illegal traffic. And for
at least two decades now Colombia has been one of the main engines
driving the international drug trade (an engine fueled largely by
U.S. demand).
</P>
<P>
   Though reliable data are hard to come by, drug proceeds amount
to an estimated 25 percent to 35 percent of the country's total
exports. Meanwhile, with the effective elimination of the Medellin
and Cali cartels over the past several years, the drug industry has
become more fractured, making it harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   Today narcotics have penetrated nearly all spheres of Colombian
society, politics and economics. The cumulative effects of drug
trafficking and the spreading insurgencies _ coupled with a
rampantly corrupt political system that has long excluded large
sectors of the citizenry _ have exacerbated the country's immense
institutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians have long been aware of their many problems and have
sought to address them in various ways. Meanwhile, Colombia has
somehow managed to hold election after election despite its many
crises. The region's oldest insurgencies coexist with South
America's longest stretch of civilian, constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Colombian administrations have launched a variety
of peace efforts, also with mixed results. Colombians have paid a
tremendous price _ in financial, institutional and most tragically,
human terms _ to fight drugs and curb their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing symptom of the failure of Colombia's
institutions has been the exponential growth of the paramilitary
forces, now estimated to number 4,000 to 5,000 combatants. These
militias, frustrated by the country's demoralized and debilitated
security forces, seek to counter insurgent advances. They have
grown more sophisticated over the years since the army and
landowners first organized them as self-defense units in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Like the insurgents, the paramilitaries are now spread out and
are often fueled by the drug economy. In some cases they have
developed right-wing political identities and agendas and have
shown a keen interest in Colombia's political game.
</P>
<P>
   The existence and nature of the militias' links to the army are
hotly contested. Direct connections between the two have been
established in some cases. More often, state agents have merely
looked the other way when paramilitary units have committed
atrocities. Chiefly as a result of growing international pressure,
there have been a number of recent attempts to break such ties. In
April, Pastrana dismissed two generals with reported paramilitary
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence, the drug economy and an acute institutional
crisis have contributed to the most dire human-rights situation in
the hemisphere. Roughly 10 Colombians are killed every day in
political violence. All the country's armed factions commit gross
abuses. But both credible human-rights groups and the State
Department blame the paramilitaries for the lion's share _ three-
quarters of all of Colombia's political killings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Human Rights Watch, Colombia has the fourth-largest
internally displaced population in the world. The poor are also the
principal victims of Colombia's pervasive social and criminal
violence, which accounts for some 85 percent of the country's
30,000 annual homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's murder of three American human-rights workers in
Venezuelan territory in March underlined the brutality of
Colombia's civil war and its mounting regional repercussions. For
most of this century, the two countries have enjoyed close and
friendly relations, in part because of Colombia's exemplary
economic management and its adherence to civilian, constitutional
government since the early 1960s. For many years, Washington held
Colombia up as a model of good governance and a close partner in
President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress aid program.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia's entanglement with the drug trade in the mid-1980s
changed all of that. Since then, U.S. Colombia policy has been
nearly indistinguishable from U.S. antinarcotics policy. About 80
percent of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia, along with
roughly three-quarters of the heroin seized by authorities on the
east coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that U.S. Colombia policy tends to be
single-minded, inflexible and driven by the desire to look tough on
drugs. As a result, it is often counterproductive. Any option that
might conceivably soften antidrug efforts is deemed unacceptable by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the United States reached a low point during the
1994-'98 presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was credibly accused of
having accepted some $6 million from the Cali drug cartel in his
1994 campaign. Samper's U.S. visa was revoked and, in 1996 and
1997, the United States fully decertified Colombia for failing to
cooperate in the fight against drugs. Decertification demoralized
and alienated Colombians and undermined their government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the election of Pastrana last June has
substantially improved the relationship. This was reflected by the
recertification of Colombia in March 1999 and Congress' approval in
October 1998 of some $289 million in counternarcotics assistance
(tripling the amount previously provided).
</P>
<P>
   The increased aid includes about $40 million for an air-mobile
army battalion to help in the antidrug effort. This marks a
significant development. U.S. aid to the Colombian army had been
suspended in 1996 because of its troubling human-rights record.
(The money went to the national police instead.) Today, support is
still restricted and should be carefully monitored in accordance
with U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense, State and Justice departments, the Office of
National Drug Control Policy and key congressional representatives
_ are all competing to shape policy. Skeptics in the U.S. Congress
have taken sharp public aim at the meetings between State
Department officials and FARC representatives, especially in light
of what they regard as the insurgents' stubborn behavior and
unreasonable demands (and the FARC's designation as a ``terrorist''
group). And members of Congress have been critical of Pastrana's
meetings with Fidel Castro to explore a Cuban role in brokering a
settlement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Most Colombians long for peace but are divided over how to
pursue it. Only if Pastrana can shape a national consensus _ and
inspire his people to remain a part of it _ will he finally help
the country out of the abyss his father anticipated more than a
decade ago.

   As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime, the provinces
smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping through the
establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in fighting one
another than their common enemies.
</P>
<P>
   For the country to survive as a democracy, this will have to
change _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's presidential election of 2000, amid rising civic
sophistication and popular discontent, could oust the long-dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for the first time in 70
years. This bespeaks progress in Mexico's ongoing democratization,
but it will strain the country's fragile new institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drug lords increase their power while
revolutionaries, nostalgic for a Marxist past, struggle to
establish their own. And the ghost of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a PRI
presidential candidate assassinated in 1994, still haunts the
landscape with the specter of political violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico totters, pulled in one direction by the inertia of its
authoritarian past and in another by the wobbly momentum of a
democratic future that is barely 11 years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   True, a democratic free-market revolution is in process and
NAFTA annually generates $174 billion in two-way trade. But
economic reforms have been only partially consolidated and so
remain susceptible to swings in the political pendulum. Backlash
often follows revolution and it is no easy task to liberalize the
oldest single-party regime in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As the elections near, it remains unclear whether Mexico's
political players will abide by democratic rules of the game.
Mexico has spent billions of dollars creating technologically
sophisticated and credible electoral institutions, revamping voter
ID cards and registration lists, and establishing the nonpartisan,
autonomous Federal Electoral Institute. But the cultural values
needed to underpin democratic governance _ tolerance, compromise
and civic participation _ remain weak. Thus although Mexico has
gained democratic pluralism it may lose governability in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico suffered through most of the 19th century at the mercy of
men on horseback. Today, as PRI dominance atrophies, the popular
allure of the ``caudillo,'' or strongman, has returned. In Chiapas,
for example, Zapatista guerrillas are held in sway by their
charismatic poet-leader, Subcomandante Marcos (the ``nom de
guerre'' of Rafael Sebastian Guillen Vicente).
</P>
<P>
   Even within mainstream politics, personality seems more
important than ideology. Thus the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) remains captive to the popular mayor of
Mexico City, the leftist icon Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Meanwhile, the
center-right National Action Party's (PAN) collegial traditions
have been overwhelmed by the ideological eclecticism, campaign
vigor and sheer force of personality of presidential aspirant
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado named Carlos Salinas
de Gortari as his successor in 1987, a generation of old-school
politicians steeped in PRI revolutionary lore suddenly found
themselves confronted by young, free-market ``tecnicos,'' who
banished them from the banquet table of high political office and
government graft. Cardenas formed the dissident Democratic
Revolutionary Party as a refuge for exiled populists.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican democracy, then, emerged in an atmosphere of frustrated
ambition, personal rancor and family feuds _ not auspicious
circumstances for compromise. And these sentiments prevail today;
personal and ideological invective remain the rule. Mexican
politicians view winning and losing not as part of the to and fro
of electoral fortunes but as an apocalyptic confrontation between
good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious kidnappings, semi-orchestrated demonstrations and
insurrections designed to influence politics abound. The habit of
demonizing adversaries impedes democratic compromise. Few signs
suggest that reconciliation will be possible any time soon. Thus
the proposition that more democracy leads directly to more
stability has yet to be proven in Mexico, where more democracy has
brought renewed political infighting, assassinations and guerrilla
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of political violence has become very real. The 1994
assassination of Colosio during the campaign ended 70 years of
peaceful presidential successions. The post-Colosio landscape is
populated with angry apparatchiks, ruthless drug traffickers,
scheming palace politicians and messianic guerrillas who have
sprung up like poisonous mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Every major Mexican political party has already had at least one
low-level brush with the insidious influence of drug money. The
corruption of candidates and their campaigns would permit drug
traffickers to carry out their competition for market share via the
electoral process. Overlay cartel competition on electoral
politics, and the potential for bloody conflict grows
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Should any presidential candidate be suspected of having ties to
drug traffickers, the impact on relations with the United States
would be devastating. The discovery of presidential corruption
would set American protectionists clamoring to use NAFTA's pull-out
clause. The U.S. Senate would rush to decertify Mexico. Calls for
military intervention and sealing the border could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has precious few levers to pull should Mexico
fall into the hands of traffickers. Economic sanctions would do as
much harm as good, undoing NAFTA commitments, threatening U.S.
foreign investment and wrecking economic reforms. Nor is Mexico, a
huge country of almost 100 million people, a good candidate for a
Haitian- or Panamanian-style invasion to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a decertification vote in the midst of the
presidential campaign would fill the air with anti-American
rhetoric. Cardenas, who called for suspending oil sales to the
United States during the Persian Gulf War, would likely insist on
expelling American Drug Enforcement Agency agents working in
Mexico. Most mainstream Mexican politicians, eager to preserve
their nationalistic credentials, would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The recent presidential victory in Venezuela of Hugo Chavez
Frias, a former army officer and coup leader, shows how Latin
American democracy does not always produce democratic results.
Indeed, poll data suggests that Mexicans may value order and strong
government more than open democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military has a long tradition of submission to
civilian rule, but should political parties exhaust the patience of
the nation with their petty disputes and should the moral authority
and power of the Mexican presidency erode even further, Chavez-like
figures might eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Mexico has oscillated between long periods of
authoritarian rule and deadly bouts of social strife. The scars
remain, and the social and geographic fault lines run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics claim that families in extreme poverty
diminished from 31.1 percent of the population in 1989 to 21.9
percent in 1997, but the absolute number of poor remains high, at
an estimated 26 million _ over a quarter of the population. In
states such as Chiapas and Guerrero, the rates of severe poverty
are even higher, and as a consequence these regions suffer from
more extreme varieties of social protest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative military intelligence estimates suggest that while
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) comprises a core of
approximately 500 armed troops with another 2,500 active militants,
the movement has more than 10,000 sympathizers. Thus Chiapas
remains at risk from guerrilla violence and paramilitary activity.
</P>
<P>
   The EZLN has divided small communities along religious (Catholic
Zapatistas vs. Protestant non-Zapatistas) and political lines (PRD
Zapatistas vs. PRI non-Zapatistas). In contested areas, both rebel
and pro-government forces have been guilty of forced expulsions and
sacking the homes of adversaries. Zapatista takeovers of small
villages, turning them into ``autonomous municipalities,'' led to
pro- government atrocities such as the December 23, 1997, massacre
in Acteal, in which 45 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican government source has estimated that the ratio of
aid money to criminal money (from drug trafficking, kidnapping and
robbery) flowing into EZLN coffers shifted from 4:1 in 1994 to 3:2
in 1998, and could reverse to 2:3 by 2001. There is no evidence yet
that the EZLN has been completely seduced by drug money (as have
Colombia's guerrillas), but the insurgents are being tempted by
criminalization.
</P>
<P>
   Especially worrisome is the kind of kidnapping campaign a
smaller radical group, the EPR (Popular Revolutionary Army), waged
against prominent Mexicans in 1994. Since then, Mexico has been hit
with a kidnapping epidemic that has struck the families of
governors, soccer heroes and music stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this plague is the work of common criminals or part of a
destabilization campaign mounted by political terrorists remains
unclear. For now, groups such as the EPR appear to operate
primarily in small cells with limited rural support in the states
of Guerrero and Oaxaca _ but if social unrest grows, they may ally
themselves with the radical urban poor. A troubled presidential
succession in 2000 would present the rebels with many opportunities
for mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in addition to political and drug-related violence,
Mexico's major cities are being overwhelmed by crime. With 1,450
abductions in 1995, Mexico ranks second in total kidnappings in
Latin America, after Colombia (with 3,600).
</P>
<P>
   In a diagnosis by Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
of the 1.5 million crimes reported in 1997, only 150,000 arrest
warrants were issued and only 85,000 executed. He estimates that
another 1.5 million crimes were never even reported because of
citizens' lack of trust in the police. The poorly paid police are
believed to be thoroughly corrupt and the perpetrators of many
serious crimes. But efforts to purge contaminated police forces
have backfired, turning unemployed cops into trained street
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire, Mexico is inundated with illegal arms.
Guerrillas and drug lords are thought to possess plastique
explosives, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, M-16 and AR-15
assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47s, Claymore antipersonnel
mines and armor-piercing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election will bring Mexico to trial by fire. The
sobering worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable. Mexico's
nightmares are possible, not inevitable, futures that could become
real should the country fail to act or do so in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   But they must be taken very seriously. Together they show just
how perilous are Mexico's opening, its transition to a free market
and its ongoing democratic revolution.

would be devastating. The discovery of presidential corruption
would set American protectionists clamoring to use NAFTA's pull-out
clause. The U.S. Senate would rush to decertify Mexico. Calls for
military intervention and sealing the border could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has precious few levers to pull should Mexico
fall into the hands of traffickers. Economic sanctions would do as
much harm as good, undoing NAFTA commitments, threatening U.S.
foreign investment and wrecking economic reforms. Nor is Mexico, a
huge country of almost 100 million people, a good candidate for a
Haitian- or Panamanian-style invasion to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a decertification vote in the midst of the
presidential campaign would fill the air with anti-American
rhetoric. Cardenas, who called for suspending oil sales to the
United States during the Persian Gulf War, would likely insist on
expelling American Drug Enforcement Agency agents working in
Mexico. Most mainstream Mexican politicians, eager to preserve
their nationalistic credentials, would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The recent presidential victory in Venezuela of Hugo Chavez
Frias, a former army officer and coup leader, shows how Latin
American democracy does not always produce democratic results.
Indeed, poll data suggests that Mexicans may value order and strong
government more than open democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military has a long tradition of submission to
civilian rule, but should political parties exhaust the patience of
the nation with their petty disputes and should the moral authority
and power of the Mexican presidency erode even further, Chavez-like
figures might eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Mexico has oscillated between long periods of
authoritarian rule and deadly bouts of social strife. The scars
remain, and the social and geographic fault lines run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics claim that families in extreme poverty
diminished from 31.1 percent of the population in 1989 to 21.9
percent in 1997, but the absolute number of poor remains high, at
an estimated 26 million _ over a quarter of the population. In
states such as Chiapas and Guerrero, the rates of severe poverty
are even higher, and as a consequence these regions suffer from
more extreme varieties of social protest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative military intelligence estimates suggest that while
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) comprises a core of
approximately 500 armed troops with another 2,500 active militants,
the movement has more than 10,000 sympathizers. Thus Chiapas
remains at risk from guerrilla violence and paramilitary activity.
</P>
<P>
   The EZLN has divided small communities along religious (Catholic
Zapatistas vs. Protestant non-Zapatistas) and political lines (PRD
Zapatistas vs. PRI non-Zapatistas). In contested areas, both rebel
and pro-government forces have been guilty of forced expulsions and
sacking the homes of adversaries. Zapatista takeovers of small
villages, turning them into ``autonomous municipalities,'' led to
pro- government atrocities such as the December 23, 1997, massacre
in Acteal, in which 45 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican government source has estimated that the ratio of
aid money to criminal money (from drug trafficking, kidnapping and
robbery) flowing into EZLN coffers shifted from 4:1 in 1994 to 3:2
in 1998, and could reverse to 2:3 by 2001. There is no evidence yet
that the EZLN has been completely seduced by drug money (as have
Colombia's guerrillas), but the insurgents are being tempted by
criminalization.
</P>
<P>
   Especially worrisome is the kind of kidnapping campaign a
smaller radical group, the EPR (Popular Revolutionary Army), waged
against prominent Mexicans in 1994. Since then, Mexico has been hit
with a kidnapping epidemic that has struck the families of
governors, soccer heroes and music stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this plague is the work of common criminals or part of a
destabilization campaign mounted by political terrorists remains
unclear. For now, groups such as the EPR appear to operate
primarily in small cells with limited rural support in the states
of Guerrero and Oaxaca _ but if social unrest grows, they may ally
themselves with the radical urban poor. A troubled presidential
succession in 2000 would present the rebels with many opportunities
for mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in addition to political and drug-related violence,
Mexico's major cities are being overwhelmed by crime. With 1,450
abductions in 1995, Mexico ranks second in total kidnappings in
Latin America, after Colombia (with 3,600).
</P>
<P>
   In a diagnosis by Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
of the 1.5 million crimes reported in 1997, only 150,000 arrest
warrants were issued and only 85,000 executed. He estimates that
another 1.5 million crimes were never even reported because of
citizens' lack of trust in the police. The poorly paid police are
believed to be thoroughly corrupt and the perpetrators of many
serious crimes. But efforts to purge contaminated police forces
have backfired, turning unemployed cops into trained street
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire, Mexico is inundated with illegal arms.
Guerrillas and drug lords are thought to possess plastique
explosives, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, M-16 and AR-15
assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47s, Claymore antipersonnel
mines and armor-piercing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election will bring Mexico to trial by fire. The
sobering worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable. Mexico's
nightmares are possible, not inevitable, futures that could become
real should the country fail to act or do so in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   But they must be taken very seriously. Together they show just
how perilous are Mexico's opening, its transition to a free market
and its ongoing democratic revolution.

   I was talking recently to Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf and, not
surprisingly, we discussed the dramatic ramifications of the Kosovo
crisis. The general spoke with the insight of an Army officer.
``When the dust settles,'' he said, ``everything will have to be
reassessed and reexamined.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the dust is settling, the need to come to grips with
all the implications of recent developments is growing more acute.
</P>
<P>
   I do not share the widespread view that NATO has scored a
victory for justice and a safer world. Very soon, even those who
succumbed to the euphoria of ``a little victorious war'' will
realize that it was a pyrrhic victory with many destructive
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But even more is at stake here. Events that, compred to this
century's two world wars, were relatively minor in scale, have now
assumed a symbolic dimension. They should be seen as a warning of
things to come, a reminder of the profound crisis of world
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As I see it, much of what we have witnessed recently is rooted
in the way U.S. leaders interpreted the end of the Cold War. They
saw the breakup of the Soviet Union _ a product of complex internal
processes _as their victory. No longer having to deal with a
serious partner in world affairs, the United States decided it
could act at will.
</P>
<P>
   It had little use for the United Nations. Having lined up other
Western countries under the pretext of fighting ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo, it has now tested a new doctrine that openly contradicts
the principles of international law. A precedent has been set _ of
intervening in violation of any international norms, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``strategy'' was formally unveiled in April at the
Washington summit convened to celebrate the NATO's 50th
anniversary. Now, after Kosovo, the shape of the world order as
seen from Washington and some European capitals is coming into
focus.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is stark: Instead of the principles of
international law, it is armed intervention by the United States
(or, ``at best,'' by a group of countries) in any internal
conflict; instead of organizations such as the United Nations,
Organization for Security in Central Europe and the Council of
Europe, it is NATO and its will. Its leaders are clearly not asking
anyone's permission to rule the destinies of the world. They are
``just doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the bitter truth. Yet, all the West's talk to the
contrary notwithstanding, the United States and NATO have suffered
a political and moral fiasco. The tragedy of Yugoslavia has shown
that this kind of a ``new world order'' cannot work. It is being
rejected, as each day passes, by popular opinion of other nations
and even by many people in NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that a special session of the U.N. General Assembly
should be convened in 2000 to take stock of the 20th century and
discuss new ideas for the future. No forum today has more
credibility or universality. No organization is a better place for
discussing our future. It is the only place where global security
can be properly addressed. Taking these issues elsewhere would lead
us into a dangerous direction.
</P>
<P>
   The leading nations of the West, however powerful they are, are
unable to replace the United Nations. I am convinced that any such
attempts will not work. It is a good sign that the architects of
the Kosovo ``blitzkrieg'' were compelled _ by the logic of events
and by the force of world opinion _ to turn to the United Nations.
All one can say is better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's actions in Yugoslavia were clearly contrary to the U.N.
Charter, a fact that the special session of the U.N. General
Assembly will have to address, as well as other tough issues
including the reform of the organization itself. It is clear that,
having been created more than 50 years ago in a totally different
international environment, the United Nations is in need of
profound changes and new tools to enable it to meet new challenges
such as economic and environmental security and combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A review of international norms will have to be undertaken, to
see which ones are outdated and which ones need to be added, while
reaffirming the validity of certain fundamental principles. The
United Nations will have to be given a special role both in the
settlement of interethnic conflicts and in protecting the
sovereignty of nations at a time of accelerating globalization.
</P>
<P>
   A fair hearing will have to be given to the reform ideas
contained in proposals of Boutros Boutros-Ghali and of the
commission chaired by former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson. The special session will also have to focus on arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   I am afraid that we have been yielding to the pressure from the
military-industrial complexes. It may well be that this is behind
the enlargement of NATO's membership and sphere of activity. The
world is again being pushed to the path of the arms race, while the
problems of backwardness, poverty, environment and education cry
out for our attention.
</P>
<P>
   A joint effort of thinking and planning the future could be
useful not only for the weak and vulnerable but also for the strong
_ if they are wise.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... in 1963.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was the seed of the pro revival leading to open tennis in
1968 and the riches in the game today. This weekend's Davis Cuppers
ought to know that their momentary playground, Longwood, kept their
profession breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer dug up 12 guys to play the US Pro, and the bank put up a
sum that seemed a fortune, a $10,000 purse. Laver beat Gonzalez on
grass in a rainstorm and felt like the Aga Khan when he saw the
champion's check for $2,200. Julie Hickey, now a Boston attorney,
felt like Helen of Troy, having launched an historic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, after losing to Rosewall, the volatile Gonzalez
tried to knock out a steel locker in the dressing room with a
roundhouse right hand. The locker won the decision. But Pancho had
a point, bellowing, ``Why are we still playing on this goddamn
grass? They should pave over the whole place!''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments, though shared, weren't expressed so vociferously
by colleagues. Nevertheless, Longwood, a fairly progressive outpost
(despite the passe name) in a very conservative sport, began a
court evolution for its professional guests. In the interest of
truer bounces, stadium grass was uprooted, replaced by a plastic
carpet in 1969, presently by clay in 1974, and _ overdue _ hard
courts in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The US Pro had led the way away from grass for the country's
prime tournaments. Installation of clay was copied by the US Open
in 1975 along with floodlit night tennis that Longwood had
pioneered in 1969, and acceptance of the then radical tie-breaker
at the US Pro of 1970. But the resistance to hard courts _ ``No
parking lot tennis in our club,'' huffed one reactionary board
member _ was costly after the US Open embraced asphalt at Flushing
Meadow in 1978, and the US, except Boston, followed. The quality of
talent declined. Those shining days and nights that made Boston
second only to the Open in New York _ the titles of Laver,
Rosewall, Roche, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg _ were but a lilting
memory.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A return to prominence
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years late, the US Pro got around to hardening up, but
further mismanagement sent the tournament into further decline.
Instead of remaining with the newly reorganized ATP Tour in 1990,
Longwood presented a series of charades, exhibition tourneys
through 1995, turning off its public. In 1996 the house went
regrettably dark. But the efforts of president Tom Ford paid off in
1997 _ ``this is a big-league city that deserves big-league
tennis,'' he proclaimed _ as Longwood climbed back onto the
recognized circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the way back,'' says president Steve Roiter, having
hired Woolf Associates to lead a 21st-century revival and obtained
Jim Courier to head the August cast, playing for considerably more
than the 10 grand of 1964: $350,000 with perhaps $200,000 more for
unannounced appearance fees, unimaginable sums to a hopeful band of
cricketers of 1877 who paid $40 annual rent to the estate of David
Sears for a patch of turf on his intown estate called Longwood. A
$200 shanty was erected as clubhouse with a shallow tub posing as
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Groundsman Charlie Chambers recalled the place in his old age:
``That tub was like a bird bath with members flicking water on
themselves as a sort of shower. They didn't believe much in
laundries. At the end of the season they made a bonfire out of the
cricket and tennis clothes they'd worn practically non-stop.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Longwood I, the original, at the corner of Brookline
and Longwood Avenues, present-day site of the Winsor School, across
from Beth Israel Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three years after the founding a young member studying at
Harvard, Dwight Davis, ordered a sterling Cup from Shreve's, and
the Davis Cup came into being. It spread from just Britain and the
winning US in 1900 to 129 countries this year. This was 12 years
before Fenway Park rose a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The property became too valuable for tennis, and Longwood II was
conceived in 1911, a move way out into what appeared to be the
wilderness at the time, a lot divided between Newton and Brookline,
halved like Berlin not so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   By 1922 the new courts, reclaimed from a swamp, and the spare,
twin-towered stucco clubhouse, purchased and moved from the defunct
Chestnut Hill Club, were ready for use. Big Bill Tilden beat club
member Dick Williams (the Titanic and Harvard alumnus) for the
Longwood Bowl. Molla Mallory took the female version over Helen
Wills Moody. Tilden came back with Richards for the US Doubles
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Longwood set up shop, a Harvard-trained physician,
Dr. James Dwight, who wisely never let medicine interfere with his
tennis, became a member as did his protege, Dick Sears, grandson of
the property owner. Dwight was probably the first American to play,
in 1874, with Fred Sears on a front lawn in Nahant. He surely won
the first tournament, a sociable round-robin, in 1876 at Nahant.
And the groomed young Sears, a 19-year-old Harvardian, to win the
inaugural US Championship at Newport in 1881.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, rightly considered the Big Daddy of American tennis, was
a leading light in forming the US Tennis Association, putting
together the Davis Cup competition and playing championship doubles
with Sears. The club has spawned several other USTA presidents
(one, Walter Elcock, was also president of the International Tennis
Federation, 1975-76), champs, innovators, Hall of Famers, and a few
genuine heroes.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Al Stitt in 1958. On his way to play a US
Doubles match, he heard a cry of distress from the swimming pool. A
tot had fallen in, unnoticed by the guards. Quickly Al dived to the
rescue. Then he resumed walking squishily to the assigned court
where his partner berated him for his sodden, bedraggled
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the club president Jack Steverman, the electrician
who had installed the floodlights. Prowling the empty grounds to
check up on everything about 2 a.m., after play had ended, the
crowd departed, he, too, heard a mournful cry for help. Turned out
a porta-john had been turned over by pranksters while occupied. The
door was blocked, the poor guy trapped. Steverman liberated him.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody liberated Napoleon the second time he was exiled, to the
small, distant isle of St. Helena off the West African coast. The
manor house where he died was called Longwood, the name chosen by
Napoleon buff David Sears for his estate. A few tennis conquerors
experienced Waterloos at this Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody has replaced Hazel Wightman as the American Lady of
Tennis. She died at 87 in 1974 after grabbing cartloads of titles.
Winning was the least of it, although she was an all-timer who
racked up extraordinary US triples (the US singles, doubles, and
mixed titles) three straight years, 1909-11, had a Wimbledon title
and two Olympic gold medals in doubles.

<P>
   Like Dwight Davis, Mrs. Wightie, as everyone called her,
believed in international team play, feeling the women should have
a Davis Cup-style tournament of their own. She also donated a
trophy, the Wightman Cup, for that purpose. Lifting off in 1923, it
was a hit for years, the US vs. Britain, and inspired the later
Federation Cup. If anybody wanted tennis lessons, this tiny, jovial
old ivory-haired lady gave them gratis in her garage a block from
the club to countless kids and adults, demonstrating her trademark
volley in the limited space. She was a giver and an encourager.

   A championship venue
</P>
<P>
   Following Dick Sears, US champs flowed from the club in the
early days when the Northeast was dominant. Mike Leach, triumphant
in the NCAA singles in 1982, was the most recent, and accompanied
his old man, Dr. Robert Leach, to the Father and Son title in
1990-91. Sarah Palfrey in 1941 and 1945 was the last Longwoodian to
take the big one, the US Singles, then at Forest Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Making a singular Longwood-Forest Hills leap in 1968, Lt. Arthur
Ashe was a breakthrough man while serving in the US Army. With
searing serves and volleys Arthur captured and captivated Boston
that year to win the US Amateur over Bob Lutz, his first important
title and national TV debut, courtesy WGBH-PBS. Few gave him a shot
at the US Open, but he blitzed the pros, too, beating Tom Okker in
the final. No amateur will ever take both titles again.
</P>
<P>
   At Longwood a reporter asked Ashe how it felt to play and win at
a restricted club where he wouldn't be accepted as a member. He
replied, ``I don't like it, but I have to go where the tournaments
are played. And I believe that will change.'' Happily it did, some
time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But little has changed in the club's outward appearance. Well,
the cow belonging to the mother of Senator Leverett Saltonstall no
longer grazes in the area of the terrace courts. Chambers
remembered that cow as an obstacle when he was laying out the new
courts just after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``The club had just about all the land it wanted, except that
parcel owned by Mrs. Saltonstall,'' he said. ``She said she
wouldn't sell until the cow died. I'm sure a few members thought
about poisoning it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only cow now is the cash cow, the US Pro, and Longwood is
one of a determined handful of clubs hanging in the professional
tournament game. Mike Humphrey, the groundsman for a
quarter-century, is pleased that he doesn't have to care for such
an animal tramping on his bluegrass and creeping bent, and that the
Japanese beetles haven't been in touch for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't even many crickets, although I saw one the other
day,'' he says. ``We do have a few little weevils, about a
quarter-inch.'' But it isn't likely the name will be changed to
Longwood Weevil Club.

MAGELLAN CONTINUES TO PERFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when everyone said Fidelity's Magellan Fund was too
big?
</P>
<P>
   That was the prevailing sentiment in September 1997 when the
mutual fund giant closed the fund to new investors. The argument
was pretty basic. At $60 billion, the fund was considered something
of an elephant, too big and too slow to make the nimble moves
necessary to generate good returns.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making that case were the authors of this column,
who, in applauding the decision to close the fund wrote, ``Magellan
has become too big to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do you expect for your 50 cents a day _ perfection?
</P>
<P>
   The Magellan fund is set to become the first mutual fund to
cross the $100 billion mark _ it reached $99.3 billion Monday _ and
contrary to predictions, its performance has been awfully good. As
of last Friday, Magellan had returned 16.2 percent for the year,
slightly ahead of the 14.9 percent turned in by Vanguard's Standard
&AMP; Poors 500 Index. Last year Magellan topped the index by five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Since Robert Stansky took over the helm of Magellan in June
1996, the fund has outperformed 77 percent of all growth funds,
according to Lipper Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Stansky's skill, some in the industry insist
he has also benefited from good luck. ``This has been a good time
to be big,'' says Russel Kinnel, mutual fund editor for
Morningstar.com, a firm that tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky's hot stretch has coincided with a period of excellent
performance by large-cap stocks, especially technology stocks. The
large-cap renaissance has allowed Stansky to buy the big stocks he
must buy, without paying any penalty. Should the market hit an
extended period where small- and mid-cap stocks do better, he will
be hard-pressed to keep pace, say the defenders of the ``big is
bad'' philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Those same people are also correct when they point out that the
Magellan fund is unlikely ever to beat the index by the huge
margins it did when it was younger and leaner. In 1991 and 1993,
the fund topped the index by 11 and 14 percentage points
respectively. The fund's current size guarantees that it must own a
big chunk of the index.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at Stansky's record suggests something else: that the
fears about the fund's size were overblown in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Magellan's growth has been more than matched by
the stock market in general. Put another way, the fund's value
represents a smaller percentage of the total value of the stock
market than it did back in 1995. At $100 billion, Magellan can
still move in and out of stocks without causing big disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Second and most important, Stansky has proven he can be quite
nimble. If his fund is an elephant, it's an elephant that knows how
to tap dance.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky's method of operation is to make good-size bets on
different sectors of the market _ technology, retailing, energy
etc. Over time, those bets can change quite a bit. Consider: At the
end of 1997, Magellan had 12.9 percent of its money in technology
stocks. By the end of 1998 technology represented 25.8 percent of
the fund; by the end of the first quarter of 1999 technology was
down to 20.9 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Stansky's bets have paid dividends. Last
summer, after the Russian financial crisis took the air out of
technology stocks, Magellan moved aggressively into the sector,
says David O'Leary, a Fidelity watcher at Alpha Equity Research in
New Hampshire. According to O'Leary, Stansky's purchase of five big
stocks _ Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, American Online, and MCI Worldcom
_ allowed him to beat the market handily for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky has also profited by investing heavily in retail stocks
and lightening up on financial stocks and health care stocks,
sectors that have not done well of late. He has consistently had
very little money in companies like Coke and Gillette, consumer
product firms that have been hurt by weak overseas economies.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.4 million shareholders in the Magellan fund have voted
their approval of Stansky's performance by sending him more of
their cash flow. The fund attracted about $2.1 billion in new money
in the first five months of the year, according to O'Leary. While
Magellan is officially closed to new investors, it is still
available to enrollees in retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   If we goofed when we questioned Stansky's prospects for beating
the market, we had plenty of company. ``I was one of those who said
it was too big,'' says William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch
Carre, a mutual fund consulting firm. ``I recommended that they
break the fund into pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does Dougherty think of his advice now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong,'' he says flatly.

   BOSTON -- It seems like everyone carrying a microphone or a
camera in town this week wants a piece of Leslie Sullivan's time.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of broadcasting and new media development for
Major League Baseball, Sullivan presides over the telecasts of the
All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby and other related events. And,
among other things, ESPN and Fox ask her where they can set up
their cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Francis is not having much down time, either. As vice
president of marketing for Major League Baseball, she is in charge
of more than a half-dozen events related to the All-Star Game _ all
of which are intended to help baseball address the crucial issue of
competing successfully for America's leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   And as vice president of special events for Major League
Baseball, Marla Miller is absolutely up to her eyeballs in work.
Miller is in charge of the whole affair, making sure that this
annual, gala festival, so crucial to burnishing the brand of Major
League Baseball, delivers all that the hoopla portends.
</P>
<P>
   On the field and in the dugouts at Fenway Park it will be all
men in uniform, the stars of the game. But anyone spending any time
behind the scenes around Boston this week knows that the All-Star
Game clearly is not just another ``guy thing.'' Women are playing
key roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, as sports have become more professional and
more corporate _ and less reliant on just the old boys' networks _
they reflect more and more the increasing diversity of the
corporate world,'' said Mary Jo Kane, director of the Tucker Center
for Research on Girls and Women Sports, at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old boys' network has not entirely disappeared, certainly.
But what you are seeing at the All-Star Game is how many women are
very much in place, and in some positions of real power, in the
business of major sports in this country,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the front office of Major League Baseball.
The list of women playing key roles this All-Star Game week seems
as long as one of Mark McGwire's home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives in charge of public relations for the two
leagues are women: Katy Feeney for the National League and Phyllis
Merhige in the American League. In addition to helping mete out
punishment for on-field disciplinary problems during the rest of
the year, Feeney and Merhige played key roles in helping All-Star
team managers gather information on which players to select.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Collet, a marketing communications consultant for the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., has played a major role in the
coordination of the FanFest, which 80,000 people are likely to
visit by closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Stein is under contract with Major League Baseball as
one of the key producers of FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   Colette A.M. Phillips, president and chief executive of Colette
Phillips Communication, is the official public relations firm for
the Boston Red Sox and FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback we're getting is that the event has gotten a lot
of exposure,'' said Phillips, who started her company 13 years ago.
``We've got a good track record, but this will really expand our
sports marketing and event operations.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the women have different stories about how they arrived
at high-profile positions in the traditionally testosterone-laden
world of sports. Some have worked in the sports business for 25
years, starting when there truly were no other women around. Others
are more recent arrivals, grateful to the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in general feel that when they are interested in
something they can pursue it, whether that's sports or not,''
Miller said last week, while juggling in-coming phone calls.
``There's a lot more women around than I saw when I started out 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller pursued a career in sports management, about 15 years
ago, after her journalism degree at New York University led to a
job at a magazine group that did not live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, Mehrige's one-time boss, Lee MacPhail, the
former American League president, realized her value as a secretary
and kept giving her more responsibilities and, eventually, jobs and
titles commensurate with her contribution. She worked with Bob
Fishel, a premier public relations official with the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Bob was so well thought of, because he had such an
enormous reputation in the game, there was a sense that if Bob
liked me, I must be okay,'' Mehrige said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan began her career at CBS Sports in New York with the
executive producer Eddie Einhorn. When Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf
bought the Chicago White Sox in 1981, Sullivan moved to Chicago as
manager of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   She helped start up SportsVision, one of the early, regional
sports networks, that eventually became Sports Channel, Chicago.
From there, it was a short jump to running broadcast and new media
at Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis realized she was a shot or two short of being a
tennis professional, and that being a human resources administrator
for an insurance company was not her love, she said she returned to
school for a master's degree in marketing with a dream of working
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by some of my counselors that, `You probably want
to take that job with that consumer packaged goods company because
women don't really work in sports and if you do it will probably be
some low-level coordinator or secretary,' '' Francis said.
``Luckily, I didn't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women of baseball and observers agree that the glass
ceiling for women in sports is at the operations level, where few
women are involved in personnel decisions affecting the athletes or
the performances of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   There are but a few women scouts in Major League Baseball, and
only Marge Schott, of the Cincinnati Reds, and Wendy Selig-Prieb,
of the Milwaukee Brewers, own teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the arguments I keep hearing is that, `Well, women
didn't play the sport,' '' said Lisa Masteralexis, head of the
sports management program at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can tell you there are a lot of men running the
operations who didn't play the sport either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the lessons of the Women's World Cup Soccer
phenomenon is is that women can play the games,'' Kane said, ``and
they can bring that knowledge to the operations side of things.''
Kane said.

 ASWAN, Egypt: ... ogled by pashas.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The guest rooms are examples of faded grandeur, in need of
refurbishment, but the vast carved armoires, corner fireplaces, and
turn-down service that includes rose petals strewn over the bed go
a long way to compensate. Get a Nile-facing room if you want a
breathtaking view of the river and the cliffs that house the tombs,
and if you can cope with the din: Egyptians are the world's most
enthusiastic car horn honkers, and they keep at it all night. A
garden-facing room would offer more tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil also describes the Winter Palace's Royal Bar, the place
to put your feet up after a hot day of sightseeing and challenges
like dealing with the endless bargaining any ride in an Egyptian
taxi requires. The bar is all dark woodwork, lit with glowing,
backlit stained glass. It has a formal feel, as does the entire
place. On the night when I ambled across the hall to make dinner
reservations in the 1886 Restaurant, the hotel's fanciest, I was
reminded that my companion would have to wear a jacket and tie. She
did.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel acts as a giant buffer between the frenzy of Luxor and
the calm of the gardens, the most glorious in town, overflowing
with palms, hibiscus, hollyhocks, nasturtiums, marigolds,
ornamental pools, and an aviary filled with cooing doves. (Dinner?)
The star attraction in this oasis is a huge swimming pool, where,
during my visit, there were a lot of seriously flabby Europeans of
a certain age wearing skimpy swimsuits, exposing pale,
soon-to-be-sunburned flesh. You wonder what the Egyptian male
waiters serving them poolside _ men accustomed to seeing Egyptian
women covered head to toe _ make of this display.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nile is just another patch of water, a manager at the Mena
House informs me. But the Pyramids are unique.
</P>
<P>
   The Mena House has the world's greatest view of the world's
greatest monuments _ if you get the right room. Because the hotel's
18-hole golf course is so close to the Great Pyramid, guests in the
past have occasionally climbed it in order to use it as the world's
largest golf tee. You can't do that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Originally built as a royal hunting lodge, the Mena House was
expanded with the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal, when Cairo
welcomed the Empress Eugenie by building a brand new road out to
Giza. The spiffy road helped spur tourism, and eventually, some
wealthy Britons bought the Mena House and spent a fortune turning
it into a deluxe hotel, fitting it out with elaborate latticework,
tiles, screens, and arabesque arches. More than a century on, the
sense of luxury still prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in 40 acres of jasmine-scented grounds, the hotel has
an outline that is as complex as that of the pyramids is smooth.
Turrets, towers, and long rows of arches punctuate the facade.
Inside the lobby, hanging like so many stalactites, are dozens of
glass pendants that cast a soft golden glow on you as you check in.
If you've just arrived from chaotic Cairo, or its equally hectic
airport, you'll find basking under them soothing indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mena House is a self-contained world, with sports facilities
including the Cairo area's largest swimming pool, several
distinguished restaurants _ including The Moghul Room, Egypt's
finest Indian eatery, where the Red Sea prawns are divine _ and a
casino, nightclub, and discotheque. Heretical though the thought
is, there would be enough to occupy you for a few days even without
the Pyramids. But of course you'll want to explore them thoroughly,
and since they're a five-minute stroll from the hotel door, you can
do so in easy stages, breaking for a poolside lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The decor in the Mena House's larger rooms and suites is
completely over the top, with Islamic arches, mirrors, and gilding
the dominant motifs. Consider my bathroom. Beware the bather who
steps from this tub with a less than confident body image. You're
confronted with a full-length mirror. Step to the sink and there's
a five-sided mirror to reveal your every flaw. En route to the
dressing room you run a gantlet of full-length mirrors on both
sides. In the bedroom, a huge, scallop-shaped mirror hangs over the
dressing table. The sole occupant of this extravagant space, I
nevertheless never felt alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of caveats. In addition to the 19th-century rooms, all
three of these hotels have modern wings that, while comfortable,
are relatively charmless. Meanwhile, the historic sections of all
three have some rooms with views of the Nile or, in the case of
Mena House, the Pyramids, and others that overlook the hotel
grounds. If you feel you haven't traveled all the way to Egypt to
gaze at a plot of petunias, you'll want the more dramatic vistas.
Be prepared to pay extra for them, though.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth remembering is that the Egyptian government's idea of
what constitutes a five-star hotel _ a classification all the above
have received _ isn't necessarily up to the standards of, say, the
Savoy Group. Rooms in all three hotels are slightly run-down. The
government actually owns all three properties, which are managed by
foreigners: the French Sofitel group in the case of the Winter
Palace and Old Cataract; the Indian-based Oberoi company in the
case of the Mena House. The top managers in the hotels are
foreigners, but most of the staff are Egyptian, and haven't
necessarily ever even seen a truly great hotel. So the managers are
left trying to describe one to them. Sometimes it works. On the
other hand, in the Winter Palace I was served wine with a blob of
cork floating in it. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he told
me to take it out.
</P>
<P>
   About the wine. Egypt has good grape-growing conditions but also
an Islamic government that has little interest in developing the
industry. So the wine, which comes in three generic varieties _
``white,'' ``red,'' and ``rose'' _ tastes like turpentine.
Meanwhile, the government slaps a staggering 450 percent duty on
imported vintages, which managers in top hotels are forced to buy
because their guests expect good wines as a complement to the good
food they offer. The first time I went to Egypt, I learned the
solution to this dilemma from a couple of savvy American travelers:
Bring your own.

TRUTH, DECENCY IS TAYLOR LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll forgive the shell shock in this newsroom, the sense that
we've lost too much of our own control. For the first time in 126
years, the Taylor family is not guiding the newspaper, and an
uncertain future has dawned on the tradition-laden pages of The
Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   It was swift, this decision to remove Ben Taylor as publisher
Monday _ and surprising. He was, literally, born to the job, but
nevertheless worked his way through the newsroom as a reporter and
editor, learning the intricacies of daily journalism from the
street on up.
</P>
<P>
   There was something reassuring about him, though never anything
glib. The Taylors, Ben included, might have stumbled here and
there, but you always knew they were trying to get things right.
Decency was, and is, the family trademark.
</P>
<P>
   So is excellent journalism. I've had the good fortune to travel
near and far on the Taylor nickel over much of my 10-year career
here. One of the things I've learned living out of hotel rooms in
distant cities is this: The Globe is inarguably one of the
half-dozen best newspapers in America, a fact that even we in this
newsroom _ natural complainers, all _ too often tend to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Ben Taylor and the family members who came before him.
While other newspapers were cutting budgets _ and with it, news
holes and reporters _ the Taylors demanded a quality product every
day of the week, and were willing to pay for it in slimmer profit
margins. For them, journalism was more than a means to make a
dollar. It was a way to make their mark in the community they have
always loved and lived in.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone seemed to flourish from their efforts. Fifteen
Pulitzer Prizes have been won by members of the Globe staff over
the years _ one of so many reasons this has become a marquee
newspaper. At the same time, a $1,000 investment in Globe stock in
1973 was worth $120,000 only 20 years later. There are pressroom
workers who drive Cadillacs and Lincolns to their Cape Cod vacation
houses every Friday afternoon because of their well-placed faith in
the Brahmin Taylors.
</P>
<P>
   When the family sold the Globe to The New York Times Co. in 1993
for more than $1 billion, Ben Taylor could have probably bought a
small cruise ship with his profits and spent his remaining days
sailing the Mediterranean in the hands of an obsequious crew.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Taylors, led by then-publisher Bill Taylor, Ben's
second-cousin, struck a deal to keep one of their own in charge for
at least the next five years. It wasn't out of a need for money,
but from a sense of mission. The Taylors have always devoted
themselves to public service in the form of the best possible
newspaper they could produce, and the sale and its resulting
windfall would do little to change their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Has Ben Taylor taken his knocks in his two-plus years as
publisher? Of course, most prominently in the paper's
well-chronicled handling of the two well-known writers who once
occupied this space, Mike Barnicle and Patricia Smith. Criticize
his indecisive handling, but be gin clear on this fact: Any of his
mistakes were born of nothing more sinister than humanity _ an
attempt to be fair to the paper, to its public, and to all the
people involved. He'll live with that just fine.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's announcement, it became apparent that change was
inevitable, though dignity was not. The New York Times didn't buy
this company to leave it in someone else's hands. Ben Taylor could
as easily have gone home after he got the news, taken solace in his
banking statements, and avoided the public eye. Instead, he stood
before the gathered editorial staff to welcome his replacement,
Richard Gilman, a Times executive, and spoke only of his hope for
the Globe's future. He'll remain as chairman of the Globe's board
of directors. It was the class act that we had come to expect of a
classy man.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, in turn, spoke soothingly about the paper's future and
appreciatively of the Taylors' guiding hand. Even in this time of
tumult, we'd be foolish to overlook the fact that The New York
Times knows a thing or two about publishing a great newspaper. The
Taylors could have sold out to a lesser chain, but didn't.
Ironically, any upside in Monday's transition was largely the
Taylors' doing.
</P>
<P>
   What we lost in the sale six years ago was local ownership of a
uniquely local institution. Monday we lost the stewardship of a
family that always tried to do the right thing. The Taylors have
made a great city better through the paper that covers it. Their
mark will linger for as long as we have a Boston Globe.

CLASSES CLASH IN SAN FRANCISCO`S MISSION DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One morning not long ago, aspiring musician
Jason Bowman awoke to discover he was yuppie scum.
</P>
<P>
   The words were spraypainted right there on the outside of the
loft building where he lives and works in San Francisco's Mission
district: Get Out Yuppie Scum. Bowman, a ponytailed 26, said he
tried not to take the message personally. He also made no plans to
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make enough money to qualify for the yuppie label,
although I'd sure like to,'' said Bowman, whose computer-based
dance band is called Memory Man. ``But anything that looks new and
shiny is a target, and I guess my building qualifies as one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other targets include sushi bars and sport utility vehicles,
anything that stands out as too upscale, too ostentatious, for one
of San Francisco's last working class neighborhoods. To longtime
locals, they symbolize the Silicon Valley cash and stock market
profits pricing them out of their homes. Every BMW, every coffee
bar, stands as a reminder of the squeeze on affordable apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Although many regret the vandalism, not even city officials
dispute that a class struggle is taking place in the still-gritty,
heavily Hispanic Mission district on the east side of the city.
Similar battles have been fought _ and mostly lost _ across San
Francisco, which now boasts some of the priciest real estate in the
nation. Mission renters worry that their neighborhood is next,
leaving them with no place to live in a city that claims to
celebrate diversity of all kinds. It stands as a kind of emblem of
the underside of the economic upsurge in cities across America _
the ever starker divide between those who own and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the middle are being squeezed, and the people at the
bottom are being squashed ...,'' said Richard Marquez, a tenant
activist with the neighborhood group Mission Agenda and Eviction
Defense Network. ``But we could still turn the tide in the
Mission.''
</P>
<P>
   For Marquez and many organizers, that means more subsidized
housing, more mixed housing and more rights for tenants, businesses
as well as families. In a city that prefers its politics served up
street theatre-style, it has also meant the emergence of a tiny
group calling itself the Yuppie Eradication Project. Considered
humorous by some, dangerous by others, the group has opted to use
threats to raise awareness of the housing crisis and frighten away
the young Internet moneymakers who discovered the Mission three or
so years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until their leader was arrested, in the hours before dawn,
allegedly covered with wallpaper paste, project members spent six
months plastering the Mission with fliers encouraging the bombing
of ``yuppie'' bars and restaurants. They urged people to strike out
at newcomers by breaking windows, slashing tires and scratching
paint on yuppie cars, specifically Lexuses, Porsches, Jaquars and
SUVs. Spraypainting their newly remodeled live-work spaces was
offered as another alternative. ``Trash them all,'' the fliers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started screaming about the number of lofts coming on
the market for $300,000 to $500,000, which is hardly starving
artist range,'' said Jason Teplitsky, who opened Blowfish Sushi in
the Mission 2 1/2 years ago and has been a target of the group.
``They say now the neighborhood is all about people who make money.
. . . But this kind of provocation _ let's bash cars and destroy
property _ is definitely not speaking for anybody except the
lunatic fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of legal counsel, unemployed temp worker Kevin
Keating declined to claim credit for the anti-yuppie crusade. But
few doubt he was behind the fliers signed Nestor Makhno, the name
of a Ukranian anarchist who killed landlords during the Russian
revolution. In mid-May, police raided his apartment and arrested
Keating, 38. No charges have been filed, although police said the
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the language in the posters was any less provocative,
nobody would have paid attention,'' said Keating, who has lived in
the Mission for 11 years and pays $800 a month for what he
described as a large single room with low ceilings. ``But what we
really need is a large organization of all of us together to
preserve the neighborhood for the working class.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the Atlas Cafe, which, like many of the newer
neighborhood establishments, used to have a Spanish name and serve
a Hispanic clientele, Keating clearly relished the outcry his
alleged handiwork has caused. But threatening posters aside, the
rush of money into the Mission may be impossible to stop. Even at
$500,000, lofts in the neighborhood are relatively inexpensive by
San Francisco's superheated standards. At $350,000, a two-bedroom
fixer-upper is considered a steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about the new housing; it's about changing the
way a neighborhood feels and looks and whether poor people are even
welcome here anymore,'' said Matt Brown, director of St. Peter's
Housing Committee in the heart of the Mission. ``The one constant,
no matter which group lived here, was that it was a working-class,
blue-collar place. Now it's newly hip and fashionable and people
who are newly six-figured are taking advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, the median sale price for a three-bedroom house was
$361,410 in 1998; a two-bedroom apartment typically rented for
$2,008. In a city where more than two-thirds of the residents rent,
the vacancy rate was a miniscule 1 percent. As city planner
Charlotte Barham explained, even many middle-class people can no
longer afford to buy a first home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly you don't want to force everyone who doesn't make
$100,000 a year out of San Francisco...,'' said Paul Zeger,
president of Pacific Marketing Association, which sells properties
throughout the Bay Area and sold 45 Mission units costing $220,000
to $695,000 in a single weekend. ``But if you shut down the forces
of growth, things are going to go down and down and down for the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the young urban professionals who bear the
sobriquet ``yuppie'' appear to have the upper hand in the Mission.
Every renter seems to know someone who has been evicted by a
landlord who wants to move into the newly hot neighborhood or
convert his bui lding to condominiums _ often unlawfully, activists
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, rental vacancies are almost nonexistent; over
a two-week period last year, Ted Gullicksen, manager of the San
Francisco Tenants Union, said he saw only one Mission rental
advertised in local newspapers, although as many as 80 percent of
neighborhood residents are renters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is actually a downside to prosperity,'' said P.J.
Johnston, spokesman for Mayor Willie Brown's reelection campaign.
``We're in the midst of one now. It's a draw for people who want to
live in this city, and it's driving up real estate and housing
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Many newcomers to the Mission, however, resent being made
scapegoats for the city's economic turnaround of the last 10 years.
When the San Francisco Weekly covered Keating's cause extensively
and somewhat sympathetically, it was flooded with complaints from
yuppies. The newspaper's response: a fake June 6 rally where
so-called yuppies carried signs decrying discrimination and hate
crimes against them. Some 200 people fell for the prank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was two sets of people behaving ridiculously but
understandably if you understand San Francisco...,'' said SF Weekly
editor John Mecklin. ``Hell, yes, I consider the housing and rental
market problems serious. It's probably the No. 1 topic on
everyone's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Keating, along with the housing activists who tend to oppose his
tactics, said they know they can't save everything in the Mission.
Their more modest goal is to save what they can, and preserve as
much of the vibrant, economically and racially diverse
neighbhorhood as possible. Otherwise San Francisco will lose some
of its soul, they said, with the Mission becoming just another
bedroom community for Silicon Valley commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentrification has hit the neighborhood hard, but there are
still things worth fighting for,'' said James Tracy, an organizer
with the Eviction Defense Network. ``It's going to be too late
shortly. It's not too late now.''

CHINA GARBAGE PROBLEM MOUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ China's richest and most Westernized city is
confronting an unpleasant underside of being a modern,
consumer-oriented metropolis: garbage. Tons of it.
</P>
<P>
   Once a thrifty populace, Chinese consumers are now buying more
products wrapped in elaborate packaging and throwing them away
sooner. Cities such as Shanghai are spending money and energy to
move and treat ever greater amounts of trash, and losing precious
land to dumps and landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Mingyang, 70, a farmer from Anhui province, is one of
thousands who have migrated to Shanghai to make a living collecting
garbage. Ten hours a day, he drags a rickshaw behind him and loads
it with waste cardboard, which he exchanges for cash at one of
hundreds of primitive downtown recycling lots, a vast expanse of
glass heaps, bottlecaps, plastic piles, and paper mountains that
has become a virtual city unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cardboard is useless now, but we can produce new things
with it, like your notebook,'' Sun said. He makes the equivalent of
$2.50 a day, four times his earnings as a farmer. He also
recognizes the social import of his arduous work. ``We create a lot
more waste than before. . . . What I do is good. I clean the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   This commercial capital of more than 13 million people produces
26.4 million pounds of waste daily, and it is piling up faster than
the city's garbagemen can collect it. Two pounds of garbage per
person per day is low by Western standards _ the average American
creates 4.4 pounds a day.
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing. The vast majority of Chinese have incomes
far below those of consumers in developed nations, but China is
projected to have the world's largest economy by 2020. The
resulting waste problem will have implications for air, land, and
water quality, and for energy use and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita garbage production is rising 10 percent a year in a
nation with nearly five times the population of the United States,
making the environmental problems accompanying China's breakneck
economic growth a threat to the global, as well as local,
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai doesn't want its trash to become a cause celebre like
New York's notorious ``garbage barge,'' which in 1987 was turned
away from five states and three countries. Shanghai already has
2,000 trash heaps; nationwide, dumps cover 193 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese cities are running out of places to dump their
trash. Some have turned to incineration, but burning is
controversial because it releases toxic gases.
</P>
<P>
   So Shanghai, which prides itself on being China's trendsetter,
is trying to promote recycling. Next month, officials say they will
launch a program in one of the city's 15 districts to test the
public's willingness to separate garbage _ and the government's
ability to process it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Beijing and Shanghai have tried pilot programs before,
without success. Collectors stored the trash and then eventually
just re-mixed the items that residents had separated because the
government had nowhere to recycle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a country is first developing, people say, `We want
money; we don't care about quality of life,' '' said Feng Suwei,
director of Shanghai's Environmental Sanitation Administrative
Bureau. The city, he said, is in the second stage of development,
when a government with rising revenues can start to think about
minimizing the environmental impact of growth.
</P>
<P>
   But ``to protect the environment is a very high investment. Not
every city can afford it. . . . China is developing later, so we
are doing this later.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, China began recycling in the 1950s, but not in the way
we think of it today. Living standards were low, and reusing every
shred of almost everything was a state-sponsored ``mass activity''
and an economic necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-fashioned, direct-use recycling still takes place. Like
hundreds of other pig farmers, Sheng Jingrong, 34, bicycles three
hours each way into the city to dig in restaurant trash bins for
discarded food for his 80 pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai once had 500 state-run recycling stations where people
sold everything from chicken feathers and hair to scrap metal and
old books. In the past two decades of a more market-driven economy,
all but 50 of those operations went out of business because they
were unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Small-time entrepreneurs have filled the void, buying and
selling scrap at a small profit to factories in neighboring Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces to make new bottles and cans.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Weiguo, 31, runs a plastics recycling lot piled high with
bottles separated into piles of red, yellow, blue, and orange. He
pays collectors 12 cents for every 2.2 pounds of plastic they bring
in, and he resells it to factories for a penny profit per pound. He
clears $185 a month, 2 1/2 times his pension as a laid-off state
factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation officials say it's great to combine reemployment with
recycling, and they don't mind collectors making money off
Shanghai's garbage. But Feng complains that many factories in
Zhejiang and Jiangsu that use Shanghai's recycled trash are
polluting the air and water. ``We don't like the idea that
Shanghai's garbage is producing more environmental problems in
other places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feng says Shanghai could recycle its waste cleanly and
efficiently, and turn waste treatment into ``the main industry of
Shanghai in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In the upcoming pilot project, the city will ask residents to
separate trash into toxic, wet, and dry piles. Feng estimates 28
percent can be reused, but that it will take at least five years to
get the whole city to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Song Qinghua, of the environmenal advocacy group Global Village
of Beijing, says that's a good idea, but says China needs stronger
regulations to deter pollution and enforce recycling. She says that
the government should create a market for recycled goods by, for
example, requiring that state-owned enterprises buy at least half
their paper from recycling mills.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when her group tried to print a report on recycled
paper, it couldn't find a single factory making the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that unlike those in Western countries
city governments here get no tax revenue or federal funds to
finance garbage collection.
</P>
<P>
   Feng says Shanghai is considering a waste tax on manufacturers,
similar to ones in developed countries, to fund environmental
efforts. The city also will push for national legislation to
enforce recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is going to work,'' he said, ``we need the support of
business, nongovernmental organizations, citizens, every sector of
society.''

BAFFERT BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to give Bob Baffert credit. The popular trainer
suffered the first dip in his career recently when he orchestrated
a disasterous Triple Crown campaign. Some thought the ``genius''
label was wearing a little thin. But Baffert has rebounded so
quickly, helped by two big stakes victories over the weekend, that
his problems now appear to have been but a blip on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who rose to the top in 1997 and '98 when Silver Charm
and Real Quiet both won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness before
losing exciting Triple Crown bids in the Belmont Stakes, sent out
an entry of General Challenge and the filly Excellent Meeting in
this year's Derby. The pair were well-prepared and deserved their
billing as favorites, but they both had rough trips and finished
off the board. Excellent Meeting was pushed back to 18th before
rallying to finish fifth, and General Challenge was knocked
sideways out of the gate, then shut off on the first turn, and
wound up 11th.
</P>
<P>
   After the Derby ordeal, General Challenge was sent home to
California, but Baffert made a curious decision to bring Excellent
Meeting back for the Preakness, a difficult assignment for a filly.
Excellent Meeting informed Baffert that he had made an error by
pulling herself up on the far turn. Baffert then sent out his other
top filly, Silverbulletday, in the Belmont, even though he may have
been the only one in racing who thought she could run a mile and a
half against males. Predictably, she took the lead but faded to
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, long a media darling, was stung by a barrage of
criticism and was on the verge of becoming yesterday's news.
However, General Challenge, Excellent Meeting, and Silverbulletday,
who won the $250,000 Monmouth Oaks Saturday, all came back to
capture their next starts. That means, despite his obvious
miscalculations, that Baffert didn't ruin any of them. And, to top
it off, Baffert turned Foresty, another 3-year-old, loose to
capture the $150,000 Dwyer Stakes at Belmont, marking the first
victory in 10 tries for Baffert in New York. It now looks as if
Forestry could be his most powerful sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, a daughter of Silver Deputy, has now won six of
seven races this year and 12 of 14 in her career. The only race she
lost other than the Belmont was to Excellent Meeting. The one
comment on starting Silverbulletday in the Belmont that made any
sense came from owner Mike Pegram, who said that he and Baffert
were out to stop Charismatic, who had won the Derby and Preakness,
from becoming Horse of the Year by being the first to win the
Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. They want Silvebulletday to be
Horse of the Year, but that's a hard assignment for a young female.
</P>
<P>
   In the Monmouth Oaks, which drew only four starters,
Silverbulletday and Jerry Bailey stalked pacesetter Bag Lady Jane
from the outset, took over when ready, and drew off to a 5-length
tally at minimum odds of 1-20 ($2.10 to win), covering a mile and
one-16th in 1:43. ``I could tell that she was ready, her energy
level was high,'' said Baffert. ``She's so much fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Forestry, a son of Storm Cat, cost a whopping $1.5 million as a
yearling, but he was a late developer for owners Aaron and Marie
Jones. Silverbulletday was 2-year-old filly champion, but Forestry
did not race at age 2. He debuted on Jan. 2 at Santa Anita and ran
second. He broke his maiden in his next start, then ran third in an
allowance race won by the precocious Apremont, with Charismatic
second. Forestry has taken five straight races since and now sports
a record of 8-6-1-1, with over $300,000 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dwyer, Forestry and Bailey broke first in the field of
five. The speedy Doneraile Court, a $1 million yearling trained by
Nick Zito and ridden by Jorge Chavez, rushed up and took over,
sizzling through a half in :44 4/5 and 6 furlongs in 1:08 2/5.
Forestry tracked the leader, then ran past him turning for home and
coasted to the wire to score by better than two lengths. Off at
even money ($4), Forestry covered the mile and one-16th, run around
one turn at Belmont, in 1:41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I picked the right day to get my first win in New
York,'' said Baffert. ``Forestry is getting better and learning how
to run. When we bought him, he was medium-sized, and he got big
quick. That's why I didn't want to push him too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Silverbulletday and Forestry will return to Churchill
Downs, where they are based, and Baffert will mull when to start
them next. Silverbulletday grabbed a quarter (cut her front foot
with her back) in the Monmouth Oaks, and Baffert wants to keep his
eye on her. But he might run both Silverbulletday and Forestry in
the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   The Haskell is raced at a mile and one-eighth, a more suitable
distance for Silverbulletday than the marathon 12 furlongs of the
Belmont, and Baffert and Pegram, who also owns Real Quiet, know
that Silverbulletday needs to beat colts at least once this year to
be considered for Horse of the Year. But would Forestry blast her
in the Haskell?
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Baffert makes the right decisions for the Haskell,
since he made enough wrong ones during the Triple Crown.

   `Thief' tuning up
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, third in the Derby, seventh in the Preakness, and
sixth against older horses in the Met Mile May 28, is training for
the Swaps Stakes for 3-year-olds at Hollywood Park Sunday, in which
he will be ridden by Pat Day. Last Sunday, Cat Thief, also a son of
Storm Cat, worked seven furlongs in 1:25 1/5 at Santa Anita. ``Cat
Thief just isn't a very good work horse, and he probably never will
be,'' said Randy Bradshaw, assistant trainer for D. Wayne Lukas.
``But, for him, this was a very good workout. We gave him some
company, and it seemed to wake him up a little bit.'' . . . Valhol,
who won the Arkansas Derby April 10 as a maiden but was
disqualified from the purse money when his jockey, Billy Patin, was
found to have carried an electrical device, broke his maiden
officially June 29. Valhol won an allowance race at Lone Star that
day and will race next in the Ohio Derby at Thistledown July 24 . .
. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association announced that the
Eclipse Award Dinner will be held Jan. 17 at the Beverly Hills
Hilton.

RONALDO REBIRTH CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago Monday, Brazil was succumbing to one of its most
baffling and humiliating defeats in the World Cup championship.
France deservedly won the game, 3-0, at Stade de France in
Saint-Denis, igniting the biggest celebrations on the Champs Elysee
since the end of World War II. But the mystery surrounding the
(literal) collapse of the Brazilian's star striker, Ronaldo, took
on an equally enduring life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has recovered, though, under Wanderly Luxemburgo, who
replaced Mario Zagallo as coach. And Ronaldo seems to be
rejuvenated. He scored the game-winner in a 2-1 victory over
Argentina Sunday as the Brazilians qualified for a Copa America
semifinal date with Mexico Wednesday in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo has already probably received more publicity than any
other 22-year-old athlete, a double-edged sword which brought him
riches but created unimagineable pressures. He seldom had a break
from publicity tours, international duty, and Serie A obligations
with Inter, the club which was supposed to be his first
professional obligation. Ronaldo's personal life was strained, his
engagement with Susana Werner has ended, and he has been
romantically linked with several other young women.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Ronaldo has been paired with Amoroso, who was
recently transfered from Udinese to Parma. With the powerful
Rivaldo in support, along with three physical midfielders, Flavio
Conceicao, Emerson, and Ze Roberto, the Brazilian attack has been
formidable. Amoroso was Serie A's leading scorer with 22 goals last
season and might be an even better striking partner for Ronaldo
than Christian Vieri, who will join him at Inter next season.
</P>
<P>
   At France '98, the Brazilians were supported by thousands of
countrymen. But they are feeling more comfortable now, with a home
base on the Brazil border at Foz de Iguazu.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has performed well in the tournament, overcoming the
suspension of Cuauthemoc Blanco and the accusation of doping of
Paulo Cesar Chavez and Raul Rodrigo Lara. Luis (El Pajaro)
Hernandez scored twice as Mexico eliminated Peru in penalty kicks
after playing to a 3-3 tie. Hernandez has now scored nine goals in
Copa America.
</P>
<P>
   The Copa America, initiated with an unofficial tournament in
1910, is the oldest continental competition and the last of the
century is reaching a dramatic climax. Chile and Uruguay meet in
the other semifinal. The final will be in Asuncion Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIFA-Asia agree
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FIFA reached a compromise with the Asian Football Confederation,
awarding the Asians a playoff against Europe for a place in the
2002 World Cup finals. Asia will have four teams _ two qualifiers,
plus co-hosts Japan and South Korea _ and a fifth team will meet
Europe's No. 15 team for a place. The Europeans will have 14
automatic qualifiers, including defending champion France. The rest
of the 32-team field includes Africa ( five teams), CONCACAF
(three), South America ( four, plus a fifth team involved in a
playoff with Oceania).
</P>
<P>
   The final match will be July 26, 2002 at Yokohama's 70,336-seat
stadium. FIFA rejected a proposal by the World Cup Organizing
Committee to change the format to extend group play into the second
round, which would have increased the number of games from 64 to
76. Organizers are attempting to maximize opportunities for
spectators, since this will be Asia's first-ever World Cup, and
expanding the tournament would allow them to rival attendances for
the US '94 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   US officials are jockeying for position for a return of the
World Cup in 2010. The success of the Women's World Cup reminded
FIFA officials how lucrative the event can be in the US, even if
both the '94 and '99 championship matches ended in boiling
temperatures, decided in penalty kicks by someone with a ponytail.

<P>

<P>
   Chivas is regal
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MLS All-Star Game is scheduled in San Diego this week with
attendance estimates ranging from 25,000 to more than 50,000. The
attraction is not only some of the best players in the MLS, but the
exhibition involving CD Guadalajara Chivas and Universidad
Cattolica of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Chivas is probably the most popular team in any sport in North
America, with the ability to draw huge crowds on a regular basis in
most major cities in Mexico and the US. Organizers are hoping to
attract fans from Tijuana and south. If the MLS decides to place an
expansion team in San Diego, it would be wise to set up a formal
partnership with Chivas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United they stand
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United has officially forsaken its defense of the FA
Cup since it will be involved in the World Team Championship club
competition Jan. 5-14 in Brazil. But AXA, the insurance group which
sponsors the FA Cup, has not surrendered. It has proposed providing
costs and transportation for United's FA Cup opponents and their
fans if the game could be staged in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Another deal has been proposed in which United would withdraw
from the Worthington Cup, formerly the League Cup, instead of the
FA Cup. United coach Alex Ferguson said the team simply does not
have time to accomodate all competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, United is about to begin a tour of Australia and
China without Ferguson and midfielder David Beckham.
London-educated South African midfielder Quinton Fortune, who has
been playing with Atletico Madrid, is on the verge of joining
United. Fortune's former Cape Town club recently signed an
agreement with United, and three other players are slated for
tryouts later this year.

GRASS COURTS OF LONGWOOD HAVE GROWN LUSH FOR 122 YEARS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Once in his musings, the picaresque boxing promoter
Sam Silverman wondered about Longwood Cricket Club: ``How come they
got a club for bugs?''
</P>
<P>
   Jess Cain, probably the greatest of Boston's radio voices when
he babbled on WHDH, didn't take it as seriously as Silverman.
During the August week of the long-since-fled US Doubles
Championships Jess would intone, ``The bugs are playing tennis
again out at Longwood.''
</P>
<P>
   If any current Longwood member even understands cricket, the
game, that would be a bigger upset than an 18-year-old Australian
named Lleyton Hewitt batting apart both Pete Sampras and Jim
Courier on the club's lone green hard-rock tennis court over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket, a pastime known and revered by the Aussies infiltrating
Chestnut Hill for the Davis Cup bash against the United States, and
other peoples descended from the British Empire, was certainly the
reason the club was founded 122 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But a new fad, tennis, barely 4 years old, started to take over
almost immediately, in 1878. Cricket would go down in 1911, a year
before the Titanic _ an accident, incidentally, from which a
Longwood member, Dick Williams, swam away to become a Davis Cupper
himself and US champ in 1914 and 1916.
</P>
<P>
   So, Longwood Cricket Club? Even today? This, perhaps, is a
tribute to our town's devotion to changing nothing. So what's new,
really? That aged crock, the Davis Cup, is right back where it was
launched in 1900, the Cricket Club, the home base of numerous
members whose influence has long been felt in tennis. Never in
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   But Longwoodians have a sense of humor about it as illustrated
by the insect in question adorning the club flag and the polo
shirts on sale at Buddy Schultz's pro shop. Entomologists may well
identify it as the sire of Jiminy Cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, crickets and grass do go together, and it is their 25
rare grass courts, fastidiously attended by groundsman Mike
Humphrey and crew, that the 900 members cherish, a kind, yet
tricky, footing enjoyed by few other clubs. They seem spectres,
clad in white, gamboling on an Elysian Field.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sod for all seasons
</P>
<P>
   On God's own sod the game began in England after it was patented
in 1874 in London by Major Walter Wingfield. If grass was good
enough for God and Wimbledon, barely-changing Longwood gladly stuck
with it, despite expensive upkeep and vulnerability to weather. A
grass court is alive and breathing, never quite the same from one
day to the next, which is part of its charm, but a maddening
feature for someone who prefers uniformity of court and bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other surfaces would appear on the 9.2-acre plot at
the corner of Route 9 and Hammond and Dunster Streets. The 13 clay
courts are popular, and the paving within the stadium appeals to
nomadic professionals. That means green slab, the Aussie-US
battleground, will also serve for the annual Longwood production,
the US Pro (Aug. 23-29), a stopover on the world-wide ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Although the seats in the Longwood arena have been sold out for
months, spectators at the US-Aussie engagement will note numerous
sideshows of varying ability on adjacent lawns: members going at
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's nice to see the pros, the best,'' says long-time
member Z. Paul Callahan. ``But your own game is a lot more
important to you than theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, international events _ Davis Cup, Wightman Cup,
Federation Cup, national championship tournaments _ have made
Longwood's reputation across the globe, and marked it as the
fountainhead of the American game, the country's oldest tennis club
of prominence. As early as 1890 the leading Americans were checking
in for the Eastern Doubles Championships, and the following year
the Longwood Bowl tourney was established, attracting the best from
everywhere. Until 1942 the Bowl was a fixture on the Eastern
grass-court circuit when that summertime route was the most
important segment of the US season.
</P>
<P>
   Grass and amateurism ruled until 1968, the dawn of open tennis,
the integration of amateurs and pros, as prize money materialized.
Even though the Longwood Bowl faded away during World War II, the
greats continued to show up for another Longwood specialty, the US
Doubles, that ran from 1917 through 1967 with only a couple of
brief interruptions. The season climaxed with the split US
Championships, the Doubles at Longwood followed by the Singles at
Forest Hills.
</P>
<P>
   It was a better arrangement than today's because all the
foremost men and women played doubles in Boston, then turned their
attention to singles in New York. However, since the US Open
gathered everything under one umbrella in 1968, doubles, often the
more entertaining, has been practically forgotten, partaken in
largely by no-names.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Aussies Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, and John Newcombe
remember the carnival that was the US Doubles spread across the
Longwood greensward to determine titles in men's and women's
doubles, mixed doubles plus Father and Son and senior doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great show,'' says Newcombe, the Aussie Davis Cup
captain, who won in 1967 with his current lieutenant, Tony Roche.
``Unique. The only tournament in the world devoted to top-class
doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Laver ``enjoyed watching the Father and Son and the seniors. We
didn't have anything like that in Australia then.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Van Ryn, at 93 the senior among US Davis Cuppers, says,
``Wilmer Allison and I loved going to Boston for doubles. We were
in finals six times (between 1930 and 1936) and won in 1931 and
1935. Bostonians knew their doubles teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, pairs such as Jack Kramer-Ted Schroeder, Bill
Talbert-Gardnar Mulloy, Chuck McKinley-Dennis Ralston, Stan
Smith-Bob Lutz, Roy Emerson-Fred Stolle became favorites. Titanic
survivor Dick Williams, the last of several Longwood members to win
a US male title, took it with Vinnie Richards in 1925-26. Richards
was 15 when he won with legendary Big Bill Tilden in 1918, and they
repeated in 1922-23.
</P>
<P>
   Longwoodian Sarah Palfrey won here seven times between 1935 and
1941, four of them with Alice Marble. Louise Brough and Margaret
duPont were perenn

   (itals)Several advertisers, including Philip Morris, recently
pulled their commercials from the Fox cartoon sitcom ``The Family
Guy.'' Philip Morris, which had planned a youth smoking prevention
campaign, told The New York Times that the show ``is not consistent
with our values as a company.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High above New York City in the executive offices of the Philip
Morris Cos., a senior vice president and his underling were
reviewing episodes of ``The Family Guy.'' The VP watched with
delight as the dysfunctional Griffin family paraded through its
politically incorrect antics that gave perfect voice to his own
private notions. At one point, the VP laughed so hard he tumbled
onto his back, snorting and gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilariously tasteless,'' grunted the VP. ``Satirically
brilliant!''
</P>
<P>
   When he came to his senses, he turned to his underling and
ordered: ``Withdraw our sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, sir . . .'' said the underling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot have our good name associated with this trash,'' the
VP declared.
</P>
<P>
   The giddy human sentiment, on display a moment earlier, was now
lost within the corporate man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not alone in this,'' the VP continued. ``Sponsors are
fleeing in droves from this radical junk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir. I have the list right here: Kentucky Fried Chicken,
McDonald's, Pepsi, Sprint, Chrysler, The Gap, Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me,'' the VP asked his underling, ``is it wrong for
Corporate America to use its muscle to silence original voices?
Voices that we, in our level-headed judgment, deem a threat to the
national good? After all, an offended viewer is a vengeful
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless America!'' the underling cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' the VP continued, ``our influence is undeniable. And
with clout comes responsibility. We understand the implications of
that new study from the Annenberg Public Policy Center _ the one
that says more kids recognize the Budweiser frogs and Joe Camel
than Vice President Al Gore. And that survey by the Colonial
Williamsburg Foundation, which found that 79 percent of adults
could identify the Nike slogan `Just do it,' but only 47 percent
knew that `life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' were rights
guaranteed by our founding fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The underling's eyes widened in astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which leads to the inescapable question,'' the VP concluded.
``Who rules America?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Us?'' the underling offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precisely,'' the VP said. ``Now prepare a statement for the
media. It will read: `The Family Guy' is not consistent with our
values as a company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, sir, but about our values _ do they include freedom
of speech?'' the underling wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you something,'' the VP said sternly. ``Do you like
your job?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' the underling mumbled with tightened lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now go find me another show that can proudly wear our name.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back, the underling said, ``I do know of a new sitcom
that mirrors the best of our values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a company that makes a product that kills many of
the people who use it. It's hilariously funny to watch how the
company denies the danger of its product. Gosh, sir, you just can't
believe this: Each episode plays out an incredible, new lie the
company comes up with. You have to see it to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it!'' the VP exclaimed, snorting with laughter.
``That's just the thing for us!''

GOOD TIMES AT FRANKLIN'S CABARET

   You've heard of Benjamin Franklin the statesman and diplomat.
And Franklin the author and philosopher. And Franklin the inventor.
But Benjamin Franklin the cabaret star?
</P>
<P>
   Why not? In America anything is possible.
</P>

   The year is 1789. The nation is new but Franklin is old, 83 to
be exact. The place is 1 Milk St., Boston, the site of his birth
and now the home of Ben Franklin's Colonial Cabaret, a joyous
evening of singing, snacking, and, especially, schmoozing with Dr.
Franklin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, portrayed accurately and lovingly by Emmy winner Bill
Meikle, is the central character in a two-act play, but the rest of
the cast is you, the audience. What Franklin says (and he always
speaks his mind) depends on what you do _ question, talk with,
laugh with, cajole, or argue with the good doctor. Thus, no two
performances are the same. Although his favorite subjects are death
and politics, topics the other night ranged from Franklin's pride
in being a printer to his misgivings about the Declaration of
Independence (``It was a declaration of war, not independence'') to
the woman who rejected his marriage proposal to why he feels the
turkey, not the eagle, should have been the nation's symbol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meikle has been ``Frankling,'' as he puts it, for almost two
decades. During that time, we've seen his show in its various
incarnations several times and always have been entertained and
often surprised by his comments. Here are a few from the other
night: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --``There's no accounting for Rhode Island.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --``Behind every successful son-in-law, there stands an
astonished father-in-law.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --``I prayed in church _ I was praying I'd stay awake!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --While he enjoyed his years in the French court (``I was adored
. . . they called me mon cher papa''), the people there ``stank to
the high heaven. If they bathed at all, it was in perfume.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cabaret/tavern aspect of the show is not yet where Meikle
and his producer and wife, Barbara Meikle, want it to be, because
they're still seeking a licensed caterer to serve historically
accurate ``comestibles and potables.'' But there are lanterns and
checkered tablecloths and, during intermission, George Washington's
Cake (a spice cake) and Benjamin Franklin's Torte (a chocolate
concoction with raspberries _ no wonder the man had gout) for $3
each and coffee, tea, and lemonade for $1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there is music. Some nights feature Whistling Jack Barton
(Kevin Skorupa) and Robert Stewart (Larry Young), intinerant
minstrels who perform as Poor Richard's Penny. On other nights,
Elizabeth Blanchard (Janet Ashton) sings traditional Scotch-Irish
songs and gets the audience to join in. Sometimes Franklin sings
along, too. And the other night he sang a solo: ``To Anacreon in
Heaven,'' a tune devoted to the god of wine, women, and song. You
may not recognize the words to this rowdy number but the melody
should sound familiar: This old drinking song evolved into ``The
Star Spangled Banner.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Through Sept. 4, the cabaret takes place Fridays and Saturdays
at 8 p.m. in the Great Room of the International Institute of
Boston, 1 Milk St. Tickets are $20. Call 781-648-0628 for
reservations, and ask also about colonial Boston walks and lunch
with Dr. Franklin or Abigail Adams.) &QL;

of its third annual ``Well Traveled Luggage'' contest. Tina Winkler
of McKenzie, Tenn., won in the luggage category for her tale of a
camelskin bag bought in Saudi Arabia and carried with her for
nearly 30 years, from India to Lebanon to the United States. The
suitcase, in fact, was such a faithful friend that she gave it a
name: Haboob. Meanwhile, Christie Leal of Lawton, Okla., won in the
briefcase category for her story of an attache case that was
purchased by her father at the Fort Walters Army base exchange in
Mineral Wells, Texas, and ended up traveling the world, carrying
the secrets of a nation, because he worked in the military with
classified documents. Both winners receive a host of prizes that
include stays at Embassy Suites hotels, natch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of luggage: We learn from the Savvy Traveler
newsletter than the Unclaimed Baggage Center of Scotsboro, Ala., is
now on line. By clicking on www.unclaimedbagge.com, you might be
able to get a good buy in someone's unclaimed cameras, designer
clothes, electronics, and goodness knows what else. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking some more of luggage: Some 99.5 percent of checked
airline luggage gets to the correct destination on time. Of the
200,000 pieces a month that don't, 8 of 10 are reunited with their
owners within 24 hours. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? 21 percent, which means that more than 1 in 5
humans lives in China. (With thanks to info(at)daytrips.com, via

STAYING IN STYLE IN EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASWAN, Egypt _ What's good enough for Agatha Christie or King
Farouk is good enough for me. So on a recent jaunt to Egypt, I put
up at the hotels where they stayed, palatial 19th-century piles.
They make an enticing alternative to the cruise down the Nile that
is most visitors' favorite way to explore Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed at three of them: the Old Cataract in Aswan; The Winter
Palace in Luxor; and the Mena House in Giza, just outside Cairo.
All fostered fantasies about turn-of-the-century Egypt, and on my
next visit to these cities that offer endless possibilities for
exploration of thousands of years of Egyptian history, I'd stay in
them all again.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Cataract, which celebrates its centennial this year, is
best-known as a setting for Agatha Christie's ``Death on the
Nile.'' This was my favorite of the three hotels, in part because
Aswan is a sleepier place than either Luxor or Giza. Not that it
lacks for attractions. Abu Simbel, the great rock temples that were
dismantled and relocated to allow the building of the Aswan Dam, is
a short plane ride away. The High Dam itself and the Philae Temple,
also rescued from drowning and moved to the island of Agilkia, are
closer; still nearer is Elephantine Island, so named because it was
a center for ivory trading in antiquity. The island lies in the
middle of the Nile, just across from the hotel. Instead of reaching
it via tourist ferry, I took a grimy public felucca _ a small
sailboat _ in the company of women clad head to toe in black. When
we reached the island, they automatically deferred to the men on
board, letting them disembark first. My blood pressure soared. It's
tough to be a feminist visiting Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the felucca-luxury scale is the one you take
from the hotel's own launch. Decked out in Arabian Nights style,
with one printed fabric over another and plump pillows to lean back
on, it is available for high tea cruises and moonlight sails.
</P>
<P>
   Diagonally across the street from the Old Cataract is the
year-old Nubia Museum, the most up-to-date in Egypt. A lavish stone
complex, it pays tribute to a people whose villages were
deliberately submerged, again to build the dam. The museum includes
both art and ethnographic exhibits, and all the wall texts and
labels are in both Arabic and English.
</P>
<P>
   As for the hotel itself, its exterior is a soft brick red,
trimmed in slate gray and white, and the building itself is low,
sprawling, and graceful. You're greeted by a male staff member
dressed in puffy pants and bright embroidered vest, looking like an
extra from ``Scheherazade,'' proffering a glass of fresh strawberry
juice. If your shoes have become dusty on the journey, there's a
free shoe-shine service, for which you sit on a throne-like affair
of dark wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Lining the hallways are
prints of the watercolors of David Roberts, an intrepid
19th-century visitor to Egypt, who recorded a Nile yet to be
disturbed by motorboats and half-buried temples yet to be
excavated.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Cataract's lobby is done up in Oriental style, with
scalloped arches striped in purply red and white, a plush red
banquette, and lighting fixtures with perforated metal shades that
cast lacy shadows and lend exotic glamour to a room that acts as
dark, cool sanctuary from the white heat outside. Aswan, Egypt's
southernmost city, is generally the warmest place in the country _
which makes the Old Cataract's spectacularly lovely pool all the
more welcome.
</P>
<P>
   A quartet of local musicians dressed in long embroidered
galabeias play native string and percussion instruments on the
terrace at tea time and in the restaurant for dinner. The
restaurant was inaugurated on Dec.10, 1902, the day the cornerstone
was laid for the first Aswan dam, an event attended by heads of
state from all over Europe. Designed as a Moorish hall, the room is
topped by a dome that soars 75 feet. It still enchants, as does the
cuisine, a French-Middle Eastern fusion. (The local bolty fish is
particularly recommended.)
</P>
<P>
   As for guest rooms, try for one with a balcony facing the Nile,
the perfect place for a room service breakfast. The rooms are all
different, and suites come with parquet floors, sitting rooms,
antiques, and lavish silver bibelots. As satisfying as the decor
is, the service is even better, delivered by a smiling staff eager
to make you happy. You'd have to be curmudgeonly indeed not to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Winter Palace, you sleep across the Nile from the Valley
of the Kings, where Egyptian rulers sleep forever. The classier
guests of yore would moor their yachts right across the street,
crossing the river at their leisure to visit the astonishing array
of tombs on the West Bank, each individually carved and/ or
painted, each a mini-museum. Should you remain on the hotel side of
the river, you could spend days exploring the great temples of
Luxor and Karnak, connected by an avenue lined with sphinxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Palace is a relic of colonial days, and looks it.
Spreading outward from the grand, horizontal, sand-colored facade
is a horseshoe-shaped staircase that is both welcoming and
forbidding. Inside the door is an airport-style metal detector,
reminder of tragic violence in Luxor's recent past. But pass
through the detector and you're in another world, where a cranberry
glass chandelier dips down from a ceiling with gilded beams, and a
wrought-iron balustrade lines a winding staircase. Ceramic camel
statues on that staircase remind you you're in Egypt. Under the
glass of a low coffee table in the lobby is a display of Egyptian
faience bead necklaces in turquoise and gold, an incentive to step
outside again and go shopping: Luxor is crammed with jewelry stores
of both souvenir and serious levels, and they're open until at
least 10 at night, long after the tombs and temples have closed.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's hallways are as wide as a good-sized drawing room is
long, an extravagant use of space. Along them, in addition to the
guest rooms, are a bridge room and billiard room, and a Victorian
lounge with European paintings of the mysterious East, scenes of
maidens reclining on cushions, being ogled by pashas.

THE TAYLOR WAY: THE COMMUNITY CAME FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It began with Charles H. Taylor, a Civil War veteran
who in 1873 agreed to help out ``for a few weeks'' as business
manager of a failing, year-old newspaper called The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 126 years, a Taylor was at the helm of the Globe,
as the family filled the publisher's office with men linked not
just by name but by devotion to fairness, accuracy, and profits,
and by an unwavering commitment to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The line ended Monday with the announcement that Richard H.
Gilman, senior vice president of operations at The New York Times,
would become publisher of the newspaper, effective immediately. He
replaced Benjamin B. Taylor, publisher since April 1997. The move
came nearly six years after The New York Times Co. purchased the
Globe from trusts controlled by the Taylor family and the
descendants of Eben D. Jordan, who co-founded the newspaper and the
Jordan Marsh department store.
</P>
<P>
   During the family's reign, five Taylors served as publisher,
helped by other family members in numerous capacities at the
newspaper. With the staffs they built, they guided the Globe
through more than 45,000 days of wars and assassinations; the
presidencies of 24 men; women's suffrage; the Great Depression;
famous crimes and civil rights movements; moon landings and
blizzards; sporting triumphs and, this being Boston, frustrating
failures.
</P>
<P>
   While other Boston papers folded or went through cycles of birth
and death, the Taylors used a combination of journalistic quality
and business acumen to build the Globe into New England's largest
newspaper and the winner of 15 Pulitzer Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a single word with which their scores of friends
would describe the Taylors, the word would be decency,'' said
Thomas Winship, the Globe's editor from 1965 to 1984. ``They care
intensely about their native city, especially its traditions of
philanthropy, politics, and sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Winship, whose father, Laurence L. Winship, was editor of the
Globe before him, recalled how the Taylors were unflagging in
support of the paper's coverage of the most vexing issues of the
day, from political corruption to civil rights to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then came the grimmest time of all for the Globe, when the
Boston school integration battle came to our front door,'' because
of the paper's support for busing, Winship said. ``Bullets were
fired into the building, a truck was overturned in Boston Harbor,
and there were reader boycotts galore. And there was never a word
of discouragement from the Taylors, never a word from the front
office to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taylor family, all of them, loved and encouraged action on
behalf of a more vital town _ and did they ever give all of us fun
who worked for them,'' Winship said.
</P>
<P>
   It was anything but fun in the early years, though, as Charles
Taylor worked 16-hour days to reverse the fortunes of a a newspaper
that was losing $60,000 a year and had 10 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had become a respected journalist after serving in
the Civil War, had a deceptively simple philosophy for his
newspaper: ``My aim has been to make the Globe a cheerful,
attractive and useful newspaper that would enter the homes as a
kindly, helpful friend of the family. . . . My ideal for the Globe
has always been that it should help men, women and children to get
some of the sunshine of life, to be better and happier because of
the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   One non-journalism legacy of Charles Taylor was Fenway Park. He
bought the team, then known as the Boston Pilgrims, in 1904, then
built Fenway in 1912. The family sold the team to concentrate on
covering the city's institutions instead of owning them.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Taylor's three sons, Charles H. Jr., William O., and
John I., all joined the newspaper, with William becoming publisher
upon his father's death. It was a job he held from 1921 to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   William O. Taylor oversaw a difficult period in the Globe's
history, keeping the paper afloat through the Great Depression and
despite intense competition from numerous other Boston newspapers.
On the news side, he is remembered for his choice of Laurence
Winship as managing editor, a move that set the stage for the
newspaper's future success.
</P>
<P>
   William O. Taylor's death in 1955 led to the appointment of his
son William Davis Taylor as publisher. Known as Davis, he brought a
first cousin, John I. Taylor, into the publisher's office, as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they guided the newspaper into one of the most vibrant
periods of the Globe's history. In 1966 _ with Thomas Winship as
editor _ the newspaper won its first Pulitzer Prize, for exposing
the poor qualifications of a candidate for a federal judgeship
nominated by the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Taylor took particular pride in the newspaper's _ and his
family's _ hard-won reputation for supporting fair treatment of
ethnic and racial minorities. ``I remember my grandfather telling
me when I was a kid, how back in the days when signs and classified
ads read `No Irish Need Apply,' the Globe was the only paper in
Boston to crusade against them and in favor of allowing Catholic
priests to enter the WASP-run hospitals,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   With Winship's prodding, the Taylor-led Globe of the late 1960s
and early 1970s was one of the first newspapers to editorialize for
the unilateral withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam, and in 1971 it
published portions of the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department's
classified history of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Taylor retired in 1977, and his son William O. Taylor II
(known as Bill) took over as publisher. During the next 20 years,
Bill Taylor was credited with greatly enhancing the Globe's
strength as a business while offering strong and steady support for
journalistic excellence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he engineered the Globe's $1.04 billion sale to The New
York Times Co. in advance of the impending dissolution of the
Taylor and Jordan family trusts. Then, in April 1997, he passed the
mantle to his second cousin, Benjamin B. Taylor, the son of John I.
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Taylor, who, like his great-grandfather, Charles H.
Taylor, came to the job with strong credentials as a newsman, was
credited Monday with putting a premium on quality and integrity at
the Globe, and for his support of excellence in all areas of the
newspaper. He will remain as chairman of the Globe Newspaper
Company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylor family legacy was memorably articulated by Louis
Lyons, author of ``Newspaper Story: One Hundred Years of The Boston
Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their family traits have been built into the newspaper.
Unconnected with the Establishment or with established churches,
they worked and learned and lived by their own standards, which
proved a sound foundation for an enduring institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, community and business leaders marked the passing of an
era and praised the family for its contributions on many fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taylors stand for integrity, competence, and journalism
that was honest and to the point,'' said Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
``They had class, and they built the paper of record. You might not
agree with the Globe all the time, but you always said it had
class. That was the Taylors.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino praised the two most recent Globe publishers for their
involvement in local causes. ``You saw them out in the community,
whether it was the United Way, or the Boys and Girls Club, or
advocating for the schools, the Globe was visible and the Taylors
were visible.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments were echoed by Charles K. Gifford, chief
executive of BankBoston: ``From the Boston Public Library
Foundation to Big Brothers, to Globe Santa, and free jazz concerts,
the Taylor family has been an important part of this community and
has served it extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is better for the Taylor family having been owners of
the newspaper,'' said advertising executive Jack Connors. ``Any
number of people have taken money out of the community, but there
is a much smaller number of people who have put a lot back in as
well, and the Taylors as a family are numbered on that very short
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Said former Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis: ``In the
'60s, '70s, and '80s, the Globe became an extraordinarily effective
newspaper. It was tough, it was crusading, and it didn't let up. .
. . The Taylors and Winships transformed the Globe into one of the
best newspapers in the country, a newspaper that had a huge
influence on this state and this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're embedded in Boston history,'' said Bill Fowler,
director of the Massachusetts Historical Society. ``They aren't one
of the founding families, but they're a family that has taken on an
enormous responsibility for the community, not just with the
newspaper but also by supporting a number of charities in the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations will never be families,'' Fowler said, ``and the
Taylors are a family whose legacy is integrity.''

SETH'S `AN EQUAL MUSIC' DOESN'T RING TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AN EQUAL MUSIC 
By Vikram Seth 
Broadway Books, $25, 381 pp. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vikram Seth is one of the world's best storytellers. A few years
ago, more than a million readers of ``A Suitable Boy'' put their
real lives on hold in order to surrender to Seth's characters as
they moved through the events that brought India into the modern
world without surrendering their individual values, idiosyncrasies,
and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Seth painted ``A Suitable Boy'' on a huge canvas; it has been
described as the longest novel in English since Samuel Richardson's
``Clarissa'' back in the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Seth was clearly under some pressure to write something more
practical this time. (One reader of ``A Suitable Boy'' tore her
paperback into four sections to make it portable.) What he has come
up with is a novel of merely 400 pages, ``An Equal Music.'' To his
task he has brought skill, attention to detail, and finesse of
feeling _ everything except the breath of life that animates every
page of ``A Suitable Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The milieu of the new novel is the world of classical music; in
an afterword Seth confesses, ``Music to me is dearer than speech.''
Music of various kinds plays a major role in ``A Suitable Boy,''
and Seth himself is an enthusiastic amateur Lieder singer who has
performed the major song-cycles of Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   Most novels about musicians are full of ridiculous errors of
sense and sensibility; there are a few honorable exceptions, like
Romain Rolland's ``Jean Christophe,'' Henry Handel Richardson's
``Maurice Guest,'' Rebecca West's ``The Fountain Overflows,'' or,
more recently, Nina Beberova's ``The Accompanist.'' Seth has gone
to a lot of trouble to keep his facts straight, and he doesn't make
mistakes. Some of the banter is mildly amusing _ a prissy music
critic points out a nearby composer: ``That's him over there. He's
just written a marvelous piece for baritone and vacuum cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the conversation, however, doesn't sound like the way
musicians talk; it doesn't even sound much like human speech. Seth
has always had an impeccable ear, even when compressing California
speech into the intricate stanzas of his novel in verse, ``The
Golden.'' Now he seems to be going tone-deaf. ``That lemony-jasmine
fragrance that's so dizzying comes from these little white blossoms
here,'' observes the heroine. ``You'd hardly think it, would you?''
``Oh, I thought it was you,'' responds her besotted lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Equal Music'' tells a love story _ basically a soap opera.
Michael Holme, second violinist of the Maggiore String Quartet,
pines for Julia McNicholl, a pianist he had loved during his
student days in Vienna and then abandoned during a crisis of
self-confidence and an orgy of self-pity. Now, years later, they
meet again and Michael is desperate to rekindle Julia's old
passion. But Julia is now married to a rich American we are
supposed to like, and they have a precocious cute-kid son who loves
the family dog. Julia has a dreadful secret, revealed early in the
novel: She's a great musician who is going deaf. She soldiers on,
performs Schubert's ``Trout'' Quintet with members of the Maggiore
in Vienna, then flees to Venice for a tumultuous, bittersweet
interlude of romance.
</P>
<P>
   This plot is on the level of Lloyd C. Douglas's ``Magnificent
Obsession,'' which reduced susceptible readers to sobs back in
1929, except that Seth's heroine is going deaf rather than blind;
the dilemma Julia faces is the one Celia Johnson quivered over in
the famous British movie weepie of the same era, ``Brief
Encounter.'' Will Julia choose love or duty?
</P>
<P>
   Seth is nothing if not industrious. He gives Michael a
working-class background, a patroness, a hobby (swimming in the
murky water's of London's Serpentine), a violin he loves as much as
Julia and that he may lose too.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the Maggiore Quartet have monochromatic
identities and contribute subsidiary complications _ Piers, the
first violinist, is gay; his sister, Helen, the violist, has taken
up with someone from the field of early music. ``He's part of an
outfit called something Antiqua,'' Piers observes, ``he plays a
baroque fiddle and wears sandals and sports a beard: you get the
idea.'' There's a pushy manager, a dying violin teacher, a violin
maker and repairer, an eccentric record company executive named
Ysobel to fill in the background. There is considerable information
about deafness, and longtime record collectors will cherish the
glimpse of the dusty shelves and helpful service of Harold Moore's
shop, off Oxford Street.
</P>
<P>
   Vienna and Venice fulfill their roles admirably, and so does
London. But the people and their dilemmas sound manufactured, not
real; they are constructions, pieces of a puzzle, and incapable of
surprising us, the way the characters of ``A Suitable Boy''
repeatedly do. Michael, the first-person narrator, is truly
insufferable in his humorless, snivelling self-absorbtion; he is
not a person any reader will want to spend 400 pages in the company
of, and the irresponsible Julia isn't much more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Michael, on the verge of collapse again, daring to enter
Schubert's mind. ``But it was the year I walked to Haydn's grave,
it was the year I died; and the earth took my syphillis-riddled
flesh, my typhoid-ravaged guts, my vainly loving heart many times
around the sun before my quintet for strings was heard by human
ears.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with ``An Equal Music'' is that Seth has applied
sensitivity and intellect to the material of popular fiction that
doesn't require them, the kind of fiction that intellect interferes
with. Seth has worked too hard to write the kind of predictable
bestseller that can be produced by instinct alone.

   New Brunswick has to be one of the hidden treasures of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   So close, yet so unknown by most Americans. For many, myself
included, it was the drive-through province on the way to Prince
Edward Island or Nova Scotia. And yet, its scenery and attractions
are the equal, and in some cases more dramatic, than those of the
other Atlantic provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now that New Brunswick has prepared a colorful and easy to
follow ``Fundy Coastal Scenic Drive Guide,'' travelers will
discover all that this province, a seven-hour drive from Boston,
has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route, visitors can witness the world's highest and
wildest tides, see reversing falls, explore sea caves, or see the
famed Hopewell Rocks, towering free-standing sea stacks that rise
off the ocean floor. Visitors can wander about them at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   The drives include opportunities to hike, visit Campobello,
where President Franklin D. Roosevelt summered, see whales, visit
beautiful gardens, take one-day adventures, explore covered
bridges, go birding, and more _ all at low cost, espcially now that
the American dollar buys almost 40 percent more just across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick is worth the drive. For more information, call

SOSA GOES TO BAT FOR WORLD `ALL-STARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You think the all-stars are all at Fenway Park
today?
</P>
<P>
   Only some of them, says Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. In his
eyes, there also are ``all-stars of the world,'' people such as Li
Jun Cai of China, Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, and the Hyseni family
from Kosovo, who found a new home in Milton but are still far
afield from Fenway's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Not one plays professional baseball, but the nonprofit
Interaction organization, capitalizing on the All-Star Game in
Boston and Sosa's fame, is presenting them and eight others as
hidden stars _ people who thrived in far corners of the world after
receiving US foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill today, enough private charity workers to fill
two baseball teams will distribute to members of Congress packs of
baseball cards with the pictures of these beneficiaries and their
life stories on the back. And yes, the packs come with bubblegum.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a centerfold of Sosa slugging a baseball.
Next to his picture is a quote from him: ``With the support of
Interaction's members and the resources of the United States,
millions of the world's poor improve their situation. Please take a
moment to read about some of these `All-Stars,' the MVPs of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the public relations equivalent of throwing a fat
pitch down the middle, but Interaction, a large coalition of
private aid groups, believes the cards get out the message that US
foreign aid can reap big benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A US House Appropriations subcommittee will take up the fiscal
2000 foreign aid bill Wednesday The Clinton administration has
requested $14.6 billion for foreign operations next year, but a
Senate bill whittled that down to $12.7 billion. US foreign
assistance has declined steadily over the last decade despite a
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ian M. Houston, Interaction's legislative director, dreamed up
the baseball card pitch on a plane ride from Washington to Salt
Lake City six months ago. Sosa, he believed, would be a natural
spokesman because ``he grew up in poverty in the Dominican
Republic, he himself is a great success story, and he helped others
after Hurricane Mitch last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa couldn't be reached for comment, but he isn't expected to
make a pitch for the unsung ``All-Stars'' during the Boston
festivities, Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be done by the Washington advocates, who will use the
cards to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign news too often is about disasters and conflict, Houston
said, adding, ``But there are success stories out there. These
images are not the typical ones that Americans see.''
</P>
<P>
   There's ``All-Star'' Li Jun Cai, 8, shown sitting happily among
100 ducklings. The boy's family received assistance from the Heifer
Project, based in Little Rock, Ark., which has helped thousands of
Chinese farmers raise low-cost livestock such as ducks, geese and
rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   There's Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, who learned from the Heifer
Project how to build ridges and drainage ditches across the steep
slope of his garden. Gaining profits from soil-conservation
techniques, Sareyo has been able to build a cement house for his
family.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Hyseni family, who resettled from Kosovo to Milton,
with the help of the International Institute of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also Ren Je of China, holding in his arms a rabbit
from his family's farm; relatives Sunita and Sunanya Gurung of
Nepal, who received a small loan to expand their farm; and Quratul
Ain Bakhteari of Pakistan, who with the help of US charities
doubled girls' enrollments in regional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this all-star push in a city that hasn't had a professional
baseball team since the Washington Senators last played in 1971
isn't expected to win immediate dividends, Houston acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they (members of Congress) get these things and they
just toss it,'' he said. ``They won't toss this . . . and they may
find a few positive stories.''

30 YEARS AGO, A STRANGE WHATEVER TERRORIZED LAKE WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was the summer of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Some remember it as the summer of the miracle Mets, Woodstock
and the astronauts' first landing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   But in Fort Worth, for many it will forever be the summer of the
Lake Worth Monster.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 30 years ago this week, he/she/it first reared its
not-so-pretty goatlike head and captured the imagination of
thousands. Monster sightings lasted a week, but the myth, lore and
legend continue to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it was a really big bobcat. Others said it was an ape
that had been horribly burned in a circus fire. Others said it was
the infamous ``mud man'' who prowled the area for years and
deserves his own story.
</P>
<P>
   It all happened on Greer Island, a part of the Fort Worth Nature
Center &AMP; Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Jim Marrs broke the story in the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram on July 10. It ran on Page 2 with the headline
``Fishy Man-Goat Terrifies Couples Parked at Lake Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   It made the front page the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police, Residents Observe, But Can't Identify Monster,'' the
headline read.
</P>
<P>
   There were more headlines throughout the week: ``Witnesses Watch
Monster Cavort,'' ```Loch Worth' Monster Reportedly Furry, Scaly''
and ``Ghosts Seen on Greer Island.''
</P>
<P>
   The monster was described as having a short humanoid body with a
long neck. It had the head of a goat or a dog and a horn in the
middle of its head. Some said it was a satyr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witnesses today said the thing threw an automobile tire and
wheel 500 feet,'' Marrs reported July 11.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``The Lake Worth Monster,'' author Sallie Ann Clarke
recalls a personal close encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not bobcat nor was it a sheep skin. It wasn't a person
dressed in a Halloween costume. It was really the terrorizing
monster. It stood on its hind feet and ran like a man. It had white
hair over most of its body and scales, too. It was a goat-fish-man.
I'm sure it stood about six feet and nine inches tall and was
undressed (It didn't have any clothes on). It looked like it
weighed 250 or 260 pounds,'' she wrote. ``It was the most pathetic
sound I have ever heard. It went Grrrrrr, Brrr, Yeeeepe,
Yuuuuuuuuuuu, and sounded almost as if it would cry any minute from
the great pain it was in.''
</P>
<P>
   One boy opined that it was from space.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke quoted the boy as saying that the monster ``said he was
chased down here from the moon by the astronauts, and as he fell
through space it became so hot until he caught fire; but it landed
in the lake and was saved. Now it is wandering around as puzzled
about us as we are about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as reasonable as any theory, although it was to be 10
more days before the astronauts would land on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke cited reports of sheep being horribly mangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their necks and heads crushed. Their chins were
laying in the middle of their backs. It looked like something had
just ripped them apart,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nature Center Director Wayne Clark said he's not aware of any
recent sightings, but questions about it do arise regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have little kids on occasion who say they heard about
the Lake Worth Monster or ask, `Is there a goat man out here?''' he
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when all that was going on. There were a number of
old parking lots, and the kids used to throw keg parties. They were
a pretty well-behaved group but they would party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then supposedly some creature showed up and started yelling
and threw tires like Frisbees. From what I heard, it was a total
panic with everybody running into each other and burning rubber to
get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Marrs said in a recent interview that stories floating around
the police department said some teen-age pranksters at Brewer High
School in White Settlement were behind the monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had found an old gorilla suit and wore a clear plastic
mask that gave the impression of glowing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marrs said it was rumored that the kids had promised to retire
their monster to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``So nothing official ever came of it, and that leaves the Lake
Worth Monster free to keep roaming through legend,'' Marrs said.
</P>
<P>
   Still there was no explanation for the mangled sheep or how a
tire could be tossed 500 feet like a Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Nature Center, Wayne Clark said there is no proof
that the monster doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have heard strange noises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Ann Clarke, at the close of her book, urges caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he still running loose? I can assure you if you want to see
it or hear about it, take a long quiet ride out around Lake Worth
some dark quiet night,'' she wrote. ``Don't go alone. It is too
scary out there.''

COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG SKITS CAST NEW LIGHT ON PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. _ Rain cascaded outside his quarters as a
young slave, with bloody gashes on his back, lay whimpering on a
straw bed. Through the misty glow of candlelight, onlookers
swallowed hard. Some turned to wipe away tears.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new Colonial Williamsburg, the popular
Revolutionary-era tourist attraction, far different from the one
that used to tell a cozy tale of America's courageous fight for
independence from the British.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enslaving Virginia,'' a program that opened in March, uncovers
the ugly story of human suffering beneath the glossy tale of heroic
patriots. The frank reenactment of slavery during the Colonial
period unveils the shameful dark side of Patrick Henry, George
Washington and other slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   In these realistic, first-person portrayals of slavery, where
costumed actors play slaves and slave owners, visitors _
particularly children _ often find themselves unexpectedly drawn
into the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a skit where a slave patrol violently breaks up a
group of slaves, one boy shrieked, ``Let him go!'' while other
tourists murmured, ``Oh my God.'' In past performances, some
visitors have attacked the actors portraying slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   Younger visitors, some outfitted in tri-cornered hats, keep a
close lookout for the slave patrol who circle the park in search of
runaway slaves. The youngsters break free from their parents to
warn the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter, Peter,'' cried 10-year-old J.D. Touchton, as he
scurried to one of the key slave characters in the unfolding skit.
``Be careful, be careful. The slave patrol is coming. They're
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enslaving Virginia program is the first time such in-depth
and personal narratives of slaves have been used in Colonial
Williamsburg's 79-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole program is full of contradictions,'' said Christy
Matthews, the director of interpretive planning. ``People
constantly have to reevaluate the role of slavery within a war that
was about freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The new focus has evoked strong emotions from both blacks and
whites visiting the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little, white old ladies have come up to me and apologized for
being white and for the things their ancestors have done to the
slaves,'' said Karen Sutton, an actress who portrays a slave.
``Black folks have said that a lot of this still hits home to them.
They cry, and sometimes I cry along with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, slavery was portrayed in small snippets at Carter's
Grove, a reconstructed plantation six miles east of the main
grounds. The park decided to develop a focus on race after a 1994
reenactment of a slave auction drew criticism as a degradation of
African-American history.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Williamsburg has actively recruited black actors to
portray the slaves, and they now comprise about 10 percent of the
nearly 600 actors.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Broken Spirit,'' a new play that opened last weekend, a
young slave, Kofi, is whipped for trying to run away. The audience
stood in the pouring rain on opening night Saturday listening to
the chilling sounds of a whip cracking on Kofi's back.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of plot twists, the play bares the realities of
masters who kept young female slaves as mistresses, and slaves who
turned against each other to win the favor of their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slaves made up a de facto family, but they were clearly not
homogenous,'' said Matthews, who wrote and directed the play that
sold out on its first night. ``I wanted to show the complexity in
the lives of slaves, the struggles they went through, and what they
did so their spirits would not be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   While many whites who watched the performance said they were
shocked by the brutality that slaves endured, many blacks said they
were familiar with such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are stories that have been passed down to me. I know it
well,'' said Opeline Davis, 72, a Williamsburg resident, who
brought her 14-year-old granddaughter to the play. ``Lots of white
people don't know these stories. The details aren't taught in
schools. You can't read it in a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Such realistic portrayals have resonated strongly within some
black visitors. According to park officials, some have walked away
from the more graphic scenes in the skits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's too real for people. Slavery's so hard to talk
about. And then to see it play out in front of you when you know
it's happened to your great-grandmother,'' Davis said, shaking her
head.
</P>
<P>
   In the sweltering heat last week, onlookers wiped tears from
beneath their sunglasses as Sarah Southall, a young slave, told how
her family was torn apart when her master sold her 4-year-old
daughter to another slave owner.
</P>
<P>
   The day is Nov. 17, 1775. The royal governor, Lord Dunmore, has
issued a proclamation that offers slaves the possibility of
freedom: Fight for the British crown and be released from slavery.
Behind Raleigh's Tavern, Southall, who is pregnant again, argues
with her husband, Peter, about running away to fight for British.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can think about is how my ancestors must have stood out
here in this heat picking cotton or tobacco on this same land 200
years ago,'' said Valetrius Garmon, 9, of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When the slave patrol harassed the actor portraying Peter
Southall by forcing him to remove his shoes and empty his bag,
Nahim Shakoor, 58, of Atlanta whispered, ``Compare this field to a
ghetto today. The same thing still goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   While many blacks, like Shakoor, draw present-day comparisons,
many whites are learning a new chapter of history. ``I never
realized how difficult the lives of slaves were,'' said Terry
Blevins, 41, from Hudsonville, Mich. ``I knew slaves must have
endured terrible hardships, but I never knew to what extent.''
</P>
<P>
   Park officials estimate that African-Americans comprise about 4
percent of the 1 million annual visitors. But at the several
performances last week, nearly half of the audience was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my children to honor slaves, the way Jewish people
honor the people of the Holocaust,'' said Mikalah Holt, 34, from
Atlanta, who brought her children, ages 9 and 5. ``We still see the
legacy that slavery left us. We still have white people names. My
children need to honor their past, so they can understand how
they've come to where they are, and so they can know how to go
about in the future.''

WOMAN FIREFIGHTER CLIMBS LADDER IN NYC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rochelle ``Rocky'' Jones never thought of becoming a
firefighter when she was growing up in Brooklyn. Her father was a
fireman, but it was a pointless dream to follow in his footsteps.
Women were not allowed in the Fire Department of New York City. Nor
were they as late as 1978, when Jones was 20 and, on a friend's
dare, took the entrance exam and passed.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, now a 17-year veteran on the force, has been promoted
to captain, the first female to achieve that rank in the city's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a proud day,'' she said at her promotion ceremony
recently. To her fellow firewomen, she proclaimed, ``It shows . . .
we are here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in large numbers, though.
</P>
<P>
   There are over 11,000 firefighters in New York City, of whom
only 36, 3/10 of 1 percent, are women.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, 2 percent of professional firefighters nationwide
are women: about 5,000 out of 250,000. The share reaches as high as
8 percent in San Francisco, 15 percent in Madison, Wis., and
one-third of the recruits coming into the department in Dade
County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   (Even Boston's fire department, very rigid by most standards,
has 12 women in a force of 1,585, or, in percentage terms, three
times as many as New York's.)
</P>
<P>
   A spattering of cities, most prominently New Orleans, still have
no female firefighters, noted Terese Floren, director of Women in
the Fire Service, a Madison-based organization that tallies these
statistics. But of those cities that have some, she said, ``None
has as low a percentage as New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt the burden from the moment she entered her first
engine house as one of the first 40 women ever to join the force,
in 1982. ``Oh, they did not want me,'' she said with a laugh,
sitting in a room at department headquarters, between sessions of
her captain's-training courses.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever physically harassed her, even during night duty,
when she slept in the same bunkroom as all the men. ``But,'' she
said, ``they cursed me, they called me names.''
</P>
<P>
   More painful still, she recalled, was ``the isolation _ just
trying to be accepted by the guys, having to prove yourself day in,
day out, for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   She hauled hoses and ran into burning buildings with the rest of
them, but she always felt as though she was being tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you were asked to do something,'' she said, ``there
were lots of people standing around to see if you could do it _ and
hoping you couldn't. If somebody asked you, `How many lengths of
hose will we need?,' everybody went silent to hear your answer and
hoped you got it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knew she had stepped onto this turf in a less than
friendly fashion, through the force of a federal court order. In
1978, the year she took the entrance exam after a group of her male
friends told her they were taking it and dared her to come along,
the Fire Department had just decided to let women try out. However,
it also revised the physical part of the exam to make it virtually
impossible for women to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put in things like a standing broad-jump and a one-arm
bent-elbow hang,'' Jones recalled, chuckling. ``You know, what does
this have to do with anything? It was all tests of upper-body
strength, which women have less of.''
</P>
<P>
   So, 41 women who passed the written exam filed a class-action
suit, claiming the new physical discriminated against them. A
federal judge agreed and, in consultation with a physical
therapist, ordered the adoption of a new test.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did not even tell her retired firefighter-father, Lester,
that she applied for the job until the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty surprised,'' he recalled, sitting in the home in
Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, where Jones grew up with her three
sisters, all of whom were given boys' nicknames: Rocky for
Rochelle, Danni for Danielle, Mike for Michelle, and, briefly, Gus
for Giselle.
</P>
<P>
   Her father retired, after 21 years, when Rochelle was 11. ``I
never discussed my job much,'' he said. ``It's nothing you talk
about with your family, all the danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But after she told him what she had done _ and after he looked
at the revised physical and satisfied himself that it was a fair
test of what a firefighter needed to do _ he encouraged her to
stick with it. Still, her father understood why so many firemen
resisted her appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a stranger coming into your home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Cannon, professor of history at St. Peter's College in
Jersey City and the author of scholarly books on the New York Fire
Department, elaborated on this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep-seated sense of cultural continuity,'' he said
of the department. ``It's a culture of male domesticity. For a
woman to come in there _ sure, lots of guys are going to feel that
as an intrusion, a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fire Department was professionalized just as the
big wave of Irish immigration hit the Northeastern shores. In
several cities, including Boston and New York, Irishmen filled the
new slots of firemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set the tone, the style of the trade for decades to
come,'' Cannon said. Even now, probably the majority of
firefighters in the city are Irish Catholics with conservative
views on cultural change.
</P>
<P>
   Floren called New York's fire department ``one of the more
traditional organizations in the country,'' adding, ``This goes not
just for women. It was one of the last departments to adopt
advances in protective gear. Not 20 years ago, they wouldn't wear
respirators _ it wasn't `manly' to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this feeds into a mystique about firefighters _ prevalent
in nearly every city but perhaps most of all in New York, which has
so many firefighters and, because of the age and height of its
buildings, so many fires.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, according to official figures, New York City
firefighters put out 381,537 fires, more than 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   When a firefighter dies, the daily tabloids give him a full-page
hero's spread, the funeral is immense, and every politician in town
comes to pay honor.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname for New York's police department, ``New York's
Finest,'' is often pronounced these days with a grain of irony, but
the Fire Department's moniker, ``New York's Bravest,'' is uttered
with universal sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I like to explain it,'' said Jones, ``is when we show
up, we make things better. That's all we do _ or that's all we're
seen doing. We're not like the police in that way. You know,'' she
added with a laugh, ``we don't stop kids and frisk them for
matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon elaborated: ``A firefighter's workspace is hidden from
the public. Nobody knows what goes on in a firehouse. It adds to
the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   It also explains, in part, how the profession could remain cut
off from the waves that shook the rest of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's life as a firefighter improved in 1984, when she was
transferred from an engine company in Brooklyn to a ladder company
in Staten Island, the most suburban of the city's boroughs _ more
laid-back, less intense, fewer fires. That year, she met the man
who became her husband, a rescue firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman joined her company in 1988, the first time she had
not been the only one in the house. She advanced to lieutenant in
1994, the first woman in the city to do so.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, she believes, she was treated no differently
than any other officer. ``People who never spoke to me in the old
days see me now and say, `Hey, Rock!'''
</P>
<P>
   She paused and laughed: ``I pretend like I don't remember.''

TOO MUCH ADO OVER GORE'S HIRING OF CONSULTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- Normally, the fact that just about everybody who
is anybody is outraged about something is reason to have some
contrarian suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   That's true especially where presidential politics is concerned.
And right now, it would seem that the mix of thugs, scoundrels,
sharpies, and junkies that self-defines itself as ``the political
community'' is appalled that Vice President Al Gore would put on
his campaign payroll one Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is not unimportant: the 44-year-old media
consultant's hard work last year on behalf of the tobacco
industry's successful campaign against sharply tighter regulation
and sharply higher taxes that helped persuade the Republican
Congress to do what it does best _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason doesn't justify the unquestioned attempt by too
many people with skeletons in their own closets to blacklist a
fellow professional for sins more venial than mortal. Upon
examination, the retention of Carter Eskew by longtime pal and
client Gore is the kind of move one would expect of someone serious
about running for president.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, it shows the kind of single-minded
determination that presidents need to have; it shows Gore in
charge, not simply sitting at the head of a table ringed by
competing egomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Gore has to take heat for giving comfort to those who
remember that before he became an emotional antitobacco political
leader, mining the memory of his sister's death from lung cancer,
he had just as vigorously defended the tobacco farmers of his
border state region.
</P>
<P>
   But since the vice president's commitment today is undeniable,
his willingness to take heat from his left is a sign of strength,
not desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I find much of what politics entails today
distasteful, and a lot of it borderline disgusting. Surveying the
Republican and Democratic landscapes, however, the fact that some
people work both sides of fences, that others raise dirty money,
and that still others use tactics more suited to gang wars than
democracy is part of a landscape on which Carter Eskew hardly
stands out.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that Eskew went to work for the
industry in order to sell the out-of-court-settlement, worth
potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, with state
attorneys-general to Congress. It was only after there were efforts
to stretch that deal beyond its breaking point that the industry
went all out, with Eskew's professional assistance, to torpedo
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   People like me were on the other side, but that doesn't mean
it's appropriate to question Gore's motives or his sincerity
because he retains someone he has worked with almost his entire
public life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the person to wonder about is Bob Squier, Eskew's
former mentor and business partner, who currently has Gore's media
job, but who has publicly questioned the vice president's move. Now
everybody in politics loves Squier, and for all the right reasons,
but the fact is, he has undercut his boss instead of supporting
him. Gore's toleration of that so far is much more questionable
than his hiring of Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   The flap is a perfect example of something that progressives
have long assumed to be the sole province of right-wingers _ the
brutal enforcement of purity standards in a manner that puts all
disagreements over issues, or professional backgrounds, into the
realm of orthodoxy v. apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   On the left, this silliness is even more pervasive. The classic
example stems from the time a generation ago, when the Democrats
ripped themselves apart over the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you were either for United States involvement or
against it, and just as obviously it was entirely appropriate to
cast a vote for or against someone in a primary on the basis of his
views on the war. But among Democrats, the fact that someone came
out against the war six months before someone else frequently
became the internecine weapon of choice, usually to the benefit of
those who really supported the war.
</P>
<P>
   And they're still at it _ condemning Representative John Dingell
of Michigan for his pro-gun activism even as they worship him for
his advocacy of health-care reform, or trying to keep right-to-life
Democrats like former Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey or even House
Minority Whip Dave Bonior from top party posts and visibility.
</P>
<P>
   There have to be limits _ racism comes to mind. But the idea
that Gore is suspect because he hired Eskew is a sign of what
happens when insider politics goes berserk. You can hear the less
virginal Republicans laughing.

SUMMER-LONG CELEBRATION TO FOCUS ON INDIAN-FIGHTING BUFFALO
SOLDIERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, just as the workweek came to an end and hundreds of
Abilene children and their parents went to the public library for a
weekend supply of reading material, they witnessed the unlikely
sight of Buffalo Soldiers sauntering across the concrete roadways
into town.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they weren't exactly sauntering and it wasn't an entire
regiment of the black riders or anything like that. It wasn't even
a good sized squad. But Ken Pollard cut a striking figure decked
out in his blue and gold uniform. He came armed not only with the
weaponry of the fierce Indian fighters he represented, but also
with the knowledge of how important the Buffalo Soldiers were to
Texas and the rest of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how the Buffalo Soldiers were overlooked in much of
history, and as a supervisor for the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department's community service program, he has taken it upon
himself to right that serious wrong.
</P>
<P>
   With a little help from the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   July has been designated as Texas Buffalo Soldier Heritage
Month. It is part of a summer-long celebration of educational
programs and events. The Heritage Trail, as the total program is
being called, is designed to promote the history of the Buffalo
Soldiers, vaqueros, African-American cowboys, American Indians and
frontier women of Texas during the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department says this is the first
time in history that the Texas Legislature has passed legislation
for a cultural group. An African-American support group called The
Soldiers in Blue Committee initiated the resolution that proclaims
July as Texas Buffalo Soldiers Month and July 28 as Capitol Salute
Day, when youth from across Texas will travel to Austin to recount
the Buffalo Soldier history. Texas is the only state to honor the
Buffalo Soldier with a monthlong celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo Soldiers we hear most about were in the 9th and 10th
U.S. Cavalry, established in the summer of 1866. Originally, there
also were six infantry regiments, but they were later consolidated
into two units _ the 24th and 25th U.S. Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   They were, by what accounts we've been able to see, a fiercely
independent and dedicated group of soldiers. They got some of the
toughest, most isolated duties in campaigns against the Comanche,
Apache, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Sioux and Arapaho. It was the Plains
Indians who gave them the name Buffalo Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   They fought in the Spanish-American War, World War II and in the
beginning stages of Korea. The last unit was deactivated in 1951.
They always fought a battlefield enemy, and the enemy of prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   The New Handbook of Texas says popular interest in the Buffalo
Soldiers began to grow during the 1960s with John Ford's film
``Sergeant Rutledge,'' but if there was a surge in interest, it
soon dried up. A greater influence was the work of Fort Worth
artist Burl Washington, whose detailed watercolors show a strong,
lasting western character.
</P>
<P>
   Books such as Elmer Kelton's ``The Wolf and the Buffalo'' also
deepened interest in the Buffalo Soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   With the efforts of people like Pollard, that interest is not
likely to go away. By the time he left Abilene, a street had been
named for the Buffalo Soldiers, and hundreds of kids were
scrambling for books and literature on the American heroes.

TOO MUCH ADO OVER GORE'S HIRING OF CONSULTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- Normally, the fact that just about everybody who
is anybody is outraged about something is reason to have some
contrarian suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   That's true especially where presidential politics is concerned.
And right now, it would seem that the mix of thugs, scoundrels,
sharpies, and junkies that self-defines itself as ``the political
community'' is appalled that Vice President Al Gore would put on
his campaign payroll one Carter Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is not unimportant: the 44-year-old media
consultant's hard work last year on behalf of the tobacco
industry's successful campaign against sharply tighter regulation
and sharply higher taxes that helped persuade the Republican
Congress to do what it does best _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason doesn't justify the unquestioned attempt by too
many people with skeletons in their own closets to blacklist a
fellow professional for sins more venial than mortal. Upon
examination, the retention of Carter Eskew by longtime pal and
client Gore is the kind of move one would expect of someone serious
about running for president.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, it shows the kind of single-minded
determination that presidents need to have; it shows Gore in
charge, not simply sitting at the head of a table ringed by
competing egomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Gore has to take heat for giving comfort to those who
remember that before he became an emotional antitobacco political
leader, mining the memory of his sister's death from lung cancer,
he had just as vigorously defended the tobacco farmers of his
border state region.
</P>
<P>
   But since the vice president's commitment today is undeniable,
his willingness to take heat from his left is a sign of strength,
not desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people, I find much of what politics entails today
distasteful, and a lot of it borderline disgusting. Surveying the
Republican and Democratic landscapes, however, the fact that some
people work both sides of fences, that others raise dirty money,
and that still others use tactics more suited to gang wars than
democracy is part of a landscape on which Carter Eskew hardly
stands out.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that Eskew went to work for the
industry in order to sell the out-of-court-settlement, worth
potentially hundreds of billions of dollars, with state
attorneys-general to Congress. It was only after there were efforts
to stretch that deal beyond its breaking point that the industry
went all out, with Eskew's professional assistance, to torpedo
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   People like me were on the other side, but that doesn't mean
it's appropriate to question Gore's motives or his sincerity
because he retains someone he has worked with almost his entire
public life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the person to wonder about is Bob Squier, Eskew's
former mentor and business partner, who currently has Gore's media
job, but who has publicly questioned the vice president's move. Now
everybody in politics loves Squier, and for all the right reasons,
but the fact is, he has undercut his boss instead of supporting
him. Gore's toleration of that so far is much more questionable
than his hiring of Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   The flap is a perfect example of something that progressives
have long assumed to be the sole province of right-wingers _ the
brutal enforcement of purity standards in a manner that puts all
disagreements over issues, or professional backgrounds, into the
realm of orthodoxy v. apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   On the left, this silliness is even more pervasive. The classic
example stems from the time a generation ago, when the Democrats
ripped themselves apart over the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you were either for United States involvement or
against it, and just as obviously it was entirely appropriate to
cast a vote for or against someone in a primary on the basis of his
views on the war. But among Democrats, the fact that someone came
out against the war six months before someone else frequently
became the internecine weapon of choice, usually to the benefit of
those who really supported the war.
</P>
<P>
   And they're still at it _ condemning Representative John Dingell
of Michigan for his pro-gun activism even as they worship him for
his advocacy of health-care reform, or trying to keep right-to-life
Democrats like former Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey or even House
Minority Whip Dave Bonior from top party posts and visibility.
</P>
<P>
   There have to be limits _ racism comes to mind. But the idea
that Gore is suspect because he hired Eskew is a sign of what
happens when insider politics goes berserk. You can hear the less
virginal Republicans laughing.
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It seems like everyone carrying a microphone or a
camera in town this week wants a piece of Leslie Sullivan's time.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president of broadcasting and new media development for
Major League Baseball, Sullivan presides over the telecasts of the
All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby and other related events. And,
among other things, ESPN and Fox ask her where they can set up
their cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Francis is not having much down time, either. As vice
president of marketing for Major League Baseball, she is in charge
of more than a half-dozen events related to the All-Star Game _ all
of which are intended to help baseball address the crucial issue of
competing successfully for America's leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   And as vice president of special events for Major League
Baseball, Marla Miller is absolutely up to her eyeballs in work.
Miller is in charge of the whole affair, making sure that this
annual, gala festival, so crucial to burnishing the brand of Major
League Baseball, delivers all that the hoopla portends.
</P>
<P>
   On the field and in the dugouts at Fenway Park it will be all
men in uniform, the stars of the game. But anyone spending any time
behind the scenes around Boston this week knows that the All-Star
Game clearly is not just another ``guy thing.'' Women are playing
key roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, as sports have become more professional and
more corporate _ and less reliant on just the old boys' networks _
they reflect more and more the increasing diversity of the
corporate world,'' said Mary Jo Kane, director of the Tucker Center
for Research on Girls and Women Sports, at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old boys' network has not entirely disappeared, certainly.
But what you are seeing at the All-Star Game is how many women are
very much in place, and in some positions of real power, in the
business of major sports in this country,'' Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the front office of Major League Baseball.
The list of women playing key roles this All-Star Game week seems
as long as one of Mark McGwire's home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Both executives in charge of public relations for the two
leagues are women: Katy Feeney for the National League and Phyllis
Merhige in the American League. In addition to helping mete out
punishment for on-field disciplinary problems during the rest of
the year, Feeney and Merhige played key roles in helping All-Star
team managers gather information on which players to select.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Collet, a marketing communications consultant for the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., has played a major role in the
coordination of the FanFest, which 80,000 people are likely to
visit by closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Stein is under contract with Major League Baseball as
one of the key producers of FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   Colette A.M. Phillips, president and chief executive of Colette
Phillips Communication, is the official public relations firm for
the Boston Red Sox and FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback we're getting is that the event has gotten a lot
of exposure,'' said Phillips, who started her company 13 years ago.
``We've got a good track record, but this will really expand our
sports marketing and event operations.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the women have different stories about how they arrived
at high-profile positions in the traditionally testosterone-laden
world of sports. Some have worked in the sports business for 25
years, starting when there truly were no other women around. Others
are more recent arrivals, grateful to the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in general feel that when they are interested in
something they can pursue it, whether that's sports or not,''
Miller said last week, while juggling in-coming phone calls.
``There's a lot more women around than I saw when I started out 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller pursued a career in sports management, about 15 years
ago, after her journalism degree at New York University led to a
job at a magazine group that did not live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, Mehrige's one-time boss, Lee MacPhail, the
former American League president, realized her value as a secretary
and kept giving her more responsibilities and, eventually, jobs and
titles commensurate with her contribution. She worked with Bob
Fishel, a premier public relations official with the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Bob was so well thought of, because he had such an
enormous reputation in the game, there was a sense that if Bob
liked me, I must be okay,'' Mehrige said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan began her career at CBS Sports in New York with the
executive producer Eddie Einhorn. When Einhorn and Jerry Reinsdorf
bought the Chicago White Sox in 1981, Sullivan moved to Chicago as
manager of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   She helped start up SportsVision, one of the early, regional
sports networks, that eventually became Sports Channel, Chicago.
From there, it was a short jump to running broadcast and new media
at Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When Francis realized she was a shot or two short of being a
tennis professional, and that being a human resources administrator
for an insurance company was not her love, she said she returned to
school for a master's degree in marketing with a dream of working
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told by some of my counselors that, `You probably want
to take that job with that consumer packaged goods company because
women don't really work in sports and if you do it will probably be
some low-level coordinator or secretary,' '' Francis said.
``Luckily, I didn't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women of baseball and observers agree that the glass
ceiling for women in sports is at the operations level, where few
women are involved in personnel decisions affecting the athletes or
the performances of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   There are but a few women scouts in Major League Baseball, and
only Marge Schott, of the Cincinnati Reds, and Wendy Selig-Prieb,
of the Milwaukee Brewers, own teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the arguments I keep hearing is that, `Well, women
didn't play the sport,' '' said Lisa Masteralexis, head of the
sports management program at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I can tell you there are a lot of men running the
operations who didn't play the sport either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the lessons of the Women's World Cup Soccer
phenomenon is is that women can play the games,'' Kane said, ``and
they can bring that knowledge to the operations side of things.''
Kane said.

SOSA GOES TO BAT FOR WORLD `ALL-STARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You think the all-stars are all at Fenway Park
today?
</P>
<P>
   Only some of them, says Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. In his
eyes, there also are ``all-stars of the world,'' people such as Li
Jun Cai of China, Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, and the Hyseni family
from Kosovo, who found a new home in Milton but are still far
afield from Fenway's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Not one plays professional baseball, but the nonprofit
Interaction organization, capitalizing on the All-Star Game in
Boston and Sosa's fame, is presenting them and eight others as
hidden stars _ people who thrived in far corners of the world after
receiving US foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill today, enough private charity workers to fill
two baseball teams will distribute to members of Congress packs of
baseball cards with the pictures of these beneficiaries and their
life stories on the back. And yes, the packs come with bubblegum.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a centerfold of Sosa slugging a baseball.
Next to his picture is a quote from him: ``With the support of
Interaction's members and the resources of the United States,
millions of the world's poor improve their situation. Please take a
moment to read about some of these `All-Stars,' the MVPs of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the public relations equivalent of throwing a fat
pitch down the middle, but Interaction, a large coalition of
private aid groups, believes the cards get out the message that US
foreign aid can reap big benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A US House Appropriations subcommittee will take up the fiscal
2000 foreign aid bill Wednesday The Clinton administration has
requested $14.6 billion for foreign operations next year, but a
Senate bill whittled that down to $12.7 billion. US foreign
assistance has declined steadily over the last decade despite a
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ian M. Houston, Interaction's legislative director, dreamed up
the baseball card pitch on a plane ride from Washington to Salt
Lake City six months ago. Sosa, he believed, would be a natural
spokesman because ``he grew up in poverty in the Dominican
Republic, he himself is a great success story, and he helped others
after Hurricane Mitch last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa couldn't be reached for comment, but he isn't expected to
make a pitch for the unsung ``All-Stars'' during the Boston
festivities, Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be done by the Washington advocates, who will use the
cards to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign news too often is about disasters and conflict, Houston
said, adding, ``But there are success stories out there. These
images are not the typical ones that Americans see.''
</P>
<P>
   There's ``All-Star'' Li Jun Cai, 8, shown sitting happily among
100 ducklings. The boy's family received assistance from the Heifer
Project, based in Little Rock, Ark., which has helped thousands of
Chinese farmers raise low-cost livestock such as ducks, geese and
rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   There's Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, who learned from the Heifer
Project how to build ridges and drainage ditches across the steep
slope of his garden. Gaining profits from soil-conservation
techniques, Sareyo has been able to build a cement house for his
family.

ONCE A TOUGH-TALKING COMIC, SHE NOW USES HER STAR POWER TO CRUSADE
FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A kid walks onto a talk-show set.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Jarrett Mynear clambers into the chair next to host
Rosie O'Donnell, who asks him to tell the audience what he does.
</P>
<P>
   He has a business. He delivers toys to patients at his local
children's hospital in Kentucky. Every other Tuesday. Three carts'
worth.
</P>
<P>
   He first saw the idea in a Seattle hospital, he says, when he
was getting treatment for one of the four cancers that he's had.
``That had always helped me to look forward to something, and I
wasn't quite as scared,'' Jarrett says, ``and I thought maybe it
would help some of the other kids who are really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett says the donated toys are stacked up in his family room.
His aunts are working on getting some storage bins for the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody can, we need somebody to donate a warehouse,'' he
says, raising both arms in the air and smiling, making the audience
giggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, guess what, Jarrett,'' Rosie says. ``I got news for you.
We're gonna get you the warehouse _ and Toys R Us is going to stock
it with as many toys as you need!''
</P>
<P>
   It's just another day in Studio 8G at Rockefeller Center, where
dreams come true and kids, increasingly, come first. As the
syndicated ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' began its third season last
fall, promoters noted that the focus would expand beyond celebrity
adoration. Viewers could expect ``inspirational tales,'' kids
speaking out on topics, and parenting advice.
</P>
<P>
   The new family focus mirrored a shift in Rosie's priorities. In
1995, the former smart-mouthed, too-tough, stand-up comedian
adopted a little boy named Parker and suddenly began showing the
world her softer side.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what almost everyone in the world knows about Rosie
O'Donnell: Her show won the 1999 daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk
Show, and she won the award for Outstanding Host. She makes, at
last report, $4 million a season. She's been in the movies,
including ``Harriet the Spy,'' ``A League of Their Own'' and ``The
Flintstones.'' She founded a Chub Club for people who want to lose
weight, but she's the self-professed ``biggest failure.'' Her mom
died when she was 10, and she was 14 or 15 before she heard an
adult tell her that he or she loved her. She's not a very good
singer.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to Rosie than that. As Rosie's rising
professional star has shot out of sight in the past few years,
she's become an expert at using her celebrity power for good _ and
her efforts are almost always directed at children.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 not-so-well-known reasons to love Rosie.
</P>
<P>
   1. In Rosie's world, being your own flawed self is a good thing.
Take what she has to say about her role as Terk in Disney's
``Tarzan'': ``When they told me I was going to be a gorilla, I
spent three weeks living in the zoo. No, I didn't do anything.
Because I feel I have innate gorilla tendencies. When they showed
me the drawings, it looked like me. Honestly. It's got a pot belly,
it's got a little double chin, it's got big hair. And you know,
it's round. I thought, `OK, I'll just be myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   2. Rosie doesn't leave the house without a Sharpie. Paula
Kaplan, vice president of talent for the Nickelodeon network who
has worked with Rosie for years, says the Sharpie is a priority
because kids come right up to Rosie wherever she is, and they want
her autograph. She doesn't want to let them down.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rosie is a children's crusader. In February 1997, Rosie
founded the For All Kids Foundation, which serves as a
clearinghouse, granting awards to nonprofit organizations dedicated
to helping children through child care, education, health care and
other special programs. In the first fiscal year, the foundation
gave more than $1.5 million to charities. Seed money came largely
through Rosie's personal efforts: Proceeds from her ``Kids Are
Punny'' book brought in more than $1.7 million. Last December in
New York, her first benefit for the foundation raised $3.2 million.
This spring, Rosie also launched some auctions on eBay, selling,
among other items, ``Star Wars'' collectibles signed by George
Lucas. The site raised $686,439 to benefit For All Kids.
</P>
<P>
   4. She has a $20,000 playroom for her children next to her
office. But when she talks about life with her kids _ Parker, now
4, and Chelsea Belle, almost 2 _ she sounds like Everymom. The
other day, she was telling Parker that she was tired of him not
answering back when she talks to him. ``You know what, Mom,'' he
said. ``You're insane.'' In this month's ``Marie Claire'' magazine,
Rosie says that one time recently, Parker walked in while she was
taking a shower, and she said, ``Am I ever going to get any
privacy?'' To which he replied, ``Apparently not.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Her agent won't cough up a complete list of Rosie's
fund-raising efforts _ which are tremendous _ because ``Rosie's not
like that.'' Among other accomplishments, this year Rosie has:
sponsored a Chub Club 5K run in Central Park with proceeds going to
the Aubrey Fund for pediatric cancer research; co-hosted
Nickelodeon's Big Help-a-thon; agreed to host a fund-raiser gala
for Carnival Cruise Line with proceeds going to a children's
charity; teamed with Martha Stewart to decorate a Habitat for
Humanity home; autographed innumerable items, including her Rosie
O'Donnell doll, for charity auctions; and given away literally
warehouses full of food and toys and other goods on her show _ ``A
lot of times the money comes from (Rosie's) own pocket,'' says
Rosie's spokeswoman, Jennifer Glaisek. Rosie is popular as a host
for benefits, says Glaisek, who has been with her at auctions,
because ``she is able to force people into giving money.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Rosie is not afraid of Slime or Gak. Rosie has been slimed at
least twice. First time: Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 1997,
in her first year as solo host. Most recently: April 28 on a Rosie
show devoted to the Nickelodeon awards. She also introduced Bill
Cosby to Gak on that show. It was about time.
</P>
<P>
   7. She's not afraid of what people might say about her. On a
Nickelodeon special about teens and body images, ``The Body Trap''
(1996), Rosie said that whenever anyone says anything that hurts
her feelings, she thinks of what Glinda, the good witch, said in
``The Wizard of Oz:'' ``You have no power here. Off before someone
drops a house on you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   8. Like all seasoned moms, she can quickly become a mother bear.
When 17-year-old Britney Spears came on Rosie's show to promote her
new CD, ``Baby One More Time,'' Rosie gave the singer less than 15
seconds before letting her have it for wearing an inappropriately
revealing shirt for her performance at the Kids' Choice Awards a
couple of weeks before. ``I don't want to see you in that shirt
again unless you're wearing a vest,'' Rosie said. ``I'm so glad
you're bringing this up!'' Spears said. ``I was humiliated!'' She
mumbles something about how it was colder than she expected.
``Yeah,'' Rosie said. ``It was cold. Things happen. The point is,
promise me next time you wear the white shirt, you put a cute
little vest over it ... I'll ground you. Don't make me ground you,
because you're a sweetheart of a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Rosie insists she's not a hero or a role model for single
mothers. ``I'm very, very rich,'' is what Rosie says, according to
Glaisek. ``The real heroes are the mothers that got themselves off
welfare.'' Rosie's hero? Marian Wright Edelman, founder and
president of the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   10. Despite what she says, Rosie is a role model for mothers and
kids _ one of the precious few on whom parents and children can
agree.

WILL THIS BE THE LAST LILITH FAIR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since her 1988 debut, Sarah McLachlan's
atmospheric folk-pop has gained a devoted following, although she's
better known for a little touring concept she had four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That idea _ Lilith Fair _ started as an all-female package tour
focusing on emerging women singer-songwriters. The caravan trek,
currently in its third year, surprised observers by becoming one of
the most lucrative events of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's daylong concert Saturday at the Rose Bowl features a
wide range of acts, from McLachlan and Sheryl Crow to the Dixie
Chicks and Beth Orton.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1998 Lilith trek was the 12th largest tour of the
year, grossing an average of $600,000 per city, McLachlan says this
will be Lilith's final turn _ for now. Last year it sold out at the
98,600-seat Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't look like someone else will come along and take
her place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that someone will emerge next year and mount
an all-female tour with such a large number of acts,'' said Gary
Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a weekly magazine that covers the
concert industry. ``Lilith is successful because it's an
artist-driven tour. Maybe if someone like Jewel or Sheryl Crow goes
out with a caravan of like-minded artists _ something I think is
unlikely _ it could work on a smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``But shows like Lilith are very difficult to put together
because artists have all kinds of issues about placement on the
bill, money, comfort and other things. Lilith is a success because
the artists put a lot of that aside to work with Sarah.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow and other artists have said they particularly enjoy Lilith
because of the good deeds the tour does on a nightly basis _ it's
known to give many thousands of dollars to battered women's
shelters across the country _ the artist-friendly atmosphere and
the high quality of the production.
</P>
<P>
   But McLachlan, 31, says she wants to concentrate on her family
and take a break from producing the festival, a task that begins
six months before opening day. She recently released a live album,
``Mirrorball.'' Her 1997 album, ``Surfacing,'' has remained in
Billboard's Top 200. We spoke to McLachlan a few days before the
34-city, 40-date tour kicked off July 8 in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the risk of sounding like a Saturday afternoon serial _
does this spell the end of Lilith Fair?
</P>
<P>
   A: We said we wouldn't close the door (on reopening the tour in
the future). Lilith is a partnership between two managers, a
booking agent and myself. It's a team effort. It's not so much the
actual touring that's the problem. It's the six months previous.
Lilith doesn't just happen. It starts in January.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the best part of Lilith for you personally?
</P>
<P>
   A: Being able to play and sing with some of my favorite
musicians. For example, Emmylou Harris, Queen Latifah, Bonnie
Raitt, Erykah Badu. To get to know a lot of these women and hear
their stories is so amazing. And to give money away to women's
shelters everyday is an awesome job I get. Sometimes, we give away
upward of $25,000. I get to see their faces when I hand them the
check.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Lilith has played a big part in not only giving exposure to
many artists but in helping album alternative radio thrive. Which
came first _ Lilith or that format?
</P>
<P>
   A: Album alternative started before Lilith, but it's always hard
to say what made what happen. We certainly pushed the envelope. A
lot of female artists were already doing well in '97, and that was
the main reason we were able to do so well when Lilith started.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've spent a good dozen years on the road. What will you do
next year?
</P>
<P>
   A: I want to take a break from touring in general. I love
touring, but my managers and agent want a break, too. They want to
have kids and realized unless we stopped now, they wouldn't be
slowing down anytime in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything you're especially excited about in this year's
lineup?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, there's so much. The Pretenders, Hole, Dixie Chicks. We
ask Hole every year, and this is the first year they've agreed to
do it. (Hole pulled out from the tour at the end of last week,
citing Courtney Love's upcoming film commitments.) And Sheryl Crow
_ she's a friend, and I get to spend the whole summer with her.
It's like musical summer camp, and I get to be reunited with my
girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Lilith hits Los Angeles on Saturday, the show comes to
the Rose Bowl for the second year running. Do you think such a
massive stadium is the right venue?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, we're playing a lot of outdoor amphitheaters on this
tour, too. But there's nothing like that close to L.A. We make it
as fun as possible. I mean, sure, it's a stadium, but once the sun
goes down and the lights go up, hey!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the process in making your new live album,
``Mirrorball''?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, it's a live album, and we wanted people to know
that, but we didn't want 10 minutes of clapping after each song _
because then it's just, ``Hey, look how many people love me.'' So
my husband (drummer-percussionist Ashwin Sood) and I sorted through
the live tapes and picked three or four of the best versions of
each song. And we picked the ones that worked best. We had 35 shows
with 24 songs each night to deal with. That's a lot to go
through. &UR;  &QL;

   SUMMER-MELONS (Undated) _ Melons are the aristocrats of summer
fruit, their cool elegance and exotic lushness perfuming dishes
with the essence of a flower garden on a perfect afternoon. The
charming palette of summer colors spans the spectrum from the
creamy white flesh of the honeydew to the brassy firecracker red of
the watermelon. In sorbets and chilled soups, in cocktails and
salads, or simply eaten out of hand, melons are wonderful
restoratives for this long hot summer; with recipes. By Marian

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ More than a few American winemakers are
obsessed with the riesling grape. With good reason: it is arguably
the finest white grape variety in the world. In this country, which

attractive, friendly, uncomplicated and easy to like. These are
good qualities in an Airedale, not necessarily in white wine. By

<P>
   WINE-CHEESE (Undated) _ The rule of red wine with cheese is as

MEXICO'S OPPOSITION PARTIES NEED TO COOPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIAS CASTILLO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ Mexico more than ever, needs to boot out
the corrupt and authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, the massive political machine that has simultaneously ruled
over that country for 70 years and been the main cause of its
massive poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent gubernatorial elections in the states of Mexico
and Nayarit clearly show that the task of ousting the PRI will be a
Herculean one.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Mexico, which skirts the massive megalopolis of
Mexico City, the PRI edged out the two opposition parties, the
National Action Party (PAN) and the Party of Democratic Revolution
(PRD). However, in Nayarit, a small state, the opposition parties
swallowed hard, joined each other to support a single candidate and
forced out the PRI _ which had governed the state since the ruling
party was formed 70 years ago. The message was clear: Either the
opposition parties combine their efforts behind a single candidate
in next year's critical presidential elections or they remain
apart, split the opposition vote and lose the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is doubtful that either of the leading opposition
party candidates, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD mayor of Mexico
City, or Vicente Fox, the PAN governor of Guanajuato, would bow out
to allow the other to win the presidency. Preventing that are the
major political differences between them: Fox is an avowed
free-market advocate, while Cardenas leans toward a socialist
state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both candidates know that during the PRI's long regime, the
ruling party has miserably failed to allow Mexico to develop
economically.
</P>
<P>
   The string of Mexican presidents since the 1930s stifled free
enterprise by declaring Mexico a closed-market economy. That
allowed a handful of Mexican industrialists to enrich themselves
fabulously. It gave them a captive market in which Mexicans were
forced into buying shoddily produced merchandise. Deals were forged
between the government and the industrialists to keep workers wages
tragically low _ $3 to $5 a day. Health services and the nation's
schools and universities were given scant resources.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexico's drug cartels amassed billions of dollars in
drug money, establishing themselves as a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's middle class and some of its poor now realize they were
literally duped into poverty by the PRI. These groups could pool
their votes to oust the PRI from the presidency in the fall of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   However, with neither Cardenas nor Fox likely to abdicate, it
seems unlikely that the PRD or PAN will win that critical election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both parties should concentrate on winning control of
the Mexican Congress by combining candidates, where possible, just
as they did in Nayarit. Five years ago, opposition parties gained
control of the lower house of Mexico's Congress. Since then, the
opposition has weakened the PRI leadership by exposing its
involvement in bribes and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The majority PRD and PAN representatives in the lower house also
have attempted to force passage of major reform legislation, but
their efforts have been blocked by the Senate, which is controlled
by the PRI. By winning control of both houses, the PRD and PAN
could bulldoze the PRI aside and pass the measures badly needed to
bring Mexico back to its feet economically, socially and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that the PRI could be so weakened by
election time in July 2000 that either Fox or Cardenas could pull
an upset and win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But a takeover of Congress could also erode the PRI's power
gradually. That's a safer alternative than ousting it suddenly from
the presidency _ which could evoke a violent and deadly reaction
from fanatical PRI members in the lower echelons of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting chaos could make a shambles of Mexico's
government, threatening an already strained economy and society
that is just beginning to recover from the crippling 1995 peso
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   So, an alliance between the PAN and the PRD to win full control
of Mexico's Congress may be the surest winner in next year's
elections and the surest way toward the achieving the full
democratization process that can begin lifting the country out of
the quagmire created by the PRI.

TOUCHED BY ANGELS OR STUNG BY THE DEVIL? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nellie Murphy Reed, my mother's mother, had a
decidedly un-Irish outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
   Always remember, my grandmother told her six grandchildren,
every cloud has a silver lining. Nothing bad ever happens unless
God has good reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   To which my mother's response generally was to roll her eyes
heavenward. From childhood, she'd subscribed to the more
traditional Irish belief that happiness is only a fleeting
interlude between longer periods of unpleasant normalcy. Faced with
a choice of lighting a candle or cursing the darkness, my mother's
habitual inclination was to mumble, ``Damn you, Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during my vacation, I found myself once again trying
to decide which perspective makes more sense. That was after I'd
found myself a member of a group I'd never wanted to join.
</P>
<P>
   It was 90-plus degrees at my rugged summer property in New
York's Finger Lakes region. I was alone on the beach, at the bottom
of a steep cliff, repairing a sailboat and sweating like a galley
slave. Luckily, I had a beer or two handy for nourishment. I was
taking a break when a red-hot poker suddenly touched the right side
of my chest.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it was a bee or a wasp. I've been stung dozens of times
over the years. But I'd never felt anything quite like this. I
jumped into the lake for relief, but the thing still hurt like
hell. So, I started up the 53 wooden stairs I'd built two years ago
on the face of this cliff. When I reached the first landing, the
world suddenly turned black and white, and I thumped down on the
boards like a falling tree.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I said to myself: Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself impossibly weak. It took me another 20 minutes
and another sagging collapse before I reached the top of those
steep stairs. Then I needed 10 minutes to sit, gasping, before I
could make my way to our little cottage high on the mountainside
and have my wife drive me to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   I scratched furiously at my skin throughout that nine-mile
jaunt. My throat closed. I could see colors again, but my vision
wasn't right. My lips were swollen. I was splotchy all over.
</P>
<P>
   In the emergency room, I was pumped full of fluids and
medication while they watched my heart with an EKG and took my
blood pressure every few minutes. The heart was fine throughout,
but the blood pressure started out dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, they sent me home with instructions to see a
doctor. Somehow, I'd developed an allergic reaction to wasp or bee
venom, possibly aggravated by dehydration. About 4 percent of the
population has this vulnerability. The nasty little assassins
manage to kill about 50 Americans every year.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, and nobody knows why, bees and wasps actually
seem attracted to people allergic to their venom.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, I'll be at my doctor's office. I'm told that they
treat this thing with two years or so of weekly shots to build up
your tolerance for insect venom. For the next 24 months, I suppose,
I'll be treated to the equivalent of a weekly bee sting. And I'll
probably also get to carry around with me everywhere an emergency
needle full of medication _ just in case some other bee or wasp
read a column that bent him out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, though: Who was right _ my mother or her mother? As I
ponder it, I'm inclined to go along with my grandmother's point of
view. Yeah, sure, I almost died, and my newly discovered allergy
clearly will be a huge annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   But, after all, I did get a column out of it.

THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, MINUS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his Newsweek cover story, ``The Whine of '99:
Everyone's Getting Rich But Me,'' Adam Bryant wrote about the
explosion of U.S. millionaires and billionaires and how it makes
other Americans feel envious, resentful and desperate to gain
entrance to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing,'' Bryant writes, ``is that nobody's really
countering the money hype. In previous boom times in the 1800s and
earlier this century, there was always influential criticism of
such behavior coming from pulpits, schools and colleges. Now it
seems as if the list of seven deadly sins has been shortened to
six.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is looking for sermon fodder _ anyone who still
believes that greed belongs on the list with idleness, gluttony,
lust, pride, envy and anger _ she or he need look no further than
two brilliant-but-chilling radio ads for Forbes.com, the on-line
edition of Forbes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the one about ``Jimmy.''
</P>
<P>
   A gentle, treacly guitar provides the background music as a
sincere sounding, soft-voiced man begins: ``Meet Jimmy.'' In
sing-song earnestness, the man says that Jimmy is a ``lot like his
other friends. He loves rap, he devours pizza and he always wants
to stay out past curfew.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the man's voice takes on a more serious tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except, there's something different about Jimmy, something
that makes him ... special.''
</P>
<P>
   Because we have heard dozens of commercials like this _ to
solicit donations for the Special Olympics or kids or adults with
some disability _ we prepare for the characteristic that makes
Jimmy ``special.''
</P>
<P>
   The man delivers: ``You see, Jimmy is a capitalist pig.''
</P>
<P>
   The smug way the man says ``capitalist pig'' makes it clear that
it's a great, butt-kickin' thing to be. He then explains that Jimmy
created an Internet Web site with a computer he got for Christmas
and ``some big company bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``while his friends are thinking about college, Jimmy is
thinking about his next Web site's IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of Jimmys, the man says, and touts Forbes.com's
ability to help them: ``So, if you think you may end up
disgustingly wealthy, or if you find the prospect hard to resist,
please, click onto Forbes.com. ... Remember, we're here to help.
Forbes.com. It's a new game.''
</P>
<P>
   The companion ad is about ``Sandy,'' who's ``like a lot of women
today _ alone, raising kids.'' The twist: Sandy is ``filthy,
stinking rich'' from designing Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Before the spot is over, the man uses the terms ``ridiculously
wealthy'' and ``making bundles of dough.'' Again, despite the
parodic please-help tone, it's clear that being filthy, stinking
rich is what anybody who's not a chump wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryant's piece, such commercials are dismissed by ad industry
reps as ``jokes, exaggerations, intended to grab eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Like much of Hollywood and cable television, Madison
Avenue appears to be in the grasp of clever but sophomoric young
men who never met a person, product or issue they couldn't turn
into a joke _ preferably one with a babe in it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is nothing sacred or deserving of dignity, anything
that once was held as such _ say, a sense that excess, greed-driven
wealth is obscene _ is Public Enemy No. 1, begging for a put-down.
</P>
<P>
   But lightweight intentions do not always produce inconsequential
results. Advertising is ubiquitous today because it works. Added to
the not-so-subtle cultural message that conspicuous consumption and
the widening wealth gap already send to all Americans, is it such a
far reach to expect hip and clever ads to intensify the attitude?
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of a magazine that has grown famous by publishing
an annual list of the wealthiest individuals in the world now says
it is truly cool to be a filthy, stinking rich, ridiculously
wealthy capitalist pig.
</P>
<P>
   Like the man says, it's a new game.

TV SEASON IS OVER BEFORE IT BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's look back at some of those can't-miss, sure-fire,
no-brainer fall hits that the networks rolled out for review at
this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costello.'' ``DiResta.'' ``Wind on Water.'' ``The Army Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we are just warming up. You just can't forget ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad Bloom.'' ``Mercy Point.'' ``Brimstone.'' ``Living in
Captivity.'' Mid-July means the summer Television Critics
Association Press Tour. The annual fest is where critics are called
together from around the country to a Pasadena, Calif., hotel to
review the upcoming fall shows.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the broadcast and cable networks bring in all their
stars for preview sessions, interviews, schmoozing and parties
whose opulence would leave Donald Trump shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a job.
</P>
<P>
   Still, everybody involved in this pre-fab event knows the same
thing, although it sometimes goes unsaid: Many, if not most, of
these new shows will be goners by the time the season is out, often
much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of a Kind.'' ``Holding the Baby.'' ``Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer.'' ``L.A. Doctors.'' There. That feels better.
</P>
<P>
   No, don't get the idea that the networks are outright lying to
us. Some of these shows had to look good on paper, or in
pre-pre-pre (pre-) production. Then again, some new shows get the
green light only because nothing better is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited.'' ``Guys Like Us.'' ``The Brian Benben
Show.'' ``Encore! Encore!'' ``Hyperion Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, the networks announced their planned lineups for the
coming fall. Based on some preview tapes (they have not yet been
formally released for review), some of the shows look pretty good,
some OK, some lame, some awful.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no one knows what shows will appear to be horrible
to critics, then go on to be hits. Call it the ``Providence''
scenario. On the flip side, some new programs will seem perfectly
palatable _ even good _ only to be disasters in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid.'' ``Buddy Faro.'' ``Fantasy Island.'' ``Trinity.''
</P>
<P>
   I only have a year on the beat, so don't take it like I have
grown hopelessly cynical already. Anyone who gripes about watching
television, even bad television, for a living needs to get off the
Barcalounger and run for a quick fix of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   So what will the networks tell us this year, besides that
they've each had ``the best development seasons in years''? Well,
in short, it will probably go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ABC: ``Drew Carey will star in two shows, a made-for-TV movie,
work the cash register at the commissary and fluff your pillow
before bed.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC: ``There is life after `Seinfeld' and George Clooney. It's
just not as good.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS: ``We can do women lawyer shows, too. Lots of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox: ``We can make funny comedies with real, live, undrawn
people. Honest.''
</P>
<P>
   WB: ``In continuing our pursuit for a younger audience, we are
shooting to lock up the in-utero demographic.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN: ``We're still here. And `Desmond Pfeiffer' is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pax: ``We are too a network, gosh darn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why wouldn't you believe everything they say?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Lives of Men.'' ``Maggie Winters.'' ``To Have and
to Hold.'' ``Legacy.'' Oh. Never mind.

OUTLOOK FOR CHIP BUSINESS IS ROSIER

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The semiconductor industry is in an upbeat mood
after a dismal 1998 for the manufacturers of the high-speed brains
on which computers rely.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a difference a year makes,'' said Stan Meyers, president
of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, the
2,300-member trade group that is sponsoring the 29th Semicon West
trade show. ``There is a decidedly more upbeat, though cautious
optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said 1998 was the ``worst single year in the history of
the industry'' because of a steep market decline.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales of semiconductors sank to $125.6 billion, the
lowest level since 1994, according to San Jose-based Pathfinder
Research. The decline represented an 8.5 percent drop from the
previous year, and a 13 percent drop from the $144.4 billion in
sales generated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers blamed a variety of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry is coming out of a three-year down cycle fueled
by a convergence of factors, including overcapacity and the Asian
financial crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those ills, the industry has staged a comeback and the
rebound is expected to continue. Pathfinder estimates worldwide
sales will rise to $143.1 billion in 1999 and continue to grow in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, major changes are afoot. The future of the personal
computer market is crucial. Giants like Santa Clara-based Intel
have ridden the PC boom to riches. Analysts fear the PC market is
saturated, creating less demand.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the slack from the computer market will be
manufacturers of products such as household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're PC-related, you're not so happy; if you are not
PC-related, you are fairly happy right now,'' said Dan Niles, a San
Francisco-based analyst for BancBoston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual applications, such as your toaster and your washing
machine, are going to have intelligence imbedded into them now,''
Niles said. ``There are a lot more areas that semiconductors are
going into compared to five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Mitchell, president of Air Products Electronic Chemicals in
Allentown, Pa., takes a guarded approach when looking into the
future of the semiconductor industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look
respectable,'' Mitchell said. ``It is certainly very difficult to
predict where we're going, but all of the indicators are certainly
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Semicon West show, being held in San Francisco, features
1,940 exhibitors, up from 1,750 last year.

DENIM IS HIP IN BACK-TO-SCHOOL FASHION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As teen-agers start their initial forays into the department and
specialty stores for back-to-school clothes, they will be treated
to an unusually large array of denimwear.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the prototypical American fabric is back with a vengeance.
The stores are full of it (fall clothes arrived early this year).
</P>
<P>
   Lately, classic American jeans _ Levis 501s, Wranglers, Lees and
their designer spinoffs _ have taken a back seat to khakis,
particularly the body-obscuring hip-hop look typified by designer
Tommy Hilfiger: khaki pants worn four sizes too big over Joe Boxer
briefs, topped by an oversized athletic team jacket and expensive
athletic shoes, laces undone.
</P>
<P>
   Now fashion's romance with the human body has re-emerged _ as
have form-fitting clothes to flaunt it. Add to that the hip Western
wear shown off in ``Wild Wild West,'' starring rap artist/actor
Will Smith, and jeanswear is back, big time.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, look for more variety in texture, weight and
hue. In other words, buying denim for school wear is not the
slam-dunk it used to be. It was very simple when all you wanted was
a pair of boot-cut Levis to go over your Frye's. These days, denim
comes in many hues, from the palest of the smooth, worn washed-out
blue to the deepest indigo.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want stretch? Heavy-weight? Rumply? Do you want them
pre-broken-in or would you have the patience to watch a stiff pair
of Diesel's deep blue jeans earn their ``patina?''
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid, we bought our Levis jeans in boys sizes.
</P>
<P>
   And we'd dump them in the washing machine with super hot water
treated with bleach. We'd wash them, not once, not twice, but three
times _ until the bleach broke down the fabric enough for the jeans
to fit like second skin.
</P>
<P>
   Blue jeans are an American tradition that started with German
emigre Levi Strauss, who, in 1853, sailed around the Horn to San
Francisco to begin a dry-goods business. What Strauss did, however,
was to sell long-wearing, durable work pants out of a fabric called
serge d'nimes (Nimes being the city in France where the material
was woven) to the gold miners of the Placer lodes.
</P>
<P>
   The miners complained that with all their rough use, the denim
pants didn't hold up. The pockets ripped when they stuffed their
tools into them.
</P>
<P>
   When a Reno, Nev., man named Jacob Davis, a Latvian-born tailor,
put metal rivets at the points of stress on the pants _ at the
pocket corners, at the base of the button fly _ to strengthen them,
he didn't have the $68 it would cost to patent his invention. He
contacted Levi Strauss, and together the two received Patent No.
139,121 from the U.S. Patent Office. The classic Levis jean was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Denimwear has come a long way since then, but the identification
of denim as the all-American fabric has solidified over the years.
``Denim really is the American fabric, the teen-aged `club'
totem,'' says Old Navy's Joe Enos. ``It's the anchor in the
wardrobe. Whether it's in the form of a denim skirt, a pair of
coveralls, a jean jacket, denim is a fabric that everybody can
wear. Right now, the softer washes are really comfortable. Denim is
a staple in the back-to- school wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Brad Kelly of The Denim Group U.S.A., an outfit out of
Wichita, Kan., that finds and consigns high-end vintage clothing
for the Asian market as well as for the East and West Coast,
``Denim is so comfortable. The new fabrics are light, they're easy
to maintain. It's ease of operation. And it's status with (high
schoolers).''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   What retailers such as Diesel, American Eagle and Old Navy have
begun stocking in denim, in addition to trendy styles (such as
cargo pants, carpenter jeans and draw-strings), are traditional
boot-cut jeans _ now dubbed ``flares'' _ to go over platform tennis
shoes, platform slides and chunky-heeled half-boots. Says jeans
dealer Kelly, ``I'm seeing trends back to clothes that fit. It's
probably a good sign.'' He even goes so far as to suggest that the
more contoured jeans style is a move away from the popularity of
hip-hop clothing, a statement that ``I don't want to be associated
with gang-style clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeans are easy to accessorize. This year's go-with is the plaid
shirt, layered with a sweater, a hooded jacket or a fleece or down
vest. It's neat, it's clean and it's totally American. ``Everybody
can wear a pair of jeans,'' Enos says. ``They're very democratic.''

FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH MAY BE FOUND IN THE SHADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Think of the part of your body with the
smoothest, softest, baby-like skin.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an adult, it's probably not your face, your arms or
your belly. Chances are it's your buttocks, and the reasons are
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty to 90 percent of the damage you normally associate with
aging is sun damage,'' said Dr. Mark Mitchnick, a Long Island
pediatrician and medical director of SunSmart Inc., a private
research and development company specializing in sunscreens.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most people are trying to protect themselves with
sunscreens. But knowing how to decode the numbers can be confusing,
and not all sunscreens are alike.
</P>
<P>
   Many products say they offer a sun protection factor or SPF of
15, 30 or 45 times ``your natural sunburn protection.'' Others
promise all day protection that's waterproof or water-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Calling such claims misleading and confusing, the Food and Drug
Administration recently has issued new labeling guidelines to make
it easier for consumers to know what they're buying. The rules are
the first to cover the testing and labeling of sunscreens since the
FDA issued tentative standards in 1978 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As of May 2001, words such as ``waterproof'' ``sunblock'' and
``all-day protection'' will be banished because such claims ``could
provide the wrong message and a false sense of security,'' the FDA
says.
</P>
<P>
   Also disappearing from the shelf will be any products labeled
with an SPF higher than 30, in favor of one label: ``30 Plus.'' As
the FDA explains it, the benefits of products above 30 are tiny and
difficult to accurately measure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell Singer, a Schenectady dermatologist, agrees. ``It's
become a numbers game,'' he said. ``You don't really get anywhere
once you get to a certain point.''
</P>
<P>
   So how high should you go with sunscreen? To answer that
question, you need to know how sunscreens are designed to work.
</P>
<P>
   A sunscreen with an SPF 15, for example, theoretically means
that someone who would burn in 15 minutes could stay burn-free for
3 hours and 45 minutes. Using an SPF 30 would lengthen the
protected period to 7.5 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those laboratory calculations don't take into account
real-world conditions, such as sweating, swimming or skimping on
the amount of sunscreen used. You should also know that the higher
SPFs provide only slightly more protection.
</P>
<P>
   For example, SPF 30 filters nearly 97 percent of sunburning
rays, while SPF 45 filters only about 1 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's not a lot of difference in the higher SPFs,
Singer spends less time talking numbers with his patients than
trying to get them to use sunscreen daily, not just for the long
day on the boat or at the beach. ``If you use it on a daily basis
all else is equal,'' said Singer, who recommends an SPF 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchnick believes applying sunscreen should be as routine as
brushing your teeth, since every moment in the sun can add up to
problems later. ``Most of the sun you get in your life is daily, in
small incremental doses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a daily basis, Michelle DiPasquale, 24, gets more than her
fair share of sun as a summer lifeguard for the New York Department
of Parks and Recreation, which issues sunblock with the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I get older, I'm worried about it on my face,'' DiPasquale
said. ``It does cause premature aging of the skin. You can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Some easy ways to protect yourself include wearing a hat, and
using sunscreen with at least an SPF 15 daily.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchnick also counsels people to look for a sunscreen that
protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Not all sunscreens protect
against UVA, and you should read the fine print on the label to
find out.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mitchnick is a big proponent of zinc oxide. But since
most people don't want to spread the white paste all over their
bodies, his company patented a transparent formula in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many of the large cosmetic and sunscreen
companies, including Oil of Olay, Maybelline, Body Shop, Nu Skin,
Iguana and Basis, started using Z-Cote on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work wonderfully,'' Singer said. ``It's like wearing long
pants and going outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, however, that no product offers total protection
against the sun, and you shouldn't use sunscreen as an excuse to
stay out longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of using common sense,'' Singer said. ``Just
because you're wearing a seatbelt doesn't mean you should drive 100
mph.''

NEXT WAVE OF INTERNET INVESTING: MUTUAL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While hyper cyber-traders flip their stocks like
mad, brokerage firms and analysts are betting that more cautious
long-term investors will make on-line investing in mutual funds the
next big rage on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys and business developments show that those more
conservative investors are diving quickly into the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 600 fund investors, released Monday by the Charles
Schwab and Co., found that 72 percent plan to trade mutual fund
shares in the next half-year, with nearly all of those trades done
on line.
</P>
<P>
   They also love the ease of Internet trading, with only 2 percent
saying they feel uncomfortable trading on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to be in the mutual fund industry in the
future has to get involved in the Internet,'' said Greg Gable, a
spokesman for the San Francisco-based brokerage. ``People are
embracing mutual fund investing on line. We've only scratched the
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, on-line fund assets total $128 billion _ a tiny portion
of the $7 trillion in total assets held by the nation's 7,000-plus
funds. But on-line fund assets may grow to $1.2 trillion by 2003,
according to Forrester Research Inc., an Internet research and
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Forrester report predicted that three financial behemoths _
Schwab, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group _ will dominate the
Internet market and kill smaller Internet brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's customers have $160 billion in 1,600 mutual funds, and
more than one-third of their on-line transactions involve mutual
funds. Fidelity boasts 3 million on-line accounts, and more than 30
percent of Vanguard's customers invest through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-line investing is going mainstream,'' said James Punishill,
an analyst at Forrester. ``The mass market has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial companies were slow to hit the Web with mutual fund
products. Techno-savvy cyber-traders _ typically white-collar
professionals in the financial and high-tech fields _ were the
first wave of on-line financial consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages tailored their services to those investors, who
engage in rapid-fire trading of stocks hundreds of times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, however, Jack White &AMP; Co., a discount brokerage
house in San Diego, broke the ice by selling mutual fund shares
over the Internet. Charles Schwab and others quickly joined the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Now the companies are targeting the next wave of investors:
financially conservative middle-class folks with billions of
dollars in retirement money in 401(k)s, individual retirement
accounts and other investment vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   After some early fear of the technology, consumers are warming
up to on-line finance. Their initial caution is similar to
consumers' distrust of automated teller machines two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest mutual fund product on line has been the so-called
mutual fund supermarkets, which offer consumers the choice of
thousands of mutual funds and money managers. Schwab's OneSource
supermarket is the most popular, with 1,100 no-load funds holding
$99 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   With more mutual funds coming to the Internet, fees should drop
as investors look for the cheapest deals, Punishill said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, consumers with 401(k)s will use more financial
planning software made available on their company Web sites and on
financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year or two, the financial sites also have become
much easier and more convenient to use.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab hopes to lure more customers into mutual fund investing
by providing fund research, share purchases and the monitoring of
portfolios at one easy, convenient site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be at your fingertips with one click,'' Gable
said.

AIRLINES APPEAL UNMARRIED PARTNERS RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Continuing their flight from a landmark San
Francisco ordinance, United Airlines and other air carriers
appealed a court order that says they must give employees with
unmarried partners some of the same benefits they give to married
employees.
</P>
<P>
   United and the other carriers on Monday asked the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals to overturn a federal court order requiring them
to comply with San Francisco's Equal Benefits Ordinance as early as
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was the latest in a flurry of court actions to buffet
the carriers, who have said they are seeking exemption from the
local law on business, not moral, grounds.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld, the San Francisco ordinance could affect benefits
offered by national carriers around the country, said lawyers on
both sides of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Aftergut, chief assistant city attorney, said United and
Federal Express currently violate the civil rights of employees
with unmarried partners by denying them equal pay. ``The airlines
are fighting to continue discriminating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Berg, a laywer for the Air Transport Association of
America, which represents major airlines, said, ``We're concerned
about the impact on the airlines if we're forced to comply with
this novel ordinance. We can't do business in the United States or
anywhere else if we have to comply with differing, or sometimes
conflicting, local ordinances.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco ordinance, the first of its kind in the
nation, says all companies contracting with the city must give the
same benefits to workers with registered domestic partners that
they do those who are married.
</P>
<P>
   The measure _ which covers unmarried heterosexuals as well as
homosexuals _ took effect in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But United, Federal Express and the Air Transport Association
joined in a lawsuit contending that, as national carriers, they
should be exempt from the measure and should only be regulated by
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the Airline Deregulation Act and other federal
laws bar local governments from regulating the benefits they offer
their workers, saying it would be unmanageable for them to operate
under standards set by numerous local communities where they
operate.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken of Oakland
agreed with the carriers that federal law alone governs their
pension and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, Wilken said they still must comply with other parts
of the city ordinance and give unmarried partners standard industry
perks, such as family and bereavement leave and flight discounts.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the carriers appealed that ruling to the federal
appeals court, where it will be decided within several months or
even years.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Wilken denied their request to stay her order so they
would not have to comply with it pending the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the carriers asked the appeals court to reverse that
decision and to impose a stay.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance takes effect as contracts are signed for the first
time or are amended. United and Federal Express are the only
contractors at San Francisco International Airport affected so far,
but more than 20 other national carriers would ultimately be
covered by the ordinance, Aftergut said.

   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, clusters of human skin cells that have been genetically
altered are approaching 400 divisions and still show no signs of
aging. They just keep multiplying. What gives? Shanti Menon reports
on what may very well be the discovery of the fountain of youth.

   When dinosaurs roamed Earth and South America nestled up against
Africa, Araripe Lagoon was a violent sea of death that collected
evidence of ancient life. Over millions of years the changing
climate dried and filled the sea many times. Today it's a
salt-saturated pile of sediment located in the northeast corner of
Brazil. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover magazine,
reports on what scientists are finding in its depths.

   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, clusters of human skin cells that have been genetically
altered are approaching 400 divisions and still show no signs of
aging. They just keep multiplying. What gives? Shanti Menon reports
on what may very well be the discovery of the fountain of youth.

   When dinosaurs roamed Earth and South America nestled up against
Africa, Araripe Lagoon was a violent sea of death that collected
evidence of ancient life. Over millions of years the changing
climate dried and filled the sea many times. Today it's a
salt-saturated pile of sediment located in the northeast corner of
Brazil. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover magazine,
reports on what scientists are finding in its depths.

<P>
   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.

   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a
cream,'' he suggests. ``It would penetrate the skin, get into the
cells, and keep them from aging.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay hope the beauty of telomerase turns out to be
more than skin-deep. One of the most promising potential uses of
the enzyme is to treat atherosclerosis, the scarring that blocks
arteries. Clusters of eternally youthful endothelial cells, from
the protective lining in arteries, are thriving in the Geron lab.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when someone undergoes angioplasty to scrape out
gunk from clogged arteries, the endothelial lining gets scraped
out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older patients, because of the aging of their endothelial
cells, have a reduced ability to heal the wound,'' Harley says.
``If we can deliver rejuvenated endothelial cells, using the same
type of balloon catheter that cleans out the vessels, we think we
can achieve a permanent solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay are currently working with just a few cell
types, but the list of degenerative diseases they eventually plan
to target is extensive. In some types of late-onset diabetes, for
example, people don't have enough insulin-making pancreatic islet
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if we could go in with a fine needle, take out one
pancreatic islet cell, and introduce telomerase into that cell?''
Shay says. ``We'd give the person back their own islet cells as if
they were from a 20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar procedures could regenerate skin for burn patients,
immune cells for people with HIV, retinal cells for blind people or
muscle cells to combat muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very potent direction to pursue,'' Shay says.
</P>
<P>
   Testing these techniques in humans is still a long way off,
however. Identifying the best means of triggering a cell to produce
telomerase is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Harley and Shay have already had some success engineering
viruses to carry telomerase genes, instead of harmful viral genes,
into cells. This works fairly well in a petri dish, but when a
virus enters a living person, it has to sneak past the body's
defenses to deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Another means of delivery could be to encase telomerase genes in
sacs of fatty molecules called liposomes. These tiny sacs fuse with
the cells they contact and regurgitate their contents into the
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tiny bubble fusing into a big bubble,'' Harley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has yet to perfect these methods, he's reluctant to
speculate about when people will be able to get telomerase therapy:
``I can say we'd be extremely disappointed if it wasn't in our
lifetime.''

<P>
   The clusters of human skin cells basking in a sterile incubator,
with alarms poised to go off if the level of carbon dioxide drops
or the temperature wavers from 98.6 degrees, appear to be blessed
with eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, skin cells divide about 50 to 70
times and then quickly wither and stop dividing. But after nearly
two years in a laboratory at Geron, a Menlo Park, Calif., biotech
company, these genetically altered cells are approaching 400
divisions and still show no signs of aging. They just keep
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, endlessly multiplying cells indicated one thing:
cancer. But Geron biochemist Cal Harley and cell biologist Jerry
Shay, who has the same type of lab setup at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, say the remarkably youthful
skin cells remain cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harley and Shay hope their success in prolonging the
life span of these individual cells in the lab could eventually
pave the way for more people to lead healthy and productive lives
up to the age of 120.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the driving forces for trying to immortalize normal
cells is that we may be able to treat or prevent the onset of
certain diseases where cell aging plays a key role,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shay discovered their cellular fountain of youth when a
strand of DNA they inserted into a skin cell prompted the
production of telomerase, an enzyme naturally found in very young
embryonic cells.
</P>
<P>
   Telomerase restores bits of DNA, called telomeres, which cap the
ends of chromosomes and keep them from unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter, like the
burning wick on a candle. When telomeres get down to a critical
length, a cell will simply stop dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telomeres are now known to be the clock of cell aging,''
Harley says. ``Telomerase is the enzyme that can rewind the clock.
It gives us a way to restore an increased life span, a youthful
life span, to aging cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Young cells help keep skin smooth and supple by secreting
collagen and elastin, proteins that manufacturers often add to
creams and lotions. But when the cells stop dividing, they produce
less of these proteins; some make an enzyme that breaks down
collagen. As a result, old skin starts looking thin and wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   When cells Harley and Shay had altered began producing
telomerase, the effect was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few doublings, the telomeres in those cells started
to grow, in some cases quite dramatically,'' Harley says.
</P>
<P>
   With their lengthened telomeres, the rejuvenated skin cells also
continued to churn out high levels of youthful proteins.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a skin graft using immortalized cells could replace
tough old skin with soft, healthy young skin. A less drastic
approach might be to coax skin cells to activate their existing,
but dormant, telomerase genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural gene that's in every cell but is turned off,''
Harley says. ``You could try to deliver a telomerase activator in a

<P>
   The sudden arrival of a flock of crested pterosaurs shatters the
eerie midday calm of Araripe Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   They swoop and soar as they jostle for position over the 70-mile
stretch of bubbling water, snapping for fish at the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, swarms of mating cockroaches cloud the sky, their dark
wings whirring.
</P>
<P>
   A stench of rotting eggs fills the air. Mayflies, damselflies
and wasps flit through ferns.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic bubble of toxic gas seeps up from the water's depths.
Its first victim is a hapless pterosaur. Overcome by fumes, it
crashes into the water. Soon thousands of insects splatter the
surface of the inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed Earth 120 million years ago, and South
America nestled up against Africa, Araripe was a violent sea of
death that collected evidence of ancient life.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years the changing climate dried and filled the
sea many times. Today it's a salt-saturated pile of sediment
located in the northeast corner of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The lagoon was so salty that a few fish could live only at its
surface in a thin layer of freshwater that flowed from a river on
its eastern edge. Any animal or plant that sank into the lagoon was
embalmed in a briny grave.
</P>
<P>
   The only inhabitants of its depths were bacteria; no predators
could survive in the saline waste.
</P>
<P>
   As bacteria fed on the creatures that rained from above, they
produced toxic gases _ methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
_ that in turn bubbled up to poison the birds and insects flying
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's paleontologist David Martill's theory. Martill,
of the University of Portsmouth in England, reached this conclusion
after 11 years spent unearthing an array of fossils in the driedup
lagoon, called the Crato Formation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of species he has found is unusual. Fossil hunters
typically find scraps of organisms _ a bone here, a leaf there.
Martill, however, has uncovered all kinds of intact animals and
plants, and all in one place.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom-dwelling bacteria fed on soft guts, muscle and blood,
but they could not easily digest bone, insect cuticle or plant
cellulose, which explains why the fossils look flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive among Martill's finds are pterosaurs with intact
skin, teeth, claws and head crests.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens include fish, frogs, lizards, beetles,
damselflies, cicadas and even whole flowering plants.
</P>
<P>
   And last year he came upon the coup de grace: more than a
hundred fossilized mite eggs clinging to a lone feather _ the
oldest ever found.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these creatures, notably the insects, resemble their
modern-day cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A design that works well will not change,'' Martill says.
</P>
<P>
   After he had unearthed these treasures, Martill became intrigued
by the preponderance of winged creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's funny about this deposit,'' he says, ``is
that a dinosaur hasn't drifted into the lagoon. It's dominated by
things that dropped out of the sky.'' Which is how he came up with
his poison-gas theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bacteria ate the tissues of the animals,'' he says, ``they
deposited a mineral called iron pyrite over the animal. The iron
pyrite then preserved the fossil. The bottom sediments, rich in
bacteria feeding on organic matter, would give off large quantities
of gases. It's possible that in sheltered lakes there was a buildup
of gases over the surface water. And anything flying into that
could have been killed by the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthquakes, which were common in the region, might also have
forced gas to the surface of the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all the animals plunged to their death. Some,
such as the odd frog or lizard, may have drifted into the lagoon
from elsewhere. Plants may have arrived by a similar route, or
perhaps they were blown in.
</P>
<P>
   However they got there, Martill is grateful they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing worked like a big pickling tank, preserving
everything,'' he says. ``It's a very special window into Cretaceous
life.''

 c.1999 Moscow News  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Forty years ago, for the first time in Soviet history, an
American exhibition opened at a fair in the Moscow park of
Sokolniki. There, my grandfather, Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was at
the time first secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee
and chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, had a debate with
Richard Nixon, vice president of the United States and head of the
U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibits on display was a ``typical American home for
a typical American family.'' The most heated part of the debate
took place in the model kitchen. So it went down in diplomatic
history as the ``kitchen'' debate.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange, Khrushchev predicted that Nixon's
grandchildren would live in a socialist America, to which Nixon
retorted that, no, the grandchildren of the Soviet Union's No. 1
Communist would live in a capitalist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Khrushchev, a staunch Communist, proved to be wrong. His
grandchildren indeed now live in Russia, but under a system that
can hardly be called socialist. Meanwhile, his son, my father,
Sergei N. Khrushchev, 63, after eight years of working in the
United States, became a U.S. citizen a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem a fitting postscript to that debate. I should be
putting a period here. Yet I can't. What I've come up against in
recent days shows that for many people in Russia, the Cold War has
never become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In my role as a researcher for Moscow News, I am often in
contact with agencies and bureaus for photographs, archival
information and so forth. Although Father lives in America, we are
frequently in touch. Just recently he asked me to contact a man he
knew who used to be prominent in the Soviet leadership _ at one
time, a member of the Central Committee. I phoned him and
introduced myself.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what I heard in response: ``Khrushchev's eldest son,
Leonid, surrendered to the Nazis; they used him to conduct
anti-Soviet agitation on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to object: ``No, there are no documents to that effect
in any archives, Russian or German.''
</P>
<P>
   But not letting me cut in on his monologue, he continued to
enlighten me about my relatives. ``At the end of the war,'' he
said, ``Sudoplatov's (a Stalin-era spy chief) agents snatched
Leonid from Nazi captivity and put him on trial, and he was
sentenced to be shot for collaborating with the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Again my interlocutor would not listen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was time to learn about the former Soviet leader. It
seems that Grandfather was once summoned by Stalin, and crawled
before him on his knees, crying, but the ``father of the peoples''
was adamant in his criticism. This was apparently why Khrushchev
Sr. came to hate Stalin, and plot to take revenge for being so
humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the old hard-liner ended up talking about my father.
``I am not surprised,'' he told me, ``that yet another Khrushchev
degenerate has betrayed our Motherland and sold himself out to the
Americans.'' He added that I, personally, would have to answer for
this under the ``criminal code'' of the land.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment I didn't understand. Then it dawned on me: He was
actually referring to the notorious Article 58 of the Stalin-era
Criminal Code, all of whose paragraphs provided for capital
punishment. One of them referred to ``members of the family of a
traitor to Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the view of that staunch Leninist, I am now a member of
a traitor's family; however, as yet, I have not been executed and
continue to work. What I am quickly learning, though, is that this
man is not alone in his view of me. My father's new status has
irked other people besides him.
</P>
<P>
   Quite by surprise, I was told at a Russian design bureau, once a
highly classified project, where I chose to turn for assistance in
tracking down a picture of a big space rocket that was not destined
to be produced in quantity, that they ``did not maintain any
relations with foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   But I live in Moscow, I told them, and never changed my
citizenship, whereas, indeed, this very year they were visited by
delegations from the United States, France, Japan and other
countries. That cut no ice.
</P>
<P>
   I was told this: ``Should the FSB (Federal Security Service)
give a positive response IN WRITING to your application IN WRITING
to its director, then we might be able to help you. If not, you
will never get to see this photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, I phoned an archive where I had had some
documents duplicated for my father. Its employees had never turned
down my requests before. But this time was different. They said:
``The head of the administrative department would like to talk to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of department, a relatively young man, told me in a
voice of steel: ``In view of the change in the status of your
father, the cost of this order will be 40 times as much. It is also
desirable that payment be made in hard currency.''
</P>
<P>
   This is of course no longer a Cold War. But neither is it peace
as it should be.

 c.1999 Moscow News  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Forty years ago, for the first time in Soviet history, an
American exhibition opened at a fair in the Moscow park of
Sokolniki. There, my grandfather, Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was at
the time first secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee
and chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, had a debate with
Richard Nixon, vice president of the United States and head of the
U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibits on display was a ``typical American home for
a typical American family.'' The most heated part of the debate
took place in the model kitchen. So it went down in diplomatic
history as the ``kitchen'' debate.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange, Khrushchev predicted that Nixon's
grandchildren would live in a socialist America, to which Nixon
retorted that, no, the grandchildren of the Soviet Union's No. 1
Communist would live in a capitalist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Khrushchev, a staunch Communist, proved to be wrong. His
grandchildren indeed now live in Russia, but under a system that
can hardly be called socialist. Meanwhile, his son, my father,
Sergei N. Khrushchev, 63, after eight years of working in the
United States, became a U.S. citizen a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem a fitting postscript to that debate. I should be
putting a period here. Yet I can't. What I've come up against in
recent days shows that for many people in Russia, the Cold War has
never become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In my role as a researcher for Moscow News, I am often in
contact with agencies and bureaus for photographs, archival
information and so forth. Although Father lives in America, we are
frequently in touch. Just recently he asked me to contact a man he
knew who used to be prominent in the Soviet leadership _ at one
time, a member of the Central Committee. I phoned him and
introduced myself.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what I heard in response: ``Khrushchev's eldest son,
Leonid, surrendered to the Nazis; they used him to conduct
anti-Soviet agitation on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to object: ``No, there are no documents to that effect
in any archives, Russian or German.''
</P>
<P>
   But not letting me cut in on his monologue, he continued to
enlighten me about my relatives. ``At the end of the war,'' he
said, ``Sudoplatov's (a Stalin-era spy chief) agents snatched
Leonid from Nazi captivity and put him on trial, and he was
sentenced to be shot for collaborating with the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Again my interlocutor would not listen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was time to learn about the former Soviet leader. It
seems that Grandfather was once summoned by Stalin, and crawled
before him on his knees, crying, but the ``father of the peoples''
was adamant in his criticism. This was apparently why Khrushchev
Sr. came to hate Stalin, and plot to take revenge for being so

 &HT;    A GUIDE TO THE ENGLISH WORDS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD
 &HT;    410&AMP;add. With FOREIGN-LIST.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeing the floor littered with stompies, the drissy
wowser told the janitor to stop kicksin' and clean up before the
bagmen arrive for the toenadering.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   What sounds like gibberish is actually foreign English _ words
used by folks in other countries who share the language with
Americans, but with their own linguistic twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stompies'' are cigarette butts in South Africa. New Zealanders
use ``drissy'' as adjective meaning ``frantic.'' A ``wowser'' is an
Aussie with a puritanical disposition. On Caribbean islands,
``kicksin' `` equates to loafing. In Canada, a ``bagman'' is a
political fund-raiser. And a ``toenadering'' is a gathering of
political parties in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   All these terms _ and 400,000 or so others _ are defined in the
new ``Encarta World English Dictionary,'' which will be arriving in
bookstores in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The need for such a dictionary was spawned by the Internet, said
Anne Soukhanov, general editor of the volume and ``Word Watch''
columnist for The Atlantic Monthly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail specifically has brought all generations of Americans
close to their English-speaking neighbors from Canada to the
Pacific Rim,'' she said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   With instant global communications, ``we need to be able to
understand them and their cultures, and vice versa,'' Soukhanov
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Without a ``world view,'' confusion is nearly certain because
the same words can mean different things in different
English-speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, for instance, a ``robot'' is what Americans
call a ``stop light.'' Job seekers in Southeast Asia give a
``biodata'' to prospective employers rather than a resume. In
Australia, a hotel is an establishment that sells alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Over a billion people speak English, Soukhanov said. Of these,
375 million have English as their native tongue. An estimated 750
million people are trying to learn the language.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, people associate the English language with
success, she said. ``They view it as single most important
communicative tool in their inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Compilation of the global dictionary was a technological feat.
Linked by e-mail, more than 320 lexicographers (dictionary
editors), linguists and other specialists worked at their computer
screens for over two years in 20 nations. Soukhanov did most of her
work from her restored historic farmhouse in the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of it as a huge global office,'' said Soukhanov, who
was executive editor of the American Heritage Dictionary of the
English Language, published in 1992, and co-author of the 1997 book
``Speaking Freely: A Guided Tour of American English from Plymouth
Rock to Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   A dictionary and reference book editor for more than two
decades, Soukhanov said the American version of English ``seems to
keep expanding and expanding.'' New words are especially generated
in the pop culture, digital industries and medical fields.
</P>
<P>
   The new dictionary defines ``yadda yadda yadda'' as slang for
``boring, trite, superficial, unending talk.'' But Seinfield fans
already knew that. A ``chiphead'' is skilled at computer use and a
``stealth tower'' is an ecologically friendly, camouflaged
telecommunications tower. A ``selfish gene'' is one that ``exploits
the organism in which it occurs as a vehicle for
self-preservation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``English is definitely a work in progress,'' said Soukhanov,
describing how the language is constantly adding computer terms
such as ``drag and drop,'' historic references such as ``Dayton
Accords,'' and e-mail abbreviations like LOL for ``laughing out
loud'' and TMOT for ``trust me on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary will be published in print form by St. Martin's
Press and on a CD-ROM by Microsoft. The book will sell for $50. The
CD-ROM will be priced at $39.95 with a $20 mail-in rebate.

list of 315 cities studied. But an economist who helped prepare the
study, Perry Wong, says Austin's place among the Top 25 tech
centers may be more precarious that city boosters may believe, and
that Dallas is more firmly entrenched. That's because Dallas has a
very complex technology base, with seven different high-tech
industries represented. Austin, in contrast, has a lot of high-tech
jobs, but they are highly concentrated in the business of making

TOWN KNOWS LITTLE OF SUSPECTED KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICAHEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ People acquainted with the two brothers who
are suspected of killing two gay men and burning three synagogues
were aware of their beliefs about white supremacy, but were shocked
that these two quiet and unfailingly polite young men were linked
to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone we've spoken with finds it extremely hard to
believe,'' said Samantha Burke who, with her husband, Tom, hired
Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, as their yard man. Williams'
brother, James Tyler Williams, 29, also worked at their house on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were arrested last week in Yuba City while using
the credit card of Gary Matson. Matson, 50, and Winfield Scott
Mowder, 40, a well-known and well-liked gay couple, were found shot
to death in their Happy Valley house July 1.
</P>
<P>
   During a subsequent search of Matthew Williams' Redding home and
a house in nearby Palo Cedro, where Tyler Williams lived with his
parents, investigators found evidence that they said linked the
pair to the arson fires of the synagogues in Sacramento on June 18.
(The brothers go by their middle names.)
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Ron Richardson of the Shasta County Sheriff's Department
said the Williamses would probably be charged in the deaths of
Matson and Mowder on Wednesday or Thursday. They are being held on
charges of possessing stolen property. Richardson said no other
arrests were anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Monday that it had new evidence that further linked
the two to the synagogue fires.
</P>
<P>
   A search Monday focused on the outskirts of the Northern
California town of Oroville, where the car belonging to Matson and
Mowder was found last week.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hoped to discover whether any evidence in the
arson case had been tossed away near the site of the abandoned car,
possibly into nearby irrigation ditches.
</P>
<P>
   While some people in Redding are familiar with the Williams
family, those interviewed for this story said they did not know the
family well.
</P>
<P>
   Ben and Sally Williams, the parents of the brothers, live on a
three-acre plot in rural Palo Cedro, up against North Cow Creek.
Not only have they not come to know their neighbors in the three
years since they moved here from Gridley, in Butte County, but Ben
Williams demonstrated an unusual technique to insure that nobody
tried to socialize with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I understand you're a drug dealer,'' Williams said when he
first met his next-door neighbor, a medical technician, according
to the neighbor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided then that I wouldn't be hosting any welcome coffees
for them,'' she said. ``I think it was his way of saying `stay
back.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses' sons, who had been home-schooled and reportedly
did not socialize with their peers in Gridley, went into the
Redding community to work. Both were avid horticulturists, and sold
their organic produce at the local farmers market.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, according Richardson, that they became acquainted
with Mowder and Matson, who were also devoted to raising plants.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in this area, Matthew Williams got a job at
Orchard Nutrition, a health-supply store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little different,'' recalled Orchard employee Leona
McCall. ``He had his little weird way of thinking. He kept to
himself a lot. He was just an oddball.''
</P>
<P>
   She said he had once tried to distribute his own nutritional
literature in the store, but the owner told him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   He left Orchard about a year ago to launch his own landscaping
business. And, to some clients, he offered literature of a
different sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to do with the supremacy of the white race,'' said
Samantha Burke. ``We were rather surprised and found it
distasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband said they returned the racist information to
Williams and told him ``we were of a different persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, said the Burkes, they had no reason to dislike their
enthusiastic gardener and his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very polite, very respectful and nice to have
around,'' Tom Burke said. ``We had no reason not to trust them, and
also they were good workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' arrest ``really came as a shock'' to Cheri Cooke,
47, who cleaned houses for two families that also employed the
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew was a really sweet person,'' she said. ``There wasn't
a subject you could broach with Matthew that he didn't know
something about.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding religion, she said, ``he was very much what you would
call a fundamentalist. His lifestyle, everything. He tended to be
by the book, and he was very inflexible, very rigid.''
</P>
<P>
   She said his dogmatic ways also applied to food: ``He wouldn't
eat anything with sugar, he wouldn't eat anything that was
processed, he wouldn't take any caffeine. He was fanatical about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooke said she had met Matthew Williams' parents once and
``found them gracious and warm and friendly and accepting.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williams, on the other hand, did not relate well to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he did not like being around people,'' she
said. ``He was aloof and distant.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williams left home in 1995 and briefly attended the
University of Idaho in Moscow. He attracted some attention there
when he became involved in a controversy surrounding the Living
Faith Fellowship, a Christian youth organization that some
defectors, including Williams, accused of being a cult. He told the
Moscow Daily News that he had been attracted to the group because
he was ``emotionally devastated'' after breaking up with his
fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   If true, it appears that Matthew Williams has been engaged to be
married on at least two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely had girlfriends, and the reason is they had to think
like Matthew,'' Cooke said. ``They had to agree with his religious
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, she said he had recently become engaged to a woman
from the Redding area. ``It didn't work out,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had been ``quite happy'' about being engaged, Samantha
Burke said. ``I know that he wanted to have big family; he wanted
to have a lot of children. I thought he would make a very fine
father.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The rule of red wine with cheese is as revered as the
one dictating no wine with breakfast. But in a season when chilled
white wine seems so appealing, one of those rules demands to be
broken, and not just as a sign of surrender to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of our customers drink red wine with the cheese,
but my personal preference is for white,'' said Roger Dagorn, the
accredited sommelier at Chanterelle. ``Red wine with cheese is an
old myth. White wine is livelier and has more acidity, which
balances the fattiness of cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Many wine experts agree, although the message seems not to have
reached restaurant patrons or dinner party hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red wine with cheese? I'd like to debunk that,'' said Paul
Grieco, the beverage director at Gramercy Tavern, where his
selection of some 15 cheeses is routinely paired with red wine by
his customers. Though he is reluctant to go so far as to recommend
a dry white wine, he said he sometimes suggests a sweet one or an
oloroso sherry.
</P>
<P>
   At Picholine, which has the most elaborate cheese selection in
New York, Max McCalman, a former sommelier who supervises and
serves the cheese, lamented the bias toward red wines. He recalled
that the host at a large table of wine buffs not long ago selected
a magnum of Chateau Talbot 1989 to serve with cheese. ``There were
strong cheeses,'' McCalman said. ``It was a real clash.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Jean-Claude Vrinat, the owner of Taillevent, says he
generally prefers white wines with cheese but that most of his
customers continue with their red wine when the cheese is served.
``Red wines complement very few cheeses,'' he said. ``But our
customers usually don't ask our opinions when it comes to what to
drink with cheese, so we try to recommend the cheeses that don't
violate the taste of a red wine.'' Which defeats the pleasure of a
French cheese tray, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner last year at Les Celebrites showcasing the red
burgundies of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Aubert de -Villaine,
the co-owner of the estate, switched to Le Montrachet for the
cheese. ``With cheese, I only like white wine,'' he said to the
guests, some of whom had been nursing their red La Tache for the
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   He later said his preference had changed through tasting and
experience. ``I started drinking white wine with cheese because
every time we had a great red with the cheese, it was a
disappointment,'' he said. ``Cheese kills the nuances in red wine.
In Burgundy now, more and more people are drinking white wine with
cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion of red wine with cheese appears to be a vestige of
sexist, Victorian days. Gerald Asher, a wine writer, explained that
in 19th-century England, the consumption of red wine and cheese was
not considered ladylike. At the end of dinner, the women retired to
the parlor so that the men could get on with serious drinking:
claret and port. With Stilton, of course. Asher believes that in
France the habit evolved from a custom of saving the best (red)
wines for the end of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   The custom persists for practical reasons. ``Often, there's
enough red wine left from the main course, so people continue
drinking it with the cheese,'' Dagorn said. De Villaine conceded
that a white after a big red is not ideal, either. ``You need a
break,'' he said. Serve the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCalman of Picholine said cheese would flatter a light,
simple red wine, but most people would not follow the big red wine
of the main course with a simple country red any more than they
would pop open a white. The one cheese that he believes demands a
robust red wine, like a Nebbiolo, is Parmigiano-Reggiano.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hazan, an authority on Italian wines, whose next book is
to be called ``The Color of Wine Is Red,'' said that he no longer
advocates white wines at all but would not serve his best reds with
cheese. ``Cheese interferes with everything except a light,
sprightly red or a sweet wine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you care only about the cheese, it might not matter what the
wine is, but to enjoy the wine and do it credit, give thoughtful
consideration to the pairing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pocket Encyclopedia of Wine 1991 (Fireside), Hugh Johnson
gives a few easy rules, suggesting that in general, the harder the
cheese, the more tannins the accompanying wine can have, which
supports the marriage of Parmesan and Nebbiolo. He adds that the
creamier the cheese, the more acidity is needed in the wine.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cheeses taste of salt and fat. Many are also creamy
and pungent. These characteristics often deaden rich, tannic red
wines. But refreshing, fruity but dry whites can handle them. Some
sweet whites make for brilliant matches, like the classic
combination of Sauternes and Roquefort.
</P>
<P>
   Since many Americans like to fill their plates with a variety of
cheeses, the habit of red wine may be hard to shake. Others will
jump on the white bandwagon. But the best idea may be to ponder the
subtle nuances and make careful matches with the wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing many people I respect say the only wine to serve
with cheese is white now,'' said Steven Jenkins, the author of
``Cheese Primer'' (Workman, 1996). ``That's extreme. There are no
absolutes.''

A USEFUL DEVICE, EXTREME SCOOPING ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the summer when I was growing up, my mother would cut
watermelon into a basket shape and diligently empty its flesh with
a melon baller, refilling the basket with perfectly round
watermelon and cantaloupe balls.
</P>
<P>
   It took forever, and it did look pretty, but I thought she was
crazy. Inevitably, after a few years, she gave up and put the melon
baller back in the drawer for good.
</P>
<P>
   The watermelon basket was just the kind of trendy 1970s dish
that gave the melon baller a bad name. In truth, it is an extremely
handy tool when used in reasonable ways.
</P>
<P>
   A large melon baller can be used to make tiny scoops of sorbet,
or balls of banana to layer on top of a tart. These kinds of
finishing touches do not take that much time and can make a big
difference in the visual appeal of what you're serving.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as useful as a corer. In restaurant kitchens, melon
ballers are used to remove seeds from cucumbers and to core apples
and pears. On a cucumber halved lengthwise, the melon baller
removes the seeds in a neat, rounded trough. With halved fruit it
scoops out the core in a clean, round half sphere _ impossible
using a paring knife.
</P>
<P>
   Melon ballers can also be used to create a cavity for stuffing.
Jacques Torres, the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000, uses one to
empty the center of strawberries, then fills them with strawberry
sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   The tool's main drawback is that it creates a lot of waste. But
there are things to be done with that, too. With strawberries, for
instance, use what you core from the fruit to make a sauce. Scraps
from vegetables can be added to soups, or finely minced into a
garnish. Leftovers and excess juice from melons can be transformed
into sorbet or granita or strained and added to a cocktail for
flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when exactly the melon baller was invented, but it
began appearing in cookbooks in the 19th century. At that time in
France, cooking was becoming a much more precise craft, and the
labor required of the diner was reduced to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Tools like the melon baller were created so that melon would not
need to be scooped at the table, said Burt Wolf, who is revising
``The Cooks' Catalog'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1975), which he wrote with
James Beard, Barbara Kafka and Milton Glaser. Serving balled melon
was also a way to show off the wealth of the host and the depth of
his kitchen staff.
</P>
<P>
   Some classic uses for the melon baller are actually worthy of
revival. Pommes parisienne, for instance, is horrendously
time-consuming _ potatoes are carved into tiny balls, blanched and
browned in butter. But it's a delicious idea. Such painstaking
manipulation of so humble a food makes for a whimsical
presentation, and the small round shape offers a greater surface
area to be made crisp and buttery. The same can be done with
zucchini and carrots.
</P>
<P>
   The melon baller is one of the few tools that manufacturers seem
to have mastered. I tested 11, and the only significant differences
were in the prices, which ranged from $7 to $21. What is important
is for the edge of the baller to feel thin and sharp, for the tool
to seem sturdy and for the handle to feel comfortable in the palm.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of sizes and shapes are available. Some melon ballers make
spheres the size of peas, others as large as walnuts. There are
double-ended ballers, scalloped ones, even top-shaped ones.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of unusually shaped ballers depends on the
texture of the food. With cantaloupe, the shapes turn out distinct,
but they are completely lost with ice cream, which melts and blurs
the shape almost immediately. And potatoes are simply too hard:
shaped ballers get wedged in them and cannot be fully turned.

   No matter what shape or size the melon baller is, success
depends almost entirely on technique. If you want perfectly smooth
spheres or tops or ovals, you must press down firmly and make two
complete rotations with the tool. And when scooping ice cream, it
is a good idea to immerse the baller in hot water before plunging
it into the ice cream.

   If you work quickly enough, you can create, as Wolf does, the
world's smallest ice cream sundae.

IN ALSACE, RIESLINGS RISE TO THE OCCASION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a few American winemakers are obsessed with the
riesling grape. With good reason: it is arguably the finest white
grape variety in the world. In the United States, which mostly
means California, riesling produces wines that are attractive,
friendly, uncomplicated and easy to like. These are good qualities
in an Airedale, not necessarily in a white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with yet another batch of California rieslings, I
sometimes feel like the reluctant _ and ultimately exasperating _
swain in one of Bernard Malamud's stories. ``This one!'' cries the
matchmaker. ``This one you will really like.'' But he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between that unhappy man and me is this: I know
where the good ones are. They are in Germany _ no surprise to
anyone _ in the Rheingau, along the Mosel and in the Pfalz, all
renowned Germany wine regions.
</P>
<P>
   But the best _ and I'm going out on a limb here _ the very best,
come from Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful, bloody, tragic Alsace, for centuries a pawn on the
chessboard of tyrants. Fought over by Romans, Franks and Teutonic
knights; utterly destroyed during the Thirty Years' War in the 15th
century; French for two centuries, German from 1871, then French
again after World War I; German during World War II and now French
once more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alsace embodies the best of both cultures. As someone
once said of Alsatian cooking, ``German ingredients and French
flair.'' So, too, for Alsatian wines. The riesling is the
quintessential German grape; the Alsatians invest it with French
flair.
</P>
<P>
   Gewuerztraminer is Alsace's signature grape. Even people who
never drink it and have trouble pronouncing it (it's
geh-VOORTZ-trah-meen-er) can pick out its unmistakable, almost
dizzying aroma of litchi nuts and roses. But eventually one tires
of gewuerztraminer; it's too much of a good thing. Moreover, the
richer and more powerful it gets, the harder it is to match with
food.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Alsatian riesling. Its cousin across the Rhine is a
better food wine than most people give it credit for, but German
riesling at its best has some sweetness, and efforts to ferment it
completely dry have had only modest success. In Alsace, riesling
has always been a dry wine and, consequently, a food wine.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, its qualities are only enhanced by age. On several
occasions in the 1980s, I had a chance to sample Alsatian rieslings
from the 1920s that had the fruit and liveliness of wines a tenth
their age. In 1989, when the Hugel family of Riquewihr celebrated
its 350th anniversary in the wine business at a dinner at the
three-star Auberge de l'Ill, it served _ among many, many wines _
rieslings from 1900, 1934 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a fine riesling is no easier than describing any
other wine, but words like steeliness and flowery come to mind.
Suffice it to say that, at its best, riesling offers unmatched
elegance and depth. And, unlike any other white wine, it grows more
subtle and complex as it ages.
</P>
<P>
   During the long years of German control from 1871 to the end of
World War I, Alsace was treated as a source of cheap wine, much of
it made from the chasselas grape, which is grown on the floor of
the valley that separates the Vosges Mountains from the Rhine. With
Alsace back in French hands in the years before World War II,
riesling and other noble grapes were replanted. Once again, the
vineyards crept up the slopes of the Vosges behind the picture-book
medieval towns from Thann in the south to Marlenheim and Nordheim,
just west of Strasbourg, in the north. Riesling grows best in the
higher vineyards of the Department of the Haut-Rhin, in communes
like Ribeauville, Riquewihr, Wintzenheim and Rouffach.
</P>
<P>
   Hugel et Fils in Riquewihr and F.E. Trimbach in Ribeauville are
probably the best-known producers of Alsatian wines in the United
States, thanks to the tireless salesmanship of Jean (Johnny) Hugel,
now retired, and Hubert Trimbach, and, not incidentally, the fine
wines they sell. Hugel wines are perhaps softer and more accessible
to newcomers to Alsatian wines; Trimbach wines are more austere.
There are critics who maintain that Trimbach's Riesling Clos
Ste.-Hune, made from a three-acre vineyard in the town of Hunawihr,
is the finest of all Alsatian wines. A clos is a relatively small
vineyard, usually surrounded by a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of producers of great Alsatian rieslings,
several stand out. Zind-Humbrecht, in Wintzenheim, is a favorite
among connoisseurs of Alsatian wines because the Humbrechts strive
to make each of their various wines reflect the soil from which it
comes. Thus a riesling from the Herrenweg vineyard in Turckheim,
where the soil is largely granite, is a different wine from a
Gueberschwihr riesling, which springs from limestone soil. My
favorites are the Zind-Humbrecht rieslings from the Clos Windsbuhl
vineyard, which is also limestone.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for a producer like Zind-Humbrecht to make
wines from many vineyards. It may own or lease some of them
entirely, and own or lease parts of others. Thus, Zind-Humbrecht
owns the 13-acre Clos St.-Urbain and farms the 11-acre Clos
Windsbuhl. In some years, the Humbrechts may produce 30 or more
different wines, including a dozen rieslings from half a dozen or
more vineyards, each in a different style.
</P>
<P>
   It is now just 20 years since Theo Faller died, leaving the
Domaine Weinbach in Kaysersberg in the hands of his wife, Colette,
and their two daughters, Catherine and Laurence. Laurence is now
the winemaker and each year produces as many as six different
rieslings, including the Cuvee Theo and the Cuvee Ste.-Catherine
from the Schlossberg Vineyard. Some of the best Domaine Weinbach
wines come from the Fallers' 13-acre Clos des Capucins, one of the
finest vineyards in Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent Alsatian rieslings come from Marcel Deiss, Marc
Kreydenweiss, Schlumberger, Leon Beyer and Dopff Au Moulin.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind the fact that with good riesling, the old ``red
with the meat'' rule becomes meaningless. It may be a white wine,
but a fine Alsatian riesling has the power and the complexity to
match almost any red. The Alsatians are hunters and they love to
pair their wines with game birds, venison and wild boar. They drink
their riesling with regional specialties like choucroute or ham in
parsleyed jelly, with their marvelous local charcuterie and, of
course, with fish.
</P>
<P>
   Most American wine drinkers are still not entirely comfortable
with Alsatian wines, which is a boon to those who are. It means
prices are still reasonable. The great single vineyard rieslings
are very expensive, costing $100 and more a bottle, but there are
very good ones, still, for $10 to $15.

that Dallas is more firmly entrenched. That's because Dallas has a

 By HOWARD MEANS  
 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    Thirty years ago this month at 4:17 and 40 seconds p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on the afternoon of July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11
lunar landing module Eagle touched down on the moon's bone-dry Sea
of Tranquility.
 &HT;    Seconds later, the Eagle's 38-year-old civilian commander, Neil
Armstrong, radioed back to Earth what was to become the second most
memorable broadcast from outer space:
 &HT;    ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
 &HT;    ``Roger, Tranquility,'' came the reply from the NASA mission
headquarters in Texas, ``we copy you on the ground. You've got a
bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a
lot.''
 &HT;    Six and a half hours would pass before Armstrong and Air Force
Col. Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first earthlings to walk on
the moon. As he did so, Armstrong topped his earlier broadcast with
the 11 most famous words ever beamed back from the heavens:
``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
 &HT;    Above them orbited the only hope that Armstrong and Aldrin had
of returning home: the command module Columbia, piloted by Air
Force Col. Michael Collins.
 &HT;    The production values of the lunar broadcast watched that day
and night by hundreds of millions of people were terrible: grainy
black-and-white images delivered by choppy transmission to TV sets
that still weren't all that high in resolution themselves. But for
sheer drama, it was a moment almost impossible to top.
 &HT;    In the Oval Office, Richard Nixon placed a phone call that
traveled through the White House switchboard to the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, and from there to the Space Center in
Houston and via the Goldstone antenna in California to the two
astronauts posed in front of the TV camera they had planted on the
moon:
 &HT;    ``Hello, Neil and Buzz,'' the president began. ``I'm talking to
you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.''
 &HT;    NASA never tired in those days of reminding the public of all
the scientific advances already spun off from the space program:
filtering systems that could remove dust and airborne bacteria from
a command module or an operating room, sensors that were equally
adept at measuring meteorite hits on a spacecraft or muscle tremors
that might signal the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The list
went on and on.
 &HT;    As for future space conquests, the public's imagination didn't
need much stoking _ a lunar base, space labs, space wars, a landing
on Mars. Once you've gotten to the moon, what's to stop you from
going anywhere, doing anything?
 &HT;    What were more fascinating in many ways than the Apollo
program's future science or even its spinoffs were the actual
science and mechanics that went into the Apollo 11 flight. And it
was a triumphal moment for the engineers as well as for the
scientists.
 &HT;    But just in case there were any doubts, it seemed a good idea at
the time to invoke the aid of as many supernatural forces as one
could think of.
 &HT;    Then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had contended for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1968, recalls his son's telling him that
at his Catholic elementary school all the students had been praying
as the Eagle left the command module for the lunar surface, but
nearly all of them had also kept their fingers crossed under their
desks.
 &HT;    ``I think most of us felt that way,'' McCarthy recalls.
 &HT;    In various areas of Washington, D.C., the power went out between
the Eagle's landing on the moon and the historic walk. A summer
thunderstorm had ripped through the area, sending broken limbs
crashing down on power lines.
 &HT;    Susan and Neil Sheehan hurried from their house in suburban
Wesley Heights to Neil's office at the New York Times' Washington
bureau to find a working television: ``Saw Neil Armstrong take
first step on moon!'' Susan Sheehan wrote in her dairy. ``Watched
with Neil and Max Frankel for an hour or two.''
 &HT;    Others had to catch it all on the fly. Current NASA chief
administrator Daniel Goldin was working for the TRW Space and
Technology Group in 1969. He was on his way to Harvard University
when the Eagle touched down.
 &HT;    ``I was changing planes at LaGuardia and everything came to a
halt,'' Goldin says. ``I remember there were many young people at
the airport that day _ people in uniform and people just on their
way. We watched the historic event on a black-and-white television
in the center of the lounge. For those few moments it didn't matter
what else was going on in the world. It felt great to be an
American.''
 &HT;    If the Apollo 11 mission now can be seen as a simple and pure
moment of triumph, it also has to be seen in its own time, and the
end of the 1960s was anything but simple. When and how you saw the
moon landing, and what it meant to you, had a lot to do with which
of the many conflicting realities of the day you happened to
inhabit.
 &HT;    A quick journey through the almanac of 1969 is a tour through a
tortured history. In Nigeria, the Biafran conflict and subsequent
starvation crisis became the first of a decades-long string of
highly publicized famines to sweep Africa. By mid-January more than
half a dozen planes had been hijacked to Cuba, and Cuban air maps
had become standard issue for U.S. commercial pilots.
 &HT;    The Six-Day War was over _ Arab forces had been trounced _ but
terrorism in the Middle East showed no signs of easing. In
February, the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed, under
the leadership of Yasir Arafat; less than six months later, Israeli
jets were striking Egyptian positions.
 &HT;    On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years in a
Tennessee prison after he pleaded guilty to the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., but for blacks that hardly seemed recompense. A
hundred African-American students seized the student union at
Cornell University on April 19.
 &HT;    Three months later, with Command Module Columbia still circling
the moon, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes called out the National Guard to
quell rioting in Columbus after the fatal shooting of a black man
by a white store owner. And then there was the war in Vietnam, and
the war here against the war there.
 &HT;    Alma Powell watched the walk on the moon in an Atlanta hotel
room. Beside her in bed, her husband, Colin, the future chair of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slept like a log, having just flown in
that day from a second tour of duty in Vietnam.
 &HT;    Retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, whose book ``Rocket Boys''
led to the wonderful movie ``October Sky,'' was just back from
Vietnam too when the Eagle set down.
 &HT;    ``I watched the landing in a Fort Lewis, Washington, barracks
television room with Army troops headed for Vietnam the next day,''
Hickam says. ``It was an eerie sensation being there with them,
giving advice on how to survive in Vietnam while we were waiting
for Neil to come down the ladder. ... I felt the irony of being
part of the greatest tragedy of the 1960s while watching one of the
century's greatest triumphs.''
 &HT;    Two years before Apollo 11 lifted off from the Kennedy Space
Center on its way to the moon, Navy pilot John McCain had been shot
down over North Vietnam and interned in the prisoner-of-war camp
known as the Hanoi Hilton.
 &HT;    McCain says he was ``overjoyed'' to learn of the moon landing
``but I didn't find out until two years later.'' McCain's source: a
speech by George McGovern broadcast through the prison camp in
which the Democratic presidential candidate said, ``The U.S. can
land a man on the moon, but it can't end the war.''
 &HT;    ``There were two different American visions colliding,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, who today heads the Foundation on Economic Trends
and who then was coordinating the antiwar Citizens Commission of
Inquiry to investigate ``war crimes'' in Southeast Asia. ``We were
reaching beyond ourselves into outer space at the same time we were
involved in an epic struggle between generations and between
different visions of what the social contract was. The whole planet
was up for grabs.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union, which had begun the space
race a dozen years earlier with the launch of Sputnik I, couldn't
leave the moment alone. The unmanned Soviet probe Luna 15 was in
its 27th orbit around the moon when Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins
arrived for their first orbit. Eventually Luna 15 would crash into
the moon about 500 miles from Tranquility Base.
 &HT;    For the Kennedy family, the Apollo 11 mission would have been a
double-edged sword in any event. The 1960s had begun with President
John F. Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon before the end of
the decade _ an audacious promise that seemed to signal a new,
audacious era.
 &HT;    Now, with only five months to spare, NASA was delivering on that
vow. But Jack Kennedy was dead, murdered five and a half years
earlier. So was brother Bobby, murdered only a little more than a
year before.
 &HT;    The political mantle of the Kennedy clan had fallen to Teddy,
the junior senator from Massachusetts, and the Washington Sunday
Star headline of July 20 speaks volumes: SPACEMEN SET TO LAND ON
MOON, the top headline reads. Just below it in slightly smaller
type is this headline: WOMAN DROWNS, KENNEDY UNINJURED.
 &HT;    For some people, Chappaquiddick Island and Tranquility Base
would be forever linked. Apollo 11 was still two days away from
Earth on July 22 when Ted and Joan Kennedy attended the funeral
service for Mary Jo Kopechne in Larksville, Pa. Photos of the event
show the senator looking broken and impossibly young.
 &HT;    For NASA too, Apollo 11 was a double-edged moment. Nothing could
have gone more perfectly, and because nothing could have, maybe
there was no topping that first manned landing on the moon.
 &HT;    NASA kept sending astronauts back to the moon _ there would be
six more flights in the Apollo series and five more landings on the
moon. But the last landing took place in December 1972, and by then
Americans were less enraptured. The deed had been done, and the
moon, for all its power in literature and the imagination, was an
undramatic place once you got there.
 &HT;    ``Even Walter Cronkite was getting bored,'' McCarthy remembers.
``He had announced at the first landing that the moon was a dead
body, which people had pretty much known at any rate. The second
time, he said it was deader than we thought. The third time, he
said it was even deader still. I guess there was nothing left to
say unless they discovered life on it.''
 &HT;    NASA's audience got tougher too. Many of those who cheered
Apollo 11 had been raised on Buck Rogers, Jules Verne, Superman and
Captain Midnight. Just behind them was a generation differently
conditioned.
 &HT;    The novelist Charles McCarry says that he and his wife, Nancy,
were ``enthralled'' by the moon landing but that their four
children, all under age 10, could not have been less interested:
``Sometime during the night I awoke an realized why: They and the
rest of their generation were the first cyborgs,'' McCarry says.
 &HT;    ``Their minds had been twinned with technology, and what was a
wonder to us was a perfectly ordinary moment for them. Having
watched television from infancy onward, they were used to having
their consciousness projected onto `Gilligan's Island' and beyond
at the flick of a switch. A trip to the moon was no different. They
required no imagination; the electromagnetic spectrum was their
constant companion.''
 &HT;    Not that NASA hasn't had its triumphs in the years since. Probes
sent to the edge of our planetary system and beyond have sent back
striking photos. The space station is a model of science and
international cooperation. Space exploration continues to spin off
high technology with far-ranging applications for life on Earth.
 &HT;    But budget pressures have squeezed the agency, and bureaucracy
seems in danger of stifling the burning curiosity that drove it in
the old days, or so many say. Goldin generally gets high marks for
his leadership, but he's leading a mature agency in a different
age.
 &HT;    Hickam says the secret to reviving the space program lies in the
rocket engine: ``NASA needs to get out of the low-earth orbit
operational business and hand it over swiftly to commercial
interests, and get on with the true exploration of space. To do
that it needs to build big new rocket drives based on fission,
fusion or anti-matter physics.
 &HT;    ``These drives are not science fiction. We can build one or more
of them in 10 years with a dedicated budget and necessary
legislative direction. Such drives will allow NASA to go out to the
moon in hours, to Mars in days. We can conquer, settle and exploit
the solar system with these machines during the next quarter
century.''
 &HT;    Maybe most important, such propulsion systems _ or whatever
other ones scientists might come up with _ would give NASA
something it hasn't had since that evening of July 20, 1969:
something, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, ``commensurate to our
capacity for wonder.''

 By HOWARD MEANS  
 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    Thirty years ago this month at 4:17 and 40 seconds p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on the afternoon of July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11
lunar landing module Eagle touched down on the moon's bone-dry Sea
of Tranquility.
 &HT;    Seconds later, the Eagle's 38-year-old civilian commander, Neil
Armstrong, radioed back to Earth what was to become the second most
memorable broadcast from outer space:
 &HT;    ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
 &HT;    ``Roger, Tranquility,'' came the reply from the NASA mission
headquarters in Texas, ``we copy you on the ground. You've got a
bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a
lot.''
 &HT;    Six and a half hours would pass before Armstrong and Air Force
Col. Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first earthlings to walk on
the moon. As he did so, Armstrong topped his earlier broadcast with
the 11 most famous words ever beamed back from the heavens:
``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
 &HT;    Above them orbited the only hope that Armstrong and Aldrin had
of returning home: the command module Columbia, piloted by Air
Force Col. Michael Collins.
 &HT;    The production values of the lunar broadcast watched that day
and night by hundreds of millions of people were terrible: grainy
black-and-white images delivered by choppy transmission to TV sets
that still weren't all that high in resolution themselves. But for
sheer drama, it was a moment almost impossible to top.
 &HT;    In the Oval Office, Richard Nixon placed a phone call that
traveled through the White House switchboard to the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, and from there to the Space Center in
Houston and via the Goldstone antenna in California to the two
astronauts posed in front of the TV camera they had planted on the
moon:
 &HT;    ``Hello, Neil and Buzz,'' the president began. ``I'm talking to
you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.''
 &HT;    NASA never tired in those days of reminding the public of all
the scientific advances already spun off from the space program:
filtering systems that could remove dust and airborne bacteria from
a command module or an operating room, sensors that were equally
adept at measuring meteorite hits on a spacecraft or muscle tremors
that might signal the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The list
went on and on.
 &HT;    As for future space conquests, the public's imagination didn't
need much stoking _ a lunar base, space labs, space wars, a landing
on Mars. Once you've gotten to the moon, what's to stop you from
going anywhere, doing anything?
 &HT;    What were more fascinating in many ways than the Apollo
program's future science or even its spinoffs were the actual
science and mechanics that went into the Apollo 11 flight. And it
was a triumphal moment for the engineers as well as for the
scientists.
 &HT;    But just in case there were any doubts, it seemed a good idea at
the time to invoke the aid of as many supernatural forces as one
could think of.
 &HT;    Then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had contended for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1968, recalls his son's telling him that
at his Catholic elementary school all the students had been praying
as the Eagle left the command module for the lunar surface, but
nearly all of them had also kept their fingers crossed under their
desks.
 &HT;    ``I think most of us felt that way,'' McCarthy recalls.
 &HT;    In various areas of Washington, D.C., the power went out between
the Eagle's landing on the moon and the historic walk. A summer
thunderstorm had ripped through the area, sending broken limbs
crashing down on power lines.
 &HT;    Susan and Neil Sheehan hurried from their house in suburban
Wesley Heights to Neil's office at the New York Times' Washington
bureau to find a working television: ``Saw Neil Armstrong take
first step on moon!'' Susan Sheehan wrote in her dairy. ``Watched
with Neil and Max Frankel for an hour or two.''
 &HT;    Others had to catch it all on the fly. Current NASA chief
administrator Daniel Goldin was working for the TRW Space and
Technology Group in 1969. He was on his way to Harvard University
when the Eagle touched down.
 &HT;    ``I was changing planes at LaGuardia and everything came to a
halt,'' Goldin says. ``I remember there were many young people at
the airport that day _ people in uniform and people just on their
way. We watched the historic event on a black-and-white television
in the center of the lounge. For those few moments it didn't matter
what else was going on in the world. It felt great to be an
American.''
 &HT;    If the Apollo 11 mission now can be seen as a simple and pure
moment of triumph, it also has to be seen in its own time, and the
end of the 1960s was anything but simple. When and how you saw the
moon landing, and what it meant to you, had a lot to do with which
of the many conflicting realities of the day you happened to
inhabit.
 &HT;    A quick journey through the almanac of 1969 is a tour through a
tortured history. In Nigeria, the Biafran conflict and subsequent
starvation crisis became the first of a decades-long string of
highly publicized famines to sweep Africa. By mid-January more than
half a dozen planes had been hijacked to Cuba, and Cuban air maps
had become standard issue for U.S. commercial pilots.
 &HT;    The Six-Day War was over _ Arab forces had been trounced _ but
terrorism in the Middle East showed no signs of easing. In
February, the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed, under
the leadership of Yasir Arafat; less than six months later, Israeli
jets were striking Egyptian positions.
 &HT;    On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years in a
Tennessee prison after he pleaded guilty to the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., but for blacks that hardly seemed recompense. A
hundred African-American students seized the student union at
Cornell University on April 19.
 &HT;    Three months later, with Command Module Columbia still circling
the moon, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes called out the National Guard to
quell rioting in Columbus after the fatal shooting of a black man
by a white store owner. And then there was the war in Vietnam, and
the war here against the war there.
 &HT;    Alma Powell watched the walk on the moon in an Atlanta hotel
room. Beside her in bed, her husband, Colin, the future chair of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slept like a log, having just flown in
that day from a second tour of duty in Vietnam.
 &HT;    Retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, whose book ``Rocket Boys''
led to the wonderful movie ``October Sky,'' was just back from
Vietnam too when the Eagle set down.
 &HT;    ``I watched the landing in a Fort Lewis, Washington, barracks
television room with Army troops headed for Vietnam the next day,''
Hickam says. ``It was an eerie sensation being there with them,
giving advice on how to survive in Vietnam while we were waiting
for Neil to come down the ladder. ... I felt the irony of being
part of the greatest tragedy of the 1960s while watching one of the
century's greatest triumphs.''
 &HT;    Two years before Apollo 11 lifted off from the Kennedy Space
Center on its way to the moon, Navy pilot John McCain had been shot
down over North Vietnam and interned in the prisoner-of-war camp
known as the Hanoi Hilton.
 &HT;    McCain says he was ``overjoyed'' to learn of the moon landing
``but I didn't find out until two years later.'' McCain's source: a
speech by George McGovern broadcast through the prison camp in
which the Democratic presidential candidate said, ``The U.S. can
land a man on the moon, but it can't end the war.''
 &HT;    ``There were two different American visions colliding,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, who today heads the Foundation on Economic Trends
and who then was coordinating the antiwar Citizens Commission of
Inquiry to investigate ``war crimes'' in Southeast Asia. ``We were
reaching beyond ourselves into outer space at the same time we were
involved in an epic struggle between generations and between
different visions of what the social contract was. The whole planet
was up for grabs.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union, which had begun the space
race a dozen years earlier with the launch of Sputnik I, couldn't
leave the moment alone. The unmanned Soviet probe Luna 15 was in
its 27th orbit around the moon when Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins
arrived for their first orbit. Eventually Luna 15 would crash into
the moon about 500 miles from Tranquility Base.
 &HT;    For the Kennedy family, the Apollo 11 mission would have been a
double-edged sword in any event. The 1960s had begun with President
John F. Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon before the end of
the decade _ an audacious promise that seemed to signal a new,
audacious era.
 &HT;    Now, with only five months to spare, NASA was delivering on that
vow. But Jack Kennedy was dead, murdered five and a half years
earlier. So was brother Bobby, murdered only a little more than a
year before.
 &HT;    The political mantle of the Kennedy clan had fallen to Teddy,
the junior senator from Massachusetts, and the Washington Sunday
Star headline of July 20 speaks volumes: SPACEMEN SET TO LAND ON
MOON, the top headline reads. Just below it in slightly smaller
type is this headline: WOMAN DROWNS, KENNEDY UNINJURED.
 &HT;    For some people, Chappaquiddick Island and Tranquility Base
would be forever linked. Apollo 11 was still two days away from
Earth on July 22 when Ted and Joan Kennedy attended the funeral
service for Mary Jo Kopechne in Larksville, Pa. Photos of the event
show the senator looking broken and impossibly young.
 &HT;    For NASA too, Apollo 11 was a double-edged moment. Nothing could
have gone more perfectly, and because nothing could have, maybe
there was no topping that first manned landing on the moon.
 &HT;    NASA kept sending astronauts back to the moon _ there would be
six more flights in the Apollo series and five more landings on the
moon. But the last landing took place in December 1972, and by then
Americans were less enraptured. The deed had been done, and the
moon, for all its power in literature and the imagination, was an
undramatic place once you got there.
 &HT;    ``Even Walter Cronkite was getting bored,'' McCarthy remembers.
``He had announced at the first landing that the moon was a dead
body, which people had pretty much known at any rate. The second
time, he said it was deader than we thought. The third time, he
said it was even deader still. I guess there was nothing left to
say unless they discovered life on it.''
 &HT;    NASA's audience got tougher too. Many of those who cheered
Apollo 11 had been raised on Buck Rogers, Jules Verne, Superman and
Captain Midnight. Just behind them was a generation differently
conditioned.
 &HT;    The novelist Charles McCarry says that he and his wife, Nancy,
were ``enthralled'' by the moon landing but that their four
children, all under age 10, could not have been less interested:
``Sometime during the night I awoke and realized why: They and the

 By PETER BOGDANOVICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    After Stanley Kubrick died in his sleep of a heart attack on
March 7, even the New York tabloids reported the news with an
auteur slant, headlining the director's generally bleak view of
life. Words like ``secretive,'' ``reclusive,'' ``strange,''
``mysterious'' and ``cold'' were repeatedly used to describe him.
It's true that the 13 feature-length films he made over 40 years
present a disenchanted, sardonic and generally pessimistic view of
humanity, but the lifelong friends, intimate associates and family
members I spoke to conjure a far more complicated picture of a man
who could be deeply reserved but also outgoing, meticulous and laid
back, loving and self-absorbed.
 &HT;    The precocious son of a Bronx, N.Y., doctor, Kubrick became a
staff photographer for Look magazine at 17, but from the start he
was captivated by the movies. He began as a kind of one-man band,
financing, directing, producing, writing, shooting and editing
three short documentaries _ ``Day of the Fight'' (1950), ``Flying
Padre'' (1951) and ``The Seafarers'' (1953) _ and then doing
virtually the same thing for his first two extremely low-budget
features, ``Fear and Desire'' (1953), backed entirely by an uncle,
and ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955).
 &HT;    In 1954, having already run through two marriages, Kubrick moved
to Los Angeles and formed a production company with his friend
James B. Harris, through which he made his first two professional
pictures, the film noir ``The Killing'' (1956), with Sterling
Hayden, and the powerful antiwar drama ``Paths of Glory'' (1957),
starring Kirk Douglas. While shooting ``Paths of Glory'' Kubrick
fell in love with and wed the German painter and actress Christiane
Harlan, with whom he would rear two daughters along with
Christiane's young daughter from an earlier marriage.
 &HT;    ``The Killing'' and ''Paths of Glory'' did not make money, but
they did make Kubrick's reputation as a budding genius among
critics and studio executives. In 1960, Kirk Douglas hired Kubrick
to replace another director on ``Spartacus,'' the only
all-Hollywood production Kubrick would ever make, and his first
box-office success.
 &HT;    He hated the experience. Disenchanted with the industry and
having developed a phobia about flying, the director soon afterward
moved with his family to England, never again to travel far from
home.
 &HT;    Over the next 38 years, he made only eight more films. Between
his controversial adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's notorious
``Lolita'' (1962) and his grim but popular Vietnam war film, ``Full
Metal Jacket'' (1987), Kubrick achieved a kind of mythic status in
world cinema with three hugely successful pictures: his black
comedy of the Cold War, ``Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964), the mystical science-fiction
saga ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968) and his ultraviolent
investigation of violence, ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), based on
Anthony Burgess' novel.
 &HT;    (While ``Clockwork'' won the New York Film Critics Circle Award
for best picture, it was wildly criticized in England for inspiring
copycat crimes. Kubrick, wounded by the attacks, withdrew it from
circulation in the UK; to date, it is not available there even on
video.)
 &HT;    The gigantic and enduring box-office appeal and critical
enshrinement of these three films, coupled with the slimness of his
output and his distance _ physical and emotional _ from the
Hollywood mainstream, fueled a kind of legendary aura of integrity
and perfectionism that gave Kubrick enormous power in the industry
he avoided. Still, he was troubled by the fact that ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), his costume drama adapted from Thackeray, though
much admired in certain quarters, did not have a box-office
response commensurate with its cost.
 &HT;    His next work was his most openly commercial: ``The Shining''
(1980), based on a Stephen King horror novel and headlining a major
star, Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    When he died, at 70, he had just completed ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
based on Arthur Schnitzler's ``Dream Story,'' a project he had been
thinking about for more than 30 years. The film, which deals
candidly with sexual relations between a contemporary New York
married couple, played by the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, opens in the United States July 16.
 &HT;    I cannot say I knew Kubrick, though we spoke briefly on the
phone two or three times in the early '70s. He was preparing to
shoot ``Barry Lyndon'' and he called me out of the blue. His voice
sounded extremely youthful, with a subdued but definite Bronx
accent and a kind of reticence and self-effacement that was
disarming.
 &HT;    He asked what I thought about Ryan O'Neal, whom I had directed
in ``What's Up, Doc?'' Kubrick's young daughters were fans of the
movie and now were lobbying their father to cast O'Neal in ``Barry
Lyndon.'' Even in that brief exchange, Kubrick's obsessions _ film
and family _ were twinned. They would remain that way until the
end.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW MODINE (actor; lead role in ``Full Metal Jacket''): One
day I said: ``I got a joke for you. ... You're dead.'' He said,
``It's not funny.'' I said: ``Let me tell the joke. Steven
Spielberg's dead too.'' He said, ``Steven's dead, oh, that's
funny.'' And I said: ``You're dead and you're up in heaven and
Steven Spielberg has just died and he's being greeted at the gate
by Gabriel and Gabriel says: 'God's really dug a lot of your movies
and he wants to make sure that you're comfortable. If there's
anything you need, you come to me, I'm your man.' And Steven says,
'Well, you know, I always wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick, do you
think you could arrange that?' And Gabriel looks at him and says:
'You know, Steven, of all the things that you could ask for, why
would you ask for that? You know that Stanley doesn't take
meetings.' He says, 'Well, you said that if there was anything I
wanted.' Gabriel says: 'I'm really sorry. I can't do that.' So now
he's showing him around heaven and Steven sees this guy wearing an
Army jacket with a beard riding a bicycle. And Steven says to
Gabriel: 'Oh, my God, look, over there, that's Stanley Kubrick.
Couldn't we just stop him and say hello?' And Gabriel pulls Steven
to the side and says, 'That's not Stanley Kubrick; that's God _ he
just thinks he's Stanley Kubrick.' `` Stanley liked that joke.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RICHARD ANDERSON (actor; producer; dialogue coach and actor on
``Paths of Glory''): He had dark circles under his eyes, his hair
all over the place. Stanley was a pro at chess _ he'd sit down and
play chess on the set. He was very interested in people's motives,
people's psyches. ... One time when Kirk Douglas blew up at him on
the set, Stanley said, ``Jeez, Kirk, you don't have to do this in
front of everybody, do you?'' But he admired Kirk. He said, ``My
God, this guy always knows his lines.''
 &HT;    Stanley is very psychological to get what he wants. One time he
had done about 40 takes and Jimmy Harris (Kubrick's producing
partner on ``Paths of Glory'' and other films) comes and says,
``Stanley, it's now 1 o'clock and we're in terrible trouble and we
gotta break this up.''
 &HT;    That was the only time I saw Stanley go nuts. He shouted, ''It
isn't right _ and I'm going to keep doing it until it is right!''
He shot 84 takes. I think he wanted everybody to hear that _ he
wanted it to get around.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TONY CURTIS (actor; co-star of ``Spartacus''): Stanley would
never capitulate. I remember he asked for 15 or 20 extras for a
little scene and the assistant director came over and said they had
talked it over (with the studio) and decided to cut down the amount
of extras. And Stanley said, ``No, we'll double the amount.'' He
refused to allow anybody to tell him how to do the picture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SHELLEY WINTERS (actress; co-star of ``Lolita''): He was very
cognizant that actors are delicate. He would discuss the scene with
you and you never thought you were being directed until you saw the
rushes the next day. You almost said, ``Gee, wasn't I clever to
think of that?'' But it was Stanley who had sort of planted it very
subtly in your head. Like the dance I did with James Mason _ a sexy
sort of South American dance _ he didn't really tell me to make a
sexy dance. I decided to flirt with him while I was dancing in a
sexy way and he said, ``That's it.'' He was very elusive. Sometimes
you might rehearse and you didn't even know he was watching. He'd
be off somewhere, sort of hidden, watching.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEN ADAM (production designer; designed ``Dr. Strangelove'' and
``Barry Lyndon''): I don't think I ever had such a close
relationship with a director. There was a certain naivete and charm
about him, but you very quickly found out that there was an
enormous brain functioning. I think the most difficult part was his
questioning, almost computerlike, mind. He knew most of the
technicians' work better than the technicians themselves. ...
 &HT;    He very often changed his mind. After two days of shooting, for
example, he wasn't happy with Peter Sellers playing the B-52
bomber-captain (in addition to his other roles) and he cast Slim
Pickens instead and then decided to have him ride the atomic bomb
bronco-fashion into the Russian missile complex. It was a very
exciting experience, but at the same time, I felt, you know, one
film would be enough. Being exposed to Stanley 16 hours a day, you
lost your resistance, and the danger was you would lose your
confidence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAMES EARL JONES (actor; small role in ``Dr. Strangelove''): His
manner was casual. Very, very laid back. Chewed gum. Cool. One day
he got pissed off at me when I didn't know my lines. I had missed a
section I was supposed to memorize. He said: ``You don't know these
words? Why don't you know these words?'' It was a quiet pissed, but
he was pissed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JOHN MILIUS (director, screenwriter, producer): When he did
``Dr. Strangelove,'' the Air Force contacted him afterward and all
the big shots of Strategic Air Command, and General Le May, wanted
to talk to him. And he was afraid of going to see them. He was
afraid they'd be angry with him _ that they would do something to
him. I said: ``Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They
wanted to honor you. They loved 'Dr. Strangelove.' `` He said: ``I
know it's crazy. I wish I'd gone to Washington and seen them.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEIR DULLEA (actor; co-star of ``2001''): I was always aware
that he knew exactly what he wanted. He would invite (me) to have
dinner at his beautiful home. And he would invite a lot of other
people from all walks of life and different disciplines _ art
historians, authors and intellectuals. And he was as informed as
anybody about their disciplines. ... If Stanley had been an
octopus, with that many arms, he would have held his own camera,
done his own makeup, built his own sets. But I had a feeling he
wouldn't have acted in his own films.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAN HARLAN (producer; Kubrick's brother-in-law; production
assistant on ``A Clockwork Orange''): He felt very misunderstood
about (the violent, negative reactions to) ``Clockwork Orange,''
very insulted.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILIUS: He was very vulnerable to criticism or to whether a
movie was a success or not. He wasn't completely comfortable with
``Barry Lyndon.'' He just felt that people didn't understand it.
People were bored by it. I think after that picture he felt no one
was going to let him make a film again. Apparently the only thing
that really bothered him a great deal was that ''Barry Lyndon''
failed commercially. He made ``The Shining'' after that. Nicholson,
I remember, at the time said: ``I'm glad to be off that one. That
was rough duty.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: People always think he was this idiotic
dictator. He was always asking everyone's opinion on most things.
What do you think of this? What do you think of that? Do you think
I should have done this different? He spread his palette of ideas
for everyone to have a pick at, and would dismiss you brutally if
he thought that what you said was really irritating.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LEE ERMEY (Vietnam Marine Corps veteran; technical adviser,
script consultant, actor on ``Full Metal Jacket''): Stanley told me
he didn't understand actors. He had no actor friends _ they were
basically working associates, and he thought they were a little bit
strange, totally spoiled and in most cases had to be begged to give
him a decent performance. Half the time the actor would argue with
him.
 &HT;    Vince D'Onofrio didn't like Stanley's ``craziness look.'' He
wanted to try it some other way. The problem with Vince was this
was his first film, and he's telling Stanley Kubrick how he thinks
this look should be. They stand there arguing. Stanley finally
said, ``Look, do it my way and we'll load back up and we'll shoot
it your way.'' Well, when they shot it Vince's way they didn't have
any film in the camera.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MODINE: I once asked him why he so often did a lot of takes. He
said it was because actors didn't know their lines. And he talked
about Jack Nicholson: ``Jack would come in during the blocking and
he kind of fumbled through the lines. He'd be learning them while
he was there. And then you'd start shooting and after take 3 or
take 4 or take 5 you'd get the Jack Nicholson that everybody knows
and most directors would be happy with. And then you'd go up to 10
or 15 and he'd be really awful and then he'd start to understand
what the lines were, what the lines meant, and then he'd become
unconscious about what he was saying. So by take 30 or take 40 the
lines became something else.'' Stanley'd say: ``I don't know how to
do it. People don't do their homework, the only thing I can do is
spend time doing multiple takes while the people are learning what
their job is supposed to be.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: He thought it was boring away from home. He
liked all his stuff around him, all his telephones and televisions
and fax machines. Also, we have a zoo. We have a lot of animals and
he liked those and he liked the children and later the
grandchildren. He liked being at home. But not like a hermit _ he
had lots of friends _ they just weren't in the film business. He
talked to everyone _ he just didn't talk to the press.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SYDNEY POLLACK (director, producer, actor; phone relationship
with Kubrick since early '70s; featured role in ``Eyes Wide
Shut''): My initial take on my part (in ``Eyes Wide Shut'') was
very different from what Stanley wanted. I came in with the idea of
being tougher with the character of Tom (Cruise) because he had
done something that I disapproved of strongly. And then Stanley had
an idea of my wanting to manipulate him more and therefore be
kinder, and he was very specific about how to communicate that. He
knew I was another director - he didn't have to beat around the
bush. He wasn't trying to work any psychological tricks with me.
And he was crazy about both Tom and Nicole.
 &HT;    I always think of Stanley literally on the edge of a smile. His
eyes always had mischief in them. He always had this sense of the
devil in him while he was very calmly asking questions. He read
everything, and knew absolutely all aspects of the business,
including literally what the box-office receipts of every theater
in the world were over the past few years. ...
 &HT;    Cruise woke me up on Thursday morning to tell me how great he
thought the picture was. I called Stanley and we talked for an hour
and a half or so and I told him how thrilled Tom was. Then I spoke
with Terry and Bob (Daly, co-chairman of Warner Brothers) and they
were absolutely ecstatic, and four days later he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STEVE SOUTHGATE: ....... Two days before he died, he sent me
over to Las Vegas with the first trailer of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' for
the Sho West convention. As it was the first time ever that anyone
was going to see anything from the movie, he wanted to make sure
that the projection was perfect. He gave me specific instructions:
We had to clear the room at 3 o'clock in the morning, make sure
everybody was gone and just the projectionist and I rehearsed it.
The last conversation I had was: ``I trust you to go and do this in
Vegas. Let me know how everybody reacts. Ring me during the
screening _ take your mobile phone _ I want to hear what the
reaction is.'' And while I was on the plane, he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: I thought he was awfully tired, and he never
slept much _ ever _ in his whole life. Then I thought he was really
overdoing it with this last film. Sleeping less and less. He also
was a doctor's son and he wouldn't see a doctor. He gave himself
his own medicine if he wasn't feeling well or he would phone
friends _ it was the one thing he did that I thought was really
stupid.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POLLACK: People say he had these phobias, he wouldn't go here
and wouldn't go there. The truth is he lived in a paradise _ there
wasn't any reason for him to go anywhere. It was a kind of a
heaven.

 RIDING the BUBBLE of the INTERNET BOOM

publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the
rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For a homeless shelter's annual charity auction not long ago,
Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist, donated a breakfast with
himself at Buck's Restaurant.
 &HT;    Buck's is a bustling diner in Woodside, Calif., a
single-intersection hamlet nestled into an oak grove at the base of
the San Mateo County foothills. The booths at Buck's are
upholstered in ocher Naugahyde and the menus have the feel of
political-action newsletters and the owners are mighty proud of
their coffeecake.
 &HT;    Buck's also happens to be the place where Netscape and many
other high-tech companies were hatched.
 &HT;    ``Breakfast at Buck's'' was sold off by way of the Internet site
Ebay at the end of February; 78 bids after the auction started, a
budding Manhattan entrepreneur named Mark Hernandez offered to pay
$4,400 for the privilege of flying out to Silicon Valley two weeks
later to present his business idea.
 &HT;    That might sound like a lot of money to have breakfast with
someone, but Jurvetson is a venture capitalist with a reputation _
young, enthusiastic, open-minded.
 &HT;    He can be found at Buck's most mornings. He bounds in like a
kangaroo, exuberant, flashing a joyous smile, his youthful face
tanned from his noon-hour games of ultimate Frisbee.
 &HT;    He is generally more dapper than his colleagues, wearing a
charcoal Czechoslovakian hand-made suit over a cobalt shirt with
faint royal blue pin-stripes. His tie picks up these colors
perfectly; the black wing tips on his large feet shine. In the
plastic window of his wallet is the bridal portrait of his wife of
eight years, Karla, who is a psychiatrist at Stanford.
 &HT;    He has a prototypical resume for a Silicon Valley VC: earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford, designed microchips
at Hewlett-Packard, learned management consulting at Bain &AMP; Co.,
returned to Stanford for his MBA and then beat out 250 other
applicants for a position at Draper Fisher, the venture firm.
 &HT;    Prototypical resume, except for the date column: As an
undergrad, he tricked the registration computer _ which blocked
signing up for more than 20 units _ by penciling in just two units
of credit on what were five-unit classes. In this way, he was able
to take eight classes at once and finish in two and a half years
with an A-plus average.
 &HT;    Think that's fast? The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is
that it takes three years to learn the craft. Jurvetson made
partner in six months. He was 28.
 &HT;    Venture capitalists' favorite unit of measurement is the factor
X. They live life on multiplication scale, and anything less than X
is inconsequential. When they invest, they ignore 12 percent or 15
percent or 18 percent returns. They start to take notice when they
see potential for 10X returns.
 &HT;    In this lingo, Jurvetson blasted through college at nearly 2X
the normal rate, and made partner at 6X speed. Now he's
accelerating _ straight into what could be a precarious stretch of
road.
 &HT;    Only 32, Jurvetson is in for the summer of his life, with no
fewer than 11 of the Internet-related companies he has backed (Wit
Capital, Goto.com, Tumbleweed and Netzero among them) at various
points along the road to an initial public offering.
 &HT;    The brand name he has built for himself with investments in a
couple of other successful Internet start-ups _ his firm's
specialty and the hottest destination for venture capital _ will be
put to the test. That's because the market's taste for Internet
stocks appears to have soured.
 &HT;    Dave Marquart, a Silicon Valley veteran who was the only venture
investor in Microsoft and the co-lead investor of Sun Microsystems,
warns: ``To be a bona fide venture capitalist, you have to go
through a complete cycle. Those who've entered the business since
the mid-'90s have never seen a down cycle. Everything has been to
the right and up _ very up.''
 &HT;    To understand why Jurvetson is a folk hero for so many of those
looking to convert their dreams and visions into Net wealth,
consider what happened in February 1996.
 &HT;    Sabeer Bhatia was an immigrant from India with zero experience
running a company, zero experience in consumer products and zero
experience in software. (He had been a hardware engineer at Apple.)
He was Jurvetson's age less two years, or J - 2. Bhatia had already
been turned down by 21 other venture capital firms. He had produced
no prototype, not even a graphic printed on a piece of paper.
 &HT;    What he did have was what Jurvetson called ``hallucinogenic
optimism'' and one intriguing idea, which he sketched out on a
conference room white board.
 &HT;    Jurvetson invested $300,000 to buy 15 percent of the project.
Less than two years later, the company that emerged from that
meeting, Hotmail, was sold to Microsoft for $400 million. Jurvetson
became an instant legend, the guy every young entrepreneur wants to
meet, even if it means paying 250X the cost of breakfast at Buck's.
 &HT;    Increasingly, successful venture capital firms are sheltering
themselves from the hail of unsolicited business plans by invoking
the Inverse Rule of Referrals: All good ideas come by referral, so
if it didn't come by referral it must not be a good idea.
 &HT;    Here's how a typical venture firm might catalogue the incoming
slough. Administrative staff scans the first paragraph of the cover
letter for a referral by a ``trusted third party,'' which is
entered in a database. Partners scan the database; they'll look at
the plan only if they trust the referral.
 &HT;    But Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson has cultivated a reputation for
ignoring that rule. The firm is located in Seaport, a sailing
harbor in Redwood City _ psychologically far from VC ground zero,
Sand Hill Road (but close enough to zip there in 10 minutes for a
meeting).
 &HT;    The problem with referral networks, as DFJ sees it, is that as
the venture capitalists age, so does their referral network,
cutting them off from the original thinkers. At DFJ they say they
read every one of the 5,000 plans sent to them each year. Theirs
was the first venture capital firm to run an advertisement.
 &HT;    DFJ is a ``seed'' firm, meaning it gets in on the first round of
financing for nascent businesses. ``Getting companies started is
the hardest part,'' says Tim Draper, the firm's founder, ``and it's
the most rewarding _ both financially and personally.''
 &HT;    To Jurvetson, it's even more rewarding than being an
entrepreneur. ``I get bits and pieces of several success stories,
sort of a highlight reel,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jurvetson has succeeded so far by making himself accessible to
the kind of young people who he figures come up with unusual ideas
_ as opposed to what the industry calls ``Me, Too'' product. One
recent month's ``Me, Too'' was on-line gift registries. He saw 30
business plans on that concept. The month before, it was
Web-calendar companies. He saw three Web-calendar plans out of Sun
Microsystems' employees alone.
 &HT;    Having lunch in San Francisco one day, he bumped into an old
friend who said he had left Netscape to found his dream start-up;
without much tact, Jurvetson jokingly blurted out, ``I hope it's
not another Web-calendar company!'' His friend's face fell. They
always think they're the only ones with the idea.
 &HT;    ``Truly original thinkers tend not to be entrepreneurs who've
spent 10 years at Cisco and can be trusted to know what they're
doing,'' Jurvetson explains. ``They tend to be 26 years old and
highflying. They often have a very childlike mind, with some
naivete. We're impressed by people who don't know what can't be
done.''
 &HT;    Just as the wild success of venture capital firms has made them
magnets for business plans, it has made them extremely popular with
fund investors (which tend to be pension plans, university
endowments and insurance companies). At a typical VC firm, money
under active management has gone up 40X; the number of partners to
manage that money has gone up only 4X. It's now common to raise
$350 million to $500 million every couple of years.
 &HT;    When Draper Fisher Jurvetson mailed out prospectuses for its
most recent fund, the firm received 3X the pledges it needed. The
partners drew the line at $180 million _ but even that is a huge
sum to deploy among early-stage firms, and easily the biggest fund
DFJ had ever raised.
 &HT;    VC firms have a fat incentive to raise more and more money,
because they get paid in two ways. First, when investors in a
specific fund are paid back after a set period of time has elapsed
(typically 10 years), the venture firm keeps 20 percent of all the
profits. Second is the gravy train: a 2.5 percent annual management
fee paid by investors, regardless of performance.
 &HT;    To deal with all the incoming money, most firms are ratcheting
up the size of investments, especially on secondary rounds, when a
company that has survived the seed stage needs large cash
infusions.
 &HT;    That means sticking with start-ups that have a high likelihood
of growing not just big but gargantuan, with billions of dollars in
annual sales. The Amazon of pharmacies, the Amazon of insurance,
the Amazon of auto parts _ consumer markets so big that even a
small slice of them guarantees a stellar payoff. They're not really
start-ups, they're bulk-ups. They put on weight fast and flex their
muscles and try to scare competitors off the beach.
 &HT;    But as Jurvetson sees it, something has been forgotten in this
process. Sure, it's cool to make so much money. And sure, it's cool
to be able to buy hair dye and condoms from the privacy of home.
But on-line superstores aren't creating new markets, and though
they might evolve the technology of E-commerce, they're not
revolutionizing it. They're just big Web sites. Where's the
adventure in that kind of venture?
 &HT;    Seed investing requires a special kind of hunger. Jurvetson's
parents were immigrants from Estonia, and he was reared in Dallas
by the creed that what he was to make of his life was entirely up
to him; there were no entitlements.
 &HT;    In an undergraduate psychology class, he answered a series of
Enneagram questions meant to divine his character type. He so fit
the description of a Type 3, the Performer (as in star performer),
that he was asked back in following semesters to lecture about the
traits of Type 3's: tremendous need for achievement, with an inner
drive to do something beyond the ordinary.
 &HT;    That drive is why he belongs dead center in the creation zone of
the new economy: where there's constantly a new goal to keep him
from getting bored, and where he has all of Silicon Valley as an
audience to perform for.
 &HT;    He seems very similar in character to the headstrong young
entrepreneurs he deals with, and perhaps that is partly why they
mind-meld with him so well.
 &HT;    At no time was this more clear than the day he drove across the
Dunbarton Bridge to meet Joe Chen, the CEO of a very new start-up,
See U There.com. Chen had 12 employees working in the living and
dining rooms of his Union City home. Jurvetson admits he's a sucker
for this kind of raw fertile atmosphere, and he grooved on it for a
while that day, talking to the employees and soaking up their
ambitious energy.
 &HT;    The whole point of money is that it's transferable legal tender,
that it retains its value no matter who possesses it _ your million
dollars is just as valuable as my million dollars. With venture
capital, that's not always the case.
 &HT;    Chen already had two other venture firms ready to give him the
million dollars he needed.
 &HT;    ``Literally, they are screaming at us, asking when we are going
to close the deal,'' Chen explained as we sat down at his
conference table in the garage. But he would rather have
Jurvetson's million dollars. His pitch: a plan to build an Internet
site to capture the largely untapped $60 billion market for event
planning. Jurvetson seemed inclined to invest (and two days later,
did).
 &HT;    Chen is J + 1 years old. He wanted Jurvetson's technical
fluency, but also a certain kind of cultural chemistry _ the
difference between working with someone who is just like your
father and working with someone who is just like you. As Chen puts
it, ``He's not some stiff suit walking in here.''
 &HT;    ``The hotmail story reached us even in Singapore,'' says
Eng-Siong Tan, the CEO of a start-up called Third Voice. Tan is J +
4 years old. ``It resonated and became part of the folklore of the
valley that he was willing to invest where 21 other firms had
passed. We knew Steve would be someone who gets our idea.''
 &HT;    Tan and eight other Singaporean engineers uprooted and came here
cold. They crammed into a cement-block storage warehouse in Foster
City, their front door an aluminum roll-up gate. In November, Tan
pitched Jurvetson.
 &HT;    Third Voice would make software that allows users to post
comments, viewable only by other users, directly onto the front
page of any Web site. It's the Web equivalent of empowering people
to spray-paint the State Capital. Jurvetson got it: This could do
to on-line chat what Ebay did to classified ads.
 &HT;    Internet companies are like Bazooka bubble gum. It takes a lot
of chewing and manipulation _ a tremendous amount of effort _ to
get the first bubble started. Then, with the slightest additional
effort, a mere exhale, it expands 100X. For a while it's customary
to double in size every month. That's what Tan is about to go
through. He's ready to exhale.
 &HT;    The first of Jurvetson's 11 IPO-bound companies _ Wit Capital,
an Internet investment bank _ went public early in June, right on
the heals of a disastrous week for Internet stocks. In late May,
Juno Online and Ziplink not only failed to post triple-digit
first-day returns, they both dropped below the offering price. Two
other IPOs were postponed.
 &HT;    Suddenly the center of the Internet boom seemed to a lot of
people like a scary place to be. But Wit went out and and finished
its first day up 85 percent _ a figure that would have been a
disappointment just months before, but now looked strong. And
Jurvetson sounded as chipper as ever.
 &HT;    Yes, some of the insane pops of early 1999 probably won't be
back, but Jurvetson says that only means offerings are being priced
more fairly and supply and demand are synching up. But the Internet
is the economy, he insists; businesses that still think it's just a
fad are in denial.
 &HT;    Of his IPO-bound companies, only one is considering putting off
its public offering by a quarter, he adds, and there is nothing in
his voice to suggest fear or unease about the future. That's what
the Type 3 description doesn't capture: This is a guy having time
of his life. The default setting on his face is a birthday-boy
smile.
 &HT;    And why not? ``I get to have the Steve Jobses of the next
century come to me and make their pitch. I can't define a better
recreation activity, let alone a job, that would be better than
that.''

 By MARGARET TALBOT  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The woman waiting for her abortion is 20 years old, a college
student, wan and pretty, with long black hair and glasses. She
arrives for her appointment promptly at 10 a.m., neatly dressed in
pressed jeans and loafers, but her voice is shaking a little when
she signs in at the front desk and her shoulders stay hunched, in
what might be shyness or self-protection.
 &HT;    She follows the nurse-practitioner into the examining room and
lies down without being asked.
 &HT;    During the exam, she winces and cries, making hardly a sound.
But afterward, sitting up, her fingers laced together in her lap,
she is almost talkative.
 &HT;    ``Did you think about maybe keeping the baby or giving it up for
adoption?'' the nurse-practitioner asks kindly.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' says the young woman, ``but I knew I didn't want to do
that. My parents are having all kinds of financial difficulties. I
know they'd want me to finish school.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says, her voice a little stronger now, though her
sentences still end in that questioning upward lilt of late
adolescence, ``I want to finish school. I don't want to work in a
7-Eleven all my life.'' And, after a long pause: ``I want to have
kids someday, but I want to be able to take care of them so they
won't be miserable.''
 &HT;    When the nurse asks if she has been using birth control, she
says yes, she's on the pill, but she doesn't take it all that
regularly. ``My boyfriend and I want to try that injection _
Depo-Provera? _ 'cause the pill makes me sick.''
 &HT;    So far, there is nothing especially unusual about the young
woman's story. What is unusual is the kind of abortion she will
have today. For quite personal reasons, she has opted for a new
method with enormous political consequences.
 &HT;    At 10:30 a.m., she sits down with a counselor, a chatty
ex-schoolteacher, to hear about the procedure she is about to
undertake as part of a clinical trial. Then a nurse guides her into
another room, points her to the only chair and gives her a cup of
water and a tablet of mifepristone _ better known as RU-486, or the
French abortion pill.
 &HT;    ``Here goes!'' the young woman says. She knows there is no
turning back once she takes the pill. It will begin to work right
away, blocking the effects of her body's progesterone, a hormone
needed for the fertilized egg to sustain itself in the wall of her
uterus.
 &HT;    Looking calmer now, she grabs her backpack and heads downstairs
to find her boyfriend, who has been waiting for her in the lobby.
Together, they go home.
 &HT;    Within about 72 hours (in other cases, it is 48 or fewer), she
will find someplace private and comfortable to lie down _ probably
her own bed _ and vaginally insert four tablets of a medication
called misoprostol. The tablets will trigger uterine contractions.
She will cramp and bleed _ perhaps heavily.
 &HT;    When I ask her how she will manage the pain, she says her
boyfriend will read to her or tell her stories; he'll curl up next
to her and stroke her hair. She figures that and some Tylenol with
codeine should get her through.
 &HT;    About four hours later, in all likelihood, her body will expel
the uterine lining and with it a gestational sac. Because it has
been barely six weeks since her last period _ which means it has
been about four weeks since the union of egg and sperm _ the embryo
will be tiny, about five millimeters, or the size of a grain of
rice.
 &HT;    It will not look like a baby. The sac itself will look like a
miniature ball of gauze, whitish and fuzzy, and be one or two
centimeters wide. The incipient life she is now carrying will still
be considered an embryo, not a fetus.
 &HT;    All of this matters to the young woman _ a lot. In the examining
room, she twice asks the nurse-practitioner what ``it'' looks like
at this point.
 &HT;    ``When does it start looking like a person?'' she asks. ``When
can you see a face?''
 &HT;    She wants to know about brain waves (not yet measurable) and the
presence or absence of a beating heart (it's there, in rudimentary
form). She called for her appointment here the very morning she did
her at-home pregnancy test. That this is a method designed solely
for early pregnancy _ from the moment a woman knows she is pregnant
to about nine weeks _ appeals to her almost as much, if not more
than, the fact that it allows her to avoid a surgical abortion.
 &HT;    Surgery scares her. ``Invasive'' is the word she uses, and she
shudders when she says it. But there will be no surgery for her _
unless this is one of those rare cases (about 2 percent, according
to the latest clinical trials of mifepristone) when abortion by
medication does not work and vacuum aspiration by machine, the most
common method of abortion now, becomes necessary after all.
 &HT;    And there will be no trek to a clinic, where anyone watching her
enter and leave could make a reasonable surmise about her business
there. No protesters to dodge, no one shouting ``baby killer.''
 &HT;    The office she is visiting today is tucked deep in a sprawling
hospital complex in Rochester, N.Y., where she lives. Hundreds of
people come and go here all day for everything from vaccinations to
gall-bladder operations to visits with hospitalized friends. And
the doctor this young woman sees isn't even an OB-GYN. He's a
pediatrician who developed an interest in medical abortion while
treating pregnant teen-agers and who has lately been conducting
research on mifepristone. How could even the most enterprising
anti-abortion picketer figure out whom to buttonhole?
 &HT;    It now seems fair to say that this is the shape of abortion to
come. After a decade of struggle to bring RU-486 to the United
States _ a decade of setbacks and small advances during which
right-to-life politicians tried to ban the Food and Drug
Administration from even provisionally approving it, right-to-life
groups vowed to fight it and the big pharmaceutical companies
loudly refused to go near it _ a small pharmaceutical company, the
Danco Group, backed by a deliberately low-profile consortium of
investors, has announced definite plans to manufacture the drug and
market it for the general public by the end of this year.
 &HT;    This is the breakthrough pro-choice activists have been waiting
and working for ever since they first heard about the French
abortion pill, the one they have tried to achieve through
strategies ranging from the bluntly political to the ingeniously
covert.
 &HT;    By the late '80s, Carl Djerassi, the Stanford chemist and
leading contraceptive researcher, was touting RU-486 as the only
real discovery in fertility control since the pill. Women's
magazines were triumphantly announcing its imminent arrival at your
local Planned Parenthood. Yet for years production and distribution
in this country hit snag after snag.
 &HT;    When the French manufacturer, Roussel-Uclaf, and its parent
company, Hoechst A.G. of Germany, refused to sell RU-486 here,
American feminists organized picket lines outside Hoechst plants in
this country and flew delegations to Paris to lobby company
officials. It didn't work.
 &HT;    By then, the pope himself had denounced RU-486 as the ``pill of
Cain _ the monster that cynically kills its brothers,'' and Hoechst
feared boycotts of its products in the United States, where it does
more than $6 billion worth of business.
 &HT;    Moreover, Hoechst had particular reason to be touchy. It was one
of three corporations that emerged from the breakup of I.G. Farben,
the German chemical company that manufactured the cyanide gas,
Zyklon B, for Nazi death camps, and Hoechst was sensitive to
charges that it was again manufacturing what one right-to-life
group called ``a human pesticide.''
 &HT;    In 1988, in the face of opposition from anti-abortion groups and
Catholic bishops in France, Hoechst's subsidiary, Roussel,
announced it would drop the drug entirely. Only after the French
Health Minister declared RU-486 ``the moral property of women'' and
ordered Roussel to bring it to market, did the company do so. In
the United States, where abortion is a far more volatile issue,
Hoechst seemed determined to stay out of the fray.
 &HT;    ``We've been petitioned, we've been yelled at and we've been
telephoned by everybody,'' Edward Norton, the spokesman for
Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, said in 1990. ``But
our formal position hasn't changed in two years, and I don't expect
it to change.''
 &HT;    During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the FDA classified
RU-486 as a banned drug, effectively halting all Federal research
on it, and pro-choicers decided they would resort to more
unconventional means.
 &HT;    In 1992, a pregnant 29-year-old social worker named Leona Benten
tried to challenge the law by bringing her own personal stash of
RU-486 into the country from England, only to see it confiscated by
U.S. Customs. The Supreme Court heard Benten's appeal (but upheld
the confiscation) just 16 days after she arrived at JFK accompanied
by the abortion-rights activist Lawrence Lader.
 &HT;    Next, Lader and his organization, Abortion Rights Mobilization
(ARM), fixed on the daring idea of making the pill themselves,
using published patents. In 1993, they rented part of a warehouse
in a Westchester County suburb and, unbeknown to the landlord, set
up what was in effect an underground drug lab, complete with
plentiful dry ice, an oversize ventilation hood and a volunteer
scientist who agreed to moonlight there only if he could be known
to his new colleagues as Dr. X, for fear of reprisals from
anti-abortion extremists.
 &HT;    If outsiders questioned them, project members agreed to say they
had been working on a new treatment for cancer, Lader recalls in
his book, ``A Private Matter: RU-486 and the Abortion Crisis.''
 &HT;    Even logistically, it was a complicated process; the synthesis
of mifepristone involved 10 separate steps, and since the equipment
Lader and his colleagues could afford wasn't really big enough for
the task, each step had to be repeated many times.
 &HT;    Yet by 1994 ARM had developed its own copy of the drug, and by
1997 Lader was announcing plans to offer mifepristone to as many as
10,000 women. ARM would donate the supply to clinics conducting
research on it.
 &HT;    Still, the only real hope for a more reliable source of
mifespristone, and for FDA approval, lay in persuading Hoechst to
give up its patent on the drug or else start making it itself. Soon
after Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, his administration had
begun exerting pressure on Roussel-Uclaf, and in 1994, the company,
which stopped manufacturing the drug in 1997, donated the U.S.
rights to the Population Council, a New York-based nonprofit
organization that promotes reproductive health.
 &HT;    Now the day is at hand when RU-486 will at last be widely
available _ and we can see for ourselves whether a significant
change in abortion technology really can transform the abortion
debate.
 &HT;    To talk to the doctors and nurses and patients who have been
using this method over the last few years is to be persuaded that
it may well reconfigure the politics and perception of abortion in
this country more definitively than any piece of legislation has in
the quarter century since Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    As Suzanne Poppema, a Seattle doctor who has participated in
both of the major clinical trials of mifepristone in the United
States, puts it, ``This method is the best means we've had yet for
defusing the abortion conflict.''
 &HT;    Her optimism seems well founded. Not only are mifepristone
abortions, by nature, more discreet than their surgical equivalents
(such as vacuum aspiration), but the practitioners who prescribe
them will almost certainly constitute a larger and a more varied
group than the dwindling corps of OB-GYNs willing to do surgical
abortions.
 &HT;    In 1998, for example, when the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation
polled family practitioners about their interest in using
mifepristone once it was approved and available, 45 percent of
doctors responding said they were ``very'' or ``somewhat'' likely
to do so. Fifty-four percent of nurse-practitioners and physician
assistants expressed interest in offering the drug. Yet only 3
percent of the physicians in the study and 2 percent of the
practitioners and assistants had performed surgical abortions.
 &HT;    Similarly, in a 1996 survey of doctors who belong to the Society
for Adolescent Medicine, 42 percent said they would prescribe legal
medical abortion, though only 2 percent currently offered the
surgical option.
 &HT;    The potential for expanding the number of abortion providers in
rural areas is perhaps even more dramatic. One 1995 study, for
example, found that while less than 4 percent of all OB-GYNs,
family practitioners and general surgeons practicing in rural Idaho
performed abortions, 26 percent said they would definitely be
interested in prescribing RU-486, and another 35 percent were
uncertain.
 &HT;    ``One of my real, and I think realistic, hopes for this
method,'' says Carolyn Westhoff, an OB-GYN at Columbia University
medical school who offers medical abortion as part of a clinical
trial, ``is that it will help get abortion back into the medical
mainstream and out of this ghettoized place it's been in.''
 &HT;    And if that is indeed the scenario we're looking at - a scenario
in which abortion is folded far more seamlessly into regular
medical practice - then it has implications not only for women's
experience of abortion but for the politics of abortion as well.
 &HT;    At the very least, it will present the right-to-life movement
with new tactical challenges. If abortions are taking place in all
kinds of medical settings, and at home, then abortion clinics can
no longer be the potent symbols they have become over the last
decade.
 &HT;    Mifepristone is also an abortifacient that can be used very
early in pregnancy - earlier, by as many as five weeks, than
surgical abortions have typically been offered. Along with other
new methods, including a less practical but already FDA-approved
dug called methotrexate and a newly revived technique called
manual vacuum aspiration, mifepristone pushes back the time at
which women can get abortions - back as far as the point at which
sophisticated new home-pregnancy tests can first tell them they are
pregnant.
 &HT;    ``The other question then,'' says Carole Joffe, a sociologist at
the University of California at Davis who has been studying the
probable response of doctors to mifepristone ``is, Will abortion
become more socially acceptable in this country if these
technologies help to make more and more abortions happen earlier
and earlier?''
 &HT;    Abortions in the earliest weeks of pregnancy are not only safer,
cheaper and less emotionally wrenching for the women who undergo
them, they are also more politically tenable.
 &HT;    A 1998 New York Times/CBS News poll showed that 61 percent of
Americans favor legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy,
but that support drops precipitously as pregnancy develops, down to
15 percent in the second trimester and a mere 7 percent in the
third.
 &HT;    ``For most Americans, as opposed to most of the right-to-life
movement,'' says Cory Richards, the vice president for public
policy at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the family-planning think
tank, ``an abortion at 3 weeks is a very different thing from an
abortion at 23 weeks. Earlier is better, and prevention is better
yet.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The woman waiting for her abortion is 20 years old, a college
student, wan and pretty, with long black hair and glasses. She
arrives for her appointment promptly at 10 a.m., neatly dressed in
pressed jeans and loafers, but her voice is shaking a little when
she signs in at the front desk and her shoulders stay hunched, in
what might be shyness or self-protection.
 &HT;    She follows the nurse-practitioner into the examining room and
lies down without being asked.
 &HT;    During the exam, she winces and cries, making hardly a sound.
But afterward, sitting up, her fingers laced together in her lap,
she is almost talkative.
 &HT;    ``Did you think about maybe keeping the baby or giving it up for
adoption?'' the nurse-practitioner asks kindly.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' says the young woman, ``but I knew I didn't want to do
that. My parents are having all kinds of financial difficulties. I
know they'd want me to finish school.''
 &HT;    Besides, she says, her voice a little stronger now, though her
sentences still end in that questioning upward lilt of late
adolescence, ``I want to finish school. I don't want to work in a
7-Eleven all my life.'' And, after a long pause: ``I want to have
kids someday, but I want to be able to take care of them so they
won't be miserable.''
 &HT;    When the nurse asks if she has been using birth control, she
says yes, she's on the pill, but she doesn't take it all that
regularly. ``My boyfriend and I want to try that injection _
Depo-Provera? _ 'cause the pill makes me sick.''
 &HT;    So far, there is nothing especially unusual about the young
woman's story. What is unusual is the kind of abortion she will
have today. For quite personal reasons, she has opted for a new
method with enormous political consequences.
 &HT;    At 10:30 a.m., she sits down with a counselor, a chatty
ex-schoolteacher, to hear about the procedure she is about to
undertake as part of a clinical trial. Then a nurse guides her into
another room, points her to the only chair and gives her a cup of
water and a tablet of mifepristone _ better known as RU-486, or the
French abortion pill.
 &HT;    ``Here goes!'' the young woman says. She knows there is no
turning back once she takes the pill. It will begin to work right
away, blocking the effects of her body's progesterone, a hormone
needed for the fertilized egg to sustain itself in the wall of her
uterus.
 &HT;    Looking calmer now, she grabs her backpack and heads downstairs
to find her boyfriend, who has been waiting for her in the lobby.
Together, they go home.
 &HT;    Within about 72 hours (in other cases, it is 48 or fewer), she
will find someplace private and comfortable to lie down _ probably
her own bed _ and vaginally insert four tablets of a medication
called misoprostol. The tablets will trigger uterine contractions.
She will cramp and bleed _ perhaps heavily.
 &HT;    When I ask her how she will manage the pain, she says her

been barely six weeks since her last period _ which means it has
been about four weeks since the union of egg and sperm _ the embryo
will be tiny, about five millimeters, or the size of a grain of
rice.
 &HT;    It will not look like a baby. The sac itself will look like a
miniature ball of gauze, whitish and fuzzy, and be one or two
centimeters wide. The incipient life she is now carrying will still
be considered an embryo, not a fetus.
 &HT;    All of this matters to the young woman _ a lot. In the examining

15 percent in the second trimester and a mere 7 percent in the
third.
 &HT;    ``For most Americans, as opposed to most of the right-to-life
movement,'' says Cory Richards, the vice president for public
policy at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the family-planning think
tank, ``an abortion at 3 weeks is a very different thing from an
abortion at 23 weeks. Earlier is better, and prevention is better
yet.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    What were you doing 12 weeks ago?
 &HT;    Twelve weeks ago was Nirav Tolia's last day on a pretty enviable
job. He is 27, and in addition to managing the marketing of
Yahoo!'s E-commerce properties, he had represented the company on
television more than 100 times.
 &HT;    Almost nobody leaves Yahoo!, but Tolia had just heard a really
interesting start-up idea from a friend, Naval Ravikant, who had
recently left  Home. It took Tolia about one day to decide, and the
following morning he resigned.
 &HT;    Soon after Tolia's last day at Yahoo! he and Ravikant were
joined by one of the highest ranking engineers at Netscape,
Ramanathan Guha, who was cooking up an idea very similar to
Ravikant's on the back burner of his big brain. By the end of the
week, they were five strong.
 &HT;    Eleven weeks ago, despite not having a single line of code
written or even a paper sketch of the Web site they wanted to
build, they got $8 million in seed financing from venture
capitalists _ half from Benchmark Capital, which had financed Ebay,
and half from Capital, where Naval Ravikant was camping out as
entrepreneur in residence. This gave the start-up what is believed
to be one of the highest seed-round valuations ever.
 &HT;    Nine weeks ago, they brought on Lou Montulli and Aleksander
Totic, two of the six founding engineers of Netscape. Eight weeks
ago, they moved into a second-floor gabled loft in Mountain View,
Calif., and began grinding out 15-hour days, seven days a week _
but of course these guys had done that before.
 &HT;    In a spring when it had started to seem to some Silicon Valley
veterans that all the big original ideas were gone, theirs was a
lightning rod for talent. The new director of business development,
Dion Lim, began to cut deals with other Web sites to import their
data feeds.
 &HT;    Seven weeks ago, they started hiring category managers. Six
weeks ago, it became clear to Guha that enough of the original
programming was already done, and he could switch hats from coder
to manager. Five weeks ago, their venture capitalist from
Benchmark, Bill Gurley, came by the office for his first look-see.
He was blown away: ``This is, unequivocally, the fastest I have
ever seen a start-up move.''
 &HT;    Four weeks ago, they began to cut distribution deals; two weeks
ago, they settled on their marketing plan; and now, having reached
a critical mass of 31 people, they are set to launch their Web
site.
 &HT;    In 12 weeks, the amount of time it might take an average person
to decide what kind of hedge to plant in the backyard, they built a
company from scratch. An instant company, or what is being called
in Silicon Valley a ''second-generation Web company.''
 &HT;    Not so long ago, it seemed incredible that a Web company could
be born in a mere two years. But rather than going back to normal,
the pace of creation in Silicon Valley now seems to be speeding up
even more. Any Web company that starts out today and takes two
years to get up and running is likely to be left in the dust.
 &HT;    In first-generation Internet companies, the founder and a few
college buddies moved into a garage that they decorated with Nerf
guns and green army men. In second-generation Internet companies,
the staff coalesces not from friendships but from respect for
mutually complementary skill sets.
 &HT;    They skip the garage phase, engage two real-estate brokers and
make simultaneous bids on three office spaces, hoping one comes
through. They move in over the weekend and by Monday have it
decorated with Nerf guns and green army men.
 &HT;    In first-generation Internet companies, the staff resigned from
monolithic software corporations or took leave of business school
or jumped ship on brand-manager positions at Procter &AMP; Gamble.
Nobody had Internet experience; they learned by making mistakes, of
which there were many. The purpose of the Internet was unclear.
 &HT;    Now, companies are being formed by staff members who have years
of know-how. And they see the Internet, above all, as a place to
buy things. Some $301 billion was generated by the Internet economy
in 1998, with an annual growth rate over the past four years of 174
percent.
 &HT;    Because of the way high-tech employees are compensated, there
are likely to be a great number of second-generation start-ups in
the next year. The notorious stock options that add up to so much
paper wealth usually take four years to fully vest. For the early
movers on the Internet, the four years are coming up. And the
golden handcuffs are coming off.
 &HT;    This particular second-generation internet company has managed
to recruit top people who were still handcuffed _ what people in
the Valley call ``the unhirables.'' Naval Ravikant walked away from
what at the time was $4 million worth of unvested  Home stock
options. Guha walked away from probably more than $4 million (a
figure he is contractually forbidden to confirm) at America Online,
which had acquired Netscape.
 &HT;    Sabrina Berry's previous employer, CommTouch Software, was
planning to go public. Berry walked away from all of her shares in
that company. For Montulli to join, he resigned from a hot,
well-financed start-up called Geocast Network Systems. At the time
 &HT;    Tolia left Yahoo!, the unvested options he left on the table
were worth $10 million. But, he insisted, it didn't matter to him
if it was $20 or $20 million _ he has a dream to pursue.
 &HT;    ``People are going to think I'm nuts,'' said Tolia, rolling his
eyes.
 &HT;    ``Can we not talk about this anymore?'' Guha said. ``It's
painful to dwell on.''
 &HT;    Six weeks ago, the engineering team walked to In-N-Out Burger
for lunch. Crossing an overpass above Highway 101, they paused at
the rail.
 &HT;    ``This team has been responsible for many of the key features of
Netscape Navigator,'' Guha said. ``These guys can point to any of
these cars passing underneath and say: 'That driver has almost
certainly used my code. And that driver. And that one.' We want to
build something that has that kind of influence. We want to build a
site that everyone will use.''
 &HT;    So what's the idea that is inspiring so many to jump? Until this
week, they've kept everything secret, operating under the code name
``Round One.''
 &HT;    In fact, not even people who come in to interview for a position
learn the idea their first day. Several hours of vague conversation
seem to be leading up to the grand presentation, but alas, the
applicant is sent home with a preliminary offer, setting out salary
and options and title _ and no clear sense of what the company will
do. If the candidate is sold on the team, then she or he comes back
for a second round.
 &HT;    Only at the end of that next day does she sit down in front of a
whiteboard with Ravikant and Tolia and hear something like this:
 &HT;    As the Web becomes an infinite supply of goods and services,
goes the pitch, people crave guidance on what and where to buy. So
far, the great number of on-line shopping guides present
quantitative, machine-sorted and machine-generated data _
comparisons of product prices and specifications. But what
consumers need (Ravikant and Tolia contend) is a recommendation
that gets beyond that _ the advice of someone they trust, someone
just like them.
 &HT;    So imagine a Web site, Epinions.com, which would be a sort of
Zagat-for-everything, a site consisting entirely of consumer
opinions or reviews of anything you can buy. Epinions.com itself
will sell nothing at all _ it has no warehouse, no trucks on the
back end.
 &HT;    The money would come from deals Epinions.com cuts with companies
that do sell things. Every time an ``E-pinion'' prompts a reader to
click ``Buy,'' the company will earn a tiny commission on the
resulting sale.
 &HT;    At the start, the E-pinions on Epinions.com will be culled from
existing sources, guiding users through aggregations of expertise
from the four corners of the Web. But the key to the whole idea is
to make Epinions.com participatory, taking advantage of what I call
the Tom Sawyer model. Write and post a short review of any product
on Epinions.com, and you can earn a few pennies every time the
review is read by another user.
 &HT;    By letting readers rate the usefulness of the E-pinions, the
most trusted ones will float to the top of every category. As Ebay
is a marketplace for products, Epinions.com dreams of becoming a
marketplace for ideas. If it catches on, like Ebay, then everything
snowballs, and these hobbyist-reviewers function as sliver-time
virtual employees who do all the work for you.
 &HT;    ``Everybody is an expert at something,'' they kept repeating
around the Epinions.com office; they hope their site will be the
place where everyone shares their expertise.
 &HT;    Similar logic has been welling up in the collective unconscious
of Silicon Valley, and most E-commerce sites are already adding
some form of E-pinion to their Web pages. Productopia, Deja.com,
Cnet, Amazon.com _ everyone's hiring editors and bringing back the
old-fashioned, well-trusted written word.
 &HT;    Of course, sites that both sell goods and review them are
subject to criticisms of bias. Epinions.com would be the first
company to start up doing E-pinions and only E-pinions, hoping to
be as Jell-o is to flavored gelatin.
 &HT;    And that's it. Then again, what was Yahoo! at the start but just
a Yellow Pages to the Web? The point is that job recruits with
demonstrable talent are buying in to give it a go. And they know
that in the short and unpredictable history of Internet businesses,
success has often come down to getting the details right, fast.
 &HT;    No time to waste. Ravikant and Tolia's business plan (which
consisted of 16 sparse slides) had no financial projections and no
budget. They negotiated for $8 million, enough that they wouldn't
have to go back for more until well after launch. They had no idea
what it would cost to pull together the E-pinions they would need
to stock the site, but they budgeted $5 million, just to be safe.
 &HT;    The first weekend in their new digs, the parts for their desks
arrived from Home Depot _ 25 solid wood doors, 100 4-by-4 legs and
400 metal braces. Despite this formidable team of engineering
talent, in eight hours of off-and-on tinkering they couldn't
correctly assemble any desks. Finally they called a carpenter who
had done this before, and he started building two desks an hour.
 &HT;    But then, going through the start-up experience usually bonds a
team together. There are those occasional ``Breakfast Club''-like
days when workers' inner lives get revealed to each other. This
bedrock of goodwill gets the team through hard times later. Going
through it at second-generation speed only allows brief bonding
moments.
 &HT;    At the all-hands meeting five weeks ago, Tolia announced that he
would shave his head if the company met its official launch date.
This is a guy whose E-mail was ``the-face yahoo.com'' for a good
reason _ a hair is never out of place on his head. ``When you're
wondering why you're here at 2 in the morning, think about my cue
ball,'' he said.
 &HT;    Everybody howled with laughter. Then Totic went over to his
computer and pulled up an ancient Web page, from way back in 1994.
Digital photographs were posted from the period when the original
Netscape engineers shipped Navigator 1.0. There at the top of the
page was a picture of Montulli _ who is even more of a sharp
dresser than Tolia _ with his head completely shaved. Then everyone
really laughed.
 &HT;    After Ravikant left  Home, he would still see old colleagues at
parties. The comment he heard from them time and time again was:
``It's amazing you walked away from all that money. I wish I was
brave enough to take the chance.''
 &HT;    So why did they walk away from all that money? Take it as a
given that they all believe in the commercial viability of the
idea, but beyond that, their comments are all over the map. One guy
talked blatantly about wanting ''plane money,'' and how you weren't
even a player in the Valley with less than $100 million. A few
plead that they just want to live the start-up experience, and the
money they've earned has bought them the unconditional freedom to
pursue that dream.
 &HT;    Now they are at the takeoff point, and their first-generation
experience can't help them. The next 12 weeks will be an even
greater challenge: the goal now is to turn a brand-new site into a
hive, one that has 80 percent of all E-commerce categories covered
well in advance of the crucial Christmas buying season. They are
blindly gambling that they have the right incentives and the right
filtering mechanisms in place. Ready. Fire. Aim.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Sgt. Mike Lewis of the Maryland State Police is a bull-necked,
megaphone-voiced, highly caffeinated drug warrior who, on this
shiny May morning outside of Annapolis, is conceding defeat. The
drug war is over, the good guys have lost and he has been cast as a
racist.
 &HT;    ``This is the end, buddy,'' he says. ''I can read the writing on
the wall.''
 &HT;    Lewis is driving his unmarked Crown Victoria down the fast lane
of Route 50, looking for bad guys. The back of his neck is burnt by
the sun, and he wears his hair flat and short under his regulation
Stetson.
 &HT;    ``They're going to let the NAACP tell us how to do traffic
stops,'' he says. ``That's what's happening. There may be a few
troopers who make stops solely based on race, but now they're going
to let these people tell us how to run our department. I say, to
hell with it all. I don't care if the drugs go through. I don't.''
 &HT;    He does, of course. Lewis was born to seize crack. He grew up in
Salisbury, on the Eastern Shore _ Jimmy Buffett country _ and he
watched his friends become stoners and acid freaks. Not his scene.
He buzz-cut his hair away and joined the state troopers when he was
19.
 &HT;    He's a star, the hard-charger who made one of the nation's
largest seizures of crack cocaine out on Route 13. He's a national
expert on hidden compartments. He can tell if a man's lying, he
says, by watching the pulsing of the carotid artery in his neck. He
can smell crack cocaine inside a closed automobile. He's a human
drug dog, a walking polygraph machine.
 &HT;    ``I have the unique ability to distinguish between a law-abiding
person and an up-to-no-good person,'' he says. ``Black or white.''
 &HT;    All these skills, though, he's ready to chuck. The lawsuits
accusing the Maryland State Police of harassing black drivers, the
public excoriation _ and most of all, the governor of New Jersey
saying that her state police profiled drivers based on race, and
were wrong to do so _ have twisted him up inside.
 &HT;    ``Three of my men have put in for transfers,'' he says. ``My
wife wants me to get out. I'm depressed.''
 &HT;    What depresses Lewis is that he believes he is in possession of
a truth polite society is too cowardly to accept. He says that when
someone tells this particular truth, his head is handed to him.
``The superintendent of the New Jersey State Police told the truth
and he got fired for it,'' Lewis says.
 &HT;    This is what Carl Williams said, fueling a national debate about
racial profiling in law enforcement: ``Today, with this drug
problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most
likely a minority group that's involved with that.''
 &HT;    Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired Williams, and the news
ricocheted through police departments everywhere, especially those,
like the Maryland State Police, already accused of racial profiling
_ the stopping and searching of blacks because they are black.
 &HT;    The way cops perceive blacks _ and how those perceptions shape
and misshape crime fighting _ is now the most charged racial issue
in America. The systematic harassment of black drivers in New
Jersey, the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African
immigrant, by New York City police officers earlier this year, and
other incidents in other states have brought the relationship
between blacks and cops to a level of seemingly irreversible
toxicity.
 &HT;    Neither side understands the other. The innocent black man,
jacked-up and humiliated during a stop-and-frisk or a pretext car
stop, asks: Whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment? It is no
wonder, blacks say, that the police are so wildly mistrusted.
 &HT;    And then there's the cop, who says: Why shouldn't I look at race
when I'm looking for crime? It is no state secret that blacks
commit a disproportionate amount of crime, so ``racial profiling''
is simply good police work.
 &HT;    In the old days, when Lewis was patrolling the Eastern Shore, it
was white people he arrested.
 &HT;    ``Ninety-five percent of my drug arrests were dirt-ball-type
whites _ marijuana, heroin, possession-weight. Then I moved to the
highway, I start taking off two, three kilograms of coke, instead
of two or three grams. Black guys. Suddenly I'm not the greatest
trooper in the world. I'm a racist. I'm locking up blacks, but I
can't help it.''
 &HT;    His eyes gleam: ``Ask me how many white people I've ever
arrested for cocaine smuggling _ ask me!''
 &HT;    I ask.
 &HT;    ``None! Zero! I debrief hundreds of black smugglers, and I ask
them, 'Why don't you hire white guys to deliver your drugs?' They
just laugh at me. 'We ain't gonna trust our drugs with white boys.'
That's what they say.''
 &HT;    Lewis' dream: ``I dream at night about arresting white people
for cocaine. I do. I try to think of innovative ways to arrest
white males. But the reality is different.''
 &HT;    A big part of Lewis' reality is a black man named Keith Hill.
Lewis killed Hill three years ago. Hill was speeding down Route 13
when Lewis pulled him over. He approached the car, Hill rolled down
the window and Lewis smelled burning marijuana. He ordered Hill out
of the car, began to search him and came up with thousands of
dollars of cash and packets of marijuana.
 &HT;    Hill suddenly resisted. What flashed through Lewis' mind was his
friend Edward Plank, a trooper killed by a coke runner on this same
highway a few months before. They fought, Hill knocking Lewis into
a ravine. They wrestled, and Hill went for Lewis' gun.
 &HT;    ``We were in a clinch, just breathing heavy,'' Lewis recalls,
''and I said, 'Man, it's just pot, it's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    But Hill kept going for the gun, Lewis tells me. He couldn't get
it, and ran. He looped through a housing development and back to
his car. Hill gunned the engine just as Lewis got himself in front
of the car. Lewis drew his weapon and fired, striking Hill twice in
the chest.
 &HT;    Lewis speaks often of the shooting, and of Plank's death. One
day, he collects for me old newspaper stories of trooper shootouts.
I'm reading them when we pass two members of his interdiction squad
parked on the median of Route 13. They've stopped two cars with New
York license plates filled with young black men.
 &HT;    ``What's up?'' Lewis asks Gary Bromwell, a bulky, sullen
trooper.
 &HT;    The two cars were pulled over for speeding and weaving, but that
was a pretext. The goal of Lewis' unit, the criminal-interdiction
unit, is to find drugs, guns and untaxed cigarettes in the cars of
smugglers. However, in order to stop a suspected gunrunner or drug
mule, troopers first have to find a reason in the state's traffic
laws.
 &HT;    Bromwell issues written warnings and sends them on their way. I
ask Bromwell, who is white, why he didn't ask the young men their
consent to search the cars. Reasonable suspicion _ anything the
trooper can articulate before a judge _ is enough to justify a
consent search.
 &HT;    ``They're decent people,'' Bromwell says.
 &HT;    How can you tell?
 &HT;    ``They looked me in the eye, and the driver's hand didn't shake
when he handed me his license.''
 &HT;    Lewis interrupts: ``No visible sign of contraband, no
overwhelming odor of air fresheners emanating from the vehicle, no
signs of hard driving'' _ that is, driving long hours without
making stops.
 &HT;    He is listing Drug Enforcement Administration-endorsed
indicators of drug smuggling. Smugglers use air fresheners to fool
drug-sniffing dogs. Signs of hard driving _ these guys drive
straight through because they don't want to leave their drugs
alone,'' Lewis says _ include loose-fitting clothing, day-old
beards and food wrappers on the floor. These signs, though, can
also indicate the presence of college students _ which is, in fact,
the case here.
 &HT;    Did you stop them because they were black men from New York? I
ask.
 &HT;    ``Tell you the truth,'' Bromwell says, ``we couldn't see who was
driving these cars. They were speeding.''
 &HT;    After the New York cars pull into traffic, Lewis shows Bromwell
and his partner, Rob Penny, the newspaper clippings, hoping they
will back him up. ``Eddie Plank,'' he says. ``Killed by a black
male. My shooting _ a black. Robbie Bishop, down in Georgia, killed
by a black. North Carolina trooper, killed by a black.''
 &HT;    Bromwell looks uneasy. I ask him if he believes in a connection
between the race of the shooters and the crimes they commit.
 &HT;    ``People might think it,'' Bromwell says, walking away, ``but
they don't say it.'' He flashes Lewis a look that says, Shut up,
and quick.
 &HT;    This is what a cop might tell you in a moment of reckless
candor: In crime fighting, race matters. When asked, most cops will
declare themselves color blind. But watch them on the job for
several months, and get them talking about the way policing is
really done and the truth will emerge, the truth being that cops,
white and black, profile. Here's why, they say.
 &HT;    African-Americans commit a disproportionate percentage of the
types of crimes that draw the attention of the police. Blacks make
up 12 percent of the population, but accounted for 58 percent of
all carjackers between 1992 and 1996. (Whites accounted for 19
percent.) Victim surveys _ and most victims of black criminals are
black _ indicate that blacks commit almost 50 percent of all
robberies.
 &HT;    Blacks and Hispanics are widely believed to be the blue-collar
backbone of the country's heroin- and cocaine-distribution
networks. Black males between the ages of 14 and 24 make up 1.1
percent of the country's population, yet commit more than 28
percent of its homicides. Reason, not racism, cops say, directs
their attention.
 &HT;    Cops, white and black, know one other thing: They're not the
only ones who profile. Civilians profile all the time _ when they
buy a house, or pick a school district, or walk down the street.
Even civil rights leaders profile.
 &HT;    ``There is nothing more painful for me at this stage in my
life,'' Jesse Jackson said several years ago, ``than to walk down
the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery _
and then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.''
 &HT;    Jackson now says his quotation was ``taken out of context.'' The
context, he said, is that violence is the inevitable byproduct of
poor education and health care. But no amount of ``context''
matters when you fear that you are about to be mugged.
 &HT;    At a closed-door summit in Washington between police chiefs and
black community leaders recently, the black chief of police of
Charleston, S.C., Reuben Greenberg, argued that the problem facing
black America is not racial profiling, but precisely the sort of
black-on-black crime Jackson was talking about.
 &HT;    ``I told them that the greatest problem in the black community
is the tolerance for high levels of criminality,'' he recalled.
``Fifty percent of homicide victims are African-Americans. I asked
what this meant about the value of life in this community.''
 &HT;    The police chief in Los Angeles, Bernard Parks, who is black,
argues that racial profiling is rooted in statistical reality, not
racism.
 &HT;    ``It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males
or put them in jail,'' Parks told me. ``It's the fault of the
minority males for committing the crime. In my mind it is not a
great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal
activity, they're going to look at the kind of people who are
listed on crime reports.''
 &HT;    I asked Parks to comment on the 3-out-of-10 hypothetical. In
Maryland, the state police, as part of a settlement of an American
Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, reported that on a particular
stretch of highway, the police came up with drugs in 3 out of every
10 consent searches. This was deemed unacceptable by the ACLU.
 &HT;    ``Three out of 10?'' Parks said. ``That would get you into the
Hall of Fame. That's a success story.'' He continued: ``At some
point, someone figured out that the drugs are being delivered by
males of this color driving these kinds of vehicles at this time of
night. This isn't brain surgery. The profile didn't get invented
for nothing.''
 &HT;    To justify aggressive policing in black neighborhoods and on the
highways, cops cite numbers _ but those numbers tell only, albeit
important, part of the story. For one thing, blacks make up only 13
percent of the country's illicit drug users, but 74 percent of
people who are sentenced to prison for drug possession, according
to David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University and the
author of ``No Equal Justice.''
 &HT;    Common sense, then, dictates that if the police conducted
pretext stops on the campus of UCLA with the same frequency as they
do in South Central, a lot of whites would be arrested for drug
possession too.
 &HT;    Of course, this doesn't happen, because no white community is
going to let the police throw a net over its children.
 &HT;    The real question about racial profiling is this: Is it ever
permissible for a law-enforcement officer to use race as one of
even 5, or 10 or 20, indicators of possible criminality? In other
words, can the color of a man's skin help make him a criminal
suspect?
 &HT;    Yes, says Whitman, the New Jersey governor. She suggests she
doesn't have a problem with the use of race as one of several
proxies for potential criminality.
 &HT;    ``I look at Barry McCaffrey's Web site,'' she says, referring to
the Clinton administration's drug czar, ``and it says certain
ethnic groups are more likely to engage in drug smuggling.''
 &HT;    It is true. Despite President Clinton's recent declaration that
racial profiling is ``morally indefensible,'' the Office of
National Drug Control Policy's Web site helpfully lists which
racial groups sell which drugs in different cities.
 &HT;    In Denver, McCaffrey's Web site says, it is ``minorities,
Mexican nationals'' who sell heroin. In Trenton, ``crack dealers
are predominantly African-American males, powdered cocaine dealers
are predominantly Latino.''
 &HT;    The link between racial minorities and drug-selling is exactly
what Whitman's former police superintendent, Carl Williams, was
talking about. So was Williams wrong?
 &HT;    ``His comments indicated a lack of sensitivity to the
seriousness of the problem.''
 &HT;    But was he wrong on the merits?
 &HT;    ``If he said, 'You should never use this solely; race could be a
partial indicator, taken in concert with other factors''' _ she
pauses _ ``but you can't be that broad-brushed.''

 &HT;    ``I told them that the greatest problem in the black community
is the tolerance for high levels of criminality,'' he recalled.
``Fifty percent of homicide victims are African-Americans. I asked
what this meant about the value of life in this community.''
 &HT;    The police chief in Los Angeles, Bernard Parks, who is black,
argues that racial profiling is rooted in statistical reality, not
racism.
 &HT;    ``It's not the fault of the police when they stop minority males
or put them in jail,'' Parks told me. ``It's the fault of the
minority males for committing the crime. In my mind it is not a
great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal
activity, they're going to look at the kind of people who are
listed on crime reports.''
 &HT;    I asked Parks to comment on the 3-out-of-10 hypothetical. In
Maryland, the state police, as part of a settlement of an American
Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, reported that on a particular
stretch of highway, the police came up with drugs in 3 out of every
10 consent searches. This was deemed unacceptable by the ACLU.
 &HT;    ``Three out of 10?'' Parks said. ``That would get you into the
Hall of Fame. That's a success story.'' He continued: ``At some
point, someone figured out that the drugs are being delivered by
males of this color driving these kinds of vehicles at this time of
night. This isn't brain surgery. The profile didn't get invented
for nothing.''
 &HT;    To justify aggressive policing in black neighborhoods and on the
highways, cops cite numbers _ but those numbers tell only, albeit
important, part of the story. For one thing, blacks make up only 13
percent of the country's illicit drug users, but 74 percent of
people who are sentenced to prison for drug possession, according
to David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown University and the
author of ``No Equal Justice.''
 &HT;    Common sense, then, dictates that if the police conducted
pretext stops on the campus of UCLA with the same frequency as they
do in South Central, a lot of whites would be arrested for drug
possession too.
 &HT;    Of course, this doesn't happen, because no white community is
going to let the police throw a net over its children.
 &HT;    The real question about racial profiling is this: Is it ever
permissible for a law-enforcement officer to use race as one of
even 5, or 10 or 20, indicators of possible criminality? In other
words, can the color of a man's skin help make him a criminal
suspect?
 &HT;    Yes, says Whitman, the New Jersey governor. She suggests she
doesn't have a problem with the use of race as one of several
proxies for potential criminality.
 &HT;    ``I look at Barry McCaffrey's Web site,'' she says, referring to
the Clinton administration's drug czar, ``and it says certain
ethnic groups are more likely to engage in drug smuggling.''
 &HT;    It is true. Despite President Clinton's recent declaration that
racial profiling is ``morally indefensible,'' the Office of
National Drug Control Policy's Web site helpfully lists which
racial groups sell which drugs in different cities.
 &HT;    In Denver, McCaffrey's Web site says, it is ``minorities,
Mexican nationals'' who sell heroin. In Trenton, ``crack dealers
are predominantly African-American males, powdered cocaine dealers
are predominantly Latino.''
 &HT;    The link between racial minorities and drug-selling is exactly
what Whitman's former police superintendent, Carl Williams, was
talking about. So was Williams wrong?
 &HT;    ``His comments indicated a lack of sensitivity to the
seriousness of the problem.''
 &HT;    But was he wrong on the merits?
 &HT;    ``If he said, 'You should never use this solely; race could be a
partial indicator, taken in concert with other factors''' _ she
pauses _ ``but you can't be that broad-brushed.''

   WASHINGTON _ If Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., were grading the
companies that sell goods and services on the Internet, he'd give
them a ``a big fat F'' for failing to protect the privacy of
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many lawmakers and regulators willing to give credit
to Internet companies, Markey wondered, ``merely for taking the
course while they fail the subject matter?''
</P>
<P>
   At a House Commerce subcommittee hearing on consumer privacy
Tuesday, Markey disagreed sharply with Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Robert Pitofsky, who recommended Congress not regulate the
way companies collect and use information from Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, appointed by President Clinton, argued that companies
operating on the World Wide Web are ``on the right track'' in terms
of protecting consumers. He said he'd give industry a letter grade
of C for existing privacy protections, and a B-plus for
``improvement'' over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said passing laws now would be ``premature'' because
companies need time to develop policies for self-regulation. Those
policies would give lawmakers a better idea of what works best to
protect consumer data.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some federal legislation may be needed to reinforce
those self-regulatory efforts, but Congress would be wise to hold
off because ``we want to get it right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey scoffed at that recommendation, saying that no matter how
quickly technology changes, lawmakers still have a responsibility
to set ``standards that are eternal.'' In terms of the Internet, he
believes those standards should include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Notice. Web sites should offer clear notice of what privacy
practices apply. For example, will the company sell your personal
information to other marketers?
</P>
<P>
   _ Choice. Consumers should be able to grant or deny consent to
the privacy practices of the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access. Consumers should be able to see the information
collected by the Web site so they could correct mistakes and find
out who has purchased their data.
</P>
<P>
   _ Security. Information collected, such as credit card numbers,
must be protected by reasonable safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contact information. Consumers ought to be able to contact the
Web site's manager with questions or complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Markey noted that the nation's stock exchanges largely regulate
themselves and use fast-changing technology. Still, the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission oversees the exchanges and is
able to set standards for fairness. The federal government should
regulate Internet commerce in a similar fashion, he said.

FORMER SAFEWAY EXECUTIVE QUENTIN REYNOLDS DIES AT 93 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Quentin Reynolds, retired chief executive
officer of Safeway Stores, died June 30 at his home in Walnut
Creek. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had been suffering from emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   A company man for five decades, Reynolds began working as a
clerk for the giant grocery chain's predecessor, Skaggs Cash
Stores, during his high school years. He joined Safeway in Oakland
in 1926, and one year later he was managing his first Safeway store
in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, he is credited with opening the Marina Safeway
in the 1950s, once a model store for future Safeways and now a
commercial landmark. He also opened the Safeway on Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds climbed the corporate ranks and was promoted to vice
president in 1956 and president in 1966. He was named chief
executive officer in 1969 and board chairman two years later.
</P>
<P>
   During Reynolds' reign in the 1970s, Safeway sales surpassed
those of grocery giant A&AMP;P, making Safeway the largest grocery
chain in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Former store manager George Erb of Orinda remembers that
Reynolds was best known for compassionate people skills and
appreciation of store managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to visit stores in the early morning just to get
acquainted with the employees there,'' remembered another longtime
co- worker, Louis Bianco, 89, of Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds retired in 1974 after 51 years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the last grocery men to leave the company. The
ones that came after him were the MBAs, accountant types,'' said
his eldest son, Edward Reynolds, 67, of Healdsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Also active in the community, Reynolds sat on boards for the San
Francisco and California chambers of commerce, San Francisco Boys
Club and the San Francisco Zoological Society, among others.
Reynolds was vice president of the Alameda County Coliseum
Foundation Inc. and a member of the Board of Regents of Saint
Mary's College, which named him Alumnus of the Year in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Praised for his business acumen, Reynolds was named by former
President Lyndon Johnson to the 16-member Executive Board of the
National Alliance of Businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was born May 16, 1906, in San Rafael, and his father
worked nearby as a San Quentin Prison guard. When his parents died
in 1926, Reynolds left school to work full-time in grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds is survived by sons Edward Reynolds of Healdsburg, Jon
Quentin of Piedmont and Peter Melone of Berkeley; stepchildren
Jeanette Dunckel of San Francisco, Parker Maddux of San Francisco
and Jacklyn Maddux of North Carolina; 12 grandchildren; and 11
great-grandchildren.

NEW LAW OFFERS SAVINGS ON MORTGAGE INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERI GRAVES   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ A new law taking effect Aug. 1 will save
money for home buyers who purchase property with a down payment of
less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Homeowners Protection Act of 1997, signed into law on July
29, 1998, will curtail a long-standing practice of overcharging
homeowners for Private Mortgage Insurance _ PMI _ coverage that no
longer is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with private mortgage insurance, and the reason for
the new law, is that ``once a PMI policy was in place, the premiums
continued virtually forever,'' said John Witty, an industry analyst
from New Jersey who is touring the country as a spokesman for the
Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, PMI allows a home buyer to substitute insurance
coverage for the down-payment cash. The insurance policy, however,
should be canceled when the borrower's home equity reaches the
point where it is equal to or more than the customary 20 percent
down payment the borrower would have made had there not been a PMI
policy in place.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders were supposed to notify borrowers when it was time to
cancel the policy, but many didn't. Insurers had no responsibility
to cancel the policies at the appropriate time. Only eight states
had laws requiring the insurance to be canceled as soon as the
lender's risk of default was outweighed by the borrower's equity in
the property.
</P>
<P>
   The Homeowners Protection Act requires automatic cancellation of
private mortgage insurance once equity has reached 22 percent. Over
the course of a typical 30-year mortgage, eliminating the monthly
PMI premium will result in considerable savings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Witty, the monthly PMI premium depends on the risk,
which is weighed by the amount of the down payment, the size of the
loan, and the credit characteristics of the borrower. For loans
from $100,000 to $250,000, premiums range from $30 to $100 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of the time, the borrower pays the PMI premium.
So-called lender-paid mortgage insurance typically involves loans
with a higher interest rate, so the borrower pays more for the loan
and in effect is paying for the insurance anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision of the new law allows borrowers to request
termination of private mortgage insurance when they've reduced
their loan to 80 percent of its original amount, thereby
accumulating the 20 percent equity that otherwise would have been
represented by the down payment. The law, however, also allows
lenders to require the borrower to pay for an appraisal to prove
the property has not depreciated in value. Borrowers may wish to
forego the cost of the appraisal and wait until the automatic
cancellation at 22 percent equity.
</P>
<P>
   Fixed-rate borrowers will receive an amortization schedule
showing exactly when PMI can be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist, the new law allows lenders to refuse to cancel
the insurance if the borrower does not have a ``good payment''
record. Generally you're in good stead if you do not have one
payment 30 days late within one year of a cancellation request, or
one payment 60 days late within two years of seeking an end to PMI
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, lenders can continue PMI up to 15 years
for so-called ``high-risk'' loans, regardless of equity. FHA
financing is not covered under the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good law that got lost in last year's Monica
mess,'' said Witty. ``The disclosure provisions will be for
existing loans as well as new ones, but the 20 percent and 22
percent provisions will apply only to new loans. People need to
keep an eye on their loan balance and contact the lender when that
20 percent equity point is reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Private mortgage insurance has been controversial since its
inception during the depression. The Federal Housing Administration
started issuing mortgage insurance in 1934. Private industry picked
up the ball in late 1950s.

   New Airline Policies Aim to Improve Service &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possibility of new federal regulations, the
airline industry last month announced a series of new policies to
improve customer service. But it may be up to six months before the
reforms take effect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress began considering new regulations after increased
complaints about service and a snowstorm in Detroit in January that
caused a huge airport tie-up, leaving thousands of Northwest
Airlines passengers stranded on planes for hours, within sight of
terminals; they had little food, and on-board lavatories were soon
unusable.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 major American passenger lines that belong to the Air
Transport Association, which says its members handle 95 percent of
all domestic air travel, said new policies would include the
following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Telephone reservations agents will always quote the lowest
available fare, and customers will be guaranteed that fare for 24
hours so they can comparison shop. Airlines will either honor the
fare for 24 hours or give full refunds on cancellations within that
period, the association said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Lost bags will be delivered, if possible, within 24 hours; the
airlines have asked the Department of Transportation to raise the
liability limit for lost baggage, which has been $1,250 a passenger
since 1984, and the department has proposed making it $2,500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Notification of flight delays will be improved and, when
passengers face long delays aboard aircraft on the ground, every
reasonable effort will be made to provide food, water, restroom
facilities and access to medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Policies on the disabled, unaccompanied minors and
frequent-flier programs will be published and made readily
available to customers, and refunds will be made within seven days
for refundable tickets bought with credit cards and within 20 days
for tickets bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also promised within six months to develop clear
policies on compensating passengers who are forced to make an
unscheduled overnight stop because of flight delays.

   Near Paris, a Salute To Saint-Gaudens &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848-1907) is often called the American
Michelangelo, but his father was French and he studied in Paris,
participated in important Parisian salons and eventually retired to
a New Hampshire farm named after his father's village in the
Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the first major retrospective of his work in
France: Through Oct. 18, over 100 of Saint-Gaudens' monumental
sculptures, portraits and numismatic designs, gleaned from public
and private collections, will be displayed at the 17th-century
Chateau de Blerancourt northeast of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   His celebrated public commissions include Civil War memorials to
Lincoln, Admiral Farragut, General Sherman, Col. Robert Gould Shaw
(on Boston Common) and the exquisite double-eagle gold coins
created at the behest of Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   More intimate works are also presented in this exhibition _
informal portraits, delicate cameo jewelry, and a copy of the
sweetly elegant Diana, the sculptor's only female nude, which first
served as a weathervane atop the original Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Blerancourt Museum, founded in 1924 by Anne Morgan, is a
particularly appropriate showcase, as one of the most important
featured works, Amor Caritas, a sculpture of a winged angel, is
based on a funerary monument that Saint-Gaudens designed for the
J.P. Morgan family; Anne Morgan was J.P. Morgan's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Musee National de la Cooperation Franco-Americaine, (33-3)
23.39.60.16, is about 70 miles northeast of Paris, by taking the A1
to Exit 9, and then heading toward Soissons. It is open daily
except Tuesday. Tickets cost $3.80 (at 6.35 francs to $1), under 18
free. &QL;

   Suites and Nothing But At 2 Vancouver Hotels &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Vancouver have two new luxury all-suite hotels to
choose from. The Sheraton Suites Le Soleil, which opened in March
at 567 Hornby Street, sits about two blocks from the cruise
terminals and is in the heart of the business district.
</P>
<P>
   The 122 suites are furnished in crimson and gold, with silk
brocade coverlets, down duvets and Biedermeier-style furniture.
Each has two-line speaker phones with data ports and high-speed
Internet access. The hotel's restaurant, Oritalia, features Asian
and Mediterranean-style preparations. Doubles are $284 (at $1.48
Canadian to the American dollar); (604) 632-3000 or (877)
632-3030. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 207-room Westin Grand Vancouver, which opened in April at
433 Robson Street in the entertainment district, is built in the
shape of a grand piano. The decor is minimalist, with a largely
neutral color scheme. Each suite is equipped with a kitchenette, a
data port and two phone lines. Rates range from $148 to $236; (604)
602-1999.

   Denmark Sheds Some Light on Dark Ages &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denmark has proclaimed 1999 its Medieval Year, highlighting the
many archeological digs, burial mounds, churches and museums that
offer information on the period from about 1000, when the Danes
turned from paganism to Christianity, to 1536, the year of the
Reformation. More than 400 events, including lectures and
workshops, have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bright Ages,'' an exhibition at the National Museum in
Copenhagen, includes artifacts and reconstructed scenes designed to
demonstrate that the period was more colorful than the term Dark
Ages would suggest. It runs through Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   At the Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus in Jutland, medieval
manuscripts collected from research libraries throughout Europe,
including the Vatican Library, are on display, many of them never
before on public view. Some were written on parchment in
monasteries; some manuscripts are illustrated with pictures of
daily life and religious observances.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be given a chance to try their hands at writing
with a quill pen. On Sept. 15 the exhibition will move to the Royal
Library in Copenhagen until Jan. 1, where it will occupy a new wing
called the Black Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   In Odense on July 27 and 28, the Medieval Days festival, on the
site of a 15th century military camp, will feature tournaments,
mock battles, archery contests and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 24 on the island of Funen, Nyborg Castle, once the
royal palace, will display toys and other artifacts relating to
children's lives in the Middle Ages. The castle's halls are notable
for their thick walls, heavy oak ceilings and worn floor tiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the European Medieval Festival on Aug. 27 and 28 in Horsens
in Jutland, knights in armor will do battle. Musicians and street
entertainers will perform in the city center, and medieval food
will be sold at inns. After sunset flaming torches will replace
street lights.

COMMENTARY: A WOMAN IS STILL HER OWN BEST DETECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night Betsy Hall was watching a TV movie of the week about a
woman who gets cancer and then her husband leaves her. It was a
pretty bad movie, she said, and she told herself to either turn off
the TV or lie down on the bed and do a breast exam.
</P>
<P>
   She did the exam, suddenly felt the thing you never want to
feel, called her husband to verify ``It's a lump, isn't it?'' and
the next day was at the doctor's office. It was breast cancer and
she had a mastectomy. Now, five years later, she believes that you
can't get too many reminders to pay attention. In her case, she
says it was, ``Bad movie; good choice.''
</P>
<P>
   For a subject so long denied by scared women and a squeamish
media, breast cancer is now a common theme for novels, movie plots,
magazine articles, health studies and endless speculation by women
who are still scared but are definitely more on watch.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who lives in the Midwest thinks of breast cancer as a
tornado _ impossible to predict or tell whether it will hit your
house or your friend's across town. But it's coming and it's close.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend recently confided, ``I've had a shift in my
thinking. I used to think breast cancer would never happen to me.
Now I think it will.''
</P>
<P>
   I told Betsy Hall of my friend's cold certainty, hoping that she
would reassure her and the rest of us worried well people that we
don't have to be THAT accepting. Betsy wondered if my friend had
become obsessed by it and I said no, that she's decided to be more
diligent so she can catch it at the earliest stage.
</P>
<P>
   Smart woman, said Betsy. Better to feel it's inevitable than to
feel you're invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy's a psychotherapist in Santa Rosa, Calif., who leads
support groups for women with cancer. Last year she started one
specifically for women who are newly diagnosed and has since added
one for women whose cancer has advanced. Betsy knows a lot about
the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't know anymore than the rest of us about
preventing it or curing it. In spite of all the talk about breast
cancer there's still more theory and speculation than solid,
reassuring breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Every study seems to bring a counter study. We swear off a
certain food and then suddenly it's acceptable. Then comes a new
drug that one research group says shows ``welcome encouragement,''
and another says should be ``viewed with caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember when we weren't supposed to eat fat? Then this spring
came the Nurses Health Study saying that a low-fat diet was good in
many ways but it didn't seem to make much of a difference with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement pills were almost a certain danger until
Chicago researchers last month said maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we're advised to avoid breast cancer by
eating more broccoli and cauliflower, load up on the soy, drink
bottled water, don't delay having children and breast feed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some women with all the risk factors never get breast cancer
and some who take the best of care, like the very organic Betsy
Hall, do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every suspicious food or even flawed study is beneficial
to know about because they keep women on their guard, says Betsy,
who leans across the lunch table and asks, ``Do you self examine?''
</P>
<P>
   While I was writing this I got a call telling me that a woman
I've long admired, Woody Schwartz, had died. Woody spent her life
working for justice in every dark corner of the world. Everyone
knew she had breast cancer and that in the last few years it had
spread to her bones.
</P>
<P>
   Woody's husband Arnie said, ``Here's something women should
know'' and told me that 15 years ago no doctor or mammogram
detected Woody's breast cancer. Woody looked in her mirror and
noticed a strange dimpling in one breast. Ten years later she saw
something suspicious in the other breast. That cancer had spread to
her lymph nodes. ``Don't trust the experts,'' he said. ``Trust
yourself.''

`THE JUKEBOX QUEEN OF MALTA': A CHARACTER-RICH WINDOW ON WORLD WAR
II 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It must have been a daunting challenge for the talented Nicholas
Rinaldi to set his new novel, ``The Jukebox Queen of Malta,''
within the absurdist confines of World War II. That, after all, was
the territory of Joseph Heller, William Styron, Norman Mailer and
others who might be seen as intimidating predecessors. But Rinaldi,
whose one previous novel was ``All Fall Down,'' seems unfazed. His
new book does not have the searing, epochal quality of the works of
those famous writers, but it does show that Rinaldi belongs in
their company.
</P>
<P>
   A reading of ``The Jukebox Queen of Malta'' leads to the
suspicion that Rinaldi himself was most strongly influenced by
Heller's ``Catch-22.'' He gives us a character named Fingerly who
engages in a gleeful commercial exploitation of the war, bringing
to mind Heller's immortal Milo Minderbinder. But as ``The Jukebox
Queen of Malta'' unfolds, it becomes clear that Rinaldi has pulled
off far more than an imitation of an earlier novel. He uses a
previously unexploited setting _ the island of Malta, controlled by
the British, bombed by the Germans _ to chisel a funny, melancholy,
romantic, disturbing, character-rich window on the war.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Rocco Raven, a 21-year-old U.S. soldier
who, because of some bureaucratic mistake, has been airlifted into
Malta to serve as a radio operator for a tiny U.S. intelligence
service known as I-3. Rocco repaired cars back in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and took courses on Melville, Nietzsche and Poe in night school.
</P>
<P>
   He misses Brooklyn, with its ``trees and backyards, and baseball
at Ebbets Field, and all those other good things _ egg creams,
peacocks in the zoo, beer in the bowling alleys and cars whose
motors he could tinker with, making them purr.'' He doesn't like it
on Malta, where the German bombers are causing daily death and
havoc. But for such a young man, he has a kind of quiet wisdom
about him, a self-possession that keeps him sane and sees him
through.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco meets Melita, a local beauty whose hair is as raven as his
last name. Melita sells and repairs the jukeboxes that are made out
of spare parts by her cousin Zammit, a disabled
mechanical-electrical genius, a Pop Art poet. Rocco first sees
Melita walking ahead of him through the rubble, seeming to burst
into flames before returning to herself again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Malta,'' Rinaldi writes, striking a continuing theme of
geographical mysticism, ``Malta again was doing this to him, making
him see things that weren't there. He had a feeling he'd passed
through some sort of gate, an invisible portal, and his life would
never be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldi handles the love affair between Rocco and Melita with a
patient sort of prudence and around it weaves a marvelous tapestry
of Malta trapped in the ludicrous drama of war. Two elements to the
novel give it a particular luster. One is Rinaldi's skill at
decorating the scene with unexpected but authentic-seeming details.
Rinaldi, for example, knows his jukeboxes, and he knows the songs
that were played on them in 1942. In his hands they become like
home altars, things that glow in the dark and become objects of
veneration amid affliction.
</P>
<P>
   The jukeboxes are also a kind of crazy, off-kilter emblem of
normal life in a world gone crazy. Rinaldi's Malta is a theater of
violence, with the heavy bombing by the Germans and the British
effort to fight back against the odds. This is marvelously handled
by Rinaldi.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a shivering wildness in it: the noise, the rage, the
stink of cordite, the sheer savagery of all that metal being hurled
about,'' he writes about one bombing raid. ``Melita felt it: the
cutting loose, the complete recklessness of the moment. Where the
bombs hit, they kicked up smoky spikes of dirt and dust a hundred
feet high, yellow clouds from the pulverized limestone buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The second element that gives this novel its traction is the
cast of characters, who begin as stock figures in a tale of
exoticism but then transcend that by virtue of their jagged
individuality. Fingerly is perhaps the best of them, a glib, amoral
operator who knows history and is probably a pretty good
intelligence operative as well.
</P>
<P>
   There is Nigg, the Harvard dropout whose addiction to gambling
is an unsuccessful escape from his domineering proctologist father.
(Rinaldi's background on the father is a short tragicomic
masterpiece.) Then there is Tony Zebra, a U.S. pilot flying for the
Royal Air Force who, despite his manifest incompetence, scores kill
after kill against the Germans, usually without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Others include the count, an anti-Hitler German who plays the
piano in a local restaurant, an affectionately sardonic comment on
Rick's in the movie ``Casablanca.'' Nardu Camilleru is an elderly
Maltese eccentric who hovers near death for much of the story yet
refuses to die. And Malta itself is a rich and tragic character,
long-suffering, near starvation, despairing and valiant.
</P>
<P>
   Rinaldi includes brief snippets from the newspapers that reflect
the persistence of ordinary life in the midst of calamity. ``Keep
the kidneys active to ensure Good Health,'' reads an advertisement
for Doan's pills. It lies beneath other headlines about Allied air
activity in China and Burma and a lowering of the height
requirement for draftees. Keeping your kidneys healthy while bombs
are falling around you is a mad sort of prescription for sanity.
</P>
<P>
   With Rocco and Melita at the center, Rinaldi follows events on
Malta to a moving and satisfying end in a novel that upholds a
literary tradition of the war and adds to it as well.

`MUPPETS FROM SPACE': RELIES TOO MUCH ON SPENT SCREEN FUEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cut through the attitude, funk and _ beg pardon, Miss Piggy _
sheer hamminess of ``Muppets From Space,'' and inside lie the
remains of movies like ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Men in
Black'' and ``My Favorite Martian.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not the first time these material creatures have
stuck their beaks, snouts and blobby little noses into the
recycling bin in search of a cinematic vehicle, but somewhere along
the way they have gone Hollywood when they should be going Oz, as
in Frank Oz and Jim Henson, who were present at the creation of the
Muppets and stuffed their puffy fabric bodies with so much charm
and no little wit.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of sending up their cinematic sources, the creators
of ``Muppets From Space'' rely too much on this spent screen fuel.
Frenetic movement and loud music overwhelm warmth and compassion,
and the balance of character, plot, irreverent humor and innate
decency that made some of the earlier Muppet movies so welcome is
lost.
</P>
<P>
   So at the risk of sounding like Oscar the Grouch, let it be said
that ``Muppets From Space'' doesn't achieve exhilarating liftoff.
But its bright colors, high spirits, brisk pace, brief length and
familiar characters making a lot of noise will doubtless seem an
oasis of entertainment to many parents seeking a diversion for
children on a hot, humid summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tim Hill, a Nickelodeon alumnus in his feature-film
debut, and written by Jerry Juhl, Joseph Mazzarino and Ken Kaufman,
``Muppets From Space'' mixes the Muppets with human actors in a
tale of longing and belonging built around Gonzo the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Gonzo. He has been all alone ever since he can remember, a
period dating back in his nightmares to a time when Noah (F. Murray
Abraham) turned him away from the Ark for being one of a kind
(although Noah was kind enough to provide him with an umbrella).
</P>
<P>
   To his Muppet pals in the boarding house where they all live, he
describes himself as a one-of-a-kind freak. But kindly Kermit the
Frog, in one of the film's rare moments of compassion, tells him he
is, rather, distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo's life begins to change when he receives a message from
his alphabet breakfast cereal instructing him to watch the sky.
Soon Gonzo's efforts to link up with his extraterrestrial relatives
have brought him to the attention of a top-secret government
security agency and made him a springboard for the ambitions of
Miss Piggy, a television studio go-fer, to displace Shelly Snipes
(Andie MacDowell) as the host of a program called ``UFO Mania.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzo and his pal Rizzo the Rat are taken prisoner by the
men in black, the rest of the gang rides to the rescue in time to
deliver Gonzo from the hands of a mad surgeon to the rendezvous
point for linkup with his relatives from outer space. Here,
briefly, ``Muppets From Space'' comes close to mixing its puppet
stars, its human cast, its plot, its messages, its special effects
and its music into a satisfying brew.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulated by puppeteers like Dave Goelz (Gonzo), Steve
Whitmire (Kermit) and Oz (Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal, et al.),
the puppets as performers remain magical even when their material
is uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   The humans, led by Jeffrey Tambor as K. Edgar Singer, the
paranoid government alien hunter, and including Ms. MacDowell, Pat
Hingle, Ray Liotta, David Arquette, Rob Schneider and Hollywood
Hogan, lend themselves with admirable good will to the supporting
roles.

SOSA GOES TO BAT FOR WORLD `ALL-STARS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w, a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You think the all-stars are all at Fenway Park
today?
</P>
<P>
   Only some of them, says Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. In his
eyes, there also are ``all-stars of the world,'' people such as Li
Jun Cai of China, Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, and the Hyseni family
from Kosovo, who found a new home in Milton but are still far
afield from Fenway's spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Not one plays professional baseball, but the nonprofit
Interaction organization, capitalizing on the All-Star Game in
Boston and Sosa's fame, is presenting them and eight others as
hidden stars _ people who thrived in far corners of the world after
receiving US foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill today, enough private charity workers to fill
two baseball teams will distribute to members of Congress packs of
baseball cards with the pictures of these beneficiaries and their
life stories on the back. And yes, the packs come with bubblegum.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a centerfold of Sosa slugging a baseball.
Next to his picture is a quote from him: ``With the support of
Interaction's members and the resources of the United States,
millions of the world's poor improve their situation. Please take a
moment to read about some of these `All-Stars,' the MVPs of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the public relations equivalent of throwing a fat
pitch down the middle, but Interaction, a large coalition of
private aid groups, believes the cards get out the message that US
foreign aid can reap big benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A US House Appropriations subcommittee will take up the fiscal
2000 foreign aid bill Wednesday The Clinton administration has
requested $14.6 billion for foreign operations next year, but a
Senate bill whittled that down to $12.7 billion. US foreign
assistance has declined steadily over the last decade despite a
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ian M. Houston, Interaction's legislative director, dreamed up
the baseball card pitch on a plane ride from Washington to Salt
Lake City six months ago. Sosa, he believed, would be a natural
spokesman because ``he grew up in poverty in the Dominican
Republic, he himself is a great success story, and he helped others
after Hurricane Mitch last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa couldn't be reached for comment, but he isn't expected to
make a pitch for the unsung ``All-Stars'' during the Boston
festivities, Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be done by the Washington advocates, who will use the
cards to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign news too often is about disasters and conflict, Houston
said, adding, ``But there are success stories out there. These
images are not the typical ones that Americans see.''
</P>
<P>
   There's ``All-Star'' Li Jun Cai, 8, shown sitting happily among
100 ducklings. The boy's family received assistance from the Heifer
Project, based in Little Rock, Ark., which has helped thousands of
Chinese farmers raise low-cost livestock such as ducks, geese and
rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   There's Loti Sareyo of Tanzania, who learned from the Heifer
Project how to build ridges and drainage ditches across the steep
slope of his garden. Gaining profits from soil-conservation
techniques, Sareyo has been able to build a cement house for his
family.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Hyseni family, who resettled from Kosovo to Milton,
with the help of the International Institute of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And there's also Ren Je of China, holding in his arms a rabbit
from his family's farm; relatives Sunita and Sunanya Gurung of
Nepal, who received a small loan to expand their farm; and Quratul
Ain Bakhteari of Pakistan, who with the help of US charities
doubled girls' enrollments in regional schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this all-star push in a city that hasn't had a professional
baseball team since the Washington Senators last played in 1971
isn't expected to win immediate dividends, Houston acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often they (members of Congress) get these things and they
just toss it,'' he said. ``They won't toss this . . . and they may
find a few positive stories.''

THE DAYS OF FIGS AND HONEY ARE HERE, BORNE ON A BED OF ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By THOMAS KELLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)This is the last of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the
chef and owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. His
collaborator has been Michael Ruhlman. Next week: Waldy Malouf, the
chef of and a partner in Beacon in Manhattan.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of those great recipes, because it's so easy
and so satisfying. Hot figs and cold ice cream with honey _ that's
virtually all there is to it. You don't even have to make the ice
cream: buy some, let it sit until it's pliable and fold in the
honey.
</P>
<P>
   To make it even simpler, drizzle the honey on top of the ice
cream, or add it to the pan when you cook the figs. However you
want to incorporate the honey is fine.
</P>
<P>
   But it's important to use a honey of good quality. Taste a
variety and find one that you like. In the Napa Valley, there are a
lot of wildflowers and many people who gather honey, so wildflower
is the kind I like to use.
</P>
<P>
   The summertime here also brings an overabundance of figs on the
order of what most people have with tomatoes. So I serve figs in
salad, with lobster, for dessert or in a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive in two stages, the first crop in late spring, the
second in July. The later crop is high in sugar, perfect for this
dish. I usually use Mission and Brown Turkey varieties, but any fig
will work, as long as it's ripe and wonderful to eat just as it is.
The baking essentially turns the fig into a sauce within its own
skin.
</P>
<P>
   The vanilla bean, cooked and served with the fig, provides
additional flavor and visual components. Typically, vanilla bean is
incorporated into a preparation, like sauce anglaise. Here it's a
separate element, and it's fun to scrape the seeds out of the pod
and eat them with the ice cream and warm buttery sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I love the hot and cold combination in this dessert. It reminds
me of banana splits and hot fudge sundaes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VANILLA ROASTED FIGS WITH WILDFLOWER HONEY ICE CREAM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes plus chilling and freezing for the ice cream;
20 minutes for the figs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the ice cream:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   { cup wildflower honey
</P>
<P>
   12 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the figs:
</P>
<P>
   18 ripe figs (Black Mission, Brown Turkey, Adriatic Green or a
combination), washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   4 vanilla beans, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons sugar. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the ice cream: in a large saucepan, combine the milk,
cream and honey. Place over medium heat, and stir. When honey is
completely dissolved, remove pan from heat and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. With an electric mixer, or by hand in a metal bowl, whisk egg
yolks and sugar until they have thickened and lightened in color.
Gradually whisk in the warm milk mixture. Return mixture to
saucepan and place over medium-low heat. Stir until mixture coats
the back of a wooden spoon and reaches 175 degrees; do not
overheat. Immediately remove from heat and transfer to a mixing
bowl. Chill bowl by placing it in ice water, and allow mixture to
cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   3. Strain mixture into a container. Cover, and refrigerate for
at least 5 hours, or overnight. Freeze in an ice cream maker
according to manufacturer's instructions; then, transfer to a
covered container. Freeze for several hours, or until hardened.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare figs: slice off and discard tops of figs. Cut split
vanilla beans into 2-inch pieces. Make a small slit in top of each
fig, and insert a section of vanilla bean.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In an ovenproof pan large enough
to hold all the figs standing upright, melt butter over medium
heat. Add sugar, and stir to dissolve. Stand figs in the butter,
and add any remaining vanilla bean pieces to pan. Place pan in oven
until figs are thoroughly heated, about 10 minutes. Serve figs warm
or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, place a scoop of ice cream into each of six bowls.
Arrange three of the figs (with vanilla bean) around each scoop.
Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.  &QL;

SOY SAUCE AND FISH: MATCH MATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooking food in soy sauce is a tantalizing idea, but it can be
tricky. In large quantities the flavor is overpowering, and in
lesser amounts the sauce often burns, giving off a sharp,
unappealing aroma.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder soy sauce is most often used as a condiment. But it
actually makes a fine poaching liquid for fish, as long as you thin
it with water to prevent the burning and cut the saltiness (a
little sugar helps, too).
</P>
<P>
   The basic liquid can be enhanced with many different
combinations of seasonings, like minced ginger and garlic; the
juice of a lime and a tablespoon or so of sesame oil, or a little
wasabi paste and a garnish of shredded daikon. But it can be even
simpler _ often I just add a handful of chopped scallions and a
dried chili or two, or two or three spring onions or one yellow
onion, peeled and sliced.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the soy mixture to a boil, add the fish fillet or fish
steak, and poach, turning a few times. You'll be rewarded with
mahogany-colored, intensely flavored fish. The dish can be
garnished with the cooked scallions, and the poaching liquid _
slightly reduced, but now enhanced by the flavor of the fish _
makes a fine sauce for rice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides choosing good soy sauce _ find a brand you like, and
stick with it _ the one basic consideration is how much water to
add. If your soy sauce is mild, almost sweet (the kind you would
happily use as a plain dip for sushi), you can dilute it with an
equal part of water. But if it is strong and highly salty, use two
parts water to one part soy.
</P>
<P>
   The other decision is what kind of fish to poach. Striped bass,
now at the peak of its season, is a good suggestion. Supplies are
plentiful because this meaty, flavorful fish has, in recent years,
made a great comeback from overfishing and contamination.
</P>
<P>
   I've used this same preparation for halibut, monkfish and
salmon. If you use cod, undercook it slightly so it doesn't fall
apart. Red snapper, sea bass, swordfish and even sea scallops also
work, but they should be cooked for only three or four minutes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STRIPED BASS POACHED IN SPICY SOY SAUCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-third to { cup good soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   { to two-thirds cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   About 15 scallions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths, or 2 or
3 spring onions or 1 large onion, peeled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 dried or fresh chili, optional
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ pounds striped bass fillet, about 1 inch thick. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine the soy sauce, water, sugar, scallions and chili in a
skillet just large enough to hold the fish. Turn the heat to
medium-high, and bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the fish and adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles, but
not furiously. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning once or twice, until
the fish is coated with a brown glaze and cooked through. Serve
with white rice, spooning the sauce over all and garnishing with
the scallions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WINE OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Candido Salice Salentino Riserva 1994, Apulia, Italy. About $7.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts that Italy offers the world's best wine
bargains has only to try a bottle of this little gem. Salice
Salentino is one of eight wine districts in Apulia, in the extreme
southeast of Italy on the Adriatic coast.
</P>
<P>
   This is an estate-grown and produced wine, which means all the
grapes come from the Candido vineyards. The blend is 85 percent
negroamaro grapes and 15 percent malvasia nera. Although virtually
unknown in this country, negroamaro is an important grape in Italy.
Some 75,000 acres of it are planted south and east of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, negroamaro produces a wine very similar to a good
Chateauneuf-du-Pape. This is no Chateauneuf, but it is a solid,
full-flavored red wine with plenty of character. And the price for
a bottle is less than what most New York restaurants charge for a
glass of their cheap stuff.

 &HT;    Soccer's bra-haha a boost for Nike
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Brandi Chastain whipped off her jersey after the winning goal
in the Women's World Cup, exposing a downright chaste-looking
undergarment. What's the big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Her bra was designed as outerwear in the first place, Nike says.
</P>
<P>
   The company is so thrilled about Saturday evening's ``exposure''
_ ``momentary insanity,'' Chastain called it _ that it's giving its
post-World Cup ad campaign another look, a Nike spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
   Which means you might see that now-famous bra moment many, many,
many more times.
</P>
<P>
   The bra seen by millions is part of a new line Nike is launching
at the end of the month. And Chastain and four of her teammates
have apparel deals with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   Which has people wondering: While no one could have known the
game would end up on penalty kicks, much less that Chastain would
take the final one, was the bra-baring a setup? USA Today called it
``a conveniently revealing moment for Nike.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says it was a complete surprise. Will Chastain get
anything extra anyway? ``A huge thank-you,'' says Nike spokesman
Kathryn Reith. ``We haven't talked about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain is one of several woman athletes (teammates Tiffeny
Milbrett and Tisha Venturini included) who talked to Nike last year
about what a good sports bra needs.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to their gripes (too-tight bras, chafing,
breast-squishing, not enough support, sweat traps) and advice, Nike
developed a line of six sports bras called Inner Active. Chastain
wore one during Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The bras should reach stores in early August, and already are on
the Nike Web site under women's fitness apparel, Reith says. Price:
$40.
</P>
<P>
   Reith says Nike fitted the women's soccer team in April and
offered the bras to whoever wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Reith says, ``I'm still trying to figure out who wore
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, she says, Nike planned on making just one
``ultimate'' bra. But the athletes (tennis' Mary Pierce and Lindsey
Davenport among them) had various needs depending on breast size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The D-cup women want support, support, support,'' says Reith,
who reports that some women, frustrated, would wear two or three
bras at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smaller-busted women, like Brandi, didn't want to be
squished flat,'' Reith says. So Nike made six styles _ two for
smaller women, two for regular and two for large. Some are
racerback, like Chastain's, and others have the more traditional
adjustable back and straps.
</P>
<P>
   What does a sports bra need, anyway? Examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``When you run in a bra, the breasts move in kind of a flat
figure-eight pattern, not just up and down,'' Reith says. So Nike
added side panels for stability.
</P>
<P>
   -- Seams that don't chafe. Instead of putting seams on the tops
of the shoulders, the company moved them to the upper back.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wicking, to draw sweat away from the skin.
</P>
<P>
   A sports bra, Reith says, is ``an incredible piece of
equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, it seems, Nike got incredibly lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was screaming,'' Reith says, ``and when I saw what bra it
was, I screamed even louder.''

`ALI BABA AND THE 40 THIEVES': ENJOYABLE, BUT FALLS SHORT OF
ENCHANTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of ``Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves'' didn't make much of
an impression on me as a child. The idea of a magic password was
fun: two secret words (``Open, sesame'') that would make solid
mountain rocks move, allowing entrance into a secret cave. But when
Ali found all that stolen treasure inside, I lost interest. Maybe
children today have a greater appreciation of how much a huge cache
of jewels and gold coins could change their lives.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child,'' a
monthly series of familiar tales retold with particular attention
to sexual equality, takes on ``Ali Baba'' Wednesday night, and this
time the title character is a girl. (Ally McBeal, Ali MacGraw, Ali
Baba, what's the difference?) The resulting half-hour of animation
_ written by Gerard Brown, based on an adaptation by Anna Quindlen,
the novelist and former columnist for The New York Times, falls
short of enchanting. But it should make for enjoyable enough
viewing for children.
</P>
<P>
   If only a lot of it didn't look like a rehash of ``The Little
Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and several other Disney
animated films. Sure enough, Ali (with the voice of Jurnee
Smollett), who is headed out into the desert on her daily errands,
has a couple of cute animal sidekicks (in this case, a personable
camel and a pet snake). Sure enough, there are a couple of perky
musical numbers. Sure enough, there's a big, muscular guy with an
IQ of about 12 (Ali's brother, Cassim, who seems to spend his time
being fanned and fed by adoring girls who aren't as self-actualized
as Ali).
</P>
<P>
   In this version of the story Cassim (Tommy Davidson) manages to
get into the cave and becomes very excited about the vast wealth
inside, but then he can't remember the password to get out. ``Open
seven days'' is one of his many wrong guesses. It's a long story,
but he ends up covered in molten gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali Baba'' never really resolves the moral issue of profiting
from crime. In the end Ali takes only as much of the treasure as
she and her grandmother (Marla Gibbs) really need. But that still
leaves a message that taking stolen goods is sometimes OK.
</P>
<P>
   As HBO continues this series, it also might be nice to see a

MEN, START YOUR OVENS.

   By DIANE PETERSON   Santa Rosa (Calif.)   The Press Democrat,    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Now there's a no-nonsense, ``Real Man's
Cookbook'' for guys who don't eat quiche, but do want to bake their
own bread, brew their own ale and basically ``steak out'' their own
territory in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   With his tongue planted firmly in cheek, David Bowers wrote
``Bake It Like a Man'' (William Morrow, 1999, $16) as a
quasi-humorous guide for men who want to take back the knife _ the
cleaver, the garlic press and the wire whisk _ to prove their
status as ``high priests of self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite healthy servings of humor _ and help from his wife,
Sharon, a food-writer, the book is dead serious about men's right
to do it their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is the last frontier for modern man; and no, no,
he doesn't need any help, thanks,'' Bowers states in the
introduction. ``Real men aren't looking to rush things. We want to
do things a certain way, and we want that way to be the man's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specific rules: a real man doesn't work with leftovers;
ingredients must be pristine, of the highest quality, organic if at
all possible. Also, real men are not daunted by big, imposing
projects and treat their kitchens like a domestic laboratory. (If
you doubt any of the above, check out Jeffrey Steingarten's
imposing tome, ``The Man Who Ate Everything.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Bake It Like a Man'' gets cooking with a chapter on tools
entitled ``Men and Hardware.'' The joy of hand-to-hand combat with
dough is detailed in a chapter on baking bread and pizza, followed
by a juicy discussion of ``Men and Meat'' and ``Men and Flame'' _
``the smoke, the fire, the raw meat in our tongs, the wind in our
hair ... it's an elemental experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The age-old taunt _ my pot is bigger than yours _ is replayed in
the chapter on ``Men and Big Food.'' We're talkin' turkey here,
plus crowd-pleasing recipes for paella, jambalaya and Big Fat
Italian Lasagna. The gut-bustin' fun continues with ``Men and
Fat,'' which offers recipes for Cadillac Mac and Cheese and Classic
Fettuccine Alfredo, among other rich favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and Hot Foods,'' ``Men and Fermentation,'' and ``Pommmes
des Hommes,'' round out the book, along with a final ``Brass
Tacks'' guide to the basics, from making Marinara Sauce to the
Perfect Caesar Salad.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, who wooed me by making a mustard-shrimp dish from
``The Silver Palate Cookbook'' then retreated from the kitchen for
the next 12 years, is definitely getting a copy of ``Bake it Like a
Man'' as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be duct-taped to the blowtorch he'll use to finish
off the Creme Brulee recipe on page 131 _ and to clean up after
he's done.
</P>
<P>
   David Bowers writes: I am a long time connoisseur of huevos
rancheros, and the recipe below is the result of years of
tinkering. The basic dish is heated tortillas with fried eggs,
grated cheese and a hefty dose of Salsa Cruda. Over time, I've
gradually made little adjustments to the topping that have improved
it dramatically. The hint of cinnamon and beef stock make a more
full-bodied salsa, the touch of chipolte adds a smoky richness,
while the dish remains simple.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Makes 1 hefty serving
</P>
<P>
   3 corn tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup salsa
</P>
<P>
   1/4 beef bouillon cube (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 canned chipolte pepper en adobo finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated melting cheese (such as mozzarella, Jack, or
Havarti)
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Heat a dry cast iron or other unlined skillet over high heat and
put a tortilla in each for 10 seconds per side, until they start to
color. Remove to a plate, overlapping in a cloverleaf pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil in a skillet and fry the
eggs in whatever style you like. I like yolks soft for this dish.
</P>
<P>
   While the eggs are frying, heat the salsa in a small saucepan
over medium heat with the beef bouillon cube, cinnamon, and
chipolte. Stir the salsa well and heat through.
</P>
<P>
   Spread a few spoons of the sauce over the tortillas. Lay the
eggs on the sauce-spread tortillas. Pour the remaining sauce over
the top of the eggs. Sprinkle generously with the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Place the plate under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes, until the
cheese melts completely. Garnish with cilantro, if desired. Serve
immediately.

TELEGRAPH STATION TAPS ITS LAST CODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALF MOON BAY, Calif. _ In the age of satellites and dot.coms,
the last distinctive dots and dashes of commercial telegraph
transmission faded into history Monday night at four telegraph
stations in North America.
</P>
<P>
   At just before 5 p.m. Pacific time, Globe Wireless sent out its
last transmission. The company signed off the air using the same
line Samuel F.B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph, used in the
first message he sent in 1844 from Washington, D.C., to his
assistant in Baltimore: ``What hath God wrought?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on hand was Dalton Bergstedt, 92, who 27 years ago
managed this small marine communications station, surrounded by
cows and radio towers, which beamed messages by Morse code to ships
across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being home again,'' who needed a cane to steady
himself as he sat in a swivel chair before the radio telegraph
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Half Moon Bay station and three others were the last in
North America to broadcast ship-to-shore messages by Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Wireless, based in Foster City, confirmed what many in the
shipping business have long said: The telegraph is as obsolete as
the horse and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three decades, ships have been shifting to other
technologies: satellite communications, high-frequency radios and
most recently electronic mail, which allows ships to send vast
amounts of information at speeds much faster than any telegraph
operator can type.
</P>
<P>
   But for operators like Bergstedt, the change is bittersweet.
Though ships may benefit from the new technology, it also means the
end of the line for radio telegraph operators _ known
affectionately as ``sparks'' for the electric sparks originally
generated by the friction of the early telegraph transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad event for me, but I know it's for the best,''
Bergstedt said. ``It will improve maritime communications (to be)
much better than they ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipping lines were among the last companies to give up the
telegraph. While land-based businesses long ago moved to using
phones, fax machines and other communications technology, seamen
appreciated the dependability of the radio telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very solid, reliable form of communication for all
these years,'' said Tim Gorman, director of operations for the Half
Moon Bay station for Globe Wireless. ``But nowadays it's just too
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed has been the Achilles heel of the radio telegraph. The
pace of the Morse code messages is limited by typing speed. To earn
a first- class license, operators have to type at least 25 words a
minute, retired operator John Brundage, 72, said. For a
second-class license, the minimum speed is 18 words a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Some also complain that radio telegraph systems are limited in
the amount and kinds of data they can transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you send a drawing via Morse code? How do you send a
picture via Morse code?'' said Peter Kierans, a vice president for
corporate development of Globe Wireless, which is intent on selling
ships e-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kierans said today's shipping lines are trying to run their
ships with minimal crews and see hiring a radio operator as too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of having a skilled radio person on each ship
doesn't fit into today's method of operation,'' he said. ``It's an
extra expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tasks that radio operators on ships used to perform
have now been automated as well, making the radio operator less
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the International Marine Organization, a United Nations
agency, established the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.
Instead of having operators relay ``SOS'' in writing, anyone on the
ship can simply push a specific button that indicates a certain
problem _ sinking, capsizing, dead in the water. A signal then is
automatically sent out to the nearest vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Lee, a radio telegraph history buff who will be teaching a
course on the history of telecommunications at Golden Gate
University next fall, says Morse code won't become a dead language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be hobbyist uses,'' Lee said. ``The
amateur radio operators still operate Morse code. You can hear it
any night on any band.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, like China and Russia, have been slow to make
the transition away from radio telegraph and may not change for
years, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   To some veteran telegraph operators, the move away from Morse
code is risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellites go down,'' said Denice Stoops, who says she was the
first female radio operator in the United States when she began in
1979, but lost her job when Globe Wireless bought and closed the
Point Reyes marine radio station in 1997. ``I think this will still
remain as the most reliable and probably the cheapest and most
dependable in an emergency.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Bergstedt recalls when he took a distress call from a passenger
liner that struck a reef off Mexico's coast in 1931 and was sinking
fast. The freighter he was on was just 40 miles away, and was able
to respond fast enough to save the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident more often recalled came after the Titanic
struck an iceberg and the ship's telegrapher dispatched an urgent
call for help. Some 1,500 Titanic passengers and crew died.
</P>
<P>
   Another ship, the Californian, was nearby, but its radio
operator had gone off duty and never heard the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Brundage said people should realize that radio operators did far
more than just give and take dictation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of technical stuff,'' he said. ``Being on a
freighter or tanker, if something breaks down, you're it. You've
got to fix it. So you're a technician as well.''

IN IDAHO, A SECLUDED LOG CABIN, WITH A 1,000-ACRE BACKYARD

<P>
   To get the confusing part out of the way: the Idaho Rocky
Mountain Ranch is not really a ranch, and while it is in the
northern Rockies, the mountains visible from the front porch of the
ranch's main building _ snowcapped peaks towering 3,000 feet or
more above a basin that is already 6,700 above sea level _ are
called the Sawtooth Mountains, birthplace of the Salmon River and a
lure to wilderness lovers and backpackers who gladly climb
heart-stopping trails for a glimpse of a hidden Alpine lake.
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch is an oasis of understated
comfort and civilization in the wilderness of south-central Idaho.
If a 1,000-acre spread can be said to be tucked in anywhere, this
one can. Its main building, an 8,000-square-foot lodge of hand-cut
pine logs, sits far back behind a little ridge that makes it nearly
invisible from the state road that bisects the property. We had
driven right past the ranch on a previous visit to the area without
even noticing it.
</P>
<P>
   Built by a New York businessman in 1930 as a private hunting
club, _ it was bought in 1951 by the Idaho family that still owns
it. Twenty years ago, the ranch began taking paying customers; with
a capacity of 40 to 50 guests in eight two-unit log cabins, a
single cabin and four rooms in the main lodge, it is almost always
full. Four years ago, it was added to the National Register of
Historic Places. uest rooms have private baths and electricity,
but no telephones, television, radios or even clocks. My travel
alarm clock never made it out of my suitcase. We left the window
shades up and let the sun do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Our family visit to the ranch, for four days last August, was
largely accidental. On a previous Idaho vacation, we had driven 60
miles up State Highway 75 from Sun Valley to Redfish Lake, a
popular boating and fishing spot that takes its name from the red
sockeye salmon that spawned there in great numbers in happier days
for that threatened species. Last year we hoped to stay there, at
Redfish Lake Lodge, a rustic hotel overlooking the lake's swimming
beach. It turned out to be fully booked for our long August
weekend, and the manager referred me to a place with a ``somewhat
different atmosphere'' only five miles away: the Idaho Rocky
Mountain Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhat different'' was an understatement. While I still
think a visit to the Redfish Lake Lodge would be great fun, it is
basically a bustling waterfront summer camp _ RVs jostling for
space, hikers stocking up at the general store _ compared with the
ranch's relative isolation and blissful serenity. Not that guests
at Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch are expected to take a vow of
silence: small children and extended families are much in evidence,
and most guests choose to eat meals with other guests at big tables
in the cozy dining room, dominated by an impressive stone
fireplace. Our Thursday arrival coincided with the weekly barbecue
night, and a five-member Western band provided foot-stompin' backup
as guests sat on the porch watching the sun set over the mountains
and savoring their salmon and barbecued ribs.
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho mountains might not seem like a culinary capital, but
the kitchen is in fact the pride of the place. The ranch bakes its
own bread and pastries, including peach and apple strudel for
breakfast and the walnut-basil wheat bread served one night at
dinner. A typical dinner menu offered a choice of three entrees:
grilled Chilean sea bass in an orange rum sauce; rainbow rotini
with roasted yellow pepper and garlic; and New York-style steak in
a pepper mustard sauce. Dress for these elegant meals is most
informal; blue jeans or even shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast and dinner are included in the rate. Depending on the
capacity of the dining room, a limited number of nonguests are
accommodated for dinner at $38 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Our log-cabin room, with a fireplace and a walk-in dressing
area, was a rather tight fit when the roll-away bed for our
13-year-old daughter, Hannah, was open. Families with more than one
child would almost certainly need a second room. But the cabins are
strictly for sleeping. Ranch life centers on the lodge's porch,
where the rocking chairs are inviting, and lemonade, beer and other
drinks are always available.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's property, mostly undeveloped, includes hiking trails
through sage-covered hills, a stocked trout pond and a swimming
pool filled with the warm and slightly sulfuric waters of a nearby
hot spring. Although daytime temperatures were in the 80s, the
night chill arrived quickly once the sun began to set, and the
hot-spring pool beckoned. One night, a dramatic summer storm began
to play out over the mountains as we soaked peacefully and paddled
on inner tubes. A full moon rose behind us in a clear sky while
lightning flashed over the high peaks in the distance ahead. With
reluctance, we bowed to safety concerns and left the pool, glad to
have caught the show. The pool is open 24 hours a day, and the
management gently reminds guests not to forget their bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   There is no riding program as such, but half-day, full-day and
overnight horseback rides are available at a nearby stable.
Allergies and fear make us a nonriding family, but we spoke to
experienced riders from Southern California who were ecstatic over
their full day of challenging trail riding in the nearby White
Cloud range.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner table and pool, we met people from every part of
the country. Many were repeat visitors; for some, the ranch was
respite at the end of days of backpacking and camping in the
surrounding Sawtooth National Forest or the nearby Frank
Church-River of No Return Wilderness. This 2.4-million acre
preserve, bigger than Yellowstone National Park, is the largest
wilderness area in the lower 48 states. No motorized vehicles are
permitted, and the area is best known for the whitewater rafting
trips on the Middle Fork of the Salmon River.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to several wilderness areas in this part of Idaho is
Stanley, the region's metropolis with a permanent population of 69.
It is nine miles up the road from the ranch, and while no
settlement with an espresso and ice cream bar named Peaks and Perks
can be considered completely outside the American mainstream,
Stanley is isolated _ its few square blocks are lined with
outfitters and suppliers for rafters, hikers and campers. State
Highway 21, the northern route that we took from Boise, 130 miles
away, is sometimes closed during the winter. The Stanley Basin
traps cold air, and the town often runs second only to
International Falls, Minn., as the coldest spot in the lower 48,
with temperatures of minus-40 degrees not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We used the ranch as our base for exploring Stanley and the
surrounding area. While it is California that is busy celebrating
the 150th anniversary of the Gold Rush, the quest for gold shaped
Idaho's early history as well. Stanley is named for Capt. John
Stanley, a prospector who passed through in 1863 with a party of 75
other hopefuls. He kept going and never came back, but others in
his group established a permanent settlement. The cozy Stanley
Museum, in a former ranger station on Highway 75, tells the story
of Stanley's days as a service center for nearby gold mining towns,
some of which remain ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   But traces of the town's gold mining past extend far beyond the
museum, at a series of sites along the Yankee Fork of the Salmon
River. The Land of the Yankee Fork Historic Area, managed by the
Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation and two federal agencies,
the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, covers an
area from just east of Stanley to Challis, 50 miles to the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the historic area's unpaved roads require a vehicle with
high ground clearance, but there's enough of interest to see
without one. We turned off Highway 75 onto a paved road at Sunbeam
and followed the Yankee Fork _ in late summer, more of a shallow
stream than a river _ to the ghost town of Bonanza. A few
tumbledown structures are all that remain, and we were startled
later to see a photograph of elegantly dressed 19th-century ladies
playing croquet on a manicured Bonanza lawn. In the cemetery, the
graves date from the 1870s to the 1950s; several of the early ones
are those of Chinese immigrants. The mining towns were multiethnic
societies, and the Chinese, who worked as cooks and operated
laundries in the mining camps, were one of the biggest immigrant
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The museum in Custer, a better preserved ghost town a few miles
up the road, displayed the Census of 1880 _ 129 men, 8 women and 10
children, from two dozen states and 16 foreign countries. At its
peak, Custer had a population of 600. But by 1911, the mining era
had ended and the place was abandoned until the 1960s, when some
counter-culture types set up housekeeping in the old structures
until the Forest Service kicked them out.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the mining towns died out, gold fever lingered. In
the late 1930s, a group of investors came up with the idea of
dredging the bed of the Yankee Fork a half mile south of Custer for
the placer gold, nuggets and flakes that had washed down over eons
of erosion from veins high in the mountains. To accomplish this,
they commissioned the Yankee Fork Gold Dredge. If a battleship had
been designed by Rube Goldberg and then beached in a remote gully,
it might look something like this contraption. More than 100 feet
long (200 feet with various attachments at bow and stern) and 64
feet high, its purpose was to dig up the riverbed gravel and work
it through a series of sorting devices to find gold that the owners
believed would have a value of $12 million. It took more than 6
million cubic yards of gravel to yield enough gold for a two-foot
brick.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much gold the 988-ton dredge actually found
during the five years it was used. The volunteer guides at the site
said the owners did quite well. The same cannot be said of the
surrounding landscape _ the dredge churned through almost one mile
of riverbed a year, leaving huge piles of gravel along the bank,
scarring an otherwise nearly pristine area with a five-mile trail
of ugliness that leads to the dredge's final resting place, where
the riverbed, and dreams, ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Our other excursions from the ranch included a boat ride across
Redfish Lake and a six-mile hike back, up steep switchbacks and
along a high ridge with great views of the lake and surrounding
mountains. Guided nature walks are also offered through the lake's
visitor center.
</P>
<P>
   We also stopped at the Sawtooth Fish Hatchery, a state facility
that has the daunting mission of trying to bring back the local
salmon populations that have been dangerously depleted by the eight
dams standing between their Idaho spawning grounds and the Pacific
Ocean 900 miles away. The hatchery, just north of the Idaho Rocky
Mountain Ranch on Highway 75, welcomes visitors with tours,
informative exhibits, and even food for the distinctly unendangered
rainbow trout raised there for stocking nearby streams.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning in summer at 9, hatchery workers check a trap to
see if any adult Chinook salmon have made it back from the ocean,
up through the Columbia, Snake and Salmon Rivers, to spawn and die
here in their Idaho mountain birthplace. Hatchery workers
accelerate those last natural events, killing the fish and taking
their eggs and sperm to insure a higher breeding success. More than
90 percent of the fertilized eggs will survive to hatch here,
compared with fewer than 10 percent in the wild. The Chinook's
fertility is impressive; in two long tanks, we saw 137,000
hatchlings from 27 adult females. But fewer than one in a thousand
of the young Chinook will make it back as adults. On the two
mornings we visited the hatchery, the trap was empty of returning
salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Another worthwhile excursion was a scenic drive over an unmarked
dirt road the locals aptly refer to as Nip and Tuck (be sure to ask
for directions). The road climbs to offer a magnificent view of the
entire Stanley Basin.
</P>
<P>
   To prolong our stay in the back country, we signed up with one
of the Stanley outfitters for a half-day whitewater trip on the
main Salmon River for the morning we checked out of the ranch;
later, in the afternoon, we would drive south to Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-mile river tri0 began under bright sun but ended with a
vivid display of the mountains' volatile weather: rain, thunder,
lightning, a 30-degree temperature drop and hail. As we sat,
paddling and shivering, bare arms and legs pelted by ice, I had
only one thought: to get back to the Idaho Rocky Mountain Ranch and
soak in the hot-spring pool. Then came the sad realization that we
had already checked out. True, a hot shower awaited us in our
rented Sun Valley condo. But somehow it just wouldn't be the same.

Idaho 83278, (208) 774-3544, fax (208) 774-3477, is 9 miles south

   WASHINGTON _ Drivers who prefer roomy sports utility vehicles
don't have to sacrifice clean air and fuel efficiency, the Union of
Concerned Scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, the group described how its engineers used
existing technology to design ``the UCS Exemplar,'' a modified Ford
Explorer with 50 percent better gas mileage and 75 percent less
pollution that the original production model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher efficiency and lower pollution don't have to come in a
small car package,'' said Jason Mark, senior transportation
analyst. ``We redesigned the SUV with the environment in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency's car
exhaust standards will require reduced emissions from light trucks,
which include minivans and SUVs. The UCS Exemplar gets 28.4 miles
per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned car is more expensive to buy, but officials said
that cost would be offset by lower fuel bills over the life of the
vehicle. Mark said owners of the new vehicle could save $1,600 over
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to tell the American public, `Thou shalt not
drive sports utility vehicles,''' said Howard Ris, executive
director of UCS. ``Just if you do drive one, you're entitled to a
cleaner one and a more efficient one.''
</P>
<P>
   UCS says that among the improvements they made to the car are a
higher-efficiency engine, low-resistance tires, improved
aerodynamics, and weight reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford Motor Co. supports making cleaner vehicles,
``environment hasn't been a driving force'' in the SUV market, Mark
said. ``The priority hasn't been on fuel economy in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The average light truck emits 47 percent more smog-forming
pollutants and 43 percent more global warming pollutants than the
average car, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Ris agreed saying that consumers have tended to focus on the
style and size of the vehicles _ ``the number of coffee cup
containers in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark said the market success of vehicles designed according to
the Exemplar's standards is contingent on consumer demand and
interest.

`BLAIR WITCH PROJECT': VANISHED IN THE WOODS, PANIC MEETS
IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a cabin built entirely out of soda cans, ``The Blair Witch
Project'' is a nifty example of how to make something out of
nothing. Nothing but imagination, and a game plan so enterprising
it should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in only eight days with no real script, this little movie
is a locomotive pulling a Web site, a mythology, a special on the
Sci-Fi Channel and assorted tie-ins in its wake. And all of it,
including the film's cult status, has been skillfully spun out of
thin air.
</P>
<P>
   The horror genre is ideal for the bare-bones (pardon the
expression) nature of this undertaking. And it enabled the
filmmakers to turn a near-total absence of resources into a
creative advantage. Five friends who had come out of the University
of Central Florida's film program realized that the best way to
make a movie without sets, costumes, music or special effects would
be to incorporate that spareness into the story. With no easy
formulas to fall back on, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (who
are jointly credited with writing, directing and editing) give
their audiences no easy idea /f what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' begins by announcing the
disappearance of three documentary filmmakers in the woods of
Maryland in 1994 and presents itself as the scenes they left
behind. That way, its scrappy home-movie style is completely, even
ingeniously, appropriate to its story. It so knowingly summons the
atmosphere of a no-budget indie shoot that we even see the
filmmakers filming themselves buying marshmallows for their trip,
and zooming in to a tight close-up of the plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   It also amusingly differentiates between the solemn,
self-important documentary being made (with a narrator sitting in a
cemetery talking of stories ``etched in stone'') and the
behind-the-scenes slacking and carousing of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The on-camera filmmakers, Heather, Mike and Josh, are played by
Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard with a
warts-and-all improvised verisimilitude, no doubt heightened by the
conditions under which they worked. As documentarians exploring the
legend of the title witch, on a mission that eventually leads them
into the woods under increasingly scary circumstances, the actors
were put through a comparable wringer during shooting.
</P>
<P>
   They actually wielded the film's cameras, and they were left
cold, hungry, lost and increasingly angry, just like the characters
they play. One byproduct of this approach is an acute sensitivity
to things that go bump in the night. Another is the gratingly
limited vocabulary, full of virtually nonstop bleepables, which
makes the film somewhat hard on the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for horrific special effects are under every rock
here. More interestingly, the filmmakers confine themselves to
using the rocks themselves as alarming effects, not to mention the
twig figures that, when found hanging from the trees in the
morning, cause a considerable stir. In a textbook illustration of
how a literal image counts for less than its implicit horror, the
``Blair Witch'' crew creates a string of spooky occurrences in the
forest. It would seem that someone is following the filmmakers,
making strange noises outside their tent, leaving creepy souvenirs
for them and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a most inventive departure from
standard horror fare, is frightening only insofar as its
characters' panic seems real. Everything else is left to the
imagination. And the imagination works overtime watching the acuity
of these talented filmmakers, and wondering what bright idea
they'll have next.
</P>

   ROME _ Sometimes art does not survive death, at least in the
case of some contemporary art in Rome. Four days after it opened,
an exhibition titled ``Life Beyond: The Vision of Death in
Contemporary Art'' closed Tuesday amid recriminations and smashed
artworks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, offering 24 works on the theme of death by some
of Italy's most promising contemporary artists, was being held in
the famous non-Catholic cemetery in Rome where John Keats and Percy
Bysshe Shelley are buried. On most days, the cemetery is a haven of
tranquility whose silence is only sporadically disturbed by the
sotto voce murmurings of Keats devotees in particular, who stand
respectfully by his violet-covered grave raptly declaiming his
melancholy odes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the exhibition opened last week, however, the cemetery has
been abuzz with bitter words and controversy. First, an
opening-night cocktail party was canceled after prominent members
of the local English-speaking community objected to its being held
on hallowed ground. Then the opening itself _ which was to include
poetry readings, a contemporary dance piece and classical music _
was canceled altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, only two days after the exhibition opened, organizers
were urgently called to the cemetery because three of the artworks
had been smashed to pieces. On Tuesday the artists voted to close
the show rather than risk destruction of the remaining works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry that this happened,'' said Carmine Sorrentino,
one of the show's curators. ``The exhibition was meant to be a
reflection on death and contemporary art, and we didn't mean to
offend anyone or do anything that would be upsetting. But we cannot
continue after this. The artists have decided to pull out because
they found this manifestation of violence to be offensive to them
and to all contemporary art.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has been charged in connection with the works'
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble began when the editors of Wanted in Rome, a biweekly
publication that is staple reading for English-speaking residents,
heard about the exhibition and organized an angry letter-writing
and press campaign against it. The editors said the exhibition, and
especially the opening night cocktail party, manifested a lack of
sensitivity toward the relatives of those buried in the
still-active cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a disaster,'' said Claire Hammond, owner of
an English-language bookstore in Rome. ``All those people and
cigarette butts everywhere among the tombs. The bottom line is that
this was a lack of respect for the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why Wanted in Rome, which deals more in classified
ads than in controversy, had taken up the cause, the publication's
editor, Mary Wilsey, said, ``We received dozens of phone calls from
outraged private citizens who felt that this was not the way to
treat a cemetery.'' She said their criticisms had been directed not
at the organizers of the exhibition, who she conceded had received
permission to use the cemetery, but at the cemetery's director and
the committee of 12 ambassadors that oversees its administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are taking the Italians to task,'' she said.
``They have done nothing wrong. What we are worried about is a
cemetery that has been badly administered.''
</P>
<P>
   That was small consolation for the curators of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Sorrentino lamented that the destruction of the artworks had
been virtually ignored in the Italian news media and in cultural
circles and suggested that there was not much sympathy for
contemporary art in Italy. ``When they knock a few noses off the
statues in Villa Borghese, you get pandemonium in the press,'' he
said. ``In this case we were put in the back pages.''
</P>
<P>
   In Italian the cemetery's proper name is Cimitero Acattolico
(Non-Catholic cemetery). In English, it is often wrongly referred
to as the Protestant or English cemetery, though it has always been
open to other denominations. (Many Orthodox Jews are buried there,
as well as other Jews and some Catholics in graves belonging to
non-Catholic members of the same family.) Since 1953 the
regulations have specified that those buried there should be
``non-Catholic citizens,'' though there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery has existed since the middle of the 18th century,
though not in its present form, and in the early part of its
history it was no stranger to controversy. Before the papacy lost
its temporal powers in 1870, non-Catholics were often forced to
bury their dead at night, and crosses and inscriptions that
suggested the possibility of attaining eternal bliss were not
allowed to appear on their tombstones.
</P>
<P>
   Though still open for burials, the cemetery is mostly visited
nowadays by tourists: 10,000 to 15,000 a year are drawn to the
site's history and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The art exhibition, consisting mostly of sculptures and
installations, had been set up in the old part of the cemetery,
where the more historic graves are. The placement of the artworks
ranged from the whimsical _ in the case of Felice Levini's
conceptual offering, an electric blue urn and an upended black
table, with ``Only one day without an end'' written across the top,
facing the tomb of the the 18th-century Neo-Classical painter Asmus
Jacob Carstens _ to the poetic, in the case of Luigi Ontani's
brightly colored Egyptian sarcophagus, probably the ultimate symbol
of death, set against the imposing mass of the pyramid of Caius
Cestius.
</P>
<P>
   A work that consisted of three terra cotta sculptures by
Benedetto Pietromarchi was placed upon a wall in the shadow of the
Caius Cestius pyramid, which dates from the first century B.C.
Sometime on Sunday morning, those three figures were thrown over
the side and smashed to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Two other artworks were destroyed, both of them installations:
``Alien Next to Hollywood. Roswell, New Mexico 1947,'' a
cryptically titled work by Adrian Tranquilli consisting of a white
plaster sculpture of the supposed Roswell alien, and a piece by
Marina Paris in which three bodyless elementary school uniforms
seemed to grow like bright black and blue flowers from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Pietromarchi was dismayed by the destruction, especially because
two of the sculptures had recently been sold to different buyers.
He said he had not yet told the works' owners about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily I was insured,'' he said, gazing down upon his broken
statues, ``but that's small consolation. It doesn't make up for
this at all.''  &QL;

   VALUJET-INDICT _ MIAMI _ A federal grand jury today is expected
to indict the air maintenance company that packed more than 140
flammable oxygen-generating canisters later placed on ValuJet
Airlines Flight 592, which slammed into the Everglades moments
after takeoff in 1996, killing all 110 aboard. Critics have charged
that, three years later, many dramatic changes promised in the wake

Lockheed officials to the news that a House subcommittee voted to
withhold the $1.8 billion that had been budgeted to buy six F-22s,
proposing to use the money instead to expand the fleet of older
F-15s and F-16s. This follows bad news for the C130. The committee
told the Air Force to rethink or reject the $70 billion program,

   AUSTIN-ECONOMY _ WASHINGTON _ Austin has the reputation as
Texas's high-tech heaven, but Dallas has the mojo. A new study
measuring the impact of new technologies on regional economies
shows that metro Dallas is second only to the Silicon Valley for
being a tech mega-center. Austin-San Marcos turns up as No. 21 on a
list of 315 cities studied. But an economist who helped prepare the
study, Perry Wong, says Austin's place among the Top 25 tech
centers may be more precarious that city boosters may believe, and
that Dallas is more firmly entrenched. That's because Dallas has a
very complex technology base, with seven different high-tech
industries represented. Austin, in contrast, has a lot of high-tech
jobs, but they are highly concentrated in the business of making
computers. (Geewax, Cox News Service). 25.

   &UR; QUICKIE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to their car from a shopping tour, one of the
young ladies realized that she had forgotten to stop at the
pharmacy for her birth control pills. She rushed into the nearest
pharmacy and gave her prescription to the pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   `Please fill this immediately,` she asked. `I've got people
waiting in my
</P>
<P>
   car!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL EXAM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The not necessarily well-prepared student sat in his life
science classroom staring at a question on the final exam paper.
The question directed: `Give four advantages of breast milk.` What
to write? He sighed, and began to scribble whatever came into his
head, hoping for the best:
</P>
<P>
   1. No need to boil.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cats can't steal it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Available whenever necessary.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good - maybe. But the exam demanded a four-part
answer. Again, what to write? Once more, he sighed. He frowned. He
scowled, then sighed again. But suddenly, he brightened. He grabbed
his pen, and triumphantly, he scribbled his definitive answer:
</P>
<P>
   4. Available in attractive containers.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to how hot it was earlier today -- I'm not making this
up, this was true. Earlier today, a guy, a fat guy, falls asleep on
a waterbed, it's so hot he wakes up with a hard-boiled ass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you can tell it's summer in New York! Here's what
happened last night -- they found a naked dead guy in the tank at
Red Lobster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, my bug zapper, honest to God, dropped more flies
than a White House intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only hot here in New York City, it's hot down there
in Washington, D.C. It was so hot earlier today, President Clinton
dropped his pants in front of an air conditioner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hot in the White House, President Clinton was
staying very, very close to Hillary -- just for the chill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hot in the Oval Office, interns were crawling under
Clinton's desk just for the shade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Yeltsin has announced that next year he's going to
resign, step down as President of Russia. He's going to take a
couple of months off and he's going to run for Senate from New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hot today, Hillary Clinton has changed her mind, she's
going to run for the Senate from Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news yesterday in New York. Here in Manhattan, we had the
power blackouts -- lost power because of the heat and the city went
black. It was awful, down there at Dunkin' Donuts, the power went
off -- the mice were eating dinner by candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton this week is kicking off her listening
tour.'She's traveling around the state of New York listening.'
Here's what she should have been doing: she should have been
listening outside the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all very excited here in New York because
Hillary has started her four-day statewide New York listening
tour'...And right after that she'll begin her illegal fundraising
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   This listening tour,' I'm baffled by this, I just don't get it.
What is the point, the listening tour?' I mean, my God, after being
married to Clinton, you think she'd heard it all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's running for Senate...This is an historic
moment for Hillary Clinton. This is their first step toward the
Clintons becoming a two-impeachment family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you know Hillary Clinton is in New York State now
on her listening tour.' The campaign is all starting to come
together: she's on the listening tour now, she's raising funds,
next week she's hiring male interns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think honestly Hillary is starting to feel more at ease with
New Yorkers because she opened up a campaign speech earlier today
by doing a couple of jokes about Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This listening tour, she's driving around New York State
listening to the voters...And the voters are all telling Hillary,
Go back to Arkansas!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they're playing another one of those interleague
deals, Subway Series,' the Yankees and the Mets...Everybody asking
Hillary, Who do you prefer, the Yankees or the Mets?'...It's not a
fair question to ask Hillary. That's like asking Bill, Who's your
favorite Jane Doe?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and Hillary are coming to New York City so she can run
for Senate. They've already got a house picked out and the rent for
this house is $20,000 damn dollars...Bill and Hillary are on a
budget, they only can afford to spend $10,000 a month. They're not
worried because Hillary's sure she can make up the difference with
a crooked real estate deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons don't want to spend more than $10,000 a month on
their new home. Keep something in mind, folks -- this is the same
couple that was charging $50,000 a night to sleep in the Lincoln
Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say what you will about Bill Clinton, he's a very simple guy
when it comes to housing. Really, if you think about it, all he
wants, all he needs is a roof over his head and an intern under his
desk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, President Clinton, her husband, he's on a poverty
tour, and earlier today or yesterday, he stopped at a Sioux
reservation in North Dakota. It's interesting, the Sioux have kind
of a cute nickname for President Clinton -- they call him Chief
Crazypants.'''

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I charged onto the subway train, found it too crowded and
decided to wait for the next one. My right leg touched the platform
just as the doors closed on my left leg. ``Open the doors,'' I
yelped, and although the doors often open and close several times
before the train takes off, they didn't this time. I decided the
only way out was to pull _ my leg slid free with more ease than I
expected, but my left shoe was lost inside the car as I fought my
way free.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the car, an attractive, well-dressed man picked up the
shoe and held it near the window for me to see. The train headed
out of the station as I screamed, ``Leave it at the next station!''
I didn't know whether he heard me, but I thought he gave me two
thumbs up. There I was at the 50th Street station, to all intents
and purposes shoeless. Going home to get another pair was
logistically out of the question; buying another pair was a
possibility but too time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   I boarded the next train at the exact spot my loafer had left
me. My hope, wishful thinking, was that the Samaritan would be
waiting at the comparable spot at Times Square. When we arrived
there, I leapt off the train and ran up and down the platform. No
shoe. I accepted my fate and got back on the train. As I stood
inside the door looking out, I saw my shoe, delicately placed by
the garbage can right in front of me. I leapt out, grabbed it and
made it back on board. The other passengers were gaping.
</P>
<P>
   -KRISTIN HARDING
</P>
<P>
   Walking on the west side of Broadway near 87th Street, Stella
Chess found her way barred by an elderly man. She looked around and
saw that in fact, a cordon of people was sealing off an area of the
pavement. A little girl of about 6, and a number of men, women and
youngsters were diligently searching the sidewalk. The child's
father was urging her to give up, but several people told him to
hush.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the girl's tooth had come loose, and as she wiggled
it to show her father, it came out in her hand and she dropped it.
She began searching, and as she became increasingly upset, more and
more passers-by joined her search. The group informally assigned
itself to different areas and finally, the tooth was found. Within
seconds, the Samaritans once again became hurried and harried New
Yorkers. They were off even before the father could thank them.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Power was walking along Lexington Avenue recently when
he noticed a postal worker hunkered down by an open mailbox,
shoveling letters into his bag. Mr. Power's attention was riveted
when the man pulled two bagels out of the mailbox, placed them on
top and continued loading his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this happen very often?'' Mr. Power asked. The man, still
loading his bag, and without looking up, responded, ``It's the
first time I've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Power assumed the bagels were the work of vandals or
litterbugs. ``What are you going to do with them?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mail them, of course. They have stamps and addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Power peeked. The bagels seemed to be quite stale and hard,
but sure enough, they had addresses written right on them and
stamps affixed. How, why, he's still wondering.
</P>
<P>
   A Metropolitan Opera park concert on Staten Island in late June
was a particularly memorable occasion _ it was the first time I can
recall an opera grinding to a halt because of an attack by a swarm
of kamikaze June bugs.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun descended and the stage lights came on, thousands
of the bugs rose from the grass and assaulted the stage,
divebombing the singers and musicians, of which I was one. They
crashed into our heads, flew into the singers' mouths and spattered
onto the stage. As they watched the distracted singers and
musicians trying to bat the insects away while performing, a scene
worthy of a Marx Brothers movie, the spectators reacted with
appropriate howls. About halfway through Act I, we all fled the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   After about 15 minutes of unscheduled intermission, we crept
tentatively back, crunching over hundreds of tiny corpses, and took
up the opera from where we left off.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught continued, but the intensity gradually abated. The
poor young woman making her debut as Lucia di Lammermoor looked
suitably beside herself as she sang the famous final scene while
frantically slapping and flicking incoming bugs away from her
shoulders and wrenching them out of her hair. A Mad Scene indeed!

   A friend was driving along Park Avenue in the 70's when he
spotted a prosperous-looking older couple cruising along in not
only a Bentley but also a Bentley that he thought was probably a
custom color _ a shade he described as a black-cherry red. The
license plate reflected a sense of humor. ``PRE HMO,'' it said.

Recently he was performing at the Sidewalk Bar on Avenue A, and at

he resist?

   ``I'm an attorney, poet, composer, playwright, arranger, pianist

<P>
   The world is becoming increasingly polarized between the rich
and the poor _ both between and within countries. Poverty amid
abundance is a growing problem that poses grave dangers to the West
and to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, per capita income has declined in more
than 100 countries and individual consumption has dropped by about
one percent annually in more than 60.
</P>
<P>
   The number of poor people in East Asia will increase sharply in
the next two years _ from 40 million to more than 100 million, if
current trends continue, according to World Bank estimates. The
number of Indonesians living on less than $1 a day will jump from
13 million in 1997 to 34 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of a huge global underclass undermining international
stability is quite real.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's growth for 1998, once expected to exceed 4 percent, has
in fact been closer to 2.2 percent. In Latin America, growth
forecasts have been scaled down from 5.3 percent before the global
financial crisis to 2.6 percent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, about 150 million people _ equal to the combined
populations of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the
Nordic countries _ were pushed into poverty when the Soviet Union
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 4.4 billion people in developing countries around the
world, three-fifths live in communities lacking basic sanitation;
one-third go without safe drinking water; one-quarter lack adequate
housing; one-fifth are undernourished; and 1.3 billion live on less
than $1 a day. Nearly one-third of the people in the poorest
countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, can expect to die by age
40.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Uganda's having posted 6 percent annual growth for a
decade, two-thirds of its population still lives in absolute
poverty, with per capita income at the 1970 level. Rapid growth has
only started to counteract the ravages of two decades of armed
conflict, economic mismanagement, high inflation, crippling
corruption, external debt and declining export prices.
</P>
<P>
   Lest cynics in the West argue this has nothing to do with them,
consider the following. Economic declines inevitably translate into
political instability and social unrest. Sporadic rioting and
looting have already broken out in East Asia, along with attacks on
ethnic minorities. What began as a financial crisis has spread and
is tearing at Asia's social and political fabric. This may herald
severe consequences for stability in countries where growing
prosperity had once delivered social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, short-term military, political and economic
interests, rather than the goals of poverty eradication and human
development, have shaped development assistance. A new framework
for such aid must switch the focus of scarce funds to the most
pressing needs of people, particularly the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of development cooperation must broaden to include not
only assistance but trade, debt management, private investment and
capital flows, access to technology and the strengthening of civil
society as a whole. In particular, it must correct the chronic
underinvestment in social programs by poor countries with
unshoulderable debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
   To make this possible, industrialized nations must first reduce
developing countries' burden of external debt. This now totals more
than $2.2 trillion, of which two-thirds is long-term public debt.
African governments now transfer four times more money to
international creditors than they spend on basic health care and
education. The West can afford temporary suspension of payments
from poor countries while they negotiate new terms.
</P>
<P>
   Special programs must address the challenges of pre-emerging
markets, where banking and regulatory systems and governance
capabilities are far less developed than in the Asian tigers, and
where only 0.2 percent of global commercial credit goes to the
poorest 20 percent of the world's people.
</P>
<P>
   International agencies such as the U.N. Development Program are
generating the international political will for debt relief,
improving poor countries' debt-management capacity and helping them
shift their resources from debt to social development.
</P>
<P>
   Poor-country access to rich-country markets is crucial both for
long-term development and for pulling the hardest-hit emerging
markets out of the current crisis. Wealthy countries should make it
their joint responsibility to absorb developing countries' goods
even if this risks temporarily skewing their trade balances.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States has been particularly stingy with
its aid budget. In 1960, 4 percent of the U.S. budget went to
development and international affairs. Today these areas are
allocated less than one percent. Forty U.S. embassies, consulates
and branch offices have closed in the last six years. The United
States now accounts for just 13 percent of the industrial world's
development assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But declining engagement does not square with U.S. global
interests. Since 1987, more than two-thirds of American export
growth has been in emerging markets, generating roughly 2 million
new domestic jobs. Two-fifths of U.S. trade goes to the developing
world. With four out of five people living in developing countries,
market growth for U.S. industries will continue to shift toward the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this positive interest in the economic health of the
developing world, Americans have an obvious stake in avoiding
humanitarian emergencies, national and regional conflicts,
environmental deterioration, terrorism, illicit drugs, the spread
of diseases, illegal migration and other human and natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these threats stem from poverty, inequity, joblessness
and social disintegration. Although no one would attribute such
problems solely to underdevelopment, it is clearly part of the
disease. And sustainable development must be part of any cure. In
Rwanda, for example, vocational training and employment programs
have helped stabilize the delicate political situation. In El
Salvador and Guatemala, programs that assist the poor and needy are
important aspects of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot accomplish any of its admirable
international goals _ fomenting peace and stability, human rights
and democratization, the expansion of trade and markets,
environmental protection, population stabilization, an end to
hunger and extreme deprivation _ without equitable, sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
   In an interdependent world, international cooperation must be an
integral part of public policy. Our common well-being will
increasingly depend on factors, from the environment to the
economy, that are global.
</P>
<P>
   The costs of neglecting the rapidly growing international class
divide will be immense, reaped in environmental harm, humanitarian
disaster and economic growth. The West must have the foresight to
act now.

market. Publishers know this hunger exists. That's why there are so
many investment advice books in the stores and libraries. Some of

   COKE-SUIT _ ATLANTA _ The gloves come off Thursday. That's when
lawyers for Coca-Cola and the four plaintiffs suing the company for
racial discrimination will argue over a key part of the case _
whether to eliminate the possibility of it becoming a
``class-action'' suit in the future. If it becomes a class-action
case down the road, the plaintiffs could potentially represent
1,500 other salaried Coke employees in the United States. (Unger,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TECH-SMALLBIZ _ Definition 6, an Atlanta-based interactive
advertising and marketing company, hopes to capture the small

   SLATE-CHANGES _ Slate has always been notorious for keeping its
light under a bushel and in the shadow of that other popular online
magazine, Salon. But now it seems that Slate may have finally found
a combination of editorial, commerce and alternative revenue
streams to push the Microsoft-owned site into mainstream acceptance
after three years of failed attempts. Monday, in the Web site's
daily e-mail ``morning delivery,'' there was a note from famed
editor Michael Kinsley talking up Slate's latest efforts aimed at
reaching a broader audience and tapping into current Web trends.
The new and improved Slate has taken a huge leap into the next
century with versions now available for PalmPilot and Windows CE
users. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   MONEYTALK _ Readers often ask what books would help them get
smart about investing in general and the stock market in
particular. That's no surprise. A lot more people have investments
these days because they have 401(k) retirement plans. Others have
gotten interested because they keep hearing about the booming stock
market. Publishers know this hunger exists. That's why there are so
many investment advice books in the stores and libraries. Some of
those books are very good. But some are them are awful. We list
some good places to start. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 c.1999 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But in
Kosovo, for example, no country offered to send them in when the
ethnic cleansing began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The large U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was established
right after the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate
and provide health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli
zones in the former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had the effect of
becoming desirable homes rather than eagerly abandoned transit
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of several Arab countries, the agency
turned escaping civilians into lifelong refugees who gave birth to
refugee children, who have in turn had refugee children of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many feverishly competitive nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) now aid war refugees. Like any other
institution, these groups are interested in perpetuating
themselves, which means that their first priority is to attract
charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. The NGOs focus their
efforts on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This
ensures that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although
abysmal by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for so-called humanitarian groups to stop helping
prolong the warfare whose consequences they ostensibly seek to
mitigate.

enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But in
Kosovo, for example, no country offered to send them in when the
ethnic cleansing began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   The large U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was established
right after the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate
and provide health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli
zones in the former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip had the effect of
becoming desirable homes rather than eagerly abandoned transit
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of several Arab countries, the agency
turned escaping civilians into lifelong refugees who gave birth to
refugee children, who have in turn had refugee children of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many feverishly competitive nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) now aid war refugees. Like any other
institution, these groups are interested in perpetuating
themselves, which means that their first priority is to attract
charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. The NGOs focus their
efforts on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This
ensures that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although
abysmal by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for so-called humanitarian groups to stop helping
prolong the warfare whose consequences they ostensibly seek to
mitigate.

THE NEWS BUSINESS LOSES A HERO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ John Lynch was one of ours, one of Sonoma's and
one of a kind. One day last week, at the age of 46, John died.
</P>
<P>
   He was found at home, fully dressed for the morning shift at the
San Francisco Examiner. We all have searched for explanations for
his death, and found nothing but reasons for him to live.
</P>
<P>
   We must admit our selfishness. In part, we want him to be alive
for us. We want to share his humor, which like all great humor was
entirely serious. We need him as the cool professional he was, too.
</P>
<P>
   John was a part of this column you never saw, an editor fighting
creeping ungrammaticality and leaping illogic. You'd have to see
John to really appreciate him, too. He was as handsome as any lead
singer, with the tan of a surfer and the elegant suits of a
Hollywood producer.
</P>
<P>
   The phone would ring at my home and he'd be all business, but
the business was the rock 'n' roll of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morse, Lynch here,'' he'd say. ``Now maybe I'm not intelligent
enough to be part of your readership, but there's a sentence here I
don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else he'd say, ``I know you don't care about prepositions at
the end of sentences, but here's a way we could reword it to keep
English teachers from sending you letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else he'd say, ``Here's a way I think we can make this
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a way I think we can make this better.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the last words of his I remember, the words of the
consummate editor, words we all should try to apply in life. He was
a self-deprecating man, so he always added ``I think'' when he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   John was a fourth-generation newspaperman, one of the family
that founded and still publishes the Sonoma Index-Tribune. A
memorial service for John was held on Sunday at Sonoma's Trinity
Episcopal Church, and the church overflowed with hundreds of
journalists and residents of Sonoma, including members of the
Sebastiani family and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, family, reporters, cops and firemen wept for John in
the small country church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a tribute to John and this town,'' said my
friend Michael Coats, who has lived in Sonoma since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``John was the first person I met when I moved here,'' Coats
said. ``I was a new PR guy in town and he was managing editor of
the Index-Tribune, so I called him up. He answered his own phone,
and we went out for drinks. We talked about the Rolling Stones.''
</P>
<P>
   One of John's expressions about newspapering was ``Remember,
it's only rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   He cared deeply about both newspapering and rock 'n' roll. It
was just like John to use that expression to soften his
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial service, John's brother Bill told the mourners
to remember John as the good friend and selfless colleague that he
was. He told us to write down our thoughts, so John's teen-age
kids, Max and Lily, can have them forever.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I write this, and also to admit to readers that
sometimes newspaper people can't deal with issues of mortality,
even though that's the business we're in.
</P>
<P>
   John once edited a story written by my wife. ``It was just about
Christmas tree lots, but he treated it as seriously as any
front-page story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper is the sum of its parts, as a great editor once told
me. I've come to know what that means. It means stories about
Christmas tree lots are as important, in their way, as stories
about plane crashes and political scandals.
</P>
<P>
   It means an editor looking for spelling errors and logical
lapses is as important as someone with a picture over a column.
</P>
<P>
   We're all equal in putting out a newspaper, just as we're all
equal in the eyes of the Lord. But I wish John could have seen his
own funeral to know how special he was.
</P>
<P>
   My wife said he was still there, that people don't depart until
bidden farewell. I say they don't depart because they live in
people's hearts. Editors live in writers' copy.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew John was going through hard times and he'd lost an
awful lot of weight. His brother Bill told the mourners that he
could come up with no reason for John's death.
</P>
<P>
   John came to work every day when called. He always was on time.
He always had a smile. He took dictation on deadline like the pro
he was. He made the tough calls on stories. A small-town
newspaperman at heart, he was unfailingly polite to angry readers
who called the city desk.
</P>
<P>
   The day John died, a bunch of us took a very long lunch at the
local bar and told newspaper stories, stories about John and ones
he would have appreciated. ``He was a hero,'' one grizzled
newspaperman said.
</P>
<P>
   The way John worked and joked was an inspiration to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is that if this column reads poorly, it's because
he isn't here to edit it.
</P>
<P>
   As I drove away from the memorial service on Sunday, I popped in
a Rolling Stones CD. Leaving Sonoma, I drove through the square,
past vineyards and the firemen's barbecue, and mouthed the words to
``Not Fade Away.''
</P>
<P>
   I know it's only rock 'n' roll, but I liked him.
</P>

TEXAN SHRUGS OFF ADVERSITY TO WIN A THIRD TOUR STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SESTRIERES, Italy _ Nothing fazed Lance Armstrong Tuesday _ not
the rain mixed with occasional hail, not the summits he attacked in
the Alps, not the 173 racers who attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong seemed immune to it all as he wore the Tour de France
leader's yellow jersey. The 27-year-old from Austin, Texas, won the
134-mile stage in 5 hours, 57 minutes, 11 seconds. That was 30
seconds ahead of his nearest pursuer, Switzerland's Alex Zulle, and
it gave Armstrong an overall lead of more than six minutes almost
halfway through the event.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Armstrong's second in a row and third stage win so
far.
</P>
<P>
   So is it presumptuous to envision him as just the second
American to win the 86-year-old Tour de France? Armstrong believes
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still nervous, and I still don't think that the race is
over,'' he said. ``The others will be back and they'll be better,
and I can have bad days and my condition can run out.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how it looked Tuesday, when you could almost hear
the Tour organizers say, ``Gentlemen, start your engines,'' as the
racers rolled out of the streets of Le Grand Bornand, a French ski
resort in the Alps near the Italy and Switzerland borders. The race
would start with a descent and then cover four summits to finish on
top of another.
</P>
<P>
   So while the riders had no motors to rely on, they instead had
to summon all the manpower they could for the first mountain stage
after a week in the relatively flat regions of northern France.
</P>
<P>
   Every view of the snow-covered Alps was mere foreshadowing to
the riders of what was in store. With much of the course filled
with fans who had hiked or biked up, one could only wonder what
went through Signor Agnelli's mind when he designed the stage in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong, aided by teammates Tyler Hamilton and Kevin
Livingston in the first part of the race, seemed to relish it.
Armstrong was 12th to arrive at the summit 120 miles into the race
and the fifth to ride to the top of summit less than 15 miles
later.
</P>
<P>
   And the rain didn't seem to bother him any more than the
ascents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day for me because of the conditions,'' he said.
``I always ride good in these cold, wet conditions, and on a day
like this you automatically eliminate 50 percent of the opposition
because of bad morale or accidents, so I've always looked on that
as an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   And he capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel super, but I realized the others looked like
they were suffering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong approached the final climb with six other riders but
pulled away from them less than 4 miles from the summit. He
grimaced as he steadily rode to the top on roads lined with
cheering and umbrella-holding fans, and he lifted his hands to tug
on his jersey before raising them high as he crossed the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who missed all of the 1997 season and sat out last
year's Tour after surgery for testicular cancer, said Tuesday's win
also showed that he and his team can battle the Alps as well as any
seasoned European racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before today there were some questions, and people
weren't sure of my team's or my ability in the mountains,'' he
said. ``So I think there was some importance to showing that we
were stronger. It was good for our whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   And he steadfastedly refused to predict a victory in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built the whole season around this race, but I also had good
form in June, and the form could run out in the next four or five
days, and then I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, things are looking just fine.

shows that metro Dallas is second only to the Silicon Valley for

list of 315 cities studied. But an economist who helped prepare the
study, Perry Wong, says Austin's place among the Top 25 tech
centers may be more precarious that city boosters may believe, and
that Dallas is more firmly entrenched. That's because Dallas has a
very complex technology base, with seven different high-tech
industries represented. Austin, in contrast, has a lot of high-tech

 &HT;    TRUST A BARRIER TO WIDER BIOTECH USE ON THE FARM, GLICKMAN SAYS
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Biotechnology has enormous potential to help combat
hunger, reduce pesticide use and increase crop yields, but first
there must be a greater level of trust between scientists, the
public and regulators, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the National Press Club, Glickman said the European
Union's refusal to allow the sale of genetically modified food from
U.S. producers is ``scientifically unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   European fears of these products stem from the fact that ``they
have no independent regulatory agencies'' like the Food and Drug
Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture or Environmental
Protection Agency, Glickman said. As a result, ``they've had many
food scares in recent years,'' such as outbreaks of ``mad cow
disease'' and chicken tainted with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are many benefits from genetic modification of
foods, he said, noting that nearly half of the soybeans in the
United States are a variety altered to increase resistance to
certain pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary, who has declined to propose labeling of
genetically altered foods in the United States, said the USDA, FDA
and EPA must stay at ``arm's length'' in regulating biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said he would seek an independent scientific
review of USDA's biotechnology approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this review will be to ensure that, as we are
faced with increasingly complex issues surrounding biotechnology,
our scientists have the best information and tools to ensure our
regulatory capabilities continue to evolve along with advances in
new technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the USDA would seek funding for regional centers
to evaluate biotech products for long periods of time and supply
information to growers, consumers, researchers and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Once biotech products hit the market and the benefits are known,
consumer acceptance will be high, according to Glickman. ``There
clearly needs to be a strong public education effort to show
consumers the benefits of these products and why they are safe,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he was concerned with how biotechnology would
affect farmers, who are suffering from very low commodity prices.
``We need to ensure that biotechnology becomes a tool that results
in greater _ not fewer _ options for farmers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To determine if the biotech approach is helping or hurting
family farmers, Glickman said the government needs to integrate
issues of privatization of genetic resources and patent-holders'
rights.

BOTTLE DEPOSIT SPURS RECYCLING IN NEW YORK STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DINA CAPPIELLO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ While New Yorkers are recycling a hefty 42
percent of all trash, the rate is nearly double for bottles and
cans sold with nickel deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, well over a billion beverage containers _ one out of four
sold _ are never cashed in and the money stays with the
distributors. The 1982 Returnable Container Law that placed a
nickel deposit on the sale of carbonated soft drinks, beer and some
wine is widely credited with achieving its initial purpose _ to
decrease litter. It has also spurred recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1980s, when curbside programs began, returnable
containers were the single largest contributor to the state's
recycling efforts. Today, they account for 2.3 percent of the 12.5
million tons of paper, bottles, cans, tires and other materials the
state recycles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. George Pataki announced with pride that New
York's 42 percent solid waste recycling rate met goals set a dozen
years ago. Other states don't do as well. Pennsylvania recycles 26
percent, Massachusetts 34 percent and Texas 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $255.9 million paid out in deposits in 1997, New Yorkers
redeemed $194.7 million _ $7.1 million more than the previous year.
The billion-plus nickels not redeemed by consumers _ or some other
enterprising individuals _ stay with the beverage distributors. And
that's no small change. The total was $61 million dollars in 1997,
the most recent statistic available.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation tracks how
many deposit bottles and cans are brought back in nine regions. The
redemption rates vary widely. Statewide, 76 percent of glass and
plastic bottles and aluminum cans are returned, usually at
supermarket machines that count the cans and bottles and identify
their brands before they are crushed.
</P>
<P>
   In Central New York, where redemption centers handle much of the
nickel-payback business, the deposit is redeemed 93 percent of the
time. New York City's rate of 68 percent is the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the highest redemption rate in New York state,'' said
George Gianquitti, whose redemption center near Syracuse collects
8.25 million containers per year. ``It's not because we're better
environmentalists than anyone else in the state. We've just made it
easier to redeem cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to machines, the process is quicker and cleaner.
Beverage distributors reimburse the five-cent deposits and pay the
handler _ be it a redemption center or supermarket _ an additional
two cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our phone book you see 15 redemption centers listed,'' said
Gianquitti, who operates R.G. Nickel Back Redemption Center in
Mattydale and helped found the New York State Bottle and Can
Redemption Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creation of redemption centers would have a lot to do with
increasing the redemption rate,'' said Donna Stewart, an
environmental program specialist at the DEC's Bureau of Waste
Reduction and Recycling.
</P>
<P>
   If the law were stretched to include today's popular
non-carbonated drinks, the number of containers returned would grow
by 20 percent, cutting litter and boosting recycling, according to
Pat Franklin, executive director of the Container Recycling
Institute near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, bills to amend the container law are introduced in
the state Legislature to include additional beverages. The beverage
industry has successfully fought off attempts to get the unredeemed
nickels into the state treasury. In Massachusetts the left-over
deposit goes to the state.

 &HT;    Course pretty unforgiving, no matter the weather
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ At most major championship venues, each
practice day brings some progress. At a place like the Carnoustie
Golf Links, where the conditions went from sunny and mild to cool
and rainy over lunch Tuesday, it's a struggle even without keeping
score.
</P>
<P>
   Add Carnoustie's tight fairways, which have knee-high rough
lurking near, and the 128th British Open takes on an appearance of
a bogeyfest. On the par-5 sixth hole, the fairway is only 11 yards
wide at the layup point.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 3-iron or the 1-iron, you lay up into an area that is
only 10 or 11 yards wide, with a ditch on the right and the rough
on the left,'' American Jim Furyk said. ``It's a bit over the top,
I think. . . . It's very tough, the hardest course I've ever
played.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnoustie is living up to everything that has been discussed
about it,'' Phil Mickelson said. ``A fair test? Off the tee, it's
arguable. I've never seen fairways this penalizing for a major
championship. You might as well stick red hazard posts down the
fairways.''
</P>
<P>
   Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden called the 10- to 15-yard landing
area at the 479-yard 12th hole ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience doesn't mean a thing if you can't hit it
straight,'' said Nick Faldo, a three-time champion. ``And it's long
as well. You've got to hit the driver. And it's narrow. It's pretty
serious out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecast for Thursday is dry and sunny, with
temperatures in the high 60s and winds at 10-15 mph, gusting to 20.
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds?
</P>
<P>
   Most bookmakers list Tiger Woods at 5-1 or 6-1 as the favorite.
Colin Montgomerie is about 11-1, down from 16-1, followed by David
Duval at 12-1, Ernie Els at 16-1, Vijay Singh at 18-1 and Sergio
Garcia at 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   England's Justin Rose, the sensation of last year's Open with a
third-place finish as an amateur, is a 500-1 shot _ no wonder,
after it took him 22 European Tour events to make a pro cut. Zane
Scotland of England, the 16-year-old amateur qualifier, is a
2,000-1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III is 33-1, along with Justin Leonard, Tom Lehman,
Mickelson and U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. Defending champion
Mark O'Meara is 40-1, along with Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's practice start on Monday was less than stellar. Hitting
with a group off the first tee that included Greg Norman and Nick
Price, Duval popped up his first drive maybe 225 yards to the right
and quickly reloaded. . . .You might want to avoid Lee Janzen in
your office pool. ``I'd say on a 1-to-10 scale, my game is about a
negative 4 right now,'' he said.

 &HT;    A tale of two destinies
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ In golf history, never have two
combatants in a major championship left the course, left the
country and then taken such different paths. For one, the high road
led to five British Open titles. For the other, the low road ended
his career _ and nearly his life.
</P>
<P>
   American Tom Watson beat Australian Jack Newton by one shot in
an 18-hole playoff the Monday after regulation play of the 1975
British Open, at the same Carnoustie Golf Links that will be the
site of the 128th championship this week. Watson would evolve into
one of golf's greatest champions, winning four more times across
the pond. Newton, eight years later, on July 24, 1983, would walk
into an airplane propeller on a rainy night in Newcastle,
Australia, and lose his right arm, his right eye and half of his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are here this week, of course, with their roles still
as contrasting. Watson returns to the scene of his first British
Open win _ on his first try at age 25. Newton annually works the
tournament for Australian television. The two men are on the
grounds for the first time since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's thoughts at Carnoustie are mostly wonderful, until he
remembers that the man who lost the 90-hole battle by one shot,
then lost almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping he was going to survive, first of all,'' Watson
said when asked to recall the emotions he felt when he heard about
Newton's accident. ``He was in intensive care and close to death
for many weeks after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Newton was able to recover from the tragedy and rework his
life. Although Newton's professional career became just memories
and press clippings, he started playing golf again with one arm,
reduced his handicap from 36 to 15 and breaks 80 occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Newton is chairman of the PGA Tour of Australasia and head
of the Jack Newton Junior Golf Foundation. He has been a fixture at
every major championship in recent years, dapper always in his bow
tie and blue blazer. The right sleeve is pinned at the shoulder,
but Newton's mood and mannerisms do not give away the horrors he
has felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I looked at it,'' Newton said as he awaited British
Open week and Carnoustie, ``I had two choices _ go sit in the
corner and sulk for the rest of my life, or get on with it. It was
no choice, really.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Watson, he turns 50 on Sept 4 and will hit the Senior PGA
Tour full-time. If he makes the cut this week, it will be an upset,
especially if the weather gets rainy and windy by Thursday.
Laughing at himself, Watson established one goal of parring the
16th hole, the often brutal 250-yard par-3. In 1975, Watson never
managed it in five rounds, including the playoff, or a practice
round. He hit the green one time and 3-putted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not playing particularly well right now,'' he said. ``I
am putting well, though. . . . Something here brings out the best
in me, though. I hope this time it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Watson was a young man from Kansas City who had not yet
developed a fondness for links golf. He wore a plaid Hogan-type
cap, purchased in Carnoustie, with longish hair sticking out from
under it. This week at 49, Watson sat at the interview room table
wearing a Duke baseball cap, blue with a white D, for the school
that daughter Meg attends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played American target golf _ hit the ball high,'' Watson
said. ``I truly didn't really like the game over here until maybe
1979 at Royal Lytham. . . . I honestly didn't like St. Andrews in
1978 when I played. I liked to get the ball up in the air and stop
it quickly, and it was going against my nature at the time. But I
decided I better change my nature. . . . So I pretended I was a
little kid again, in the sense that you had to run the ball on the
greens _ you know, when you couldn't hit the ball very far. You had
to try and find the openings and run the ball on to the greens. And
that free association, I guess, really worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie was a gentler giant in July of 1975, with little
rough and not much wind. Newton, in fact, moved into Sunday's final
pairing with a 65 _ the Carnoustie course record until Colin
Montgomerie and Alan Tait shot 64s in the 1995 Scottish Open. The
course won't yield such numbers this week. The nearly unnegotiable
rough is at many places no more than 10 yards from the fairway, and
the fairways are barely wider than some of the nearby roads.
</P>
<P>
   Telling a story to illustrate Carnoustie's difficulty, Watson
remembered a conversation with Jack Nicklaus about a ``Big Three
Golf'' match he played at the course with Arnold Palmer and Gary
Player in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack said, `We went out and played in about 40-mph winds, and
the course was completely baked out,' '' Watson said. ``Jack said,
`I shot 77, Gary shot 78, and Arnold shot 79.' Then they counted up
the greens in regulation. Jack led with four, he said Gary hit two
and Arnold hit one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if you add rough and length and wind to it,'' Watson said,
``now what's going to happen?''

   Hail the World Cup champions!
</P>
<P>
   That Mia Hamm sure is a telegenic babe, isn't she? Really cute,
in an athlete-next-door kind of way. If she weren't married to that
military dude, I'm sure she'd be flooded with all kinds of romantic
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain has her own special brand of sex appeal as well.
That move she did Saturday when she ripped off her jersey in front
of the crowd, revealing just a black sports bra, was practically
Rodman-esque _ though Dennis never wore a bra under his jersey, as
far as we know.
</P>
<P>
   But I think I prefer the pose Chastain struck earlier this year
for Gear magazine, with only a strategically placed soccer ball for
cover. That was even better than the group picture the team did for
David Letterman, in which they appear to be wearing nothing but
``Late Night'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, though. How can we have a discussion of the U.S.
women's team without mentioning Brianna Scurry's pledge to run
naked through her hometown should the squad win the Cup? She's
pulled that move before, you know.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth noting that the players have called themselves
``booters with hooters''; that they paint each other's toenails
red, white and blue; and that they have endorsed the benefits of
conjugal relations before big games.
</P>
<P>
   These truly are women of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   What's your complaint? That I'm a third of the way through the
column and it's been all about sex appeal and superficialities?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't get mad at me about the sexy stuff. That's the
image the team itself has been projecting all along: wholesome,
down-to-earth attractiveness, spiced with more than a little of the
assertive jock persona.
</P>
<P>
   As for their soccer skills, I guess they're darn good _ but then
again, I watched only about 20 minutes of game action. Everybody
looked great in their ponytails chasing after the ball, but nothing
really happened, so I went back to the Aquarium Channel. (All
fishies all the time; you should check it out.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm unaware of this girls' soccer craze. Over the last
few weeks, I I've read tons of newspaper and magazine stories and I
I've watched several TV features about the World Cup team. I saw
the commercials starring Mia Hamm, and I noticed the Soccer Barbies
in the toy stores. One night in late June, I was nearly overrun by
packs of 12-year-old girls who were all talking at once as they
stampeded to the World Cup action at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'd really be into this thing, if it weren't for the
soccer part.
</P>
<P>
   Try as I have over the years to appreciate the global pastime,
all I see is the Myth of Sisyphus without the mountain: a bunch of
people kicking a ball and chasing after it, kicking a ball and
chasing after it, with somebody scoring a goal every hour or so.
It's like looking at one of those ``Magic Eye'' optical illusions
and never seeing the spaceship emerge from the squiggly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Nor am I convinced this is anything more than a temporary
explosion. In the wake of the incredible media blitz about the
World Cup team, a little perspective is in order.
</P>
<P>
   True, there were record crowds for the games. Whether busloads
of girls' teams were given tickets for free or people were plunking
down their hard-earned money, attendance figures of 75,000 and
90,000-plus are impressive.
</P>
<P>
   But the TV ratings provide a more enlightening picture.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saturday's final was the most-watched soccer game ever
on U.S. network television, according to overnight ratings, the
first two weeks of World Cup games on ESPN averaged 1 percent of
U.S. cable households _ and let's remember that almost half the
country still isn't wired for cable. Last week in USA Today,
Michael Hiestand pointed out that only 32 percent of that tiny
viewership is female _ meaning that in terms of percentage of
female viewers, the World Cup lagged behind ``fringe'' sports such
as skiing, NASCAR, horse racing, rodeo and bowling. Bowling!
</P>
<P>
   You can market and hype soccer to the sky, but those 12-year-old
girls who love to play the game and watch it in person will never
become adult couch potatoes, soaking up match after match and
absorbing commercial after commercial.
</P>
<P>
   When they're not working, the vast majority of women in this
country are busy giving birth and running marathons and organizing
car pools and changing the oil in their cars and playing softball
and sweeping out the gutters; they won't waste entire days and
nights watching sports on TV. They're not stupid, like us men.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was fueled by more than a touch of jingoism and
marketing, the World Cup was a nice story _ but it doesn't mean
women's soccer is now a big-time sport for the masses. If you want
to argue with me, I'll ask you this:
</P>
<P>
   Can you name one player on any team outside the USA?

MCI MOVES INTO MARKET FOR CONSUMER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICES   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc. made a big move into the consumer market for
high-speed Internet access Tuesday, announcing a partnership with
Earthlink Network Inc. to sell retail services in as many as 25
markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom's Uunet operation, the No. 1 supplier of wholesale
Internet access, has conducted high-speed tests with America Online
Inc., the leading retail provider of Internet and other online
services. But America Online has come to focus on the regional Bell
local phone giants as partners for delivering high-speed Internet
service to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink, in contrast, wants to use Uunet's network to offer
high-speed Internet links applying a technology called digital
subscriber line, or DSL, in up to 25 markets by 2000, said Kurt
Rahn, an Earthlink spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink, which plans to announce quarterly financial results
Wednesday is one of the nation's top five Internet providers, with
about 1.2 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   DSL lets consumers use standard phone wires to link to the
Internet at speeds as much as 30 times faster than are possible
with today's fastest dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying DSL, however, requires phone companies and
communications carriers like Uunet to invest hundreds of dollars a
customer in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink is testing a DSL product in California using systems
provided by the Pacific Bell unit of SBC Communications Inc. and is
already offering DSL service in Charlottesville, Va., through the
Sprint Corp.'s local phone operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uunet's extensive national DSL network will allow us to offer
DSL services to our members on a much broader scale than before,''
Jon Irwin, Earthlink's senior vice president for broadband
services, said in a statement. ``By allowing us to reach such a
large part of the country through one provider, we'll significantly
cut down on the time it takes to roll service out in different
areas and significantly reduce our operations costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Uunet also said Tuesday that it had deployed DSL systems in
1,000 central telephone switching centers around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Those ``central offices'' are mostly controlled by the Bells and
the GTE Corp., but the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the
local phone incumbents to allow other communications carriers to
deploy equipment inside those facilities. Each central office can
provide high-speed Internet links to homes and businesses within a
radius of about three-and-a-half miles.
</P>
<P>
   Uunet's DSL operations now include 22 metropolitan areas in the
United States, but despite the Earthlink deal, it remains focused
mostly on business customers. By the end of the year, Uunet wants
to deploy DSL technology in another 500 central telephone offices.

   KEDUNG, Indonesia _ The farther the road goes, the more
beautiful the villages become, and the more desperately poor. Deep
in the countryside, with a hint of ocean in the air, green rice
fields stand silent except for the swish of a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   With the rice mostly planted and the next harvest months away,
the hungry people here fly kites through the golden afternoons and
sometimes under the stars at night.
</P>
<P>
   Remote as it seems, this tiny village is less than 30 miles from
Jakarta, the capital. Yet most of the people who work here
surrounded by coconut palms and mango trees say they have never
been to the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they have watched, on communal television sets, the
upheavals that are transforming their country. They voted with
great enthusiasm on June 7 in the national election in hope of a
better life. But they seemed relieved, one recent afternoon, that
most of the excitement of the last year had passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's secure here,'' said Siti, a farmer who guesses her age at
about 40. ``No rumors. No reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform _ or ``reformasi'' _ is the battle cry of the
demonstrators who helped bring down President Suharto a year ago
and who want to transform their nation into a free and democratic
society.
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Siti and others here in the fields it is a strange,
foreign-sounding word that may have something to do with the
harshness of their lives since the Asian economic crisis hit
Indonesia two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like these make up the huge majority of Indonesia's
population of more than 200 million, and a huge majority of its
electorate. Yet most of the country's hot political issues _
corruption, democracy, the role of the military _ are little more
than words for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where nearly half of the population is estimated to
live in poverty, national politics is not very complicated. It is
all about the prices of rice and cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what ``reformasi'' meant to them, many villagers here and
elsewhere said it meant rising prices, even though the currency
crashed and prices rose well before Suharto resigned in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many others did not even offer a guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want prices to go down,'' said Amnah, a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Siti said she was relieved that there was no reform here in
her village, northwest of Jakarta. But when asked what that meant,
she deferred to a young man named Rusman, who has enough education
to repair motorcycles at the edge of the fields here.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't know either,'' Rusman said. ``I might know someone
who does, but he's praying right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That man is Suhaimi, an elderly carpenter who has made the
pilgrimage to Mecca and who chooses his words with care. Seating
himself slowly in the shade of his workshop, Suhaimi said he
thought he had the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same as paceklik,'' he said. That is a word
(pronounced pah-che-KLIK) that farmers use to describe a period of
extremely bad harvests.
</P>
<P>
   A friend explained, ``If you don't have rice you eat corn and if
you don't have corn, you eat cassava, and if you don't have cassava
to eat, it's paceklik.''
</P>
<P>
   Suhaimi, 67, managed to make his pilgrimage in 1996, just before
the economic crisis hit. Now, he said, it would be much too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, reform has had a big impact,'' he said. ``Before,
business was a lot smoother. Now everything is expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, Rusli, was an electrician in Jakarta before the
economic crisis hit. Now, like millions of Indonesians, he has lost
his work and returned to his home village, where he sometimes helps
in the fields but mostly sits indoors.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's hard,'' he said, when asked how he gets by. ``It's
hard even to buy a pack of cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had to choose between a bowl of rice and a pack of
cigarettes? Rusli scratched the back of his head for a long time.
``I guess it would be the cigarettes,'' he said, ``if I had the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Though they may know little about ``reformasi,'' the farmers are
right in putting the economy at the center of their country's
political upheavals.
</P>
<P>
   Without the anger aroused by the economic crisis, Suharto would
surely have ridden out the political challenge against him last
year. The country's foundering economy _ rarely mentioned in the
recent election campaign _ presents the greatest challenge to a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than any revolutionary future, many farmers here are
wishing for a return to the recent past, when the economy was
booming and prices were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the new government will bring the situation back to the
way it was before,'' said Yakub, 25, a jobless driver who now helps
his brother in the fields. ``Before the changes, my family could
afford to buy 20 kilograms of rice a week. Now we can hardly afford
to buy 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of his seven family members have embarked on strict Muslim
fasts, he said, more as a measure of frugality than religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Suharto's time we were doing OK,'' he said. ``We didn't
know about his dark side, or his bright side either. But now that
he's gone we know that prices are high.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Megawati country _ solid red, the electoral color of
Megawati Sukarnoputri. She is the presidential candidate who bears
the hopes of most people who want change, from those who want
democracy to those who want lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers here say they flew her red banner from their plows, like
kites.
</P>
<P>
   A victory for Mrs. Megawati would mean an overturning of the old
order that has clung to office since Suharto stepped down. But most
of the people here, whose votes for her could help change the
course of the country, have little idea who she is or what she
might do in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's reform time,'' said a farmer named Sariun, who said
he was about 50. ``But if Megawati wins, things are going to get
better. The farmers are just waiting for Megawati to become
president.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and patchy rain will occur Wednesday from the southern
Appalachians to the Carolina coast as weak disturbances travel
along a wavering front near the Atlantic Seaboard. However, most of
the rain will be light, converging winds near a low pressure center
will cause some heavier rain over southeastern Virginia and eastern
North Carolina. Afternoon temperatures will continue to average 8
to 12 degrees below the seasonal average.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Northeast will become warmer and more humid.
Sunshine will be plentiful near the Canadian border where
temperatures will surge several degrees above seasonal levels.
Meanwhile, light onshore breezes will keep most coastal areas cool
for the middle of July.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and humid conditions will spread from the Plains over most
of the Middle West and interior Southeast. A few showers and
thunderstorms will form near the leading edge of the sultry air
from the northern Mississippi Valley to the northern Great Lakes.
Afternoon thunderstorms will also form near the Gulf of Mexico
coast where sea breezes undercut and lift sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled conditions will linger from the western slopes of the
Rockies to the deserts of the Southwest. The day will begin with
ample sunshine in most areas, but numerous thundershowers will form
during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest will turn breezy and cooler with some
mountain showers as a cold front moves south through Oregon and
Idaho. Another surge of unusually chilly air will reach northern
parts of Montana late Wednesday night and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Daytime Chill
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, N.C., temperatures were near 100 on Sunday, but the
following day was the coldest July day since records began there in
1887. A damp, chill blew in from the Atlantic Ocean on Monday and
the mercury reached only 67 degrees, setting a record low maximum
temperature. While record high temperatures and extreme nighttime
cold are routinely reported, unusual daytime chill is a more
obscure quantity. Nevertheless, a low maximum is good indicator of
how cold a day is, since it measures chill in the afternoon, a time
when most people experience the weather. &QL;

TOUGH RULES STAND GUARD OVER CANADIAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Lenny Kravitz's raunchy remake of the  &UR; ' &LR; 70s classic
``American Woman'' had been thoroughly dissected, and the music
director of Toronto's CHUM-FM radio station was satisfied that it
was, indeed, Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising, since neither the singer nor the subject of the song
has a direct connection to the Great White North. But the music and
anti-American lyrics _ reflecting common Canadian views _ were
written by members of the Guess Who, a popular Canadian band of the
1970s. That gives ``American Woman'' the two points it needs under
Canada's intricate system of rankings to help meet CHUM-FM's
government-imposed requirement that 35 percent of its daytime
playlist be devoted to Canadian content.
</P>
<P>
   Determining what to do with ``Baby Feel My . . .'' by Patria, a
young Filipino artist, was not so easy. ``She came to Canada at age
2, but I think she's a landed immigrant now,'' said Barry Stewart,
CHUM-FM's music director, as the weekly music meeting dragged on.
``That makes her Canadian, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the bizarre world of Canadian cultural regulation, a
sometimes arbitrary, often contradictory system of rules and
measures cobbld together over several decades to protect Canadian
culture _ not just music but film, television, magazines and
literature _ from what some Canadians consider the menace of
American cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is not alone in trying to draw a Maginot line against
Mickey, Rambo and Homer Simpson. France requires theaters to
reserve 20 weeks of screen time a year for French feature films.
Australia demands that 55 percent of a television broadcaster's
schedule be filled with domestic programs. And while Mexico allows
foreign films to be shown, with subtitles in Spanish, it does not
allow them to be dubbed because that would increase the mass appeal
of new Hollywood films in a country where literacy rates are low.
</P>
<P>
   By most counts Canada is the Death Star of cultural
fortifications, bristling with regulatory armaments to preserve
what little is left of its own cultural territory.
</P>
<P>
   But at a glance it might appear the battle is already lost.
Eighty percent of what Canadians watch on television, outside of
news, comes from the United States. So do up to 80 percent of
English-language magazines on Canadian newsstands; 65 percent of
the songs heard on the radio, 60 percent of English books and 95
percent of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   No other country is so vulnerable to invasion by the American
colossus. Except for the French-speaking province of Quebec, Canada
shares the same language with the United States and is separated
from its loud neighbor to the south by a peaceful, 3,000-mile
border that is largely invisible. Where cultural differences exist,
they tend to be subtle.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, few people in the world match Canadians'
appetite for American cultural goods, everything from Walt Disney
to ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'' And Canadians enjoy being a part of
a cultural scene much larger than their own population of 30
million people, spread over a vast and wild continent, could ever
support.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as barriers are thrown up to keep Hollywood from
dominating the Canadian scene, both Vancouver and Toronto welcome
film production crews with incentives and a cheap Canadian dollar
to dress up Canadian streets to look like New York and Chicago. The
efforts have been so successful that the Screen Actors Guild in the
United States estimates that Canada lured away the equivalent of
almost 19,000 full-time film production jobs last year. It has
vowed to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the maze of cultural restrictions really is intended
to protect the 700,000 Canadians who depend on culture for their
jobs. But those like Norman Jewison, the director of ``Moonstruck''
and ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' argue that much more is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just cars or refrigerators for sale; this is
ideas,'' Jewison said. ``And when you start exporting ideas,
philosophies, behavior, products, ways of living, it becomes an
assault on the culture. Americans have to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always clear that Americans do, especially since
entertainment is now one of the most important United States
exports.
</P>
<P>
   For Washington, every question involving culture and trade has
assumed enormous importance because of the impact it might have on
business. For example, the office of the U.S. trade representative
threatened to start a trade war over a proposed Canadian law
intended to protect Canadian magazines. The law would have made it
a criminal offense for Canadian companies to take out
advertisements in the Canadian edition of American magazines like
Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's position is that domestic magazines are important
conveyors of Canadian voices and will be undercut if Americans can
simply place a maple leaf on a magazine cover, call it a Canadian
edition and sell cut-rate advertising that would otherwise go to
Canadian magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans respond that if magazines are so important, Canada
can subsidize outright; otherwise, free trade laws mean that the
market is open to all comers. After months of argument, Canada's
cultural minister, Sheila Copps, agreed to allow Canadians to
provide up to 18 percent of the advertising in an American
magazine. The percentage could increase only if more than half the
content of the magazine is Canadian.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Copps was pilloried from coast to coast for selling out
Canadian culture, although the compromise represented a crack in
Washington's defense against cultural restrictions. ``This decision
gives France and other countries the opportunity to argue that the
precedent of taking cultural considerations into account has
already been set,'' said William S. Merkin, a former U.S. deputy
chief trade negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   In defending itself against brashly aggressive American culture,
Canada sometimes seems like a fastidious gardener who fumes and
fusses over the riot of dandelions on his neighbor's lawn while
realizing that ultimately there is little he can do to keep them
from encroaching on his property. But that doesn't keep him from
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate systems have developed to preserve a portion of the
culture market for Canadian products, and they are largely
considered here to have been successful in helping the nation break
out of its colonial dependence _ first on Britain, then on the
United States _ and develop its own creative universe.
</P>
<P>
   Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette, Sarah McLachlan,
Bryan Adams, the Tragically Hip and the Barenaked Ladies are all
Canadian stars in the music field. In film, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey,
David Cronenberg, Atom Egoyan, James Cameron and Norman Jewison
share Canadian roots. Television programs like ``The Outer Limits''
and, until recently, ``The X-Files,'' have been filmed in Canada.
In literature, Margaret Atwood and Alice Munro have been joined by
a stable of accomplished writers including Michael Ondaatje,
Rohinton Mistry and Guy Vanderhaeghe.
</P>
<P>
   What is less clear is the degree to which the system of
percentages and regulation is responsible for such cultural
blossoming. Many Canadian pop stars signed contracts with major
labels after leaving Canada, suggesting that the Canadian content
regulations cannot be credited with their success.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stars like Ms. Dion are penalized by the regulations.
The point system for determining Canadian content goes by the
acronym MAPL _ music, artist, production, lyrics _ and assigns one
point for each category where a Canadian is predominantly involved.
At least two points are required for a record to be treated as
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   So while Rod Stewart's ``Rhythm of My Heart'' is accorded the
two points because the music and lyrics were written by Mark
Jordan, a Canadian, Celine Dion's hit ``My Heart Will Go On'' from
the movie ``Titanic'' cannot be counted in a radio station's quota
for Canadian content because it gets only one point, for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian content rule also creates a kind of musical ghetto
in which songs that are not popular enough to make it on their own
are replayed endlessly just to meet requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the CHUM-FM music director, said that because there are
not enough hits meeting the criteria that identifies them as
Canadian, a song by an artist like Shania Twain has to be kept on a
playlist for more than five months _ an eternity in radio.
Listeners tire of it, he said, and are tempted to tune in to radio
stations from the United States that can play whatever they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The radio regulation is intended to support up-and-coming
Canadian artists. But some argue that it can foster mediocrity or
generate an artificial popularity that comes back to haunt Canadian
groups.

   ``If an artist has success in Canada, international markets
often see that as `rigged' because they believe that artist `has to
be played by law,''' Steven Page, lead singer for the Barenaked
Ladies, said in an e-mail interview conducted while he was
backstage at a concert in England.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Page said, Canadian artists don't know where to turn.
The impression that Canadian songs are played only because they
must be played ``can make taking your success elsewhere a more
difficult endeavor,'' he said. And the the government's
protectionist attitude sometimes trickles down to fans who ``turn
their backs on artists they feel are not Canadian enough,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With its overwhelming impact, television is the fiercest
battleground for Canada's protectionist policies _ and the most
controversial, because broadcasters often find themselves opposing
government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians watch Canadian television channels, but they see very
little that is produced in Canada by Canadians. Regulations allow
commercial stations to broadcast popular American programs at the
same time they are broadcast on American channels _ which most
Canadians can receive.
</P>
<P>
   But the law allows Canadian broadcasters to substitute their own
commercials. So while Canadians saw the Super Bowl at the same time
as Americans did, they were treated to dated Canadian beer ads
instead of flashy new American commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations now require 60 percent of a television station's
schedule to be Canadian. But with unceasing opposition from
broadcasters, regulators are constantly redefining what Canadian
content is, and even what prime time is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top Cops,'' a CBS program that tells American police stories,
fulfills Canadian content regulations because it is produced in
Canada. But the Disney company's ``Never Cry Wolf,'' a 1983 film
version of the Canadian author Farley Mowat's book about the
Arctic, is not Canadian enough because it was produced in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast executives like Ivan Fecan, president of CTV, one of
Canada's largest commercial television networks, argue that while
Canada's cultural regulations may be necessary, their effect is
limited because they can never overcome a fundamental premise:
popular culture must be popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force people to read Canadian magazines or watch
Canadian dramas, but you should provide them with the choice,'' he
said. ``I don't think anyone would confuse this with being
anti-American. It's not. Canada is not another state, and we don't
want to be one.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Melons are the aristocrats of summer fruit, their
cool elegance and exotic lushness perfuming dishes with the
fragrances of a flower garden. The charming palette of summer
colors spans the spectrum, from the creamy white flesh of the
honeydew to the brassy firecracker red of the watermelon. In
sorbets and chilled soups, in cocktails and salads, or simply eaten
out of hand, melons are wonderful restoratives for the long, hot
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Melons have been admired for just these qualities through the
centuries, the admiration reaching something of a frenzy in
16th-century France, when they appeared at every meal and moved the
poet Marc-Antoine de Gerard Sieur de Saint-Amant to verse:
</P>
<P>
   ``O precious food! Delight of the mouth! Oh, much better than
gold masterpiece of Apollo! O flower of all the fruits! O ravishing
melon!''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary abundance and variety of melons available
today would send the poet into a new frenzy. Within the next two
weeks, we will enter the height of the season, when melons from
California and local farms are at their juiciest and sweetest.
There will be dozens of varieties like the golden Juan Canary and
satiny honeydew from the West, and from nearby farms the meltingly
sweet flesh of ambrosia and even the East Coast version of the much
admired French Charentais. The little Cavaillon, which is a version
of the Charentais and is still imported from France, is already
turning up in produce sections where price is no object. Chefs
treasure them for their lovely striated green skins, salmon pink
flesh and creamy sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these melons will keep coming into September, and some
even longer, depending on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them so appealing is their high water content. When
that water chills the smooth flesh of the melons, they taste cooler
and more refreshing than any of the other equally luscious fruits
of summer. In the recent hot weeks, restaurants that have had melon
dishes as specials have made them a permanent part of their
seasonal repertoire because of their popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way the musky earthiness of the melon marries well
with savory foods,'' said Rocco DiSpirito, the chef at Union
Pacific. ``If you handle it the right way, it can take spice, salt
and sweet unlike other fruits.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSpirito's salad of calamari, watermelon and avocado
beautifully balances all these things. A salad at the Berkeley Bar
and Grill is a lesson in how easily melon can be transformed into a
refreshing, attractive summer dish: a lovely construction of red
and yellow watermelon balls, goat cheese and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet melons fall into two broad classes: muskmelon and
watermelon. Muskmelons further divide into two principal varieties:
those with netted skins, like cantaloupe, Persian, Santa Claus,
Sharlyn and Galia, and those with smooth skins, like Juan Canary,
casaba, Crenshaw, Cavaillon and honeydew.
</P>
<P>
   This profusion can seem difficult to sort out at the market, and
it turns out it is.
</P>
<P>
   Muskmelons hybridize eagerly with one another, producing colors
that bear little relationship to what we have come to expect, like
orange honeydews. Alan Davidson, the author of ``Fruit'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1991), says French gardeners in the 19th century were
careful to cultivate melons far removed from other gourds to avoid
``incestuous intercourse'' with cucumbers. In fact, some melons,
like casaba, have heavy overtones of a cucumber flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Ng, a professor of natural resource sciences at the
University of Maryland and a melon breeder, said that because of
cross-breeding, ``at some point it's arbitrary whether the melon is
a cantaloupe, a muskmelon or a honeydew.'' He added, ``There's a
rich amount of variation.'' And confusion. Experts don't agree on
what each variety tastes like _ something that partly depends on
where the melon was grown. But there are, of course, distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the netted Western melons, the cantaloupe is highly
perfumed with firm flesh and a sweet, musky flavor. Crenshaw, a
cross between a Persian and a casaba, has a high sugar content and
is very sweet, with a rich aroma and either a strong spicy flavor
or a mild sweet one. The Persian and Galia have a dense texture
like a cantaloupe's, with delicate flavor and good fragrance. The
Santa Claus has a fairly firm flesh, and is crisp, juicy and mildly
sweet. The Sharlyn (or Sharlyne or Sharlin) has a high sugar
content, with flesh that melts in your mouth but not much aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Among the smooth melons, the honeydew has a more delicate aroma
and subtler taste than a cantaloupe. The casaba has a low sugar
content, is fairly firm but juicy and offers hints of cucumber. The
Juan Canary is sweet but has little flavor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The flesh of Eastern melons is not as firm as that of Western
melons, and they tend to taste muskier. One of the best is the
ambrosia. The Saticoy is firmer and is sometimes sweeter than
ambrosia, sometimes not. Gold Star is juicy but not as flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   The finest local melon, by most accounts, seldom makes its way
to markets in New York City. Hand melons from Greenwich, N.Y.,
named for the family that has grown them since 1925, should be
available in a few weeks in the Greenwich area (they are a
breakfast tradition at Saratoga Race Track). Because of careful
harvesting or because the microclimate in which they grow is
particularly salubrious, they are succulently sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The finest from California come from ``the west side,'' says
Harold Seybert, an owner of Fairway. The reference is to the west
side of the fertile San Joaquin Valley, where the days are hot and
the nights are warm, perfect growing conditions for melons to ripen
evenly. Markets often advertise the melons as ``west side'' because
they are so good.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, melons are harvested in places
where the temperature often spikes, so the fruit does not ripen or
color evenly. And of course, the farther the melons have to travel,
the firmer they must be when harvested. No wonder melons out of
season are usually a terrible disappointment _ rock hard and
practically tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   Local melons are expected to be superb this year because of the
hot weather, but they may not be plentiful because there has been
so little rain. California has also had a good season. At the
Greenmarkets in New York City, 1.5-pound local melons are expected
to sell for about $3 each, the same price as last year. California
melons are selling for $3 to $7 each, depending on where they are
purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Melons have been around for millenniums. Watermelons alone have
been traced to prehistoric times, when they were introduced to
India from their native soil of southern Africa. Egyptians were
eating them around 4,000 B.C. They reached the New World in 1493,
when Columbus took melon seeds to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of muskmelons is a little more obscure. They come
from either Africa or India, and just to confuse matters more, what
we call cantaloupes are actually muskmelons. Cantaloupes are found
in Europe: the name comes from Cantalupo, a former papal garden
near Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Melons have long been treated as culinary treasures, and not
just in Renaissance France. This was true even before anyone cared
that they are very low in calories and have no fat, or that
orange-fleshed melons have lots of vitamins A and C.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been trying various culinary experiments with
melons for decades. Before Prohibition, watermelons were filled
with alcohol and left to marinate overnight, a tradition still
observed at many beach parties. There were several recipes in the
1940s and '50s for filling a melon with flavored gelatin. And of
course, there have always been watermelon pickles.
</P>
<P>
   But the recipes that chefs in the '90s have created with melons
are considerably more imaginative and appealing. There are
delightful soups at Bouley Bakery, Cello, Montrachet, the Cub Room,
Daniel, Aureole and Chianti, as well as a particularly refreshing
sorbet at March and another at the River Cafe. And then there is
the traditional melon-and-prosciutto combination that has been
enhanced with figs at Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How do you choose a good melon? There are some rules, starting
with the fact that all melons should feel heavy. A good sign of
ripeness for most melons is a clean break between the melon and
stem rather than a cut in the stem itself, because when most melons
are perfectly ripe, they separate naturally from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   As with other fruits and vegetables, the moment of harvest is
crucial, because melons do not ripen further once they are picked,
although they continue to soften. Some melons, like Persians,
cantaloupes and casabas, have a little softness at the blossom end
when ripe, while others do not.
</P>
<P>
   The skin of a honeydew and other smooth melons should feel
velvety. Honeydews also have a creamy-golden tinge; avoid those
with a greenish hue. Melons that have netted skins should have a
yellowish, not green, color under the netting.
</P>
<P>
   Watermelons should sound hollow when thumped. The bottom side
should be yellowish, not white. With cut watermelon, look for the
thinnest skin and the brightest flesh, be it red, yellow or, new
this year, orange.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid melons that are too firm or too soft or that have sunken
spots on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   A ripe melon can be stored in the refrigerator for a couple of
days, but it is better to eat it before it has been refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   And there are better things to do with the juice of a watermelon
than to let it dribble down your chin. Puree seeded chunks of
melon, strain the juice, and shake it over ice with lemon-flavored
vodka. You'll never know what hit you.

</P>
<P>
   1 small melon (Cavaillon, cantaloupe or honeydew), skin and

<P>
   With the simplest embellishment, a melon can be transformed into
a light dessert or refreshing first course. Here are a few
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut a small melon like a Cavaillon in half, remove the seeds
and make a few slashes in the flesh. Fill the cavity with port wine
or moscato d'Asti, and refrigerate for eight hours or more. Or do
what Le Cirque 2000 does: serve a glass of port on the side, or
pour it in.
</P>
<P>
   _ For James Beard's Drunken Melon, cut a 2-inch-square plug in a
watermelon deep enough to go into the cavity. Deeply prick the
flesh with an ice pick, and fill to near the top with light rum,
Cognac, Champagne or gin. Replace the plug, and seal with heavy
tape. Refrigerate the melon for 24 hours, turning it over four or
five times. Serve sliced.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sprinkle slices or chunks with lime juice and dash of cayenne.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve thin slices with prosciutto and figs, or with capocollo
or Smithfield ham and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drizzle wedges with hazelnut or orange liqueur, or sprinkle
with powdered ginger or finely cut candied ginger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gently toss watermelon cubes in a mixture of lime juice,
tequila, hot pepper sauce and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that room-temperature melons have the best flavor
but that in the heat of summer, the well-chilled melon is most
appealing.

JAPANESE CONSIDER SANCTIONS AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE GROUP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland, Japan)   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese regulators met Tuesday to consider possible
sanctions against Credit Suisse Group for obstructing a six-month
investigation into its financial activities in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse, based in Switzerland and one of the world's
biggest investment banks, could lose at least one of its licenses
to do business in Japan, according to a government official who
asked not to be identified by name, and it might face criminal
prosecution as well.
</P>
<P>
   If the Japanese authorities were to revoke the license of Credit
Suisse's Financial Products, which handles the firm's derivatives
products business, it would cut off a large source of profit. Such
a punishment also would turn into a huge embarrassment for Credit
Suisse, which has acknowledged some problems in its derivatives
business in Japan but says it took action to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators who met Tuesday are officials of the Financial
Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog. The agency also
handed over the findings of its investigation to Credit Suisse's
Tokyo office Tuesday. Results of the investigation were not
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working to try to persuade the FSA to levy fair
penalties on Credit Suisse Group in Japan in light of our
acknowledged shortcomings,'' said Robert Baker, a Credit Suisse
spokesman in London.``This should be balanced by the clear legality
of our past transaction activity and by our discovery, reporting
and prompt disciplinary action in relation to the conduct of a
small number of our employees in Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Credit Suisse has received close scrutiny
from foreign investment banks here as an indicator of how Japan
will deal with them as it cleans up the country's debt-ridden
banking system and eases financial market regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The firm engaged in so-called window dressing, using a variety
of financial trading tools to help Japanese banks and companies
obscure their losses. Oddly, Credit Suisse is not likely to be
punished heavily for that activity. The legality of that business
does not seem to be in question, although the Financial Supervisory
Agency has begun investigating similar operations of Lehman
Brothers here.
</P>
<P>
   What outraged the regulators were efforts by Michael Winning,
the executive in charge of handling legal matters at Credit Suisse
in Tokyo, and other executives based here to hide the firm's
activities by shredding some documents and shipping others out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those activities, which Credit Suisse has acknowledged, give
officials here grounds to refer the case to the public prosecutor's
office for a criminal trial, which could result in financial
penalties and even jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been compared to the scandal that hurt Daiwa Bank
in the United States several years ago when it tried to cover up
more than $1 billion in trading losses at its New York branch.
After U.S. regulators began their investigation at Daiwa, a Daiwa
employee broke the seal on a box of evidence, which, among other
things, led to a record fine of $340 million when Daiwa pleaded
guilty in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, Credit Suisse suspended Winning and others who
participated in the attempted cover-up and withheld the bonuses of
other employees. But it has contended that its employees were
engaged in an effort to hide evidence of violations of the
``firewall,'' the strict regulatory barrier aimed at keeping its
banking operations separate from its securities operations, not to
thwart the agency's investigators and cover up evidence related to
window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here began to scrutinize Credit Suisse's window
dressing when Long Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank
were nationalized by the government last year. Both banks were
Credit Suisse clients, and their employees helped investigators
understand how the banks had hidden their losses using Credit
Suisse products and services.  &QL;

SWITZERLAND CITES SHARP RISE IN REPORTS OF MONEY LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Reports of suspected money laundering have more than
quintupled since a law requiring expanded reporting went into
effect last year as part of Switzerland's effort to clean up its
international banking image, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Office for Police Matters said it has received 210
tips involving assets worth $270 million, a ``substantial
increase'' in reporting, since the stricter accountability measure
went into effect on April 1, 1998. It released a report Tuesday
about the impact of the new law.
</P>
<P>
   One report involved a $32 million bank account, but most
involved smaller accounts, worth an average of $2 million, said
Daniel Thelesklaf, director of the Money Laundering Reporting
Office, which is mart of the Police Matters office.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of the money involved in reported cases came
from foreigners, he said. It included an attempt by an unnamed
Persian Gulf region country to deposit millions of dollars in
counterfeit money in a Swiss account, he said. The fake money was
not included in the accounting total, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Of the tips, more than 100 are being followed up by local and
federal prosecutors. Most of the suspected money laundering
transactions took place in the Swiss cantons of Geneva, Zurich and
Ticino, according to the 55-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Thelesklaf said it was too early for indictments, particularly
since a majority of the cases require Switzerland to seek
assistance from authorities in other countries, which takes time.
However, the reports have resulted in accounts being blocked by law
enforcement officials in cases that prosecutors decide to pursue,
he noted in a telephone interview from Bern, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 law broadened the obligation to report suspicious
transactions beyond banks to asset managers, lawyers, insurance
firms, credit card companies and foreign exchange bureaus. Prior to
that, between 30 and 40 reports had been filed yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were responsible for 80 percent of the tips, Thelesklaf
said, an indication that they are increasing their monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he was satisfied with the number of reports in the
first year, the report noted that the number ``is still low, given
Switzerland's importance as a financial center.''
</P>
<P>
   It said measures would be taken to encourage reporting,
including ``increasing awareness among players in Swiss financial
circles, especially in the non-banking sector.'' For decades,
handling and managing money in Switzerland has been shrouded in
total secrecy, a tradition that the money laundering office is
seeking to end.
</P>
<P>
   The office plans to report yearly on the number of reports, and
the overall amounts involved.

GROUP GIVES BOSTON A FOURTH AS A TECHNOLOGY HOTSPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- So much for Greater Boston's self-image as Silicon
Valley East. According to a new economic ranking of America's top
high-technology regions, we're not playing second fiddle to
Northern California's high-tech economy. We're not even playing
third fiddle.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, we're number four. And look who's ahead of
us: Dallas and Los Angeles. At least that's the view from the Los
Angeles-based Milken Institute, a think tank created by Michael
Milken, the former junk-bond financier.
</P>
<P>
   Junk indeed, say some Boston technology mavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable to me,'' griped Leslie Smith, director
of the Massachusetts Interactive Media Council.
</P>
<P>
   But economist Ross DeVol, who prepared the study, minces no
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Boston and its traditional manufacturing
industries have waned in importance,'' he said. ``It's entirely
possible that Boston may get back up to the number two point in the
next couple of years, but it's not there yet, based on the way we
conducted the study.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston suffers partly because the study looks at a broad variety
of technology businesses, not just the computer and biotech
sectors, in which Boston is so strong.
</P>
<P>
   But look on the bright side: DeVol sees Boston as a very strong
number four, because of a rich diversity of tech businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston has a truly diverse high-tech economy,'' he said.
``It's not just high-tech manufacturing, it's a lot of high-tech
services as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The institute drew up a list of 14 key high-tech industries,
ranging from computers to aircraft parts. Next, the study
determined how much each of these industries contributes to the
nation's industrial output. Then the researchers examined 300
metropolitan areas to see how much output was generated in these
regions for each of the 14 industries. The top high-tech regions
are places with above-average levels of output in several of the
industries.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that the study found the San Jose, Calif., area
by far the nation's leading center for high-technology business.
But who'd have expected to see Dallas come in second? Forget
stereotypes about oil and cattle. Dallas now hosts six of the
nation's 20 largest telecommunications services firms, including
the headquarters of giant GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In third place comes Los Angeles, which lost a lot of tech jobs
after the end of the Cold War, but has made it up through a boom in
computerization of the entertainment business.
Special-effects-laden movies such as ``The Phantom Menace''
couldn't be produced without vast amounts of computing power and
state-of-the-art software. Remove the Hollywood factor, and LA
would slip all the way to seventh place.
</P>
<P>
   Boston finally appears in fourth place. Considering such local
disasters as the demise of Digital Equipment Corp., it could have
been worse. But we were saved by the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the joint impact of defense downsizing and heavy
dependence on the lagging mainframe computer industry has been
sizable,'' the study says, ``Boston is enjoying renewed vigor due
to its Internet-related prowess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milken report cites numerous Net-related start-ups in the
region, with special mention of Waltham-based Lycos Inc., one of
the top Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Milken Institute's conclusions didn't sit well with
MIMC's Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard Dallas or LA be put in front of
Massachusetts,'' said Smith. ``There is an extraordinary amount
going on here. ... I think we're definitely growing much quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Plotkin, executive director of the Massachusetts Software
Council, questioned the assumptions of the Milken Institute report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you back out the aerospace, defense, and entertainment
industries included in this report,'' Plotkin said, ``then Dallas
and LA drop from the radar screen, and Silicon Valley and Boston
remain the two leading high-tech centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Plotkin noted, the report cites research centers and
institutions as key factors in tech-industry growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clear leadership in the brainpower (and) idea-generation
area and our diversity of technology industries indicate that
Boston is extremely well-positioned for success in the new
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Foley, president of the Massachusetts High Technology
Council, said he wasn't much concerned about the report, or exactly
where Boston ranked among high-tech towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all in the eye of the beholder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Foley noted his organization's members _ top executives
of local tech companies _ said in a recent survey they were quite
pleased with the business climate in Greater Boston. But Foley
warned that last month's Massachusetts Senate vote to restore
capital gains taxes on assets held longer than four years will
damage the state's high-tech business climate.
</P>
<P>
   Said Foley: ``People are going to hear it and say, `To hell with
Massachusetts.' ''

 &HT;    Lockheed F-22 funding in jeopardy
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A move in Congress to cut initial production funding
for the F-22 fighter raises new questions about the future of the
warplane to be assembled at Lockheed Martin Corp.'s plant in
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The House Defense appropriations subcommittee unanimously
chopped $1.8 billion of the $3 billion in F-22 funding included in
the fiscal 2000 budget submitted by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The money is slated to fund initial production of the
next-generation fighter, pending a major Pentagon review this fall.
Under the House panel's proposal Monday, the remaining $1.2 billion
would still be spent on further development work.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), the subcommittee chairman, said
F-22 production should be delayed while money is diverted to
``desperately needed'' programs to retain military pilots and
upgrade existing weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one beneficiary of the panel's plan is the Lockheed
Martin C-130J, the Marietta plant's primary product. The
subcommittee included money for eight Marine Corps refueling tanker
versions of the planes. The administration budget didn't include
any C-130Js.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, Lockheed Martin and members of Georgia's
congressional delegation vowed to fight the F-22 cut, which Sen.
Max Cleland (D-Ga.) said could be fatal to the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House subcommittee erred on the F-22 by, in effect, voting
to kill it,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed a defense bill that includes the
full $3 billion for the F-22 but only two C-130Js.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Lockheed Martin and its political allies in the
tricky position of supporting the Senate version of the defense
bill in regard to the F-22 and the House version as it relates to
the C-130J.
</P>
<P>
   The House subcommittee plan faces another vote by the full House
Appropriations Committee, then would go to a conference committee
of the two chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be very fortunate if you came out with eight C-130Js and
$1.8 billion being restored for the F-22,'' said Rep. Saxby
Chambliss (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin badly wants the C-130J orders to sustain
production of the plane until the Air Force begins a major
replacement program of older models. But the F-22 program is at a
more critical juncture, since a delay in initial production could
foster support for cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burbage, president of Marietta-based Lockheed Martin
Aeronautical Systems, said he was ``surprised'' by the House
subcommittee's action. ``The aircraft are performing marvelously in
flight testing, and the overall program is on track and within
budget,'' Burbage said. ``We do not understand the subcommittee's
rationale.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 people work on the F-22 program at the Marietta
plant, where an assembly line and test facilities have been readied
for the start of production. So far, five test versions of the
plane have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Congress and the Pentagon approved two ``production
test vehicles'' to be built this year, along with pre-production
funding for an initial batch of six production F-22s. The $1.8
billion at issue in next year's budget would provide the full
funding for those planes.
</P>
<P>
   They would be the first of 339 F-22s the Air Force plans to buy.
Congress in 1997 capped F-22 costs at $18.9 billion for development
and $43.4 billion for production. Since then, concerns have been
raised that the program will exceed the caps, although Lockheed
Martin promises to stay within them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a moderate conservative, said he's concerned the Pentagon
cannot afford to buy the F-22 and two other new planes, the Joint
Strike Fighter and the updated F-18 E/F, without diverting too much
money from other military needs.
</P>
<P>
   All three planes could cost more than $300 billion over the next
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said those plans are ``based on assessments made during
the Cold War.'' He added the Air Force should ``pause in its
pursuit of the F-22 and reassess if world events have warranted a
change in course. Delaying procurement of the first six fighters
will provide that pause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it ``remains convinced that the F-22 is the
revolutionary advance in fighter design that is needed to maintain
air superiority in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we've got an airplane on the cutting edge of technology
in every respect,'' he said. ``If we ever let that slip, we run the
risk of not being able to do what we just did in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss also said he has had lengthy discussions with Lewis
and believes the subcommittee chairman wants to keep the Air Force
focused on controlling F-22 costs without killing the program.

TWO GOP CONTENDERS WITHDRAWING FROM PRESIDENTIAL RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note budget change to include withdrawal of Sen. Bob Smith
of New Hampshire.) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ranks of Republican presidential contenders are
thinning, with one departing prospect attacking league-leader
George W. Bush and another preparing to back the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a conservative firebrand,
huffed out of the Republican Party with a Senate speech Tuesday
that lambasted Bush and the GOP ``establishment'' as too pragmatic
and accommodating. He is looking to transfer his frail presidential
candidacy, perhaps to the U.S. Taxpayers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, the Ohio Republican and chairman of the House
Budget Committee, was preparing to shut down his presidential
exploratory bid and endorse Bush on Wednesday as the governor
campaigns _ and raises more political contributions _ in the
Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come a month before a major test of popular
support and organizational ability, an Aug. 14 straw poll in Iowa,
an early caucus state where Smith and Kasich had spent a lot of
time campaigning, but with little apparent effect. Since the 1997
presidential inauguration, Smith had spent 50 days in Iowa and
Kasich 34, according to Hugh Winebrenner of Drake University in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Both contenders have shown negligible support in national polls
as well as those in Iowa and New Hampshire, an especially
embarrassing note for Granite Stater Smith. None of New Hampshire's
three other members of Congress, all Republicans, had endorsed the
maverick hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has two years remaining on his second Senate term,
said his move was a matter of conscience, but New Hampshire
Republican chairman Steve Duprey dismissed Smith as ``a sore
loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of Smith and Kasich also had been plagued by
lackluster fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, in an emotional speech announcing his decision to change
his voter registration from Republican to independent, declared the
conservative platform drafted at the party's 1996 national
convention ``not worth the paper it's written on.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on NBC-TV's ``Today,'' Smith said the party was in the
thrall of ``pollsters and consultants'' who valued winning more
than hewing to conservative principles.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that no matter which party he took his candidacy to,
his platform would remain dedicated to anti-abortion and pro-gun
rights principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pro-life, it's pro-Second Amendment, it's pro-military,
it's pro-sovereignty, it's pro-character and integrity,'' Smith
said. ``Many who want to lead our party _ specifically candidate
Bush _ won't take a position on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other candidates who trail Bush in polls and fund
raising aligned themselves with Smith's sentiments but said they
would stick with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I share the frustration but not the conclusion that leaving
the party is the right course of action,'' said former Vice
President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Steve Forbes, making his second run for the White
House, said Smith's decision was a ``wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Bob Smith is abandoning the Republican Party,
it's that the Republican establishment is in the process of
abandoning grass-roots conservatives,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, in the House since 1983, is not expected to seek
re-election from his central Ohio district next year. His move to
Bush could position him for a key federal post if the Texan wins.

   IRAN-PROTESTS (Tehran, Iran) _ Developing. The worst unrest in
the Islamic Republic's history is countered in Tehran's clogged
streets by tens of thousands of uniformed and plain-clothes
security police, army troops, anti-riot police, Revolutionary
Guards, intelligence operatives, semi-official and free-lance
vigilantes, and ordinary street thugs. In scenes eerily reminiscent
of Iran's revolution two decades ago, police fired tear gas at
countless thousands of demonstrators and fired pistols and
submachine guns in the air as street battles raged through huge
swathes of the capital. By Elaine Sciolino.

subsidies are still one of the biggest forces shaping urban areas.
For all the debate over the quality of life in America's gangly new

ACCIDENTAL REVOLUTIONARY IS CHANGING FACE OF EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wendy Kopp allows the standing ovation to fill the auditorium
for 10 seconds before she cuts in with a modest ``Hello.'' The
applause continues, and she leans toward the microphone again:
``Hello.'' Not ``Thanks very much.'' Not ``Wow, this is great.''
Her gratitude shows itself in a restrained smile.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp isn't here to bask in the adoration of the crowd. She
hasn't come to Houston to toot her horn or gush about what an
amazing 10 years it has been for Teach for America, the ``Peace
Corps for teachers'' she created when she was fresh out of
Princeton University. She's ready to get down to business.
</P>
<P>
   Her speech lasts 14 minutes. No jokes. No cute remarks. The
audience of 790 recent college graduates, which moments before was
whooping and laughing at the other presentations during this
opening ceremony, is entranced by Kopp's practiced oratory. She may
lack the magnetism of some natural-born motivators, but what she's
saying has them thoroughly mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not joining Teach for America to become part of a
system where low achievement rates are viewed as unavoidable,''
Kopp stresses from behind the lectern. ``You are joining Teach for
America to be part of an effort to reach the day when all children
in this nation truly have the opportunity to attain an excellent
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we know that, as of now, we are shockingly far from
reaching that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp needs her words to convey urgency as much as inspiration.
In less than two months, these new TFA corps members will be left
to their own devices in some of the toughest classrooms in the
United States: Houston, the Rio Grande Valley, the Bronx, Los
Angeles, the Mississippi Delta and eight other sites.
</P>
<P>
   They have no prior teacher training. They are very, very young.
Most have little or no experience working in low-income
communities, where they have committed to spend the next two years
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Kopp is concerned, they are the perfect candidates for
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The notion is radical and controversial, but Kopp believes that
academically gifted young adults with the passion to help can be
great teachers without undergoing lengthy, rigorous training.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 corps members have graduated from the country's top
colleges _ Harvard, Stanford, Cornell, Spelman, Duke and the
University of Chicago, among others _ with degrees in science,
math, history and literature. Had they chosen differently, they
could have earned far more than a starting teacher's salary.
</P>
<P>
   They will have five weeks at this Houston-based training
institute to soak up a fraction of what most teacher-education
students study over several years. If they don't use this time
well, Kopp emphasizes tonight, they will surely fail.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp has built her adult life around the belief that public
education is shortchanging poor children _ and around the
conviction that she can do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   At 21, this Highland Park High School graduate created Teach for
America as a step toward strengthening neglected urban and rural
schools. At 22, she was camped in Ross Perot Sr.'s office
persuading him to write a check for a half-million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By 23, Kopp and her brainchild had been featured in The New York
Times and the Los Angeles Times and on a PBS documentary called
``Who Will Teach for America?'' Glamour magazine named her one of
its 1990 Women of the Year, picturing Kopp alongside Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Wendy Kopp, now 32, still possesses the same
mind-boggling confidence in her mission. And because of that, Teach
for America still has thousands of top college graduates vying for
the chance to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp would have moved on long ago if she wasn't positive they
were doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   A SIMPLE IDEA
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's garment district is as unlikely a location as any
for Teach for America's national headquarters. On 36th Street
between Eighth and Ninth avenues trucks line the curb like circus
elephants, trunk to tail, and workers weave through foot traffic
dragging racks of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Six stories up, above neighboring businesses' lightly graffitied
corridors, TFA stitches together its solution for educational
equity.
</P>
<P>
   The office is starkly unadorned: cement floor, exposed pipes,
cubicles separated by glorified particle board, and wire mesh
baskets stacked one atop another for mailboxes. The place looks
like the headquarters of a campus student group, and the fact that
everyone appears to be well under 30 only adds to the illusion.
</P>
<P>
   It also belies the reality that many of them, like Kopp, work
15-hour days and run one of the most well-known education
initiatives in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp oils the TFA machinery from a semi-enclosed office with
little more than a desk and a laptop computer. She keeps few
mementos on her shelves: the framed Woodrow Wilson Award from
Princeton, bestowed upon an outstanding undergraduate alumnus (Kopp
was the youngest person and the first woman ever to receive it);
and the group-shot photograph with Bill Clinton, taken during a
recent dinner at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   There's also a photograph from her wedding in February 1998 to
former TFA staff member Richard Barth. Barth now works for The
Edison Project, an education-reform enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Kopp seems an unlikely leader for such an
idealistic endeavor. Today she's wearing a flax-colored linen suit
and her long, naturally brown hair is pulled back off her face, but
in old pictures she's blond and perpetually tan. At Princeton she
never was the Birkenstock-wearing activist out protesting
apartheid, but spent her time as editor and publisher of a business
journal, selling advertising in the summers.
</P>
<P>
   A media magnet since founding TFA, Kopp nonetheless dislikes
that part of her job the most _ hates being in front of a camera
and prefers to keep the focus of any article off herself and on the
organization. She's not too fond of schmoozing either: Her friends
say she's much more comfortable talking one-on-one than working a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   They also call Kopp, a former marathon runner who's always out
of bed by 6 a.m., super human. And they are awed by her ability to
juggle the responsibilities of a $6.5 million operation, to weather
the critics and to remain completely sane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure it out 10 years later,'' says
Kopp's friend Daniel Oscar, the first person Kopp hired at TFA. ``I
really do think it comes back to this personal sense of
extraordinary confidence and this personal sense of conviction and
passion for what she believes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to establish a national teacher corps evolved slowly,
between Kopp's freshman and senior years at Princeton. Educational
inequity hadn't exactly been foremost on her mind growing up in a
wealthy Dallas enclave, though according to friends she was far
from the stereotypical Highland Park teen.
</P>
<P>
   People who know her frequently apply the word ``overachiever''
to Kopp, and even she describes herself as ``driven'' in high
school: valedictorian of her senior class, editor of the school
newspaper, an actor in theater productions, a standout on the
debate team.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp made her spare change working for the family publishing
business and part time at a craft store. She even sewed her own
dresses. For fun, she and her friends would take long walks and
have ``very intense, very engaging conversations about big,
abstract issues like `Does God exist?' '' says Neeta Vallab, Kopp's
high-school debate partner and good friend. ``I think we probably
thought of ourselves as the cooler smart kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In college, the education issue confronted Kopp, a public policy
major, on more than an academic level. Her freshman-year roommate
had gone to public school in the Bronx, and though Kopp found her
college studies ``easier than my senior year in high school,'' her
roommate struggled to keep up _ ``despite the fact that she was
absolutely brilliant,'' Kopp says. ``That really got me thinking
about the disparities that exist in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Her senior year, Kopp chose sociology department chairman Marvin
Bressler as her thesis adviser. She took her proposal to him _ an
examination of volunteerism and a plan for launching a national
teachers corps _ in the fall of 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp's idea was simple: Recruit 500 recent college graduates
from the best universities in the country and place them, for
two-year stints, in under-resourced schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, she proposed setting up an eight-week training
institute run by education professionals; raising $2.5 million from
corporate donors; negotiating with school districts around the
country; and generating a buzz on the program that would woo media
and applicants alike.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the new teachers lacked in preparation, Kopp
calculated, they would make up for in sheer intelligence and
enthusiasm. Just as important, TFA alumni would bring to their
respective fields _ law, business, technology _ a rare commitment
to improving public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, as any supportive faculty member would say,
`Ms. Kopp, you are quite clearly deranged,' '' Bressler recalls.
But Kopp refused to bite off any less, and the professor finally
gave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you how much I admire her,'' says Bressler, a
professor emeritus who still keeps in touch with Kopp. ``She's
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   ALL FOR ONE
</P>
<P>
   Kopp has told the story of how TFA came together hundreds of
times: how she sent letters to random CEOs asking for money; how
Mobil Corp. was the first to offer a $26,000 seed grant in June
1989, the month she graduated from Princeton; how Union Carbide and
then Morgan Stanley donated Manhattan office space to the fledgling
group.
</P>
<P>
   The staff worked around the clock; part time was defined as
about 60 hours a week; people took turns catching Z's on a
community cot. When Vallab first visited the New York offices, she
saw a sign-in board with everyone's name and categories like
``Taking a nap'' and ``Gone home to shower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of looked enviously at other folks in their early 20s
who went out to restaurants and did normal things,'' Oscar says.

<P>
   In the spring of 1990, when Ross Perot Sr. called the TFA
offices asking for Kopp, she thought it was a prank. Kopp had
written Perot 11 letters asking for support and had heard nothing,
but now the voice on the phone was unmistakable. She made an
appointment to meet him the next week in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally sat on his couch for two hours while he tried to
tell me that he wasn't the answer, that Sam Walton was the
answer,'' Kopp says. When she left Perot's office that day, she had
a commitment of $500,000 _ as long as TFA could match it threefold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a certain naivete about her that enables her
to do things like that,'' says Vallab, who worked at TFA from 1990
to 1995. ``She almost doesn't consider all the things that would
make someone else nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   By February 1990, 2,500 college seniors and graduates had
applied to be among the first TFA corps. Staff members in donated
rental cars were driving from campus to campus interviewing them,
and Kopp was making preparations for the first training institute,
to be held on the campus of the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Everything would come together exactly as she envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I believe in something,'' Kopp says, ``I'm just
convinced that I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BACKLASH
</P>
<P>
   As lauded as TFA was during its first few years, the
organization drew vocal critics, too. The education establishment,
especially, decried the corps members' lack of training.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blow came in 1994, when Linda Darling-Hammond, then
a respected professor of education at Columbia University's
Teachers College, wrote a 13,000-word article condemning TFA as
ineffective and potentially harmful to the children it served.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of first-time public-school teachers enter a
classroom with a year or more of education course work under their
belts (much more for those going into elementary education). States
continue to raise the bar on teacher qualifications, and teacher
educators are pushing hard for longer and more rigorous degree
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But TFA has thrown out decades worth of research into how to
best train teachers. Its program values on-the-job experience and
thorough subject knowledge _ of science, math, English, etc. _ over
teaching theory.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp dismisses the criticisms now as she did then. She points to
corps members' concrete successes and the impressive results of
annual surveys asking principals, parents and students to rate
their TFA teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Darling-Hammond article hurt. Kopp was
vacationing in Ocean City, N.J., when a staff member called to
deliver the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was awful,'' she says. ``The fact is, we were so
weak organizationally that this was the last thing I had time to
deal with. We had no money, the staff was unhappy ...''
</P>
<P>
   By its fourth year, the TFA budget had burgeoned to $8 million.
Kopp was overseeing 75 full-time employees in 10 offices nationwide
and acting as the primary fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But donors had started holding back. Not only did arguments like
Darling-Hammond's concern them, but most corporations had committed
only seed money to TFA. Now that the organization was up and
running, they were less inclined to give.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp dug in her heels, calling every number in her Rolodex for
help. ``I've never been so miserable,'' she says. ``Every two weeks
I would look in the bank accounts and there was no money, and we
had to get $200,000 in the bank to make the next payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kopp was more anxious than ever, no one could tell. Vallab
says she never saw an ``external manifestation of stress'' in
Kopp's manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very strong person from an emotional standpoint,''
says her brother, David, 30. ``And I think you have to be to do
something like that. She becomes the person that everyone in her
organization looks to for emotional strength.''
</P>
<P>
   TFA weathered the crisis and rebuilt. Today, the organization
has collected $3 million toward a $10 million endowment, and Kopp
hopes to expand from 13 to 18 sites. The program continues to spark
controversy in education circles, but interest from college
students remains high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Wendy has any enemies,'' says Bressler. ``I
think she has people who disagree with her, but it's impossible to
disregard her good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had the least bit of malice in her at all, she'd be a
menace to organized society.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THE GRADE
</P>
<P>
   The speech Kopp gives at the University of Houston student
center on opening night goes over big. The new recruits head back
to the campus dorms, where they will live for the next five weeks,
chewing over her words. Some of them may have known her as merely
``Wendy someone'' earlier, but by the next morning the TFA founder
is an icon among them.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp says she could walk away from TFA tomorrow and feel
confident that the organization would thrive. ``It's far beyond
me,'' she says. ``The only reason I'm not doing it is because I've
realized this is the issue I'm most passionate about.''
</P>
<P>
   She spends weekends these days working on a book, an overview of
what she's learned ``about education ... about everything.'' She
admits to wanting a saner life in the future, including a family,
but she's not fretting about how it will all work out. It just
will.
</P>
<P>
   The day after her speech, Kopp sits observing an institute
classroom, where new corps members are studying education theory.
During a break in the discussion, a lanky recruit in shirt and tie
walks by Kopp's desk and bends slightly toward her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to say thank you,'' he offers shyly.
</P>
<P>
   This time Kopp smiles broadly.
</P>
<P>
   This time she says ``Thank you'' back.

<P>
   VALHALLA, N.Y. _ In an appeal to New York's suburban voters,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday she supports making
college tuition tax deductible, a more dramatic solution to rising
college costs than the modest tuition tax breaks favored by her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   She said the 1997 enactment of President Clinton's proposals for
a $1,500 tuition tax credit and boosts in federal grant programs
has helped make college more affordable for many students. However,
she said the high cost of college tuition remains a concern for
families.
</P>
<P>
   Her solution: ``I think that college tuition should be tax
deductible,'' Clinton told a student who asked her about more
federal aid for college education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't spell out what she wanted but said that she has
spoken with Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., about his bill that would
allow individuals earning $100,000 or less and couples earning
$140,000 or less to fully deduct the cost of their children's
college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with a select group of about 50 business leaders,
educators, students and former welfare recipients at Westchester
Community College in affluent Westchester County outside New York
City. Her audience was picked by the college with input from local
political officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indicated that the 1997 package of federal tax breaks
wasn't enough to deal with high college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though we move one step forward, then we get
overwhelmed by costs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's college visit marked the start of the second
week of her ``listening tour'' of New York as she gears up to run
for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y. Last week Clinton created an exploratory committee
that allows her to raise money while she considers whether to
formally announce her decision to run.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour session, Clinton listened intently, took
notes and posed questions to a panel of educators, business leaders
and a former welfare recipient who discussed education and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Hodges, who recently completed a one-year job-training
program affiliated with the community college, told Clinton that
she would like to complete her two-year degree but has been unable
to because she is working full-time and unable to find child-care
in the evenings to attend classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very successful, overall,'' Clinton said of the
federal welfare reform law enacted in 1996. ``But I am concerned
about the child-care piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience were generally very friendly in their
questioning of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton side-stepped a question from Sarah Stern, 40, a
self-described Republican, who asked whether Clinton favored ending
tenure for teachers as a way to more easily eliminate ineffective
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't we make them have five year contracts?'' said Stern, who
serves on a Westchester school board nominating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is counting on the political support of New York's
teachers' unions, turned to a school principal on the panel and
asked her to describe the steps that can be taken to remove a
poorly performing teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Stern later said she found Clinton to be ``very bright,'' but
said she was unlikely to vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't trust her,'' she said, citing concerns about
Clinton's role in Whitewater and other scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But Vincent Beni, a Westchester educator, said he was ``very
impressed'' with Clinton and will consider voting for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't vote for people who aren't running,'' Beni said
referring to the exploratory status of Clinton and New York Mayor
Rudolph Guilani, who is expected to seek the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travelled to Jones Beach, L.I., where she shook hands
with beach-goers for about 10 minutes before meeting with William
Cunningham, her exploratory campaign committee treasurer, over
lunch of crab cakes and ice tea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also shook hands some of the 200 people sitting in the
Boardwalk Restaurant located above the beach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters that she is still looking for housing in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking any suggestions, ideas and recommendations,'' she
said before group of about 20 reporters and a few dozen tourists
who had come off of the beach to see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody have any neighbors who are moving shortly?,'' Clinton
asked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot more complicated than I thought it would be
because I have to worry about security and other matters that I
wouldn't have to worry about under other circumstances,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she and her friends will continue looking for a
home to enable her to establish residency in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was wearing a black pant suit and a light-blue
t-shirt, briefly strolled to the edge of the board walk to look at
the ocean before heading inside for her hour-long lunch at the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will continue her tour of Long Island Wednesday
when she visits a middle school in Rockville Center and a health
care center in Great Neck.
</P>
<P>
   She will then attend a private fundraiser on Thursday at a
Manhattan law firm. About 100 people are expected to attend the
$1,000-per-person event.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to attend the event are Wall Street
financier Roger Altman, who was deputy treasury secretary during
President Clinton's first term, and millionaire businessman Erskine
Bowles, a former White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign is expected to cost $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, her press secretary, refused to say how much
money Clinton and her supporters have raised, except to say ``It's
going very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaigns in New York are expensive,'' he said. ``The last
campaign cost about $40 million and I don't have any reason to
expect this to be different,'' referring to last year's Senate race
between Schumer and incumbent Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican.

WINEGROWERS RETURNING TO RITUALISTIC ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
   (yn) 
 By TIM TESCONI   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ In the quest for great grapes, some growers
along the northern California coast, including the wine industry
leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old
peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow
horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this on a leap of faith. I don't even pretend to
understand all this stuff, but I'm committed because I've seen the
results in my vineyards,'' said Topolos, co-owner of Topolos at
Russian River Vineyards near Forestville. He said yields have
increased and grape quality has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in
the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic
agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as
farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that
doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest
control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the
ecology surrounding the vineyard. It works with nature and involves
astronomy and homeopathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the
chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came
with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,''
Topolos said. ``We can't continue to poison our way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and
question its impact on grape quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell
wine,'' said Dr. Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the
University of California, Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect
on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine.'' Biodynamics is
so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered
for further research at UC Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000
of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast.
The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and
Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a
fringe movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in
California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association. The
approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens
of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified
biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said. Nationwide, he said,
50 growers have earned biodynamic certification.
</P>
<P>
   Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born
philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with
a system of composting and special preparations that remains the
foundation of the biodynamic farming movement.
</P>
<P>
   Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen,
said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine
grapes will attain superior flavors _ flavors that reflect the
vineyard site, a term the French call terroir. Pesticides and
herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality
specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be
copied anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned
his vineyards from toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine
that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be
duplicated,'' Benziger said.
</P>
<P>
   Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using
biodynamic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is
it going to make a better wine?'' asked Mike Gulyash, winegrower at
Glen Ellen's B.R. Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards
for its ultra-premium wines. ``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones
requirement to make a great wine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape
growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture
encourages _ chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and routine
disking, which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines. The hardest
thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and
spraying when you see a problem,'' Benziger said.
</P>
<P>
   What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers
is biodynamics' strange practices, such as applying herbal potions
by the phases of the moon, spraying microscopic crystals and
burying cow dung in a female cow horn.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Willis, the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards,
said the buried horns, crystals and moon calendar that are part and
parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some
growers to embrace. He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes
and try something new. ``We can argue all day about putting a horn
in the ground, but we know it works,'' said Willis, owner of a
Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in biodynamics is growing, Beedy said. ``We are hearing
from people that organic farming didn't answer all the questions
they had. They had questions about the unseen quality of life and
how to work with the forces of nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan York, a biodynamics expert, manages the vineyards at Jim
Fetzer's Ceago Vinegarden. He is also advising the Benziger Family
Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three
years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years,
said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by
helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can
fend off insects and diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces _
``some that we understand and some that we don't'' _ is key to its
success, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with
manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice.
It's dug up in the spring. The manure ferments into a
sweet-smelling humus-like material _ Topolos calls it black magic _
that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land.
</P>
<P>
   Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget
almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   As both an organic and biodynamic farmer, Topolos said there is
some overlap between the two, but that there are real differences.
He said organic farming is more passive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Organic farming is not doing things,'' Topolos said.
``Biodynamics is quite the opposite. Not only do we do things, we
have to do them on a schedule based on a lunar calendar.''

 U.S. COMMANDER SAYS ATTACKS ON TROOPS ON THE (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army Brig. Gen. John Craddock, the commander of
U.S. forces in Kosovo, said Tuesday that peacekeeping troops have
come under renewed attack over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period of about eight or nine days at the
beginning of July where we had no instances of U.S. soldiers coming
under fire,'' Craddock told reporters here in a telephone interview
from the U.S.-controlled sector of Kosovo. ``Recently, that's
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have increased As U.S. forces have fanned out across
the southeastern portion of Kosovo to enforce the peace agreement
formalized June 20 between NATO, Yugoslav forces and separatist
ethnic Albanian guerrillas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, American troops were fired on several times near the
town of Gnjilane. Sunday night U.S. forces were shot at outside the
town of Vitina, and Monday night American peacekeepers were
attacked in Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock said the attacks, which did not result in any U.S.
casualties, were not part of a coordinated campaign. Rather, he
said, it's likely that ``rogue'' or ``splinter'' Yugoslav army
troops and possibly ethnic Albanians are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's incident was a case of mistaken identity, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Several Army troops were patrolling when they were fired on.
``They looked to see what was going on. They found a Serb, an
elderly Serb man, 65 years old, standing in his doorway with a
rifle. So they went up and disarmed him,'' Craddock said. The Serb
said he had mistaken the Americans for Yugoslav troops, whom he did
not support.
</P>
<P>
   American forces first arrived June 14 _ four days after the
78-day NATO air assault was suspended _ to patrol the southeastern
portion of Kosovo, a Serb province about the size of Connecticut.
Serbia is the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, U.S. Marines killed two attackers who had fired on
them. The night before, members of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne
Division were fired on. No one was killed, and three men were
detained for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Craddock said, lawlessness has dropped since the U.S.
forces took control of the sector, one of five that NATO has
established in the province. The others are controlled by British,
French, German and Italian forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the commander said that the crime level ``is still not to
the point where we want it.'' He added, ``There are still far too
many instances of houses being burned _ vacant houses throughout
the entire area _ and incidents of random shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO eventually will deploy 50,000 troops across the province,
including 7,000 U.S. troops in the American sector. Craddock said
about 6,500 U.S. troops are now in the region.

SENATE DEFEATS MEASURE ON WOMENS' HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans on Tuesday defeated a Democratic
measure that would have given women greater choices in choosing a
doctor and longer hospital stays after a mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening vote on patients' rights legislation, Republican
senators said they would offer competing legislation Wednesday that
addresses the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the 52-48 defeat drew harsh criticism from the supporters.
The defeated measure would have let women choose an
obstetrician-gynecologists as a primary-care doctor under managed
care programs, and let them remain in a hospital after a
breast-removal surgery if a doctor advises it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got on this floor, they gave us the back of their hand,
they lied to us and women will suffer,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif. She said the lives of women are at stake if they can't go
directly to a gynecologist after discovering a lump in a breast.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said ``women shouldn't have to go
through a maze of doctors to be treated, but that's what this
Senate has told us. ... I am amazed and appalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Republicans _ John W. Warner of Virginia, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island _ deserted
their party on the vote and joined in supporting one of the
provisions of the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of
Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is considering this week different proposals to give
people more power in dealing with managed care providers, which are
generally credited with helping to control health care costs by
using a network of member doctors and requiring patients to first
see a primary care physician before seeing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders blunted criticism that they were insensitive
to the needs of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are ridiculous charges by the Democrats, that politicize
the issue,'' said Brook Simmons, a spokesman for Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., the assistant minority leaders who is handling the managed
care legislation for Republicans. ``We do not use patients as
political props.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, President Clinton accused the Republican
leadership of catering to health insurance companies and supporting
a rights bill that would do little to help patients who have
coverage through managed care companies, or health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about political power in Washington trying to shut off
something that is manifestly in the best interest of the average
citizen of this country _ and not just the average citizen _ every
single person covered by an HMO,'' Clinton said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seek a much narrower version of the Democratic
patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, for example, say patients need a bigger legal
stick to prevent managed care organizations from denying coverage.
They want to change the law to allow a patient to sue managed care
providers in state courts for pain and suffering and punitive
damages _ whatever is allowable under the state's law _ if a
patient was harmed because a treatment was wrongfully denied.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law now limits such lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders argue that expanding a patient's right
to sue would lead to litigation that would jack up the cost of
health care, making it too costly for smaller businesses to provide
insurance for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republicans support a scaled-down approach to help
patients fight back if they think they've been wrongfully denied
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want to extend new consumer protections to 161
million people, including increased access to specialists. The
Republican's narrower protections would apply to 48 million people
in group health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats held simultaneous dueling press
conferences on Capitol Hill Tuesday with each side jockeying for
political advantage as they eye the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the Republican proposals
lacked substance. ``We're finding out how inadequate, how empty
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are empty provisions, they basically are riddled with
loopholes and they are completely a sham,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle said the Republican bill was
nothing but ``a shell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is preposterous that they would call this a bill of rights,
this is a bill of goods,'' said Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles called on the Senate to reject the Democrats' bill,
which he said contains far too much regulation of the managed care
industry and amounts to ``Washington D.C. knows best.''

THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE BOYS CLUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of a moment in time that should endure well into the
next century, several naysayers wearing the uniform of your typical
American male, macho sports fan went on a rant after the Women's
World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   They beat their chest and said soccer still sucks. They said the
large crowds and TV ratings for the U.S. team were flukes. They
said no one would ever pay to watch a woman's pro soccer league.
And their enjoyment of Saturday's win over China was limited to
Brandi Chastain taking off her jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I have a news flash for fellows in this clique: This
wasn't about you.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup wasn't about seizing the attention of
anyone in the Boys Club. It wasn't designed to change anyone's view
of soccer or the rest of the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   If the World Cup turns out to be a success, it will have little
to do with the sports talk hosts who do remote broadcasts from
Hooters, or any other media types having difficulties or
inadequacies accepting the image of the female athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Based on some of the post-Cup chit chat, that's an issue. A
whole lot of air time and ink have been wasted over Chastain's
decision to rip her jersey off in celebration, revealing ...
ohmygawd, a SPORTS BRA!
</P>
<P>
   To hear some guys talk about it, you'd think Chastain had just
given every guy in the Rose Bowl a lap dance. Geez, get over
yourself. Visit a gym, or take in a track meet or marathon. You'll
see dozens of women wearing sports bras.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup was about women athletes defining
themselves on their own terms in front of a new audience. Of the
90,185 who attended Saturday's game, I'd reckon less than 10
percent of them are likely to attend a college football game this
fall. Or, for that matter, a Galaxy game.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's common profile was that of a family of four-to-six,
with at least one daughter who plays youth soccer. These were
soccer moms bringing their daughter to a big game, just as there
are baseball dads who take their sons to Dodgers games.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team member Tisha Venturini summarized it best after the
game: ``I think everybody in the stadium had a sister, daughter or
niece who played soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the consumers who will determine if a pro league can
survive and thrive, not the Bud Lite crowd. But if anyone wants to
stay on the bandwagon, they're welcome. ``We all consider it an
honor that people who don't know our sport came out to look,'' said
Venturini.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a sport outside of the usual rotation has a big
event, talk of a professional league fills the air. Anyone remember
World Team Tennis, or the first professional soccer league, the
NASL? In the '90s, we've seen pro leagues for lacrosse, roller
hockey and women's softball pop up, with modest success.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer has a chance to prosper for several reasons. For
starters, there is plenty of talent available and a foundation of
youth programs that will keep producing talent. There are 246
Division I soccer programs in the NCAA, and the U.S. under-21 and
under-18 national team programs are having the same kind of success
as the World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, a U.S. league could be arranged around national team
demands, and those demands aren't nearly as pressing as they are in
men's soccer. Many of the top Major League Soccer (MLS) players
have to leave their teams to compete in national tournaments and
Cup qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   And while we may call the MLS a major league, the soccer world
does not. The MLS would be a B Division league if it operated in
Europe. A women's pro league here could quickly become the
equivalent of an A league, in part because there are fewer
opportunities for women soccer players overseas.
</P>
<P>
   And as the crowds for the World Cup indicate, there appears to
be an audience out there. Organizers just need to be cognizant that
great moments and good intentions aren't fail safe.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of two pro leagues, the Women's NBA and American
Basketball League (ABL), after the '96 Olympics wasn't the smartest
way to launch women's pro basketball. The ABL died, and some WNBA
cities are struggling at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a benefactor in television will be important, but a
league can't let TV dictate too much. Pro volleyball leagues let TV
talk them into fundamental changes in the game. Not only did it
hurt the sport, but network TV bailed out.
</P>
<P>
   Television and marketing executives will say a women's league
needs to have franchises in major markets. But I'm no longer sure
that's a necessity. It's not like NFL ratings have nose-dived since
L.A. lost two franchises. The presence of the Knicks in the NBA
finals didn't keep NBC's Nielsen ratings from falling to
pre-Magic/Bird levels.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask a women's soccer league team to play in a 50,000-seat
stadium and compete with more traditional sports, it will be
difficult to prosper. Small markets can offer something big cities
can't, exclusive attention for the product.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest franchise success stories in the MLS, for example,
have been in Columbus and Washington, D.C. Cities like Portland,
San Jose, San Antonio and Charlotte are large enough to provide a
fan base and hunger for teams to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the best place to plant a women's team would be Cal
State Fullerton. The soccer stadium there now seats 10,000, but the
original blueprint included expansion plans up to 30,000. It
wouldn't take long to build it up to a 20,000-seat stadium. Plus,
there are more youth leagues per square mile in Orange County than
anywhere else in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much has happened here to deny the energy of this team and
how it captured America,'' U.S. World Cup coach Tony DiCicco said
after the win. ``It will be interesting to see where we go with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people will stay on what goalkeeper Briana Scurry called
``an incredible, unbelievable, awesome ride.'' Others won't. You'll
know them when you see them. They'll be at Hooters watching women
in sports bras.

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Even a thousand feet above the valley, from the
peak where Brigham Young mapped out his Mormon empire in 1847, one
of the largest public works projects in the nation dominates the
briny expanse of the Great Basin. Two thousand workers are pouring
concrete around the clock, turning six lanes of Interstate 15 into
12 lanes through Salt Lake City and its loping suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   And no sooner will the $1.6 billion expansion be completed in
two years, state officials say, when they will need a new, parallel
highway to keep traffic moving along the 100 miles of the Wasatch
Mountain front, where most of Utah's 2.1 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake metropolitan area is growing by 1,000 acres a
month, much of it to the alarm of Utah's political and business
leaders. But almost by default, in a blitz of highway construction,
the state's leaders are encouraging the very thing they say they do
not want: the instant towns of one-acre housing lots and no
sidewalks, the car-dependent office parks and big box stores in a
sea of pavement, the brown air that obscures the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand miles away, in Milwaukee, a city that
expanded along the lines of its highways a generation ago,
sledge-hammers of regret will soon begin swinging. The city plans
to use more than $20 million in federal transportation money to
tear down a half-built section of highway that was supposed to cut
right through old Milwaukee. It will be the nation's largest
highway deconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urban superhighway should be relegated to the scrap heap
of history,'' said John O. Norquist, Milwaukee's three-term mayor,
who toured the country recently to make his case that cities should
be removing highways, not building new ones. There is no greater
form of subsidized social engineering than the interstate highway,
Norquist says, which hastens flight out of the city without doing
much to ease traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City and Milwaukee, two cities with roughly equal
metropolitan populations (about 1.5 million), each having declared
war on sprawl, are examples of how federal transportation subsidies
are still one of the biggest forces shaping urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   For all the debate over the quality of life in America's gangly
new suburbs, and the effort by politicians such as Vice President
Al Gore and New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman to make it a national
issue, highways can reshape communities in dramatic fashion, often
with little public input. These two urban areas are using federal
highway money to go in opposite directions, Salt Lake to speed
people into and out of the city, Milwaukee to restore a
neighborhood and revive city life.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has trumpeted the Clinton administration's plan to
preserve open space with tax credits worth $700 million, the
federal government is offering cities and states $162 billion over
the next five years for building, maintaining and expanding roads.
The money is from the largest public works bill ever made law, last
year's $217 billion transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money from that bill, after a change in policy under
President George Bush in 1991, can be used for commuter rail
systems, subways, bike paths, even tearing down highways. But most
of it will be used to serve cars. And whether a highway is widened
or torn down, aimed at the center of a city or routed around it, it
shapes destiny.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake, for example, new subdivisions are already rising
in the open spaces through which Gov. Michael O. Leavitt has
proposed the Legacy Highway to parallel I-15.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, a neighborhood of new housing, restaurants, shops
and a theme park is taking shape in what will no longer be the path
of the Park East Freeway, the one to be demolished. In this case,
the market is following the highway's elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem: By Plot and Lot, Not Design
</P>
<P>
   More than most cities in the American West, Salt Lake was
carefully planned from inception, its blocks and avenues plotted
with geometric precision, its neighborhoods zoned to reflect
village atmosphere and to enhance the communal economics of the
Mormon pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways the city is still like a big small town. But Salt
Lake is on its way to becoming a Phoenix of the Wasatch range,
bordered by new suburbs whose only connection to one another are
the highways.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here seem to want this. Leavitt, a two-term
Republican, has proclaimed that the Beehive State ``will no longer
subsidize urban sprawl'' _ at least as a deliberate strategy. But
indirectly, Utah seems to be doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   New highway projects, combined with local zoning that virtually
mandates big lots and big houses, are adding more helium to the
balloon of Greater Salt Lake. The metropolitan area is projected to
double in size, to more than 800 square miles, by 2020, while the
population grows 50 percent. Some people whose lives are in the
path of urbanization are bitter at the government's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 acres of prime dairy land, and there is nothing my
family would like better than keep milking cows on this land,''
said Carolynn Gibson, whose family operates a dairy farm, which
began as a homestead, about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures to sell out are enormous. Hardly a week goes
by when the family is not offered a windfall to sell its acreage to
a developer.
</P>
<P>
   What has made grazing land look appealing to house builders,
driving up property values around the Gibson farm, is Leavitt's
proposed Legacy Highway, which ultimately would run more than 100
miles, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers oppose the highway because it could wipe out up to half
of the region's 43 remaining dairy farms. Two federal agencies also
oppose it, saying the highway would cut through what biologists
consider some of the most important inland bird breeding grounds in
the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make a ton of money and just quit the sweat,'' Mrs.
Gibson said. ``But there's something about the sense of it. It
makes no sense to keep putting pavement over farmland.''
</P>
<P>
   But from his capitol office in Salt Lake City, Leavitt, a
descendant of pioneer stock, looks at a map of the narrow Wasatch
Front _ mountains on one side, a salty lake or marsh on the other _
and asks, ``Where are we going to put all these new people?''

   Utah has the nation's highest birth rate, averaging 20 births
per 1,000 people in the 1990s, more than double the average. The
state is projected to add a million people in the next 20 years,
more than 70 percent from births, and 2 million more by 2050. Dairy
farms could be a luxury, the governor says.
</P>
<P>
   The state's political climate, distrusting anything that smacks
of government planning, has made it impossible to pass limits on
growth. The Legislature did enact a Quality Growth Act this year,
establishing a commission to recommend policies, but as its own
preamble says, it ``mandates nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Utah's growth say there is a contradiction: While the
governor says he wants growth to be guided by the free market, his
$10 billion in highway construction plans are a giant government
push for growth up and down the Wasatch range.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done over the last 50 years with the federal
highway system is subsidize the worst kind of sprawl,'' said Robert
Adler, a professor of law at the University of Utah. ``In building
these roads, you skew people's choices.''
</P>
<P>
   When the governor invited Utah residents to offer their opinions
on growth as part of the Quality Growth process, more than 17,000
people filled out questionnaires. Few responding to the
unscientific survey said they wanted to continue in the direction
the state was headed, with big lots, no farmland protection and
total dependence on cars.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of those who responded said they preferred houses on
smaller lots, just under a third of an acre, near rail or transit
lines, in neighborhoods with a mix of small businesses and town
houses.
</P>
<P>
   But local zoning codes and the subsidies for new roads make it
difficult to create those neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   As in most American suburbs, zoning codes in Utah keep
businesses apart from housing to protect property values and
minimize traffic. One result, though, is that residents are forced
into cars for even small errands. And as Salt Lake has grown, many
of the small towns in the path of the metropolitan area tried to
preserve their rural feel by banning housing lots of less than an
acre.
</P>
<P>
   But with one-acre zoning, a million more people, at four per
household, would consume most of the open space left in the Salt
Lake Valley, according to Envision Utah, a group set up by business
and political leaders to guide the state on growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a disconnect between cause and effect,'' said Stephen
Holbrook, executive direction of the group.
</P>
<P>
   As in many other parts of the country, builders who try to
design more compact developments are stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Tully, a Salt Lake developer, spent years persuading city
officials in Farmington, a community of 10,000 people just north of
Salt Lake, to let him build 175 homes, including some town houses,
on 100 acres with one-acre zoning. He only recently succeeded,
after telling residents at several public hearings that the best
way to keep some of their open space was to build more compact
neighborhoods around parks and green space.
</P>
<P>
   Hugging the bird-congested shore of the Great Salt Lake,
Farmington is on the cusp of big change, shaped by the automobile.
Signs in front of farms and big new houses protest the Legacy
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   State traffic engineers say the number of cars in the
metropolitan area will double in 10 years. So even with the
interstate widened all the way up to Farmington, Leavitt said he
has little choice but to build more highway. The state is also
building a single-track commuter rail line to the city's downtown
sports complex. The rail line is scheduled to open a year before
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake metropolitan area is following a cycle that is
well-known to other cities. Atlanta, after building a ring of
highways sliced by other highways, has one of the most
traffic-clogged metropolitan areas in the country. The future shape
of the Atlanta area may hinge on whether the region decides to go
ahead with plans for a new $5 billion outer beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have turned down plans to widen highways and are
rejecting designs for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Like Utah, Maryland is expected to grow by a million people over
the next generation. But that state will no longer finance roads,
sewers and other developments that help to expand urban areas into
open land.
</P>
<P>
   These limits on growth have their own critics. Some people are
denied the American dream of owning their home, these critics say,
when restrictions are placed on new highways to the edge of
suburbia, where land and housing are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have some very well-meaning people whose idea of future
homes are a bunch of apartment complexes stacked up next to light
rail depots,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Debate: Roads Saving Time Or Costing Time?
</P>
<P>
   Among mayors, traffic engineers and other people who are
passionate about urban design's influence on people, there is a
vigorous debate over whether building new highways causes people to
drive more, adding to congestion rather than reducing it.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments boil down to this: When a new road is built,
people take trips that they might otherwise not have taken. New
homes, businesses and stores brought on by the highway will appear,
and it will soon be clogged.
</P>
<P>
   But if the crowded highway is removed, or not widened, people
will find other ways to get around, taking public transit, side
roads, walking or biking _ anything to save time.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies in England and California support the theory that
new roads add to overall driving time, concluding that every 10
percent increase in highway capacity produces at least a 5 percent
net increase in driving time.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of this theory point to San Francisco, where the
Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront, damaged in the 1989
earthquake, was removed; or Portland, Ore., where a six-lane
highway was torn down and replaced with a downtown park; or New
York, where the West Side Highway was closed after a collapse. In
all three cases, traffic in the area of the highway fell when it
was taken out of use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all this experience over the last 20 years, from Los
Angeles to Atlanta to Phoenix, that shows that building and
widening freeways do not solve our traffic problems,'' said Keith
Bartholomew, a professor at the Wallace Stegner Center for Land,
Resources and the Environment at the University of Utah, ``and yet
here we are in Utah saying somehow this time it has to work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the new highway will not reduce traffic, why build it?
Leavitt says he has no choice: The millions of new people in Utah
will have to get around somehow, and the overwhelming majority of
people _ as much as 97 percent, according to some surveys _ will
not use mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   Even cities that have embraced rail transit have not noticeably
reduced traffic congestion. Americans prefer their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others wonder if there is a way to accommodate people's
preference for the automobile without encouraging a runaway
metropolis. A city left to true market forces, not shaped by
government subsidies for either highways or railways, might take an
entirely different shape.
</P>
<P>
   Tully, the Salt Lake developer, says current trends indicate
that 70 percent of new housing in the region is likely to be
outside the Salt Lake City limits. If the Legacy Highway were not
built, he said, it would be closer to 50 percent, because many
developers would look at building housing in underused sections of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest factor driving the housing market is the
new freeway, most of which will be underwritten by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to have lunch in Paris every day,'' said Roy
Kienitz, executive director of the Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a nonprofit study group in Washington. ``But I'm not
asking the government to buy me a ticket on the Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   An Answer: For Milwaukee, A Setback for Cars
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, Norquist has spent more than a decade trying to
keep the federal government from influencing the place known as
``Brew City USA.'' Unlike most Democrats, the mayor opposes federal
money for housing, highways, education and welfare. The money is
virtually free, so cities take it. But they do so at their peril,
he argues in his book, ``The Wealth of Cities,'' published last
year by Addison-Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Detroit, St. Louis and Cleveland lost people and
neighborhoods to interstate highways, Norquist says. In Milwaukee,
which is surrounded by highways going every direction, the black
section of the city and the old Italian neighborhoods were wiped
out by highway construction in the 1960s, he says. Shopping centers
and sizeable numbers of people in the metropolitan area followed
the highways west, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this sprawl was subsidized,'' said Norquist, sitting in
his office in the 105-year-old City Hall, a Flemish Renaissance
design topped by a clock tower 400 feet above the sidewalk.
``Sprawl is the direct result of accommodating the automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Other urban experts say suburban development is the price for
creating the world's first mass middle class. The highway follows
public sentiment, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying people can go out and have a quarter-acre,
half-acre, an acre, build their own house, maybe put a little
swimming pool in it, all the things they want, and we call it bad,
nasty sprawl,'' Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute has written. ``Why don't we call it great?''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist says he is not against all highways, just those that
slice up cities. He points to Canada, where the federal government
does not pay for urban highways, and cities like Vancouver and
Toronto have responded with a mix of transportation systems that
preserve their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he against the suburbs, where nearly half of all
Americans now live. But as a big city mayor, trying to enliven
parts of central Milwaukee that once pulsed with commerce and
housing, Norquist has a natural bias.
</P>
<P>
   One of the final links of the long-term highway plan for
Milwaukee called for the Park East Freeway to cut across the
northern edge of downtown, across the Milwaukee River to Lake
Michigan. While the part that was built is still in use,
neighborhood opposition killed construction of the second half, and
now the mayor has obtained money to tear down the part that was
built.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor views what has happened since the highway was halted
as a sort of laboratory for his theory that cities will develop
naturally without federal highway subsidies. At the point where the
highway was brought to a standstill, a cluster of new housing has
arisen, in a neighborhood that includes John Ernst Cafe,
Milwaukee's oldest German restaurant. Children ride bikes with
cards pinned to the wheels for motorized effect, the elderly play
chess in a new pocket park and people carry groceries home from a
supermarket at the center of East Pointe Commons housing
development.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of neighborhood favored by the so-called New
Urbanists, a group of architects, planners and others who advocate
more compact development. The neighborhood is not for everybody,
says Norquist, but by stopping the highway, the city has allowed
people to make a choice. There is no subsidy either way.
</P>
<P>
   As the highways carried people away from the city, the new
suburbs have tended to zone out the kind of things that make a
neighborhood interesting, Norquist said, echoing the sentiments of
Tully in Utah. He points to cozy old streets in Milwaukee, where
people live in apartments that are directly above storefronts, and
walk to schools and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be Main Street, USA,'' Norquist said. ``It's now
a code violation all over America.''

CRUISE LINE REPORTS 62 ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULTS OVER 5 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a rare look at crime aboard the nation's growing
cruise fleet, Carnival Cruise Lines reported in court papers filed
Tuesday that its crew members were accused of sexually assaulting
passengers and fellow workers aboard its ships 62 times in a
five-year period that ended last August, a rate of nearly once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics represent the first public disclosure by a cruise
line about the number of alleged rapes and other sexual assaults
that occur on cruises. Industry officials have said cruises are
safe, but there have been no figures because big cruise ships are
registered in foreign countries and are not required to report all
incidents to U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing criticism by crime victims and others
that the industry covers up crime on its cruises. Officials of the
FBI said last year that they had investigated fewer than two
accusations of rape a month in the Port of Miami, the nation's
busiest cruise passenger center.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines, a subsidiary of the Miami-based Carnival
Corp., said in court papers that it investigated the 62 incidents
but did not disclose the results or say whether any arrests were
made. The figures did not include accusations involving only
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival produced its numbers in connection with a lawsuit in
Miami against the company by a former crew member who says she was
raped and sodomized by an officer aboard Carnival's Imagination
last Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival is the world's largest cruise company, carrying about a
third of the nearly 6 million passengers who travel out of U.S.
ports every year. Tim Gallagher, a company spokesman, said he was
unaware of the assault figures and referred questions to a lawyer
for Carnival, Curtis Mase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any allegation would be taken seriously, but do these
statistics suggest that Carnival ships are unsafe?'' Mase said.
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The company provided only sketchy information about the
incidents, which Mase said covered a broad range of sexual
misconduct, including molestation and rape. A chart compiled by
Carnival listed the date of each reported incident, the date the
company learned of it, the name of the ship where it occurred and
the job title of the accused attacker.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were scattered among the company's ships, and
involved employees ranging from cabin steward and assistant cook to
supervisors, engineers and a chief security officer. The statistics
are limited to accusations involving attacks by crew members and do
not include any incidents that may have occurred between
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the company said that it investigated the alleged
incident and reported it to the appropriate authorities if
requested to do so by the purported victim. Cruise ships are not
required to report crimes to U.S. authorities when they occur in
international waters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some members of Congress have complained that
the fast-growing cruise industry is permitted to operate beyond the
reach of the nation's criminal and environmental laws. They also
have raised questions about the industry's ability to avoid paying
corporate income taxes to the United States by incorporating in
foreign countries and flying foreign flags on their vessels.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, rape victims and their lawyers complained that
Carnival and other cruise lines were not helpful in investigating
reports of assaults on cruise ships and that ship personnel were
sometimes untrained in gathering evidence in rape cases. They also
contended that in some instances victims were discouraged from
reporting the crimes to the FBI or other law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The suit that led to Carnival's disclosure of the assault
statistics involved an incident last August aboard the Imagination.
A 26-year-old woman, identified as Jane Doe in court papers, said
that she was raped and sodomized by Yurij Senes, a ship's engineer,
after she invited him to her cabin. At the time of the alleged
incident the woman had worked for Carnival for three years, and
Senes had joined the company two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to her suit and her lawyers, the woman immediately
reported the attack to ship security and identified her attacker,
but she was persuaded not to file a report. A day later, when the
ship docked in Miami, the woman reported the incident to the FBI.
When agents tried to question Senes they learned that he had been
fired and escorted to the airport by Carnival employees for a
flight to his home in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Carnival said earlier that the woman initially did
not want to report the incident to the authorities and that Senes'
departure occurred before the company realized the FBI wanted him
for questioning. He has since been indicted by a federal grand jury
on charges of aggravated sexual assault, but he remains in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman's lawyer, Gary Fox, sought to obtain information
from Carnival on the frequency of sexual assaults on its ships, the
company objected. The statistics were turned over only after the
trial judge in Dade County and a Florida appellate court twice
rejected efforts by Carnival to block their release.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the most obnoxious, stalling, stonewalling
institutional litigant I've ever seen,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   From the first hearing in the case, Carnival has maintained that
the sex between the woman and Senes was consensual, something she
has repeatedly denied. Mase, the company's lawyer, also asked
numerous questions about the woman's sexual history and attitudes
in her deposition. At one point, he asked if she considered herself
sexually liberal or conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with colleagues on the ship, she said, she considered
herself a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Mase said the personal questions about the woman's sexual
experiences were important to the company's defense. He said that
evidence would show that people could differ on whether the sexual
contact was consensual, though he declined to specify the nature of
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in civil suits, cruise lines usually settle
rape cases with agreements that neither side disclose the terms or
talk further about the incident. But Fox said his client was
determined to pursue her case and would demand that rape-detection
kits be carried on every Carnival ship as a condition of any
settlement.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Ehud Barak steps into his new role as prime
minister, he is working hard to convince the region's players that
because he is a different kind of leader with a different outlook
than his predecessor, he can be trusted to take a different path to
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, on the eve of a weeklong visit to
Washington, Barak said he does not want to impose an Israeli
blueprint for peace, because ``coming from me, that blueprint will
have a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary of doing battle, the former general said he wants to forge
a regional peace agreement that ``works for everyone.'' It is not a
starry-eyed plan for regional brotherhood and love; his goal is to
draw a line in the sand that ``separates us from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to break a few standing conventions at once.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to negotiate on several fronts simultaneously _ with
the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to persuade Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to
abandon his demand for the full and immediate implementation of the
most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the Wye River
memorandum, an American-brokered land-for-security deal concluded
last fall in Wye, Md..
</P>
<P>
   And while Barak said he intended to embrace President Clinton as
a ``major partner,'' he also wants the Americans to scale back
their role in the region. He described it as ``overly involved'' _
a result of the recent deterioration in Israel's relationships with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that the Americans should be able to return to their
``special role as facilitators'' and stop acting as ``arbitrator,
policeman and judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the CIA should be involved in counting the
number of policemen in the Gaza Strip to check up on the
Palestinians,'' Barak said, referring to an American task assigned
at Wye. ``I think the American role should be more special. This is
the reason I'm going to Washington tomorrow. I want to share ideas
and build an overall strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department officials were reluctant to
comment on the specifics of Barak's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barak discussed some of this thoughts on
peacemaking and peacemakers. He characterized his relationship with
Arafat, for instance, who had called him a ``friend and partner''
after their first face-to-face meeting on Sunday, in guarded terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Palestinian leader,'' Barak said. ``He's not a Zionist
or a member of B'nai B'rith. We are partnerish rivals, I would
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat appeared physically frail in his public appearance on
Sunday. He attended the summit meeting with his personal physician.
But Barak said the Palestinian leader seemed to be in keen shape
intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say anything about his health,'' he said. ``But his
mind is sharp, alert and clear. He is in full control of his
political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   It was evident Tuesday that Barak, who began a whirlwind
diplomatic tour three days after his swearing-in last week, has
barely moved into his new office. Only portraits of Yitzhak Rabin,
the assassinated prime minister and his mentor, and David Ben
Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, graced the walls. The
bookshelves were half-filled, including a full set of the
Encyclopedia Judaica left behind by his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, generals, and politicians revolved through his office
at a relentless pace. Early Tuesday morning, the American
ambassador, Edward S. Walker Jr., left the prime minister's heavily
guarded suite as a cadre of top army officials entered, carrying
enlarged maps of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday night, Barak was in Jordan, meeting with King
Abdullah at the royal palace in Aqaba, where Barak planned to
discuss his peace strategy and to enlist the king's participation.
</P>
<P>
   That Barak, a night owl, is running on very little sleep can be
seen only in his tired eyes. He has adapted very quickly to holding
the reins of power, and he is in an expansive and confident mood.
He clearly finds it a relief that he is no longer in a position to
merely advise, as he did with Rabin and Rabin's successor as prime
minister, Shimon Peres, but to make decisions himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement Tuesday, Barak said that the new momentum
toward peace could provoke terrorist attacks. He ordered Israeli
security agencies to ``remain alert'' and to increase coordination
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barak cited the risk of terrorism as one
reason he is reluctant to ``proceed at full gallop'' toward
carrying out the Wye agreement. Not because he fears terrorism per
se, he said, but because he believes that terrorism spoils the
climate for peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror can kill the whole process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In making this kind of a threat, Barak is taking a risky tack,
one that some experts believe grants terrorists too much control
over the peace process. Although he did not elaborate in the
interview, it is possible that Barak believes that Arafat has
greater ability than ever to prevent terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he intends to abide by Wye, which Netanyahu froze
last December. In the next few weeks, he will move to carry out
some aspects of the agreement, he said, but thereafter he hopes to
proceed gradually _ if, and only if, Arafat concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly implementation of Wye should begin so they will see
that something has changed, and that we are determined to move and
not just to speak,'' Barak said. ``But full implementation now is
too risky. It would reduce our chances of achieving a permanent
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli and Palestinian analysts say that Arafat never
expected Netanyahu to proceed with honest intentions into the final
status negotiations. Those are the talks to make a permanent peace,
which involve the thorniest issues, including the status of
Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the final
borders of the Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, analysts say, approached the Wye negotiations as if they
were the last chance to obtain a transfer of land from Israeli to
Palestinian control in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If he were convinced that Barak was serious about making a final
deal, Arafat might be willing to start the final status talks
before the third phase of Wye was carried out, Palestinian
officials said. That phase calls for the return of 13 percent of
the West Bank, reportedly in the Hebron area. It would leave 15
Jewish settlements surrounded by areas under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts believe that this final phase could be
both unpopular and dangerous, creating political instability in
Israel and increasing the risk of terrorist attacks on the newly
isolated settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis awaiting us at the end of the street,'' Barak
said. ``It doesn't need a genius to identify that we're entering a
gantlet with a lot of dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is reportedly why Barak thinks that carrying out all the
provisions of Wye right away would reduce the chances of reaching a
final agreement. He may also want to hold on to the land as a
bargaining chip in negotiating other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that he would give Arafat a deadline; he would
promise to return the land by a given date no matter where the
final status talks stood at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Arafat we are going to follow the kind of relationship
you had with Rabin,'' Barak said. ``Namely, we'll have crises. It
won't be easy. We'll have ups and downs and setbacks and moments
when only a direct contact between us can avoid collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will do it in a direct, frank way,'' he continued, as
if talking to Arafat. ``It's clear that we have different
interests. But if we carry on with determination to put an end to
the conflict, there's a good chance we will be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the leaders in the Mideast find themselves in a crucial
moment, Barak said, with the possibility of working together or
seeing the region disintegrate or explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to climb together like a team of cliff climbers, to go
to the summit together,'' he said. ``Otherwise, the alternative is
that we may all fall into the abyss below.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what I told Arafat, I told Mubarak, I will tell King
Abdullah tonight, and I will tell Assad when we meet in the
future,'' he said, referring to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
the king of Jordan, and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not afraid to fight the Arabs,'' Barak said. ``And I'm
not afraid to make peace with them.''

RIGHT WING REELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The extraordinary chaos this summer in the
political right wing is welcome news for the Republican Party, the
Democratic Party and in fact the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   The ultraconservative ideological purists are in the early
stages of self-destructing. They sense they are losing their
following, their causes and their clout _ and in their frustration
they are blindly speeding up the process.
</P>
<P>
   Goody.
</P>
<P>
   Their internal angst weakens their ability to push the
mainstream GOP to the far right, put Democrats on the defensive,
push narrow-minded wedge issues and distract political centrists
from seeking substantive compromises to solve substantive problems.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to the 2000 race for the White House, where
the next occupant will dominate the national agenda for the next
half-decade. The right wing is whining because it is in danger of
being isolated, robbed of the disproportionate power over the
political process that it has exercised since Ronald Reagan's 1980
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday defection from his party of GOP presidential hopeful
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., abruptly moved the right-wing diaspora from
political gossip to reality.
</P>
<P>
   His political change of heart has less to do with fundamental
principles than with his candidacy's feeble 3 percent support in
his own state and 1 percent backing in the national polls. But
Smith's plan to flee to a third party focuses our minds wonderfully
on the sorry state of that cluster of far-right candidates once
confident of controlling the Republican Party next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody took Smith's candidacy seriously beyond a hard core of
noisy conservative activists who want to take the country in a
direction that a majority of voters do not want to go _ opposing
all gun control, banning all abortion, promoting home schooling,
cutting federal domestic spending, peddling isolationism. That
won't change if some obscure fringe party adopts him.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's lack of national identity was compounded by the fact
that too many other ultraconservatives also crowded into the
Republican race, all singing to the same small choir from the same
hymn book.
</P>
<P>
   The odd notion that Manhattan real estate developer and supreme
egoist Donald Trump may join them reinforces the silliness of it
all. Trump for president? Give me a break.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the legendary political machine of the religious
right exhibits serious signs of exhaustion. Even Christian
Coalition founder Pat Robertson concedes that Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, parading moderate credentials, seems to have sewed up the GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan, making his third White House bid, hints that
he might desert the Republicans for the Reform Party if it would
have him, which seems unlikely. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura,
forcefully moving as the party's only elected official to seize
power from Ross Perot, dislikes Buchanan's cultural intolerance and
isolationist views. No matter what, Buchanan is stale goods.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, whose whole campaign was based on the assumption
that he could ride anti-abortion fervor to the White House, cheered
Smith on and blustered about party philosophical failings. When the
GOP establishment downplayed the inflammatory abortion issue,
however, Bauer became the dangling participle of Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle is also courting the far right
with similar views, contrasting his lofty government exposure with
Buchanan's and Bauer's more humble experience. But Quayle can't
overcome his image as a national joke or rally the troops either.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes is going his own way as before, echoing most of the
positions of the right-wingers, but he doesn't need their money.
They may support him in the end, but he will never be the puppet
they lust after, and their hearts will not be in it.
</P>
<P>
   It is mostly Bush's phenomenal early lead for the Republican
presidential nomination that has sent the right wing into a panic.
The flood of money and his high poll ratings demonstrate the
party's yearning for a sensible candidate who can win with broad
support, an unmistakable turn away from the zealots who demand
fidelity to far-out positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush needn't feel as pressured to bow to the right wing as did
his father, who was dependent on the good will of the hard-edged
rightists around Ronald Reagan. This could be the remaking of the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be a philosophical right wing. But the more it
dwindles into the feeble, irrelevant condition of the left wing,
the better off the country will be.

DEBATE SURGES IN WAKE OF TAIWAN'S `ONE CHINA' DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Why would Taiwan risk a military confrontation with
China and test the allegiance of its allies by virtually declaring
independence?
</P>
<P>
   Taipei's bold declaration Monday that it has abandoned the
notion of ``One China'' _ the underpinning of a delicate peace
between China and Taiwan for decades _ is the most dramatic move
yet towards Taiwanese statehood. It comes at an odd time; just
three months before high-level talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's startling policy shift enraged China, which stepped up
a barrage of threats Tuesday, saying the move would ``bring
monumental disaster to the people of Taiwan'' and reiterating
Beijing's vow to use force to block independence for the island of
21 million people.
</P>
<P>
   A top Taiwan policymaker, meanwhile, insisted the policy change
was intended to promote improved ties by forcing both sides to
accept the reality of two sovereign governments.
</P>
<P>
   Observers across the volatile Taiwan Straits speculate that
Taipei chose this moment for a number of reasons, ranging from a
desire to win votes to a ploy to tilt the balance in cross-straits
negotiations. It could also exploit faltering US-Chinese ties by
securing protection for Taiwan under the US-Japan security
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But the move could backfire. Beijing could repeat menacing
military exercises in the Taiwan Straits that in 1996 forced the
United States to send 16 battleships to defend Taiwan, and nearly
escalated into war. A replay of that scenario would put Washington
in a pickle. On the one hand, the Clinton Administration supports
Beijing as the only China; on the other, the United States is bound
by law to defend Taiwan from attack by Beijing, and Congress is
staunchly pro-Taiwan _ even more so after recent Chinese espionage
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our one-China policy has not changed. The Taiwan Relations
Act,'' which binds Washington to defend Taipei, ``has not changed
either,'' said Susan Stahl, spokeswoman for the American Institute
in Taiwan, the unofficial mission in Taipei. Whether the United
States would send warships again, ``would be decided when and if
that moment happens. The US national interest is peace and
stability in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's gambit could also have the surprise effect of sending
Beijing into America's arms in an effort to ensure US support on
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's declaration earned
criticism from several newspapers, but apparent support from the
leading opposition party and the public, the majority of whom
support the status quo _ de facto autonomy. Taiwan resents that
China has isolated it diplomatically, forcing nations to recognize
one or the other. One hundred sixty-five nations _ including the
United States _ recognize only Beijing, while a mere 29 have formal
ties with Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   In constrast, 110 nations recognized both East and West Germany
when the two nations were divided.
</P>
<P>
   The local stock market fell more than 3 percent Tuesday,
apparently on fears that Beijing might take military action.
</P>
<P>
   The current impasse has existed since 1949, when Chinese
communists won a civil war and the losing Nationalist Party fled
the mainland to the island of Taiwan. Both sides declared
themselves the legitimate rulers of China, but by 1979, the United
States and most countries had recognized Beijing, rather than
Taipei. Beijing considers Taiwan part of China. Taiwan's government
also considered China a single nation, though it has always said it
would only rejoin the mainland after China becomes a wealthy
democracy like itself.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan ``is trying to make the whole atmosphere worse rather
than better,'' complained Ding Kuisong, a research professor at the
China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a
government think tank in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Ding asserted the main reason is domestic politics; Taiwan's
presidential elections are set for next March, and the ruling party
candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, is lagging in the polls.
President Lee may be trying to co-opt the agenda of the leading
opposition party, which favors independence, and win support for
his party by standing firm in the face of Beijing _ a strategy that
won votes during the Taiwan missile crisis in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ding said Lee was also likely trying to force concessions from
Wang Daohan, China's top negotiator for Taiwan, who is due to visit
in October. Ding said he would advise a ``wait and see'' attitude
rather than swift action by Beijing, but cautioned that if Lee
insists on ``state to state'' relations, ``it could be unavoidable
to have some sort of military response.''
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts believe there will be immediate military action,
however, though March elections could present a flashpoint. China
has so far stopped short of threatening to invade, and Beijing
could fudge its vow to do so if Taiwan breaks away by saying Taipei
has not declared independence.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan policymakers insist their underlying position is
unchanged; they still support eventual reunification. But Taipei
has been forced to abandon the fiction of a unified China because
Beijing ``has verbally disparaged and militarily intimidated us,''
said the Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's top China policy body.
</P>
<P>
   Lin Chong-PinCQ, vice-chairman of the council, said from Taipei
that the new policy was intended to bolster, not damage
cross-straits relations. ``With equal footing, both sides can talk
about anything. . . . This will make the forthcoming visit of Mr.
Wang more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the risk that Wang could cancel his trip or Beijing
could attack, Lin replied, ``We hope Beijing will behave sensibly
and responsibly.''

BURTON DREBEN; HARVARD PROFESSOR WAS FACULTY'S `CONSCIENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Burton Spencer Dreben of Brookline, Mass., a longtime professor
of philosophy at Harvard University who has been described as the
``conscience of the Harvard faculty from the 1960s through the
1980s,'' died of lymphoma Sunday in Massachusetts General Hospital.
He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of student unrest at Harvard during the 1960s,
Mr. Dreben pressed for open, public debate between faculty and
students about such controversial issues as student draft
deferments and a student strike at the school in 1969. He was dean
of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1973 to
1975 and, as chairman of the Society of Fellows at the school,
oversaw the committees that selected candidates for post-doctoral
fellowships at the school from 1976 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   As a special assistant to the dean of faculty, he oversaw the ad
hoc committees used by the president of Harvard to assess the
qualifications of candidates for tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He served as parliamentarian of the Harvard faculty for many
years and was one described in the Harvard Crimson as a `Socratic
gadfly'' for both students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rosovsky, former dean of the Harvard faculty, once
described Mr. Dreben as a ``man of remarkable erudition and
fairness'' who was ``the conscience of the Harvard faculty from the
1960s through the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   A mathematicial logician who published widely, Mr. Dreben taught
at Harvard from 1956 to 1990 and at Boston University since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Dreben was born in Boston. He graduated from Harvard in 1949
and earned a master's degree at the school in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Juliet Floyd; his former wife, Raya Spiegel
Dreben of Belmont, Mass., and their children, Jon Dreben of
Cambridge, Mass. and Elizabeth Dreben of University Heights, Ohio;
and two grandsons.

<P>
   At just before 5 p.m. Pacific time, Globe Wireless sent out its
last transmission. The company signed off the air using the same
line Samuel F.B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph, used in the
first message he sent in 1844 from Washington, D.C., to his
assistant in Baltimore: ``What hath God wrought?''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on hand was Dalton Bergstedt, 92, who 27 years ago
managed this small marine communications station, surrounded by
cows and radio towers, which beamed messages by Morse code to ships
across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being home again,'' who needed a cane to steady
himself as he sat in a swivel chair before the radio telegraph
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Half Moon Bay station and three others owned by Globe
Wireless _ another station at Half Moon Bay and two at Slidell, La.
_ were the last in North America to broadcast ship-to-shore
messages by Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   Globe Wireless, a marine communications company based in Foster
City, confirmed what many in the shipping business have long said:
The telegraph is as obsolete as the horse and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three decades, ships have been shifting to other
technologies: satellite communications, high-frequency radios and
most recently electronic mail, which allows ships to send vast
amounts of information at speeds much faster than any telegraph
operator can type.
</P>
<P>
   But for operators like Bergstedt, the change is bittersweet.
Though ships may benefit from the new technology, it also means the
end of the line for radio telegraph operators _ known
affectionately as ``sparks'' for the electric sparks originally
generated by the friction of the early telegraph transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad event for me, but I know it's for the best,''
Bergstedt said. ``It will improve maritime communications (to be)
much better than they ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipping lines were among the last companies to give up the
telegraph. While land-based businesses long ago moved to using
phones, fax machines and other communications technology, seamen
appreciated the dependability of the radio telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very solid, reliable form of communication for all
these years,'' said Tim Gorman, director of operations for the Half
Moon Bay station for Globe Wireless. ``But nowadays it's just too
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed has been the Achilles heel of the radio telegraph. The
pace of the Morse code messages is limited by typing speed. To earn
a first- class license, operators have to type at least 25 words a
minute, retired operator John Brundage, 72, said. For a
second-class license, the minimum speed is 18 words a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Some also complain that radio telegraph systems are limited in
the amount and kinds of data they can transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you send a drawing via Morse code? How do you send a
picture via Morse code?'' said Peter Kierans, a vice president for
corporate development of Globe Wireless, which is intent on selling
ships e-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kierans said today's shipping lines are trying to run their
ships with minimal crews and see hiring a radio operator as too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of having a skilled radio person on each ship
doesn't fit into today's method of operation,'' he said. ``It's an
extra expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tasks that radio operators on ships used to perform
have now been automated as well, making the radio operator less
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the International Marine Organization, a United Nations
agency, established the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System.
Instead of having operators relay ``SOS'' in writing, anyone on the
ship can simply push a specific button that indicates a certain
problem _ sinking, capsizing, dead in the water. A signal then is
automatically sent out to the nearest vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Lee, a radio telegraph history buff who will be teaching a
course on the history of telecommunications at Golden Gate
University next fall, says Morse code won't become a dead language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be hobbyist uses,'' Lee said. ``The
amateur radio operators still operate Morse code. You can hear it
any night on any band.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, like China and Russia, have been slow to make
the transition away from radio telegraph and may not change for
years, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   To some veteran telegraph operators, the move away from Morse
code is risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satellites go down,'' said Denice Stoops, who says she was the
first female radio operator in the United States when she began in
1979, but lost her job when Globe Wireless bought and closed the
Point Reyes marine radio station in 1997. ``I think this will still
remain as the most reliable and probably the cheapest and most
dependable in an emergency.''

</P>
<P>
   Bergstedt recalls when he took a distress call from a passenger
liner that struck a reef off Mexico's coast in 1931 and was sinking
fast. The freighter he was on was just 40 miles away, and was able
to respond fast enough to save the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident more often recalled came after the Titanic
struck an iceberg and the ship's telegrapher dispatched an urgent
call for help. Some 1,500 Titanic passengers and crew died.
</P>
<P>
   Another ship, the Californian, was nearby, but its radio
operator had gone off duty and never heard the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Brundage said people should realize that radio operators did far
more than just give and take dictation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of technical stuff,'' he said. ``Being on a
freighter or tanker, if something breaks down, you're it. You've
got to fix it. So you're a technician as well.''

KASICH TO SCRAP PRESIDENTIAL TRY, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short on money, down in the polls, and expecting his first child
in February 2000, Representative John Kasich of Ohio is expected to
announce Wednesday that he will not run for president, a source
close to him said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich is expected to throw his support behind Governor George
W. Bush of Texas for the Republican nomination, the source said. He
is the first in the crowded GOP field to abandon the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really likes Bush and Bush's message, which is close to
his,'' a Kasich friend said. And as he traveled the coffee circuit
in Iowa and New Hampshire, Kasich was told repeatedly that it was
not his time, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, who has languished in the low single digits in polls,
was able to raise only about $600,000 in the second quarter of this
year, according to Federal Election Commission reports. By
combining that with money he raised as a House member, Kasich had
about $1.8 million in the bank, compared with Bush's $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides opting out of the presidential race, Kasich is also not
expected to run for reelection to the House. He has encouraged a
candidate in Ohio to begin raising money for his seat. He also
stands to lose his Budget Committee chairmanship in the next
Congress because of Republican term-limit rules.
</P>
<P>
   More than money and votes have been on Kasich's mind as he has
campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire. In a recent trip to Iowa,
Kasich told the Globe that he and his wife, Karen, have been trying
to conceive a child. While he visited a Des Moines hospital
neonatal center, Kasich animatedly spoke to each of the parents
there, and admired all the newborns.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as he campaigned at the Tilt'n Diner in Tilton,
N.H., Kasich met a woman carrying a 3-week-old baby boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found out I'm going to be a father,'' Kasich blurted
out to the mother as he cooed over her infant. He said his baby is
due in mid-February, just after the New Hampshire primary, which is
scheduled for Feb. 8, barring another state's effort to move ahead
of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Kasich described his impending fatherhood as
``a happy coincidence,'' but said, ``If Karen weren't having a
baby, he'd still be getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate exploring a run for president, Kasich told voters
that he believed in cutting ``that which does not work,'' including
the Energy, Education and Commerce departments, as well as federal
funding for the arts. Kasich also campaigned on providing federal
dollars for school choice programs and instituting a ``loser pays''
requirement in the legal system.

CUBAN DANCES FROM MERENGUE TO MAMBO CREATING RHYTHM REVOLUCION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they dance across the floor, sweat trickles down their
cheeks. It's a summery weekend night at Club Babalu in Dallas, and
it doesn't feel any cooler in here than it does outside. But
Yolanda and Jose Guevara seem oblivious as they merengue, moving
with the precise grace of professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Less-experienced onlookers applaud, then try the moves
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cool,'' Jose says of the newcomers, with a slight chip
on his shoulder. ``But we've been doing this a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world, it looks like, is slowly catching up.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to interest drummed up by the recent Ry Cooder movie
Buena Vista Social Club, the crossover successes of Ricky Martin
and Jennifer Lopez, and a burgeoning interest in all things Latin,
Cuban dance music is escalating in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Observe: Local nightclubs are now hosting Latin music nights.
Latin-influenced local bands are finding it's a lot easier to find
gigs. And lessons in Cuban dance, and its many offshoots and
hybrids, are rising in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quickly becoming a big deal,'' says Joe Cripps, Cuban
music guru and a onetime Brave Combo percussionist who cut loose to
play in a Latin-jazz band called Norte de Havana. Throughout July,
the group _ which also features members of several other
Latin-influenced bands _ has a Monday-night gig at Dan's Bar in
Denton north of Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the No. 1 reason why it hasn't been this popular before is
because of (Cuba's) government,'' Cripps says. ``We just haven't
been able to get the records over here. But now that Cuba is
beginning to open up, we've started importing more and more of its
music. And compared to anything that's on the radio, I think it's
the most exciting thing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Guzman, who teaches lessons in mambo and salsa with
partner Marilyn Ramos, says Cuban dance music's growing popularity
boils down to two words: perfect timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, being Latino is sorta cool,'' Guzman says. ``It's OK
to express your Latino-ness.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only Latinos taking dance lessons and filling the
clubs. Guzman's and Ramos' classes are a mishmash of races and
ages. At a recent class, taught at the Japanese Karate Academy in
Arlington, Texas, an elderly Caucasian couple danced side-by-side
with young, giggly Latino girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of families, too,'' Ramos says. ``No one's
excluded. This is music that crosses boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban dance music is grounded in the roots of Cuban slaves and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, the dances expressed a lot of working-class and
political issues,'' Guzman says. ``There's a part in the plena
dance where the ladies pick up their dresses and show their slips
as a form of mockery. That was our way of saying we were being
oppressed _ and our way of saying it publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban dance's first taste of popularity came in the late '40s
and '50s via the mambo, a form of salsa that originated in Cuba.
New York _ where many Cubans were finding new homes _ is where the
mambo caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was doing it,'' says Guzman, who grew up in New York
during the dance's heyday. ``It became a mainstream thing, and
eventually it went international.''
</P>
<P>
   The mambo craze influenced musicians to start sound-alike bands.
``Meanwhile,'' Cripps says, ``more and more Puerto Ricans were
moving into New York and adding their own styles to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cuban dance music has dramatically evolved,
splintering into several genres and sub-genres, such as cumbia,
ranchera and salsa. Like trying to explain what is truly country or
rock, it becomes increasingly difficult to establish what is
authentic Cuban dance music.
</P>
<P>
   Cripps takes a stab at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, real Cuban dance music is from Cuba or people
playing Cuban style,'' he says. ``What we think of as salsa, which
can have a lot of ingredients, was born out of `son,' a popular
style of Cuban music that's built around a rhythmic bed. And Cuban
music has `clave,' a distinct rhythmic pattern. It gets confusing
because Cuban music has influenced a lot of other Latin music, as
well as African and Mexican music.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dances share a common trait, though: They're
sensual. Especially the guaguanco. ``That's all about seduction,''
Cripps says. ``You see that one once, you won't forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salsa is one of the most popular forms of Cuban dance. Second
most popular: merengue, which has roots in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merengue is a little bit faster than salsa,'' says Fabio
Gutwaks, who teaches both at El Paraiso Latin Club in Euless, a
suburb of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Latin version of disco,'' he says. ``It has a
lot of twists and turns. Salsa is more emotional. It reaches
people's hearts. But the moves are more difficult. People enjoy
listening to the words of salsa songs, but I think they enjoy
dancing more to merengue.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cuban dance music is the next big thing, it could also wind
up being a fad. Same thing happened to swing music two years ago.
But even if it does catch on with mainstream audiences, then
quickly dies, the music, Cripps says, will remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does have in common with swing, whether it's a fad or
not, is the music is good and it remains that way,'' he says.
``Whether fashion decides to lock onto something is kinda unrelated
to the strength of the music itself.''

   PANCEVO, Yugoslavia _ On the edge of town, in a sprawling
industrial park that held an oil refinery, a petrochemical plant
and a fertilizer factory, lie the twisted pipes, scorched storage
tanks, crumbled roofs and jagged detritus left by NATO bombs. Yet
it is not these ruined factories that are the worst scourges of war
in this river town, many people here believe, but the tons of toxic
material that poured out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Farm workers, plunging their fingers into the earth, say they
come away with rashes that burn and blister. Those who eat the
river fish and vegetables or drink the tap water, which trickles
out of faucets because of the damage to the purification plant,
come down with diarrhea, vomiting and stomach cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Children, many of whom were sent away to Slovakia by local Red
Cross officials for several weeks to escape the clouds of noxious
gasses that hovered for days over Pancevo, still suffer headaches
and dizziness. The war's lingering, ghoulish touch could be
affecting even the unborn. There are twice as many miscarriages as
during this period last year, doctors here said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no independent assessment of the medical effects of the
exposure to chemicals the bombing caused. The scientific studies
conducted by the Yugoslavs in Pancevo, by their own admission, have
been carried out with outdated methods and inferior, antiquated
equipment. The results of such testing, said Dr. Predrag Polic, the
chemist who conducted many of the tests, are three or four weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Environment Program has formed a Balkans Task Force,
headed by Pakka Haavisto, who was environment minister in Finland.
It will send a team of international experts to Pancevo, and about
half a dozen other damaged industrial sites, next Tuesday to take
air, water and soil samples for three or four weeks. It expects to
publish its findings and make recommendations in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous moment probably occurred during the fires
when the smoke was in the air,'' said Haavisto, who briefly visited
Pancevo two weeks ago and was reached by phone in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large amount of chemicals burned during this time. It
remains unclear how much is in the soil, but when you walk in
Pancevo you can smell chemical substances. The biggest danger now
is that the ground water and the Danube have been directly
polluted, something that will affect the drinking water. There are
towns in Romania and Bulgaria that use the Danube for drinking
water. In my estimation the most damaged sites will need a cleaning
process, as in places where the soil and water have been
contaminated with toxic materials, before we can talk about
rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, doctors and residents in the town report a
surge of unexplained symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effects of the bombing on these industrial sites have been
enormous,'' said Simon Bancov, the government health inspector for
the region. ``More than 100,000 tons of carcinogens were unleashed
into the air, the water and the soil. The produce is not safe to
eat. The long-term damage to the water table and riverbeds is
severe. People complain constantly of stomach pain but have no
viral or bacterial symptoms. We have all been poisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   The repeated airstrikes on the industrial complex, which covers
several acres, culminated in three huge hits at 1 a.m. on April 18.
The bombs sent fireballs into the air and enveloped Pancevo in
clouds of black smoke and milky white gasses. Flames leapt from the
facilities for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The airstrikes, part of the 78-day effort to destroy Serbia's
infrastructure in the war over Kosovo, unleashed tons of chemicals
into the air and water. An estimated 1,500 tons of vinyl chloride,
the building block of a type of plastic, 3,000 times higher than
permitted levels, burned into the air or poured into the soil and
river, according to municipal officials in Pancevo, which is
controlled by opposition parties hostile to President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical substance, which has left the banks of the river
edged with white foam, still clogs the canals around the town. Huge
quantities of other noxious chemicals burned or gushed out of
storage facilities, according to town officials and Yugoslav
scientists. These chemicals included an estimated 15,000 tons of
ammonia, used to make fertilizer, 800 tons of hydrochloric acid and
250 tons of liquid chlorine (used for several industrial products),
vast quantities of dioxin (a component of Agent Orange and other
defoliants), and 100 tons of mercury, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By dawn of the night of the attack, dozens of people were
hospitalized gasping for air, struggling to see and unable to
digest food, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was blotted out for nearly a day as people moved with
rags over their noses and mouths through the fog.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials, reached by phone in Mons, Belgium, said the
industrial site was a key target in the drive to deny fuel and
other resources to the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO had two types of targets,'' said a NATO spokesperson, who
asked not to be named. ``There were tactical and strategic targets.
The oil refinery in Pancevo was considered a strategic target. It
was a key installation that provided petrol and other elements to
support the Yugoslav army. By cutting off these supplies we denied
crucial material to the Serbian forces fighting in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   This official said that the environmental damage caused by the
attack was taken into consideration.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak arrives Wednesday
night for a heralded weeklong stay in America that will include
hours of private discussions with President Clinton aimed at
reawakening peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some see Barak's recent election as part of a
historical opportunity for peace in the Middle East, many inside
the Clinton administration are tempering their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   They see many long-intractable issues remaining in the
Arab-Israeli conflict, with plenty of chances for extremists to try
to derail talks. They also are finding it difficult to penetrate
the aura of mystery that surrounds Israel's new leader.
</P>
<P>
   In his first week in office, Barak met with three Arab leaders,
a signal to the world that peace is his priority. But on the eve of
his visit to Washington, no one in the Clinton administration
claims to know how he intends to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   US diplomats have written long cables with more questions than
answers about the intentions of Barak, Israel's most highly
decorated military officer who entered politics only three years
ago. The diplomats say that Barak will unveil his strategic vision
when he meets with Clinton and no sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kept everyone at arm's length,'' said one State
Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``He
wants to talk turkey with the president, man to man, head of state
to head of state. His attitude seems to be that everyone else can
just wait.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking administration official said that Barak
``cultivates so much mystery that it's been hard to prepare the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to see Barak an extraordinary four times,
starting with a 2 1/2-hour private meeting Thursday and then
continuing with a dinner at the White House with a table set for
four: Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodman Clinton, Barak, and his
wife, Nava.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Barak also meet on Monday, and then the White House
hosts a state dinner that night with an extensive guest list. In
addition, Barak meets twice with Vice President Al Gore, twice with
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and once with Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the trip is intended first and
foremost as a chance to probe Barak's vision and, they hope, as a
clarification of the US role in future negotiations with Syria and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who spent nearly 80 hours last fall in negotiations at
the Wye Plantation in Maryland that led to an interim
peace-for-security arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians,
will want to get into the ``nitty-gritty'' of Barak's plans, said
the high-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his Mideast experts want to know how Barak
envisions a peace deal with Syria and the Palestinians and his
thoughts about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, administration officials hope to re-energize
multilateral activities on arms control, water, the environment,
refugees, and economic cooperation in the Mideast. Specifically,
the administration wants to restart the annual Middle East economic
summit, canceled the past two years because of tense Israeli-Arab
relations.
</P>
<P>
   American mediators ``are looking for a balance between
overmanaging and under-involvement in the peace process,'' said
Tara Sonenshine, a senior adviser at the United States Institute of
Peace in Washington and a former top aide to National Security
Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's only public declaration of his intentions toward peace
was a campaign pledge to pull Israeli troops out of southern
Lebanon within a year. He has given indications to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, to
Jordan's King Abdullah, and to reporters that he would probably
fulfill the next step in the Wye accords but then wants to move to
what is called the final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations include the tough issues of the future of
Jerusalem, water rights, the return of 3 million Palestinian
refugees, and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is committed to Wye, but he believes that Wye was in
many ways a Band-Aid,'' an Israeli government official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Barak could pull troops from Lebanon, he needs to
stabilize his relationship with his northern neighbors of Lebanon
and Syria. Talks with Syria broke off in 1996 when Syria refused to
condemn a series of terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Syrian President Hafez Assad is strongly indicating he
wants the talks to resume. Barak needs American liaisons to restart
those talks. Albright is expected to travel to Damascus early next
month in hopes of reopening that track.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there has not been a moment of such hope for Middle
East peace since the Oslo peace process was signed on the White
House lawn in September 1993. Every political leader in place has
strong reasons to secure a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But US diplomats still caution that it will probably not happen
fast, and it might happen in pieces. There is some concern about
what the Israeli public can accept.
</P>
<P>
   The occupied territories comprise one-third of the land Israel
controls. If Barak gives back a substantial part of that, ``can
they do all that in one year?'' asked the State Department
official. ``I doubt it. Barak has got to be careful about what
Israelis will accept all at once.''

 PANCEVO: into consideration.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When targeting is done we take into account all possible
collateral damage,'' she said, ``be it environmental, human or to
the civilian infrastructure. Pancevo was considered to me a very,
very important refinery and strategic target, as important as
tactical targets inside Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, anxious families are coping with illnesses
no one seems able to explain. Mothers, clutching the hands of small
children, along with people whose bodies are covered in rashes,
clog the small waiting rooms of local doctors hoping for
explanations and treatment. There is little, the doctors say, they
can do, but wait to see if the exposure leads to cancer, blood
contamination and serious respiratory ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical exposure can produce immediate and longer-term effects,
causing different kinds of damage to the body, experts say. Some
may be clear to the eye and painful; other effects could be silent
and only show up years later. It is difficult to pinpoint the cause
of the symptoms people in Pancevo report without scientific tests.
Neither Polic, nor UNEP officials, said they were ready to
speculate on the possible health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we tell people?'' said Dr. Dobrosav Pavlovic, a
gynecologist. ``We have not advised expectant mothers to have
abortions, but we are seeing more and more miscarriages. I can't
say how much the bombing has contributed to this increase. I can't
say what the results of the bombing will be over the long term. It
will be over a year, when we can begin to look for birth defects
and can detect serious illnesses, that we will start to understand
what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing left most of the 8,761 people who worked in the
plants, 10 miles northwest of Belgrade, out of work. The
government, which was months late with salaries before the bombing,
has reduced incomes from $100 to $15 a month until the factories
are repaired, something workers say will never happen without
foreign investment. The damage is estimated in the hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. companies and a German firm built the petrochemical
plant, used to make plastics, in 1978. Two U.S. corporations and a
French concern constructed the oil refinery in 1969. The fertilizer
plant, which began operation in 1958, was a joint venture by
companies from the United States, Spain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of income in the town has made it difficult for those
whom would like to move or take precautions against the pollutants.
There is now 70 percent unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son and I have constant headaches,'' said Radmila Vukelic,
52.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel dizzy, as if we were going to faint. No one has told
us anything. We have no information about what has happened or what
we should do. I do not eat the fish from the river. I am afraid. We
would like to eat frozen or canned vegetables, but we do not have
this kind of money. We must eat what is in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Pancevo Mayor Srdjan Mikovic, 38, said he is bewildered by the
extent of the airstrikes, especially since his town of 130,000,
with a mix of ethnic Hungarians and ethnic Croats, has long been
one of the centers of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few places in Serbia where the radio and
television stations are free from party control, either by
Milosevic's ruling Socialists, or the parties that oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard nothing from the government,'' the mayor said.
``We have never supported the regime and for this reason I fear we
will be sacrificed. NATO had to understand what they were doing to
us because these factories were built by American and European
firms. They could not have been ignorant of the environmental
damage. I have given up. I eat the fish. How much more can I be
poisoned after living in clouds of this stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   Pancevo was once a frontier town, manned by Hungarian, Serbian
and Austrian soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian empire. The pink
facade of the former imperial army barracks lies in the center of
Pancevo. It was from here that the European troops faced the
Ottoman Turks across the river from 1716, when Vienna captured
Pancevo, until the end of World War I. The buildings, although in
bad repair, look as if they were lifted from Austria, with stuccoed
block exteriors, onion domed towers, arched windows and delicate,
wrought iron staircases.
</P>
<P>
   On the front of the old town hall, built by German-speaking
settlers in 1833 and now a museum, is a Latin inscription reading:
``Justice is the Basis for Any State.'' Outside is a thick iron
cylinder with a hollowed bore in the center. It was once lit with
an explosive charge to announce the arrival of riverboats. The
ethnic Germans, who left behind their churches, tombstones and
architecture, were driven out at the end of World War II after the
communist state was established in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But this part of Serbia has never embraced Milosevic's
nationalist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Pancevo hosted a woman's water polo tournament last year, and
the American swimmers won. The spectators cheered the athletes as
the American anthem was played during the awards ceremony. ``The
bombing has changed how we feel about the outside world,'' said
Mikovic. ``People have lost their desire to fight, to reach out.
They only want to survive. The Americans can come back, but they
will not have any applause from us.''

 &HT;    Ambrose to return to Saints
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, OHIO _ Ashley Ambrose's three-year reign as the Bengals
starting left cornerback ended Tuesday when he agreed to go back
home and play for the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Reached via telephone at his offseason residence in Houston,
Ambrose told the Dayton Daily News he was taking a 5 p.m. flight to
New Orleans and signing a two-year contract that will be worth $7
million if certain individual and team incentives are reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who spurned Cincinnati's $2.1 million offer for 1999,
said he tried to call Bengals officials earlier in the day, but
failed. The team's telephone system at Spinney Field remained
disabled from a lightning strike Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to call and just tell them: Thanks for the
opportunity,'' Ambrose said. ``I'm sorry it had to end like this. I
was hoping we could come to an agrement on something.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the point where I'm taking a little less money during
the year, but I can go beyond what I was going to make in
Cincinnati because I will have a lot of opportunity off the field,
which will really benefit me. That's what I'm looking at _ and the
opportunity to play in front of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who graduated from Alcee Fortier High School in New
Orleans and earned a bachelor's degree in industrial technology
from Mississippi Valley State University, gets a $1 million signing
bonus and $700,000 base salary. A series of incentives worth
$800,000 have also been written into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said agent Kennard McGuire and Saints general manager Bill
Kuharich have agreed to work on a contract extension at midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole thing was getting a chance in the middle of the
year to sign me to an extension,'' Ambrose said. ``Basically, I
told them it's going to be tough for me in the beginning because
they've got guys out there who know what they're doing and I have
to go in and learn everything. But I don't think they'll be
disappointed. I plan on going out and having a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who is entering his eighth NFL season, earned Pro Bowl
honors his first year with the Bengals in 1996 when he recorded
eight interceptions. He had three INTs in 1997 and two in '98.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his first four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, who
picked him in the second round (29th overall) of the 1992 NFL
draft.
</P>
<P>
   As an unrestricted free agent, Ambrose faced a 4 p.m. Thursday
deadline of signing with another club or having Cincinnati retain
negotiating rights to him. His departure solidifies Corey Sawyer as
the Bengals' starting left corner with rookie second-round pick
Charles Fisher as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do was just wait it out and see,'' Ambrose
said. ``Atlanta called back, but I just decided to go home. (Saints
owner) Tom Benson is happy I'm coming because he knows I'm from New
Orleans. Everybody is just ready for me to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose plans to keep his house in Houston, but will take his
wife, Monica, and their eight-month-old daughter, Aisha, to New
Orleans, where they'll join his parents, aunts and uncles.
</P>
<P>
   He's eager to play with rookie tailback Ricky Williams, the
Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, and for fiery head coach Mike
Ditka. He'll compete with Tyronne Drakeford and Alex Molden for a
starting cornerback job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want somebody to come in and be competitive,'' he
said. ``That's what I'm going to present. I feel I've got a good
five years left in me. Why pass up the opportunity when you get a
chance to play at home?''

STUDENT UNREST IN IRAN SEEN AS HAVING LONG EFFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-simmering fight for greater freedom in
Iran has burst into the open in the now-daily clashes on Tehran's
streets.
</P>
<P>
   As Iranian students battled with security forces and the
black-clad Hezbollahi vigilantes for the sixth day Tuesday, and
with another face-off expected Wednesday morning, Western analysts
and Middle East diplomats believe the outcome could shape the
Islamic Republic for years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things calm down, we can presume the moderates will come
out stronger,'' said a Washington-based diplomat from a Middle
Eastern country. ``But if it keeps going, there will be either a
conservative backlash or the regime will be shaken very seriously.
There are a lot of open questions.''
</P>
<P>
   While no one is predicting the fall of the Islamic Republic, the
battles could have a major impact on Iran's relationship with the
West. If the moderates gain strength, ties with the West could
accelerate. But if Islamic revolutionaries sharply put down the
unrest, such relationships could be frozen.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting began on Thursday with the latest closing of a
newspaper, the left-leaning Salam, which means peace, spawning
student protests and security crackdowns. That night, security
forces stormed dormitories at Tehran University and threw students
out of second- and third-story windows. Iranian media report five
to eight students died, sparking the street battles that show no
sign yet of abating.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surprise landslide election two years ago of moderate
President Mohammed Khatami, young people in Iran have steadily
tested the controls on freedom of expression imposed by the strict
Islamic revolutionaries, who came to power in 1979 with the
overthrow of the US-backed shah _ before many of the students were
born.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran's system of governance, which has three centers of
power, Khatami controls the weakest branch and has not shown the
ability or perhaps the inclination to open Iran's society to
Western-style democracy or market economies. With each successive
crackdown on freedom, the students have protested with more
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing had come close to the clashes of the last week, and
now Iran-watchers are having difficulty predicting where it's
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, who have carefully attempted
to re-establish dialogue with Khatami with no great success beyond
cultural exchanges, reacted Tuesday with extreme caution to the
clashes. Government spokesmen sent e-mail messages to their
departments telling officials to stay quiet for now.
</P>
<P>
   From the State Department podium, spokesman James P. Rubin said:
``Clearly, these are significant demonstrations that represent the
desire for political change on the part of the younger generation
seeking the rule of law and freedom of expression, and that is
significant and serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin reiterated the administration's concern for the students'
safety and of the use of violence ``to put down demonstrations by
Iranians students in support of freedom of expression and
democratic values.''
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic cable from an Iran expert in a Middle Eastern
country, which was read to the Globe, showed the uncertainties of
what lies ahead:
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going in the power struggle between the
moderates and extremists, it appears the important power centers
are in the hands of the extremists, not the reformers. The Security
Services and the Ministry of Interior are leading this crackdown.
Khatami himself is trying to keep a low profile and not lead a
radical change.''
</P>
<P>
   The cable continues: Khatami ``wants to make sure that things
don't get out of hand, but the students are saying maybe he is not
relevent. The students are not taking orders from him. There is a
fear that things could get out of control, and there's a part of
the students who want to overthrow the whole Islamic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Metrinko, one the US hostages held for 444 days at the
US Embassy in Tehran two decades ago and now retired from the State
Department, said Tuesday the student protesters have nothing
invested in the Islamic revolution and want to know how the
government can now improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   With some figures putting unemployment in Iran at 25 percent,
``the government is no longer meeting their needs. They are holding
out very little for their futures. These students are intelligent,
they are capable, educated, competent, they have energy. And there
is nowhere for them to go, and so they are demanding answers,''
said Metrinko, who keeps in touch with many Iranians via e-mail
messages and chat groups.
</P>
<P>
   Metrinko said he didn't believe the students were turning
against Khatami, ``but they are realizing he is not going to be as
effective as they would have liked. The honeymoon has gotten stale.
And Iranians, like everyone else, lose patience after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   William R. Royce, former head of the Voice of America-Farsi
service and a longtime Iran watcher, said Iran's young ``don't want
to be cut off from the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Royce, speaking as a private citizen and not on behalf of the US
government, compared the recent protests to the rallies against the
shah in the summer and fall of 1978. ``The difference was that the
shah was willing to go.'' Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, ``has no place to go. He's got to fight to the bitter
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's protests came despite a ban on all rallies and marches
by the government and calls by Khatami and Khamenei for calm.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Khamenei delivered a highly charged speech condemning
the dormitory attack, saying the ``bitter incident has broken my
heart.'' He blamed ``enemies,'' including the United States and
Israel, for the deaths. A crowd of several thousand responded by
chanting, ``Death to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the charges that
America and Israel fomented the attacks were ``utter nonsense.''

industrial park that held an oil refinery, a petro-chemical plant
and a fertilizer factory, lie the twisted pipes, scorched storage
tanks and jagged detritus left by bombs. Yet it is not these ruined
factories that are the worst scourges of war, many people here
believe, but the tons of toxic material that poured out of the
facilities. By Chris Hedges.

   SPRAWL (Salt Lake City) _ Salt Lake City and Milwaukee, two
cities with roughly equal metropolitan populations, each having
declared war on sprawl, are examples of how federal transportation
subsidies are still one of the biggest forces shaping urban areas.
For all the debate over the quality of life in America's gangly new
suburbs, highways direct growth, often with little debate. These
two urban areas are using federal highway money to go in opposite
directions, Salt Lake to speed people into and out of the city,
Milwaukee to restore a neighborhood and revive city life. (Special

 &HT;    UGA will study admission changes
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ University of Georgia officials said Tuesday they
will assemble a team of experts to determine what changes, if any,
will be made in admissions standards for high school students
applying for the freshman Class of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah has said that
UGA's admissions policies _ which consider race along with
geography, extracurricular activities and other factors in
evaluating about 15 percent of applicants _ represent reverse
discrimination and stigmatize minority students.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the judge's comments, the lawyer who represents the
students who challenged the policies said the Board of Regents and
UGA administrators could be held personally liable for monetary
damages in subsequent reverse discrimination lawsuits. Atlanta
lawyer Lee Parks urged the Regents and UGA to change their
admissions policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the implications of the opinion have to be factored into
the development of the admissions criteria for the class of 2000,''
said UGA Communications Director Tom Jackson. ``The team helping
with those criteria include lawyers on this campus and in the
attorney general's office, the chancellor and the Board of Regents,
President (Michael F.) Adams and his top administrators and the
faculty admissions committee. They all will have input.''
</P>
<P>
   With a minority population of 13 percent and a black population
of 6 percent, the state's flagship institution lags behind other
schools in the University System for diversity _ but not for lack
of effort. Admissions officials identify every African-American
student with high standardized test scores and good grades ``from
Texas to Maryland,'' Jackson said, and bombard them with
information about the university.
</P>
<P>
   UGA participates in recruitment fairs, works through black
churches, visits high schools and telephones prospects, ``but it's
not a big pool of people to work with,'' Jackson said. ``There are
only about 700 black public high school students in Georgia who
meet our academic standards, and they're in great demand across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The university stumbles in getting African-American students who
are accepted to enroll, Jackson admitted. ``We're having trouble
with show rates. What do we need to get the black applicant to
enroll here rather than somewhere else?''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Dawn Bennett-Alexander, who teaches employment law in
the Terry College of Business, acknowledged that UGA has an
aggressive recruitment program. ``But I don't know how much is done
to make sure students are comfortable, that they can stay once they
come here, and that attention is paid to them,'' Bennett-Alexander
said.
</P>
<P>
   While white students socialize and relax in downtown Athens,
there are no clubs in town that cater to black clientele. Many
black students withdraw or transfer from UGA, or never come in the
first place, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be useful to do exit interviews with people to see
why they're leaving,'' Bennett-Alexander said. ``And to talk to
black students about what they want. . . . I don't think the
intricacies of the situation have been explored.''
</P>
<P>
   Renita Ward, a UGA graduate who'll start on her master's next
month, said that after the first year of college, ``I had no
intention of staying, because it wasn't a welcoming community. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I found professors who helped me do what I could do and
should do,'' she said. ``People who come here from Atlanta look
around a class, and out of 300, they're the only black person. A
lot of people get discouraged and feel outnumbered because they
don't have a community base.

BUSH AIDES DENY CANDIDATE KNEW OF `WHITES ONLY' COVENANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Governor George W. Bush purchased a house in
1988 that had a restrictive covenant saying the property was for
``white persons only,'' according to real estate records. But
Bush's presidential campaign spokesman said Tuesday that such
restrictions had already been declared invalid and Bush was never
told about the covenant.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of racial restrictions on land purchases has come up
regularly in political campaigns, but the matter usually does not
become a focal point unless the purchaser knew about a restriction.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Mindy Tucker said the governor was not
aware of the restriction, and she stressed the covenant written in
1939 was not valid at the time of Bush's purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no deed restriction because it is null and void under
Texas law and has been since 1984,'' Tucker said. ``No individual
can remove it.''
</P>
<P>
   The land records were made available Tuesday to selected news
organizations by a source who insisted upon anonymity but who has
connections to a political opponent of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, Bush, whose father had just been
elected president, purchased the Dallas house on Nov. 15, 1988, for
$320,000. The deed, like those for many houses in the neighborhood,
included a restriction stating: ``Said premises shall be used for
private dwelling purposes only and by white persons only, not
excluding bona fide servants of any race.''
</P>
<P>
   Broker Steve Collins told the Associated Press that the language
was not included in the deed that Bush received when he bought the
house, but it was in the platting documents that most homeowners
never see. Bush sold the house in 1995, shortly after he was
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   If it turned out that Bush knew about such a blatantly racist
restriction, it could be damaging to his presidential campaign. As
a result, the Bush campaign Tuesday went to lengths to try to
prevent publication of the matter, asserting it was not a story
since Bush did not know about the restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The documents originally were reported Monday night on the
on-line Drudge Report and also were described Tuesday on CNN's
``Inside Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents emerged amid efforts by a variety of Bush's
political opponents to uncover damaging information about the
Republican front-runner. Bush, who has called for an emphasis on
morality, has said he was once ``young and irresponsible,'' but he
has declined to be specific aside from describing a time when he
was a heavy drinker. Bush also has faced questions about whether he
avoided combat by joining the Texas Air National Guard, but he has
denied receiving preferential treatment in becoming a pilot at the
unit.

 &HT;    Linder urges sales, not income, tax
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) hates the federal income
tax code with a passion. Today, he intends to try to do something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Linder will introduce a bill to abolish the income tax, along
with capital gains, estate and payroll taxes. In their place, he is
proposing a 23 percent national retail sales tax, which Linder says
would amount to a tax break for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only going to pay tax on what you spend, and you're not
going to pay tax on what you don't spend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The single rate would apply to everyone, regardless of income.
But poorer Americans would be protected through a rebate on taxes
paid on buying necessities, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   All deductions, including those for home mortgage interest and
charitable contributions, also would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is likely to have powerful opponents, including what
Linder called the majority of Washington lobbyists whose work
concerns provisions in the tax code. He said it is unlikely that
the bill will come to a vote before next year.
</P>
<P>
   Linder and co-sponsor Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) drew much
of their plan from Americans for Fair Taxation, a Texas-based
nonpartisan group that has bought newspaper and television ads in
support of the sales tax strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of replacing the income tax with a sales or flat tax
has circulated among Republicans for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Steve Forbes used his flat tax proposal
to catapult him to national prominence four years ago. He is
pushing a flat tax again in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Linder's bill also has competition from other lawmakers who have
introduced similar measures, including one that would impose a 15
percent sales tax and would retain a payroll tax, also about 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Linder called his proposal a model of fairness and consistency,
because it would treat all purchases the same, and he said it would
produce the same amount of revenue as the current tax system.
</P>
<P>
   But a critic of the sales tax said its proponents are ``cooking
the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, the claim of a 23 percent rate ``just
doesn't come close to adding up,'' said Robert McIntyre, director
of the nonpartisan Citizens for Tax Justice in Washington. McIntyre
said he used Americans for Fair Taxation's own figures _ $1.36
trillion in federal taxes divided by $4.6 trillion in taxable
spending, based on 1995 numbers _ to determine that it would take a
30 percent tax rate to make the change in revenue neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Another weakness, he said, is that the plan would depend on the
federal government taxing its own purchases, which McIntyre said is
akin to taking from one hand and giving to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Linder acknowledged that government purchases would be taxed,
but he said the government would pay so much less in payroll taxes
on government personnel that there would be ample money to pay the
sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that, under his proposal, people who have saved
instead of spent money already taxed under the current system would
still have to pay the sales tax when they spent it. ``Those,
unfortunately, are the people who would be hurt,'' he said.

DUQUETTE BASKS IN ALL-STAR GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The drama of Roger Clemens and Mo Vaughn returning to
Fenway Park for an All-Star Game probably would have been worth a
$2,000 scalped ticket, especially to watch an encounter between Dan
Duquette and two stars who bashed the general manager on their way
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, however, was selected to Joe Torre's American League
team, ruining any chance for a dirty look, a blank stare, an
awkward moment, or angry words.
</P>
<P>
   It also ruined any chance for Red Sox fans to see two of the
greatest players to ever wear a Red Sox uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity to possibly gloat about his former stars
not being good enough in '99 to be named to the team, while the
three players he's brought into the organization were named
All-Stars, Duquette elected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was busy bringing his son Daniel down to the field to
shag during the Home Run Derby, and electing to dwell on his
shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, playing in the game, even though he's
missed the last nine games with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke while walking from his suite on the fifth floor to the
field, where several fans passed him. The common message was
``Great job, Dan'' for the once-maligned GM who has earned the
respect of most Red Sox fans, given the team's performance last
year and especially this season, without Vaughn's big bat in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here are very supportive,'' said Duquette. ``You hear
comments like that all the time. People are appreciative of what
we've tried to accomplish here and the great job our players,
manager, and coaches have done to put the kind of team on the field
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette feels there will be enough reason for Red Sox fans to
cheer with Pedro Martinez and Garciaparra starting and Jose
Offerman selected as a reserve, despite his tumbling numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy we have three reps on the team,'' said Duquette.
``I like what Joe Torre did giving the edge to Offerman on the
ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow Garciaparra to play despite missing time
at his real job has been questioned. The feeling is Duquette wanted
Garciaparra, a marquee player, to play in a game in Boston, while
others in the organization questioned it privately because he
wasn't ready to help the Red Sox, who have lost five of their last
six.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling well enough to get out there and perform,'' said
Duquette. ``As the days go by he feels better and he should be
ready to go. He hopes to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he didn't think there would be any restrictions on
Garciaparra, but definitely thought it was up to the player to tell
Torre if he needed out. Of course, Torre would like his own player,
Derek Jeter, to get significant time.
</P>
<P>
   All three All-Stars became Red Sox players either through
Duquette's trades or through the farm system. Garciaparra was
Duquette's first No. 1 pick in the draft after taking over for Lou
Gorman prior to the 1994 season. Martinez was acquired in a major
deal with the Expos a year after Clemens signed with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette was able to trade the depth he had built at the minor
league level (Carl Pavano, Ryan McGuire, and Tony Armas Jr.) in
exchange for Martinez. He then wasted little time in signing
Martinez to a six-year, $75 million deal. After losing Vaughn in a
bitter contract squabble, Duquette signed Offerman to a four-year,
$26 million deal, far more than any other team was willing to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemens and Vaughn, Duquette will say little about either
player. He did mention Vaughn not making it because, ``It would
have been difficult to take him based on the fact he's missed time
because of injuries. The injuries have really held him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette lauded the efforts of the Red Sox and Major League
Baseball in bringing together great stars of the past and former
Red Sox players such as Ted Williams, who threw out the first ball.
Carlton Fisk also made an appearance Monday, and there have been
many others around the FanFest events over the weekend, though one
ex-Red Sox who was not involved was eight-time All-Star Frank
Malzone, a scout for the team who was nowhere to be found. Also
conspicuous by his absence was former Red Sox general manager Lou
Gorman, who still works for the team as an assistant to Sox CEO
John Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   So many have come and gone since Duquette took the reigns, but
his successes were on the field in an All-Star Game at Fenway,
while his failures watched on TV.

 &HT;    As blacks gravitate toward `niche' channels, big networks grow
more white
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the NAACP on Monday decried the lack of minorities on
upcoming network TV shows, it only pointed out what's been obvious
to many minority viewers for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice it to the point where I don't notice it anymore, it's
so expected,'' says Jimmy Stroud, 32, an African-American Web page
designer from Atlanta, of the major networks' shortage of prominent
minority characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem has been the omission of realistic situations
within the black community _ all we get is stereotypical slapstick
comedy-type programs and nothing of substance,'' adds Reggie
Mitchell, director of broadcast training at Clark Atlanta
University. ``If you came down from Mars and only got your
information about black people from TV, we'd look like idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 shows premiering this fall on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox,
none features an African-American, Latino or Asian-American in a
starring or prominent role, said Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, at the
civil rights organization's 90th annual convention in New York.
Mfume called the situation a ``virtual whitewash in network
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   While the networks quibbled with the numbers _ ABC, for
instance, noted that David E. Kelley's latest, ``Snoops,'' features
minority actresses Paula Jai Parker and Majandra Delfino as part of
its ensemble cast _ they didn't duck Mfume's basic point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all agree that those of us in the entertainment
industry need to make sure the characters on our screen reflect the
diversity of the population as a whole,'' said Leslie Moonves,
president of CBS Television.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers point to the expanding TV universe to explain the
dwindling number of prominent minority characters on ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox. Minority-oriented programming has increasingly been driven
toward niche networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a few small services, like UPN, the WB and BET,
trying to cater to urban black audiences,'' says TV historian Alex
McNeil. ``I don't know if it's cause or effect, but therefore you
also seem to have more shows (on the networks) that have all-white
casts, like `Friends.'''
</P>
<P>
   One result has been the fragmenting of TV audiences along racial
lines. Only six of last season's shows ranked in the Top 20 among
both black households and total households _ the highest number of
crossovers since the 1990-91 season. The top-rated show in black
households, ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' ranked No. 154 in white
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too hard to figure out,'' said Doug Alligood, senior
vice president for special markets at BBDO, a New York ad agency
that annually breaks down viewing habits between blacks and whites.
``If you put yourself overseas in a foreign country, say you're
looking at French TV, and you turn it on and there's a show set in
New York City, you're going to watch it. You're not going to
analyze the quality of it, you're going to be so glad to see it.
That's where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Kisha Dennis, 25, a producer for the communications
department of the city of Atlanta, says, ``The reason I watch `Ally
McBeal' is there's a sister (Lisa Nicole Carson) on that. When I
see a familiar face, one that looks like me, has mannerisms like
me, someone I have a lot in common with, I'm drawn toward that.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil refers to the 1974-75 network season as the ``high-water
mark'' in the popularity of race-conscious shows: ``Sanford and
Son'' (No. 2), ``Chico and the Man'' (3), ``The Jeffersons'' (4)
and ``Good Times'' (8) were all monority-based programs that
finished in the Neilsen Top 10. And in the year's top-rated show,
``All in the Family,'' race was a prominent theme.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, last season's Top 5 entertainment shows _ ``ER,''
``Friends,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Veronica's Closet'' and ``Jesse'' _
were principally white-cast shows with a sprinkling of prominent
minority characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious there is a downturn in black representation in
prime time,'' says Alligood. ``What is not obvious is why. Is it an
oversight? Somebody's decision there's not enough talent? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Fontana, producer of such critically acclaimed and racially
diverse shows as NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and HBO's
``Oz,'' says the networks' current lemming-like embrace of young,
white audiences is mostly a commercial decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guilt lies more in the networks grabbing for a
very specific audience next season _ the teenaged white audience _
than in creative people saying, `I'm going to be exclusive and not
write for other ethnic groups,''' Fontana says. ``The demand from
the networks is give us white high school students, and people give
them what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arbitrary nature of what they're looking for changes from
season to season,'' Fontana adds. ``This season they've all decided
they're going for the teen audience. Next year, everybody might
want Latino characters. It's the nature of selling: who's buying
and who they're trying to sell to determines the color of faces on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation is no comfort to minority viewers, who until the
mid-1960s were virtually excluded from TV programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why the (black) community feels panicky and frustrated,''
says Alligood. ``It was enjoying the direction things were going
in, and then all of a sudden it was gone and people are asking,
`Are you ignoring us again? Are we going back to the days when we
didn't exist other than as maids and butlers?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is not to go back. It's to go forward creatively.''

   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ In ``The Killing'' (1956), one of
Stanley Kubrick's earliest feature films, a man talking about his
cronies in a racetrack heist remarks: ``None of these men are
criminals in the usual sense. They've all got jobs and they all
live seemingly normal, decent lives, but they've got their problems
and they've all got a little larceny in them.'' Change ``a little
larceny'' to varying degrees of ``a lot'' and you've got a pretty
good description of Kubrick's entire body of work. Kubrick's new
movie, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a lugubrious, strangely static work that
he completed shortly before his death in March, is no exception.
The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a wealthy New York
couple who imperil their cushy, bourgeois lives by yielding to the
dark side of their natures. By Michiko Kakutani.

   BELGIAN-FILMS (Undated) _ This year marked the triumph of the
realist strain in Belgian film, as ``Rosetta,'' directed by Luc and
Jean-Pierre Dardenne (brothers whose previous films include ``La
Promesse'') captured top honors, including the Palme d'Or, at the
Cannes International Film Festival. (While across town ``The
Carriers are Waiting,'' a comedy about a working-class family by a
firsttime Belgian director, Benoit Mariage, played to packed houses
at the Director's Fortnight, a sidebar to the main festival.)
``Rosetta,'' which will open here in the fall, uses a hand-held
camera and a cinema verite style to tell an intense moral fable
about an impoverished young girl's struggle to hold down a menial
job while maintaining shreds of dignity. By Leslie Camhi. Photo.

<P>
   CABARET-BALKAN-FILM (Paris) _ It is not an easy time for a
Serbian filmmaker to be releasing a new movie in the United States,
even for a veteran director like Goran Paskaljevic, who has long
opposed Slobodan Milosevic's regime, who has expressed his shame
over the atrocities committed by Serbian forces in Bosnia and
Kosovo, who has been denounced as a traitor by the official press
in Belgrade. For all that, he remains a Serb, and, as such, he is
expected to throw light on the collective madness that has gripped
a good many of his fellow Serbs of late. As it happens, this was
his objective when he began shooting ``Cabaret Balkan,'' his 11th
feature film, in Belgrade in the early spring of 1998. It was still
a year before NATO launched its aerial war against Yugoslavia in
the name of saving Kosovo, but Paskaljevic was already convinced
that Milosevic was leading his nation to disaster. His movie is
about people, not politics, but nonetheless about people driven to
violence and despair by politics. By Alan Riding. Photo.

<P>
   SOLITUDE-THEATER (London) _ ``Fair enough then. So we're
alone.'' When Dame Judi Dench, playing a grieving veteran theater
actress, speaks the final line of ``Amy's View'' Sunday on Broadway
during the last performance at the Ethel Barrymore Theater of David
Hare's play, the remark may make theatergoers sit up with a start.
Part of the frisson comes from the elegant visualization of those
closing moments, in which cascading sheets of silk prompt a far
more real emotive response than any musical's mechanized scenery
ever could. For that, credit Richard Eyre, the director, and Bob
Crowley, the designer, alongside that rare performer, Dame Judi,
who is never more moving than when she is being most
matter-of-fact. But beyond the simplicity of a scene that works
simultaneously as baptism and requiem, is the stark, declarative
nature of the concluding remarks of Dame Judi's character, Esme
Allen. In just those six unsentimental words, Esme gives voice to a
condition that has been dramatized of late with varying degrees of
urgency and pathos on New York and London stages. By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   GEORGE-BENJAMIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Some artists bloom young;
others do not find themselves until they are a decade or two into
adult life. George Benjamin, 3, the English composer who is in
residence at the Tanglewood Music Center Festival of Contemporary
Music, beginning on Thursday in Lenox, Mass., where his music will
be featured, has followed both patterns. In his late teens and
early 20s Benjamin produced a quick succession of bold and
beautiful works, full of energy and color, and remarkable also for
their technical finish. Then the flow almost stopped until, as he
entered his 30s in 1990, he emerged again as an even stronger
creative presence, with the same keen ear but a weightier mind. The
Tanglewood programs include pieces from both the youthful
flourishing and later. By Paul Griffiths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-PARK-OPERAS (New York) _ A new operatic project could
hardly receive a more auspicious introduction than that to be
accorded over the next five months to ``Central Park,'' a trilogy
of one-act operas by three American composer-librettist teams.
That's why the flak that the project has stirred up among many
people concerned about the future of American opera, especially
American composers, has been so noteworthy. The short operas that
make up the trilogy are linked thematically only in that each story
is set in New York's most famous park. ``Central Park'' will have
its premiere on Saturday evening at the Glimmerglass Opera in
Cooperstown, N.Y. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   BAROQUE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Celine Dion singing ``My Heart Will Go
On'' and a Locatelli violin concerto send me to the radio's ``off''
button with equal velocity. A decision about Ms. Dion took about 45
seconds, Locatelli more like 30 years. But the two are annoying for
similar reasons. Ms. Dion makes it easy. The disposable charms of a
momentarily famous pop singer are brief by nature. Yet how has a
love affair with the Italian Baroque _ born of the postwar
long-playing record boom _ gone so wrong? Those of us raised on the
big pieces of the 19th century, a lot of Mozart and a little Haydn
raced to the record stores to hear the latest Torelli and Corelli
from chamber orchestras like I Musici or I Virtuosi di Roma. We
were charmed by the elegance and the certitude. We liked the
absence of bigness for its own sake and the clarity of small string
ensembles in synchrony. With exceptions (Vivaldi is one), I find
this music increasingly difficult to listen to. Saturation?
Perhaps. Near-symmetry, often repeated, numbs the spirit; the
frictionless paradoxically becomes an irritant. This civilizing of
human passions runs like a current beneath the great musical events
of the 18th century, although the best composers, refusing to be so
easily tamed, fought against the tide. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   CONDUCTORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ At a time when so many orchestras
and conductors are changing partners, it is good to be reminded of
the artistic benefits of retaining a long-term maestro. One such
reminder comes in the form of a Sony Classical reissue of two
classic recordings by the Cleveland Orchestra under the direction
of George Szell: Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1959, and
Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, recorded in 1965. These
performances may not induce discophiles to part with their version
of the Prokofiev by Herbert von Karajan or of the Bartok by Fritz
Reiner, but both offer orchestral playing of breathtaking
refinement while challenging the notion that Szell was a dour
taskmaster and an interpretive literalist. By David Schiff.

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most of the recent controversy about
on-line music has been over how it is going to change the
experience of selling and purchasing music, but much more
interesting is the question of how it is changing our experience of
listening to and handling the music. Listening to music on the
Internet is not simply a novel alternative to CD players or a way
to use the computer as a separate but equal stereo system. Nor is
it an opportunity to level the playing field _ as utopians like to
dream _ and allow all musicians, great and small, access to all
listeners mainstream and marginal. It is a key to unlocking the
restrictions that all audio storage media before them have posed to
musicians and fans. The CD was a medium similar enough to a record
that one could still call it an album without being corrected. But
with the Internet, the idea of the album is dead. By Neil Strauss.

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-ARTISTS (Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y.) _ Since the late
1980s, a number of younger Japanese artists have emerged on the
international scene to challenge the old notion that all modern art
from Japan is merely a pale imitation of modern art from the West.
Among them are Yasumasa Morimura, Tatsuo Miyajima, Mariko Mori and
Takashi Murakami, whose goofy, glossy work has found an avid
audience outside Japan. Rooted in Japanese popular culture,
Murakami's art communicates across borders in a media-driven era of
global pop to which fashion, animation, music and electronic
gadgetry from Japan have all contributed. It is now the focus of
``The Meaning of the Nonsense of the Meaning,'' a
mini-retrospective on view here at the Center for Curatorial
Studies Museum at Bard College through Sept. 12. By Edward M.

MINORITY WOMEN SAY THEY'VE HIT BARRIER TO CORPORATE ADVANCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minority women who have achieved management jobs in US
corporations paint a picture of extreme isolation in their jobs and
say they often hit a ``concrete ceiling'' in which there is no
clear path to advancement, according to an in-depth study by a New
York research organization.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst, which specializes in issues facing women in the
workplace, said that almost half of the 1,735 minority female
executives surveyed say they lack a formal relationship with a
mentor and 40 percent report they do not have even the informal
network that may be helpful to advancing within their companies.
</P>
<P>
   These black, Hispanic, and Asian-American women also said that
even though their employers are strongly committed to recruiting
minority women through diversity programs, they often are
ineffective in helping them with further career development once
they are in the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mentor gives you the politics of an organization, the
culture of an organization, clues you into what's going on, helps
you avoid pitfalls, pushes your career forward,'' said Sheila
Wellington, Catalyst's president.
</P>
<P>
   Because many minority women often lack mentors of a network of
supporters, they ``frequently feel at sea'' in their jobs,
Wellington said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the findings were not surprising, the report is
among the most comprehensive looks at the specific issues facing
minority women as their numbers in the work force are on the rise
in a trend that is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst sent surveys to more than 6,500 minority women in
management positions who were within seven reporting levels of the
chief executive; the 1,735 respondents resulted in a 27 percent
response rate, which is considered adequate for a reliable survey.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year study by Catalyst also involved 59 focus groups
with minority women executives and research conducted inside 15
companies, most of them in the Fortune 1,000 list of firms,
Catalyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst said minority women must remain in a job 3.6 years on
average _ a year more than white women _ before winning promotions.
Also, minority women are often in lower levels of management, which
helps explain their inability to get past the ``concrete ceiling''
through experience gained as they move up the corporate ladder, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Freada Klein, a Cambridge, Mass. diversity consultant whose
clients include Fortune 1,000 companies, said Catalyst's report
reinforces her own findings. In particular, she noted that women of
color face the double-barreled problems of race and gender and
often feel ``ostracized by all groups,'' including white women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a comfort level by the senior people with the
junior people for them to be willing to mentor them, invest the
time and resources,'' Klein said. ``If the company is run by
Caucasian men, then it's one big step to let in either men of color
or Caucasian women. It may be perceived as two steps to let in
women of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority women who responded to Catalyst's survey said the
support from their supervisors varied. Asian-American women said
female managers are more receptive to helping them with problems,
while black women said their minority supervisors were more
receptive than white managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth that being a woman of color is a double plus,''
Wellington said. ``In fact, when you analyze the data and look at
the survey, women of color report that it's a double minus.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Even a thousand feet above the valley, from the
peak where Brigham Young mapped out his Mormon empire in 1847, one
of the largest public works projects in the nation dominates the
briny expanse of the Great Basin. Two thousand workers are pouring
concrete around the clock, turning six lanes of Interstate 15 into
12 lanes through Salt Lake City and its loping suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   And no sooner will the $1.6 billion expansion be completed in
two years, state officials say, then they will need a new, parallel
highway to keep traffic moving along the 100 miles of the Wasatch
Mountain front, where most of Utah's 2.1 million people live.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake metropolitan area is growing by 1,000 acres a
month, much of it to the alarm of Utah's political and business
leaders. But almost by default, in a blitz of highway construction,
the state's leaders are encouraging the very thing they say they do
not want: the instant towns of one-acre housing lots and no
sidewalks, the car-dependent office parks and big box stores in a
sea of pavement, the brown air that obscures the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand miles away, in Milwaukee, a city that
expanded along the lines of its highways a generation ago,
sledge-hammers of regret will soon begin swinging. The city plans
to use more than $20 million in federal transportation money to
tear down a half-built section of highway that was supposed to cut
right through old Milwaukee. It will be the nation's largest
highway deconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urban superhighway should be relegated to the scrap heap
of history,'' said John O. Norquist, Milwaukee's three-term mayor,
who toured the country recently to make his case that cities should
be removing highways, not building new ones. There is no greater
form of subsidized social engineering than the interstate highway,
Norquist says, which hastens flight out of the city without doing
much to ease traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City and Milwaukee, two cities with roughly equal
metropolitan populations (about 1.5 million), each having declared
war on sprawl, are examples of how federal transportation subsidies
are still one of the biggest forces shaping urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Highways can reshape communities in dramatic fashion, often with
little public input. These two urban areas are using federal
highway money to go in opposite directions, Salt Lake to speed
people into and out of the city, Milwaukee to restore a
neighborhood and revive city life.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is offering cities and states $162
billion over the next five years for building, maintaining and
expanding roads. The money is from the largest public works bill
ever made law, last year's $217 billion transportation bill.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake, for example, new subdivisions are already rising
in the open spaces through which Gov. Michael Leavitt has proposed
the Legacy Highway to parallel I-15.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, a neighborhood of new housing, restaurants, shops
and a theme park is taking shape in what will no longer be the path
of the Park East Freeway, the one to be demolished. In this case,
the market is following the highway's elimination.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Salt Lake is still like a big small town. But it is
on its way to becoming a Phoenix of the Wasatch range, bordered by
new suburbs whose only connection to one another are the highways.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here seem to want this. Leavitt, a two-term
Republican, has proclaimed that the Beehive State ``will no longer
subsidize urban sprawl'' _ at least as a deliberate strategy. But
indirectly, Utah seems to be doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   New highway projects, combined with local zoning that virtually
mandates big lots and big houses, are adding more helium to the
balloon of Greater Salt Lake. The metropolitan area is projected to
double in size, to more than 800 square miles, by 2020, while the
population grows 50 percent. Some people whose lives are in the
path of urbanization are bitter at the government's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 acres of prime dairy land, and there is nothing my
family would like better than keep milking cows on this land,''
said Carolynn Gibson, whose family operates a dairy farm, which
began as a homestead, about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures to sell out are enormous. Hardly a week goes
by when the family is not offered a windfall to sell its acreage to
a developer.
</P>
<P>
   What has made grazing land look appealing to house builders,
driving up property values around the Gibson farm, is Leavitt's
proposed Legacy Highway, which ultimately would run more than 100
miles, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers oppose the highway because it could wipe out up to half
of the region's 43 remaining dairy farms. Two federal agencies also
oppose it, saying the highway would cut through what biologists
consider some of the most important inland bird breeding grounds in
the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could make a ton of money and just quit the sweat,'' Mrs.
Gibson said. ``But there's something about the sense of it. It
makes no sense to keep putting pavement over farmland.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leavitt looks at a map of the narrow Wasatch Front _
mountains on one side, a salty lake or marsh on the other _ and
asks, ``Where are we going to put all these new people?''
</P>
<P>
   Utah has the nation's highest birth rate, averaging 20 births
per 1,000 people in the 1990s, more than double the average. The
state is projected to add a million people in the next 20 years,
more than 70 percent from births, and 2 million more by 2050. Dairy
farms could be a luxury, the governor says.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Utah's growth say there is a contradiction: While the
governor says he wants growth to be guided by the free market, his
$10 billion in highway construction plans are a giant government
push for growth up and down the Wasatch range.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done over the last 50 years with the federal
highway system is subsidize the worst kind of sprawl,'' said Robert
Adler, a professor of law at the University of Utah. ``In building
these roads, you skew people's choices.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among mayors, traffic engineers and other people who are
passionate about urban design's influence on people, there is a
vigorous debate over whether building new highways causes people to
drive more, adding to congestion rather than reducing it.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments boil down to this: When a new road is built,
people take trips that they might otherwise not have taken. New
homes, businesses and stores brought on by the highway will appear,
and the road will soon be clogged.
</P>
<P>
   But if the crowded highway is removed, or not widened, people
will find other ways to get around, taking public transit, side
roads, walking or biking _ anything to save time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all this experience over the last 20 years, from Los
Angeles to Atlanta to Phoenix, that shows that building and
widening freeways do not solve our traffic problems,'' said Keith
Bartholomew, a professor at the Wallace Stegner Center for Land,
Resources and the Environment at the University of Utah, ``and yet
here we are in Utah saying somehow this time it has to work.''
</P>
<P>
   If the new highway will not reduce traffic, why build it?
Leavitt says he has no choice: The millions of new people in Utah
will have to get around somehow, and the overwhelming majority of
people _ as much as 97 percent, according to some surveys _ will
not use mass transit. Americans prefer their cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, Norquist has spent more than a decade trying to
keep the federal government from influencing the place known as
``Brew City USA.'' Unlike most Democrats, the mayor opposes federal
money for housing, highways, education and welfare. The money is
virtually free, so cities take it. But they do so at their peril,
he argues in his book, ``The Wealth of Cities,'' published last
year by Addison-Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this sprawl was subsidized,'' said Norquist. ``Sprawl is
the direct result of accommodating the automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Other urban experts say suburban development is the price for
creating the world's first mass middle class. The highway follows
public sentiment, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying people can go out and have a quarter-acre,
half-acre, an acre, build their own house, maybe put a little
swimming pool in it, all the things they want, and we call it bad,
nasty sprawl,'' Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute has written. ``Why don't we call it great?''
</P>
<P>
   Norquist says he is not against all highways, just those that
slice up cities. Nor is he against the suburbs, where nearly half
of all Americans now live. But as a big city mayor, trying to
enliven parts of central Milwaukee that once pulsed with commerce
and housing, Norquist has a natural bias.
</P>
<P>
   One of the final links of the long-term highway plan for
Milwaukee called for the Park East Freeway to cut across the
northern edge of downtown, across the Milwaukee River to Lake
Michigan. While the part that was built is still in use,
neighborhood opposition killed construction of the second half, and
now the mayor has obtained money to tear down the part that was
built.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor views what has happened since the highway was halted
as a sort of laboratory for his theory that cities will develop
naturally without federal highway subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   At the point where the highway was brought to a standstill, a
cluster of new housing has arisen, in a neighborhood that includes
John Ernst Cafe, Milwaukee's oldest German restaurant. Children
ride bikes with cards pinned to the wheels for motorized effect,
the elderly play chess in a new pocket park and people carry
groceries home from a supermarket at the center of East Pointe
Commons housing development.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood is not for everybody, says Norquist, but by
stopping the highway, the city has allowed people to make a choice.
There is no subsidy either way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be Main Street, USA,'' Norquist said. ``It's now
a code violation all over America.''

   WASHINGTON _ Acknowledging the worsening trade tensions with
Europe over genetically engineered foods, the Clinton
administration said Tuesday for the first time that it would
conduct long-term studies on the safety of altered farm products.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech Tuesday, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
insisted that the Administration would use all its legal remedies
to compel Europe to accept American farm products like soybeans and
corn, even if that meant placing tariffs on European-made goods
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman also said the administration was considering asking the
food industry to do voluntary information labeling, a practice
strongly opposed by the biotech industry but one that has been
demanded by the Europeans and some American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's speech came as American farmers complained of
declining prices and as Europe refused to accept any new
genetically altered products. But Glickman also warned companies
that were leading the technological advances in genetic
modification of crops that they must accept responsibility for
environmentally safe products and disclosure of any problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has approved 50 varieties of crops
that have been engineered to be resistant to insects, herbicides or
plant viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While Glickman stressed that most studies had indicated that
there were no known health risks to consumers, he said no long-term
studies had been conducted _ one of the central arguments made by
Europeans. In the past few years members of the European Union have
refused to import many products that contain genetically modified
ingredients. But the United States has won a major case with the
World Trade Organization to force Europe to accept its hormone-fed
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and consumer groups that have sued the government
over labeling and the lack of safety testing said they were pleased
that the administration had taken the first conciliatory steps
toward consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has realized it can't bully its way out of this
problem,'' said Rebecca Goldberg, a senior scientist with the
Environmental Defense Fund. ``Just a year ago, I don't think there
was anyone in the Agriculture Department that would have
acknowledged the legitimate issues of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about genetically modified foods in the United States
have only recently begun to coalesce around the finding that the
caterpillars of monarch butterflies were killed by pollen from a
genetically engineered form of corn in a laboratory test. The corn
was modified so that it would be resistant to the corn borer.
Additional preliminary research confirms the findings, although
Glickman said Tuesday that no tests in the field had found the same
results.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, public opposition to genetically altered foods is so
strong that the European Union requires the labeling of all newly
manufactured genetically modified products imported from the United
States. The approval of new genetically modified crops in the
European Union has ground to a halt. No new varieties have been
approved in the last 15 months.

FOR-PROFIT HMOS SKIMPY WITH CARE, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For-profit HMOs are more likely than nonprofit HMOs to skimp on
preventive care to maximize profits, Harvard University researchers
reported in a study.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit plans scored lower on each of 14 measures of medical
quality, including rates of such routine services as mammograms,
immunizations and eye exams for diabetics, according to a study
published in the current issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences are large enough to be significant
clinically,'' said Dr. Stephanie Woolhandler of Cambridge (Mass.)
Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who authored the report along
with Dr. David U. Himmelstein and others.
</P>
<P>
   Woolhandler said that the difference in mammogram rates was such
that, if all US women from 52 to 89 years old were enrolled in
for-profit HMOs, 5,925 more of them would eventually die of breast
cancer than if they belonged to nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers noted that the HMOs in the New England region _
both for-profit and nonprofit _ scored better than plans elsewhere
on virtually all indicators.
</P>
<P>
   The study results come amid the contentious debate in Congress
over proposed new regulation of the managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat from Massachusetts and the
principal architect of the party's patient-protection legislation,
said in a statement: ``This study contains strong new support for
HMO reform. It is clear that profit-oriented HMOs are
short-changing patients for the sake of higher profits. The quality
of care is suffering, and so are patients.''
</P>
<P>
   For-profit HMOs are increasingly dominating the health care
market, through acquisitions of nonprofit plans and conversions of
nonprofit to investor-owned. Between 1985 and 1998 the proportion
of members in investor-owned plans rose from 26 percent to 62
percent, according to the study. In New England, however, they
represent a small minority.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of HMOs had equal per-patient total costs, but the
for-profits spent 48 percent more on administrative overhead and
profit.
</P>
<P>
   A health plan industry group argued that the JAMA study, whose
authors advocate a national health plan, ``confuses ideology and
analysis.'' In fact, the spokeswoman for the American Association
of Health Plans applied an opposite spin to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear conclusion'' of the study ``is that managed care is
improving the quality of health care,'' said Susan Pisano in
Washington. She contended that the all of the HMOs _ non-profit and
for-profit alike _ had rates of preventive services that were
higher than those of fee-for-service (non-managed care) providers
in previous studies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said that the study's reported percentage of
HMOs prescribing beta-blocker drugs following heart attacks _ 59.2
percent for investor-owned and 70.6 percent for nonprofits _ was
still much higher than the 25 percent rate found in a study of
fee-for-service providers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Woolhandler, however, disputed this line of argument. She said
that all the peer-reviewed studies she knew of showed only
nonprofit HMOs providing higher quality of care than
fee-for-service practices. She said that while HMOs of both kinds
provide adequate care for healthy patients (whom they try to
attract), HMOs do ``quite a bit worse'' for chronically sick
patients, and for-profit HMOs are the most deficient.
</P>
<P>
   The study used health care data reported voluntarily by HMOs in
1996 to the National Committee for Quality Assurance in Washington.
The data represented 329 HMOs, 248 of them investor-owned and 81
nonprofit, making up 56 percent of the total US enrollment in HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs were rated on 14 quality-of-care measures that included
rates of completed immunizations for 2- and 13-year-olds;
mammography and Pap smears; prenatal care in the first trimester;
postpartum checkups for women delivering babies; prescription of
beta-blockers for patients discharged from the hospital following a
heart attack; eye exams in the past year for diabetics receiving
insulin; and outpatient followup for patients discharged from
mental hospitals.

 WASHINGTON: 15 months.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States
because the genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the
rest of the crop, costing American farmers about $200 million a
year. Some of the largest exporters, including Archer Daniels
Midland, have said they will no longer accept altered corn for
export and have let farmers know they want conventionally grown
corn.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of major European retailers, including Sainsbury
and Marks &AMP; Spencer from Britain, Migros from Switzerland,
Carrefour from France and Esselunga from Italy, are shopping for
sources of products that have not been genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of these actions on American farmers, who are already
in deep financial trouble, can be devastating. In trying to keep a
dialogue going with America's European trading partners, Glickman
sought to tone down the administration's rhetoric, which has
included calling Europeans ``irrational'' because of their
opposition to genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he had spoken to ``White House people'' before he
made his remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, but one
other administration official said the speech had taken them by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic modification is the insertion of genes from one species
of animal or plant or from microbes into another, permanently
altering its genetic code. It can confer resistance on plants to
certain insects and diseases that would in some cases require the
use of pesticides. Soybeans have been genetically altered so that
they can tolerate applications of an herbicide that kills the weeds
in the same field.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose genetic modification of food do so on two
grounds: The safety of these foods has never been tested and they
are harmful to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not require testing, just
assurances from the company that manufactures the genetically
modified food that it is safe. Glickman acknowledged that none of
the agencies responsible for the safety of genetically modified
foods _ USDA, FDA or Environmental Protection Agency had enough
staff or resources to conduct such testing.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental questions are more problematic. The Environmental
Defense Fund, a public interest lobbying group, filed a petition
with the EPA Tuesday asking it to require farmers to plant
conventional corn around the fields of the genetically modified
corn to prevent the escape of toxic pollens into areas where
butterflies feed.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern that the pesticide resistance engineered
into plants could transfer to weeds and insects, producing
superweeds and superbugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans who do not necessarily oppose genetic engineering
believe that such products should be labeled. In a survey conducted
by the European company Novartis, more than 90 percent called for
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to the
FDA demanding mandatory labeling of such foods. The Center for Food
Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, has filed a lawsuit against the
FDA to reclassify genetic modification as an additive that would
require labeling. When the Agriculture Department proposed organic
food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments
protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, known as a strong supporter of biotechnology, said in
his speech Tuesday that it was important to ``encourage the
development of these new food production systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We cannot blindly embrace their benefits. We
have to ensure public confidence in general, consumer confidence in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier this year at Purdue University, he said,
``We also can't force these new genetically engineered food
products down consumers' throats.''
</P>
<P>
   And he compared biotechnology today to nuclear power 20 years
ago. ``We have a way in this country of latching on to solutions,
pursuing them to the exclusion of others, and then watching them
sometimes backfire,'' he said. ``We did that in the late '70s when
we embraced nuclear power as the primary source of our energy
needs. Then, Three Mile Island happened. Now nuclear power is still
part of our energy grid, but it's not the only part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not put all of our eggs in the biotech basket.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a comparison that the biotech industry considers invidious
but opponents believe is valid.

 &HT;    Key issue in Coca-Cola suit airs Thursday
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The gloves come off Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That's when lawyers for Coca-Cola and the four plaintiffs suing
the company for alleged racial discrimination will argue over a key
part of the case _ whether to eliminate the chance of it ever
becoming a class action.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. District Judge Richard Story eventually grants
class-action status, the plaintiffs could potentially represent
about 1,500 black, salaried Coke employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola has asked the judge to throw out the class-action
discrimination claims now. The company argues there are too many
individual facts and circumstances among existing and prospective
plaintiffs for the case to be handled as one lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, however, vigorously disagree, saying the common
issues about racial discrimination outweigh any individual
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Story has said he will either rule at the hearing Thursday or a
day or two afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's dismissal motion comes early in this legal contest
since the information gathering period, called ``discovery,'' has
just begun. The class-action suit was filed April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the company loses in its dismissal motion now, the
plaintiffs must still convince the judge at a later date that the
suit should be granted class-action status. That will not be an
easy hurdle for the plaintiffs to overcome, but it would occur
after months of information gathering that has not yet taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The company just recently handed over about 15,000 documents
plus a computerized employment database to the plaintiffs, who must
analyze the information before trying to gain class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   But if the class-action claims in the lawsuit are thrown out
this week, the case would be confined to just the four plaintiffs.
They allege a companywide practice of discrimination against
African-American employees in pay, promotions and performance
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order
forbidding further alleged discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   To buttress their arguments, each side has submitted two legal
briefs to the judge. Essentially, the company argues that ``every
named plaintiff and every prospective class member has different
claims and different facts.'' As a result, the
information-gathering process will only reinforce the need for a
series of mini-trials for each prospective class member.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole point of a class-action suit is to avoid 1,500
mini-trials and consolidate the issues in one trial. Since that
will be impossible, the company argues, the class-action claims
should be dismissed. The four plaintiffs could still proceed with
their individual cases against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company also argues that despite the ``broad brush strokes
and general references to discriminatory practices, the named
plaintiffs' and prospective class members' claims have no
commonality, other than the race of their proponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the company wrong about the law, but even if the
company's position had any arguable merit, this case is in far too
preliminary a stage for the court to take any action ... without
committing clear reversible error,'' the plaintiffs argued.
</P>
<P>
   They go on to say that dismissing the class-action claims would
be both premature and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, without knowing the facts of the case and the universe
of the issues that plaintiffs will ultimately seek to try in a
class action, the court cannot make a reasoned determination,''
they argued.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they said, if the court were to dismiss claims
before any factual record was developed through the discovery
process, and that decision was reversed on appeal, then the case
would likely have to be retried.
</P>
<P>
   But if the court makes a decision on the class-action matter
after the information gathering process is completed, then an
appeal ``is far less likely to result in reversal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also disagree about whether the plaintiffs in a
class-action suit can simultaneously ask for substantial monetary
damages and for a court order requiring Coca-Cola to change its
employment practices.
</P>
<P>
   The company argues that in a class-action case the plaintiffs
can't seek both remedies at the same time. As a result, the company
said the judge should also dismiss the class-action portion of the
suit on that ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs say they can seek both remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The four plaintiffs in the case are administrative assistant
Motisola Malikha Abdallah, security officer Gregory Allen Clark,
information specialist Linda Ingram and former director Kimberly
Gray Orton.

VIOLENCE WORSENS IN IRAN AS ARMED MOBS MOVE TO QUELL
DEMONSTRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In scenes eerily reminiscent of Iran's revolution
two decades ago, the police fired tear gas Tuesday at thousands of
demonstrators and passers-by and fired pistols and submachine guns
in the air as street battles raged through huge swaths of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos and violence closed hundreds of stores, banks, gas
stations, shopping centers and office buildings and finally,
extraordinarily, even the vast bazaar in the south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The clogged streets smelled of fear and confusion as the worst
unrest in the Islamic republic's history was countered by tens of
thousands of uniformed and plainclothes security police, soldiers,
anti-riot forces in shields and face-covering helmets,
Revolutionary Guards, intelligence operatives, vigilantes wielding
long green batons and ordinary street thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The armed mobs fanned out from the area around Tehran University
north and south for miles. Security forces lobbed tear gas into
crowds of ordinary people and crowds in turn set fires in the
middle of intersections. Some soldiers and military volunteers
brandished automatic weapons and gunfire cracked across the capital
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, abruptly shifted
his tone Tuesday night after days of protests and a meeting with
the religious leadership and condemned the nationwide
demonstrations, which have left at least two people dead and
countless others injured or behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials made it clear that no further protests
would be tolerated. With a vast pro-government demonstration
planned for Wednesday, Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani announced
that the anti-government protests were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Wednesday on,'' he said, `` security will be provided _
at all costs.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to determine whether the violence in Tehran
mirrored the situation around the country. After reporting
widespread protests in 18 cities on Monday, the official press
suddenly fell silent Tuesday on the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the protest _ and the government crackdown _
reminded older Tehran residents of the year leading up to the
revolution in February 1979. Even one of Tuesday's slogans was
borrowed from then: ``Army brothers, why kill your brothers?''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1978 and '79 there was a clear, single goal, articulated
over and over: the overthrow of the Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and
the installation of an Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were two sides: the monarchy's supporters and the
monarchy's opponents. Now there are no clear sides. What makes this
political atmosphere particularly fluid is that no one seems to
know who on the street is in charge, who wants what and who is in
whose camp.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest erupted on July 8 after students protested the
passage of a law curbing press freedom and the closing of a popular
left-leaning newspaper. Security forces stormed a dormitory at
Tehran University that evening, beating students and pushing them
out windows.
</P>
<P>
   The students want faster progress toward democracy and cultural
freedoms promised by Khatami, which have been blocked by
conservative forces backing the religious leader and ultimate power
in Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But the students are not calling
for a change in the Islamic system of government.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most conservative backers of the revolution Tuesday
became protesters against unnamed ``traitors.'' Protesters claiming
to be pro-democracy university students demonstrated in front of
Tehran University and tried to storm the iron gates of the Interior
Ministry even as student groups proclaimed that they were complying
with the ban against demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people with no apparent grievances silently moved in
and out of the fringes of the demonstrations. Students claimed that
their movement had been infiltrated _ by royalists, by vigilantes,
by opponents of the government, by other unnamed enemies.
</P>
<P>
   After urging restraint and respect for the law on Monday,
Khatami read a statement Tuesday night on state-controlled
television saying that what had started out as a peaceful protest
had degenerated into riots led by people with ``devilish aims.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests, he added, were threatening national security and
were ``intended to attack the foundations of the system and lead
the country into anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also pledged to stop the protesters. ``We shall
stand in their way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement underscored the limits of Khatami's authority in a
system that gives much more power to Ayatollah Khamenei, whose
title is Leader of the Islamic Revolution, than to the popularly
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   The ayatollah is committed to keeping the Islamic republic
united behind its revolutionary ideals and free of what he
considers corrupting Western influences.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, by contrast, has based his administration on tolerance
and the rule of law, stating repeatedly since he was elected in a
landslide nearly two years ago that a divergence of views is
crucial to a healthy society. But his statement Tuesday night said
nothing critical of the vigilantes who were attacking demonstrators
in the name of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's clear statement of disapproval for the demonstrations
is likely to disappoint many ordinary Iranians, from housemaids to
retirees, who saw both the demonstrations and even the crackdown as
the beginning of a process of change, even a change in the regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iranian people are not necessarily logical,'' said one
engineer. ``They are very emotional. They want an end to everything
that they think has been a source of misery for them. It doesn't
matter to them at what cost, or whether it's going to be followed
by something much worse''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets Tuesday, that emotional side was on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray that we get rid of the savages who beat our children,''
said one middle-aged woman as she watched baton-wielding men on
motorcycles chase pro-democracy demonstrators on a street corner in
central Tehran. ``Savages, hooligans, that's what they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she had seen a dozen vigilantes beat two women
with clubs outside the university late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Another bystander said he had seen vigilantes attack a small
group of young men who were chanting, ``Khatami, we support you!''
The demonstrators were badly beaten with long batons, the bystander
said, and another man who was walking by was beaten as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get rid of the filthy regime,'' the man said.
``Anything would be better than these clerics, even the worst
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The level of criticism of the government underscores a deep
frustration. Iran suffers from an economy in crisis, high inflation
and unemployment, low investor confidence and the absence of
personal security and many freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of the people are under 25, and they know
little of the revolution and the sacrifices of Iran's eight-year
war with Iraq. But many of them do know the Internet and can watch
American television beamed in by satellite. They want jobs and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are miserable! The clerics are acting like gods!'' was
one of the slogans of the day.

TEHRAN, Iran: the day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In subduing the demonstrators Tuesday, the security forces
seemed determined _ at least for now _ to avoid the mistakes of the
shah after crowds took to the streets in 1978 to oppose his rule.
The shah's vast modern army and security apparatus were not trained
in riot control, and eventually opened fire on the crowds. The
killings sparked a cycle of mourning for the ``martyrs of the
revolution'' that provoked even bigger demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   When thousands of people refused Tuesday night to leave Enghelab
Square, one of Tehran's largest intersections, hundreds of
baton-wielding vigilantes, many of them riding in two's on
motorcycles, swooped down, witnesses said. The vigilantes
indiscriminately arrested, threatened and beat people in the crowd,
following them as they ran through the streets in search of refuge,
the witnesses added.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed security officials stood by and watched, blocking off
large areas so that the vigilantes could roam freely. By allowing
their surrogates to break up the demonstrations, the security
forces seemed to be trying to distance themselves _ and the
government _ from the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the largest thoroughfares were turned into street
theater for tens of thousands of onlookers who climbed on rooftops,
hung out of balconies and windows and took up strategic positions
on street corners to watch the drama unfold. Bus service was
stopped and taxis were barred for much of the day in central
Tehran, forcing thousands of commuters to walk and exposing them to
tear gas and vigilante attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The state television and radio broadcast an announcement Tuesday
from the Islamic Propagation Organization, the country's biggest
propaganda machine, calling on the people to take to the streets on
Wednesday in a counterdemonstration to ``defend the country's
national security'' and condemn ``those people who want to drag the
country into anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television repeatedly broadcast a speech delivered on
Monday by Ayatollah Khamenei in which he blamed the demonstrations
on unnamed ``enemies,'' particularly the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government, which can send hundreds of thousands of people
into the streets when it chooses, is expected to mobilize masses of
diehard Islamic revolutionaries on Wednesday to proclaim their
allegiance to the Islamic republic and condemn its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the official tide has moved against the
students, the tone of the official news agency shifted dramatically
Tuesday. The agency had been offering detailed reports of the
nationwide demonstrations and the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the agency was clearly back in control of the
conservatives. The reports were sketchy; no longer were the
demonstrators ``university students,'' but are now being described
as ``rioters who are believed to be backed by terrorist groups.''

 &HT;    Foundation offers millions for new hall, wants Shaw's name on it
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta and Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation will give as
much as $15 million for a new Atlanta Symphony Orchestra hall on
the site of the old First Baptist Church in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   The Blank family is also leading a challenge campaign to name
the building after legendary ASO conductor Robert Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, part of the gift will honor ASO music director
Yoel Levi, whose contract is not being renewed beyond next season,
a move that has caused controversy among his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now believe the impossible can be done. I believe we will
get a new symphony hall,'' said A.D. Frazier, chairman of the
symphony board and president and CEO of Invesco Inc. ``This is
truly a giant step towards a new symphony hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blank gift, announced Tuesday, is the first major
contribution pledged for a proposed $113 million symphony hall. The
ASO needs at least $45 million in pledges by Aug. 10 in order to
proceed with the project. Atlanta's corporate community and arts
supporters will be asked to come up with the rest of the initial
funding over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   The hall would be part of BellSouth Corp.'s new office
development at the corner of Peachtree and Fifth streets. BellSouth
has given the ASO until Aug. 10 to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought this was a unique chance in the life of the
symphony,'' said Arthur M. Blank, president, CEO and co-founder of
Home Depot. He is making the gift along with his wife, Stephanie,
and his son, Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   The Blank Family Foundation actually is making two gifts _ $10
million outright and another $5 million challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million gift will include naming the hall's grand lobby
after the Blank family. In the lobby, the Blanks also would like to
honor Arthur Blank's mother, Molly Blank, now a Los Angeles
resident who introduced her son to classical music when he was a
teenager.
</P>
<P>
   The man who would help build a home supply giant recalls that he
and his mother would take a bus, then the subway and then another
bus, to go to Carnegie Hall in New York City on Saturday mornings
to attend Leonard Bernstein concerts. Blank also wants to find a
way to honor Yoel Levi in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The Blank family has proposed naming the hall after the late
Robert Shaw, the ASO's music director for 21 years, and would award
the additional $5 million challenge grant if three other $5 million
donations can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of momentum here,'' said ASO President Allison
Vulgamore, who has been meeting with the Blanks for months. ``This
is a gift of $15 million that could become $30 million. We need a
team to join the Blanks to complete the naming of the concert hall
after Robert Shaw.''
</P>
<P>
   At his death in January, at 82, Shaw was universally
acknowledged as the world's greatest choral music figure. As music
director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus from
1967-1988, he elevated the ASO into a professional ensemble of
international fame. Under his direction, the ASO toured the world
and performed at the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter in
1977. He won a total of 17 Grammys and was awarded the Kennedy
Center Honors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaw family's response was euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's lovely,'' said Alex Hitz, Shaw's stepson, answering
the phone at the Shaw home in Atlanta. ``We as a family are
absolutely thrilled by this great honor and very grateful that
Robert is being remembered in such a lasting way.'' He said that he
had been trying to reach his younger brother, Thomas Shaw, who was
traveling in Spain, to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   Hitz said he was optimistic that the challenge money could be
raised. ``I think the money will come,'' he said. ``I'm going to
try to help them raise it.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicworld observers said it was appropriate that the honor go
to Shaw. ``He had such a huge impact on the city, on that orchestra
and on the music of America and the world,'' said New York
Philharmonic artistic administrator Welz Kauffman, who held that
position at the ASO from 1992-94. ``It's absolutely the right thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blank gift also sends a message of healing to Atlanta's
music lovers who have been divided over the imminent departure of
Levi. One of Levi's backers is Bernard Marcus, who co-founded the
Home Depot with Blank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a signal from our family that the community
needs to move past the personalities in this and move towards the
love of music,'' Blank said. ``It has been a very painful
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoel Levi declined comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stunning is what it is,'' said horn player Bruce Kenney,
president of the ASO Players Association. ``I think we are seeing
that a new chapter in the history of the Atlanta Symphony is being
written.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ASO leadership was celebrating the Blank gift
Tuesday, it still faces the difficult task of raising at least $30
million more by Aug. 10 in order to use the First Baptist Church
site. Blank said he'll help recruit other donors. ``There are a lot
of people in Atlanta, some I'm closer to than others, who have the
capacity to contribute,'' Blank said. ``It is our hope and our
prayer that this will get folks to support the arts at a much
higher level in Atlanta.

BUSH ASKED TO EXPLAIN RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE IN DEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The racist clause is legally meaningless, but
George W. Bush found himself explaining Tuesday why he sold his
Dallas home five years ago with a deed provision restricting
ownership to whites.
</P>
<P>
   The racially restrictive covenant was part of the paperwork when
the just-elected Texas governor sold his North Dallas home in 1995
to move into the Governor's Mansion in Austin. The deed restriction
declared the property could be occupied ``by white persons only,''
with an exception for ``servants of any race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Bush was not aware of the
covenant, which had covered the property since 1939. The
restriction was legally meaningless because the Supreme Court
outlawed racially exclusive covenants in 1948. Texas banned them in
1984, four years before Bush bought the Dallas home.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal repudiation of segregation did not erase the
offensive language from existing deeds. Racial restrictions were
once commonplace in communities throughout the country. Some
neighborhoods used similar provisions to exclude Jewish homeowners.
Deeds in California often prohibited sales to Chinese residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deed is a matter of record. There would be no way to
erase the record,'' said Dallas housing lawyer Norman ``Happy''
Nelson. ``If it was there when he got the property, there was no
way he could do anything about it. It's a non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, racially restrictive covenants, ghosts of the nation's
segregationist past, have a way of haunting politicians. In a new
twist, Bush's old deed came to light via the Internet. Cyber snoop
Matt Drudge, probably best known for his role in publicizing the
White House sex scandal, trumpeted his news tidbit as an
``exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't news to Alphonso Jackson, an African-American who
lives in Bush's old Dallas neighborhood. Jackson, former president
of the Dallas Housing Authority, said his home in the upscale area
also came with a deed restricting ownership to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I laughed about it. We thought it was funny. We
still think it's funny,'' Jackson said. ``I'm just glad I moved in
before the houses got so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Bush and his wife, Laura, welcomed him to the
Preston Hollow neighborhood with a party when he bought his house
in 1990. He said the governor has ``no racist bone'' in his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is the fairest human being _ with everyone _ that I've
ever come across,'' Jackson said. ``Laura and the governor are
first rate. They respect and love people of all races and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the latest in the long line of public officials who have
had to explain racially restrictive covenants.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist came under fire from
Democrats at his 1986 confirmation hearings for the top court post
because of deed restrictions on his home in Phoenix, Ariz., and at
a summer home in Vermont. The Vermont deed prohibited sale or lease
of the property to ``any member of the Hebrew race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., attacked Republican Michael
Huffington in their 1994 Senate race for restrictive covenants on
his previous homes in Texas. Huffington retaliated two days later
by revealing similar restrictions on the deed to Feinstein's
turn-of-the-century San Francisco home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's there, it's there,'' said Nelson, the housing lawyer.
``Nobody can take it out.''

VATICAN ORDERS PRIEST AND NUN TO END MINISTRY TO GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vatican on Tuesday ordered an American priest and a nun to
end a ministry to gay men and lesbians, saying that the pair's work
since the 1970s had strayed from church teaching that homosexual
activity is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   The action was unusual in its severity and in that it fell on
people who lack the academic stature of some theologians who have
run afoul of the Vatican in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,
the body charged with safeguarding church teaching, declared that
the Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick had allowed
``ambiguities and errors'' to color their public discussions about
church teaching on homosexuality and had sown confusion among Roman
Catholic lay people.
</P>
<P>
   Although it stopped short of citing detailed examples, the
congregation said Nugent and Sister Gramick had not sufficiently
emphasized the teaching that homosexual acts are ``intrinsically
disordered'' and ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, officially called a ``notification,'' comes after
a lengthy investigation, lasting well over a decade, by American
Catholic authorities and by the Vatican, into Sister Gramick's and
Nugent's work, which they began in the 1970s, putting them in the
forefront of church figures who reached out to gay and lesbian
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The decision's severity came as a surprise to some.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick and Nugent are permanently prohibited from
conducting the workshops, discussions and retreats (some with the
parents of gay Catholics) that have been the focus of their
ministry for two decades. In addition, they are forbidden
indefinitely from holding office within the religious orders to
which they belong.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, some prominent theologians whose writings the
Vatican has judged unacceptable have been ordered silenced for a
specific period. The Brazilian Leonardo Boff, an exponent of
liberation theology, a controversial system of thought that argues
that the church side with the poor and oppressed, was ordered to
cease his writing for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after he arrived in the United States from Rome
on Tuesday, Nugent said he was surprised by the decision. ``It
puzzles me, because I have never questioned any dogma of the
church,'' he said. He added that he and Sister Gramick had
occasionally come under criticism from gay and lesbian groups ``for
being defenders of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent said he would accept the decision. ``There are all
kind of ministries,'' he said, ``and I need time to discern what
kind of pastoral work I'd like to do, now that I'm shifting away
from this type of ministry. I just hope the work I've been involved
in bears fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy within the church has dogged the two since 1977 when
they founded New Ways Ministry in Mount Rainier, Md., to reach out
to gay and lesbian Catholics. Situated within the boundaries of the
Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., the organization came under
criticism from Cardinal James Hickey, Washington's archbishop,
prompting Sister Gramick and Nugent to resign in 1984. But they
continued to hold workshops and retreats on homosexuality and the
church.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Vatican said it had ``received numerous
complaints and urgent requests for clarification'' from American
bishops and others about what Nugent and Sister Gramick were saying
even after they left New Ways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Vatican created a commission under Cardinal Adam
Maida, archbishop of Detroit, to determine whether Nugent and
Sister Gramick had moved outside church teachings on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   After the two published a book on their work, the commission met
with them in 1994, then forwarded its findings to the Vatican,
which continued the investigation through correspondence with
Nugent and Sister Gramick.
</P>
<P>
   These exchanges continued from February 1996 through January
1999, the Vatican's statement said, but they did not dispel church
authorities' concern that Nugent's and Sister Gramick's views were
``doctrinally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Catechism describes homosexual acts as
``intrinsically disordered'' and contrary to natural law because
they do not lead to procreation. But it also states that gays
should be treated with ``respect, compassion and sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Vatican said Nugent and Sister Gramick were
presenting only half the message. And in so doing, it said, they
did not allow people ``struggling with homosexuality'' to hear
``the true teaching of the church from those who minister to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the decision ran from supportive to critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised at how severely they came down,'' said Sister
Rosemary Howarth, superior at the School Sisters of Notre Dame,
Sister Gramick's order. ``Yes, we are saddened and disappointed at
how hard it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bruce Williams, a Dominican priest and moral theologian
who had been an adviser to Sister Gramick and Nugent when they
appeared before Maida's commission, said the two ``went to heroic
lengths to cooperate very thoroughly with Vatican authorities.'' He
called the decision dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop William Lori, auxiliary bishop of Washington, said
that Cardinal Hickey considered the decision ``doctrinally and
pastorally correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far back as 1981, Cardinal Hickey observed that the
approach of Sister Jeannine and Father Nugent to the question of
the immorality of homosexual activity was very ambiguous,'' Lori
said. ``The phrase he always used was `studied ambiguity,' such
that the authentic teaching of the church was undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, errors with regard to the faith come from a certain
selectivity, and I think this is a classic instance of selecting
some of the teaching and distorting the other part,'' Lori said.
</P>
<P>
   In separate statements, Maida and Bishop Joseph Fiorenza,
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said they
hoped Sister Gramick and Nugent would accept the Vatican's
decision. Fiorenza also quoted from a 1986 Vatican statement
endorsing the ``pastoral care'' of gays and lesbians and said such
work should continue within church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry,
called the Vatican's decision misguided and unjust. Speaking of
Nugent and Sister Gramick, he said, ``They have consistently
presented the compassionate face of the church to gay and lesbian
people, and they have done so faithfully to church teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Although DeBernardo said the decision would be ``particularly
hurtful'' to gay and lesbian Catholics, he said the discussion
about homosexuality and the church would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America,
offered a view different from some others, saying the decision, in
coming after so many years, showed a careful deliberation, yet
appeared to lack important details. ``On the positive side, it's
clear that the Vatican took a long time before it made its
decision,'' he said. ``On the negative side, there's very little
specificity in the report from the Vatican about what they were
doing that was contrary to church teaching.''

N.H. ECONOMY GAINS $175M EXTRA IN PRIMARY YEAR, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation presidential
primary is worth about $175 million to the state's economy in the
year leading up to and immediately following the event, according
to an interim report released Tuesday by the Library and Archives
of New Hampshire's Political Tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimates that over a four-year election cycle, the
primary is worth $210 million to the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of what the primary brings in have ranged over the
years from $30 million to $238 million. New Hampshire Secretary of
State William M. Gardner said this study marks the first time an
attempt has been made to truly quantify the dollar value.
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned by the Library and Archives, the
state's political library, and conducted by economists from New
Hampshire's Business and Industry Association, professors from the
University of New Hampshire and Salem State College, and a media
research firm. They analyzed spending from the 1996 primary _
including travel tourism, tax data and Federal Election Commission
filings _ conducted polls and estimated the value of media
coverage. The full report is due out after the 2000 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Total direct, indirect and induced spending during the peak
season of the 1996 primary was calculated at just under $150
million. Researchers estimated the state gained an additional $25
million from media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   And primary season never seems to end here: The researchers
estimated an additional $30 million was spent on primary-related
visits between the end of the 1992 primary and March of 1995. And
prior to March of 1995, the report says, the state gained an
additional $5 million from media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big numbers in terms of dollars,'' said Brian Gottlob of
the New Hampshire Business and Industry Association, ``But in the
context of an over 30 billion dollar economy, it's relatively
small. It's not driving economic events. It has a role, it
certainly has an impact, but it's not something that changes the
fortunes of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, campaign staff and media who descended on the
state to cover the last primary spent $55 million between March
1995 and February 1996. Of that, $24 million was spent on hotels,
restaurants and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that the $55 million in direct spending
resulted in another $24 million in indirect expenditures by
businesses with the money they received from direct spending; and
another $70 million of induced spending _ purchases made by
households that received income from the direct and indirect sales.
</P>
<P>
   That spending, researchers said, results in over 1,500 full-time
jobs, almost half of which come in the lodging and restaurant
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The economic gain from media coverage is harder to quantify.
Based on a series of suppositions, researchers estimated the state
gained $25 million as a result of media coverage in the six months
leading up to the primary. They said $5 million of that was from
tourists visiting New Hampshire after reading about the state in
the press.
</P>
<P>
   The other $20 million, they estimated, came in value to the
state as a result of new businesses being created or moving here.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of that can be attributed directly to stories about the
primary, but the primary is the single-biggest occasion for New
Hampshire being mentioned in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Media research indicated that nearly 20,000 stories about the
primary appeared in the print and broadcast media in six months in
1996. Of those stories, 11 percent showed New Hampshire in a
favorable light and 85 percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlob said New Hampshire has the opportunity to increase the
percentage of favorability.
</P>
<P>
   Ask reporters, said Gottlob, if they realize New Hampshire has
``the highest percentage of high-tech workers of any state in the
nation. I guarantee they will not know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also attempted to quantify the political and social
benefits of the primary. In a survey of 500 New Hampshire
households in February, 18 percent of respondents said they had met
or shaken hands with a presidential candidate, 27 percent had
attended a campaign event, 43 percent said they volunteered on a
campaign and 70 percent said they voted in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that New Hampshire is always first and always
right?'' asked former New Hampshire Governor Hugh Gregg, chairman
of the Library and Archives. ``Twenty percent of people in New
Hampshire have shaken hands with a candidate. I think that's our
answer.''

SMITH BREAKS WITH GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As dawn broke Tuesday on his last morning in the
Republican Party, Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire followed the
script of his celluloid hero, Jimmy Stewart, in ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene before he became the first Republican senator
in nearly a half-century to walk away from his party, Bob Smith
strode through the mist to the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials.
</P>
<P>
   The former schoolteacher moved on to the Vietnam memorial and
his parents' graves in Arlington National Cemetery, as he
contemplated his pending act of defiance _ a move that even his
supporters portrayed as political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the footsteps of his movie hero, Smith ventured to the
Senate desk once occupied by Daniel Webster and declared he was
turning his back on the Republican Party because he believes the
party has turned its back on its conservative principles in the
name of political expedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a party in the sense of wearing hats and blowing
whistles, but it's not a party that means anything,'' Smith said in
a dramatic 55-minute speech.
</P>
<P>
   It was an extraordinary moment in the annals of New Hampshire
politics: a powerful GOP incumbent kicking aside the party
machinery that helped elevate him from small-town obscurity to the
alabaster halls of Congress, and choosing to seek the presidency as
a newly minted independent.
</P>
<P>
   In that instant, the prospect of Smith's political saga ending
as triumphantly as Stewart's on the silver screen appeared to fade
to black, or bleak at best.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 58, said in a news conference that he is strongly
considering seeking the nomination of the tiny US Taxpayer Party,
which has no significant history as a vehicle for a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving open a possible bid for the Reform Party nomination,
Smith said he also hopes to pay a courtesy visit this weekend to
Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who is vying for control of the
party with its founder, Ross Perot. The party's annual convention
is scheduled for July 23 to 25 in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose plan to bolt the GOP leaked last week to the news
media, acknowledged in his Senate speech that many of his friends
and colleagues ``have said that what I am doing is foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the Republican Party could cost Smith his Senate seat
should he seek reelection in 2002. He also could be stripped of his
Senate seniority and chairmanship of the ethics committee, although
the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said there is no timetable
for Smith's 54 Republican colleagues to resolve those matters.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the historical odds of Smith winning the presidency on
a small, third-party ticket are extremely remote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he is prepared to face the consequences. In an
address peppered with blistering criticism of the ``Republican
establishment,'' he credited a long cast of individuals _ from Mark
Twain to Patrick Henry to Jimmy Stewart's film character _ with
inspiring his risky endeavor and buoying him for the lonely journey
he faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember them for what they were and what they said, not
for the party they were,'' Smith said of several American heroes.
``It inspired me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he tried his best to stop Smith from turning
independent. Smith became the first GOP senator to repudiate his
party registration since Wayne Morse of Oregon turned indpendent in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he is doing this out of conviction, but I am
disappointed,'' Lott said after Smith's speech. ``I don't think
it's necessary to do this, but he's made up his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of other Republican senators expressed disdain for
Smith's move, which they considered a bad precedent even if it does
not shift the balance of power in the Senate. As one of the most
conservative senators, Smith made clear that Democrats can expect
no support from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate and regrettable that he has chosen this
path,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican. ``We all
have disagreements with our party, but we don't walk away because
of them. Certainly, it would be a lot more constructive to work
within the party.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 20 senators in the Senate chamber, including Lott and
his leadership team, Smith renewed attacks he had leveled earlier
against GOP leaders in Washington and New Hampshire. The party
leaders had harshly criticized his defection.
</P>
<P>
   Depicting the party establishment as hostages of pollsters and
consultants who consider winning elections more important than
defending the party's principles, Smith said, ``We need to get out
the fumigation equipment. We need to clean out the pollsters and
consultants and the spin doctors and the bloated staffs who tell us
what to say, how to say it, when to say it, and how long to say it.
The American people elected us. Isn't it time we started thinking
for ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a lifelong Republican who said President Reagan inspired
him to pursue a political career, expressed lingering resentment at
GOP leaders who asked him to withdraw from a race for a New
Hampshire House seat in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refused to pull out and won the primary, though he lost
the general election. Two years later, he won the House seat, an
unpolished newcomer who quickly drew comparisons to Stewart's movie
character.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has served in Congress ever since, though he said he has
yet to decide whether he will seek reelection in 2002, without the
benefit of Republican Party support.
</P>
<P>
   More pressing, he said, is his presidential campaign. Though the
campaign is flagging badly, Smith clings to his trademark tenacity.
``Sure, right now, if you want to look at the polls, it doesn't
look all that great,'' he said. ``But things change.''

SENATE DEFEATS PROVISION GIVING WOMEN DIRECT ACCESS TO
OBSTETRICIANS, GYNECOLOGISTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
and GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate efforts to address consumer worries about
managed care plans remained mired in partisanship Tuesday as
Republicans defeated a Democratic provision that would give women
greater freedom in choosing which doctors they see.
</P>
<P>
   Voting closely along party lines, the Senate rejected by a
margin of 52-48 an amendment that would have given women direct
access to obstetricians and gynecologists without having to go
through a health plan gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The provision also would have allowed physicians and patients,
not health plans, to determine how long a woman should stay in a
hospital following a mastectomy. Only three Republicans joined all
the Democrats in supporting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was also expected to approve a Republican-sponsored
amendment that permits the self employed to deduct 100 percent of
their health care premiums on their tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The votes marked the first skirmish in the health care debate
now raging in the Senate as lawmakers consider GOP and Democrat
attempts to regulate managed care plans. It was also a clear signal
that Republicans have the votes to defeat numerous Democratic
amendments and push through their own health care measure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton administration officials have indicated the
president would likely veto the Republican plan as it is presently
constituted.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the arguments of business and insurance interests,
Republicans charged that the Democratic provisions would raise the
cost of health insurance so high that women would no longer be able
to afford treatment for breast cancer or other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats expressed astonishment that the Republicans would
reject a provision that would allow women to bypass health plan
bureaucrats in search of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we found out what compassionate conservatism is to be.
It is not compassionate. But it is conservative,'' said Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., referring to the `` the compassionate
conservative'' slogan used repeatedly by GOP presidential
frontrunner Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush vetoed a managed care bill approved by the Texas
Legislature in 1995, two years later he signed an HMO bill that,
among other things, gives women direct access to obstetricians and
gynecologists. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``On the governors watch we've gotten the most comprehensive
patients rights laws in the country,'' said Kim Ross, a lobbyist
with the Texas Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bush even allowed to become law a provision that gives Texans
the right to sue their HMO, a measure embraced by congressional
Democrats but opposed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the different approach taken by Bush and
congressional Republicans over regulating HMOs, Ross said, ``that's
why they are in trouble and he's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans promised to offer an alternative provision
concerning women's health, but did not divulge what it would do.
</P>
<P>
   Even if their patients' rights bill is defeated, as expected,
Democrats still believe the issue will resonate in the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Clinton also weighed in on what he called
the ``watered-down'' patients rights bill offered by the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nowhere near what the American people deserve or need.
Not only does it offer merely toothless and halfhearted
protections, it fails to protect all Americans in managed care,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill, authored primarily by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., seeks to provide basic consumer protections for
patients by making access easier to specialists and emergency
services, allowing lawsuits against health maintenance
organizations and giving physicians instead of insurers the final
authority in determining whether treatments are medically
necessary. It would cover all 161 million Americans with private
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure, on the other hand, would strengthen the
appeals process for denials of coverage or other complaints, but it
would not repeal the current federal ban on patients suing HMOs.
Like the Democratic bill, it would also expand access to services
now denied by some plans. But most of its provisions would cover
only some 48 million Americans whose coverage is provided through
large, self-funded employer programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the GOP of trying to kill the Democratic
proposal because of pressure from the health insurance industry and
managed care providers, which are spending millions of dollars on
television and other media advertising campaigns in an all-out
effort to defeat the Democrats' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about ... whether the people of this country come
first in the votes of the Congress of the United States,'' Clinton
said. ``The people deserve a bill that protects them, not the
insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans responded by accusing Clinton and the Democrats
of trying to ``nationalize'' the nation's health care system by
imposing universal standards that states would be required to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always had the idea that the federal government knows
best,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who, along with Texas Sen.
Phil Gramm, has taken the lead in mounting the GOP opposition to
the Democratic proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject that philosophy, that Washington knows best on health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to alter the Democratic proposal, the Republicans
are pushing an amendment offered by Gramm, Nickles and other
Republicans that would expand the medical savings account program
Congress authorized a few years ago on a limited basis. It would
allow people who can afford it to opt out of their current health
care systems and put aside tax-free savings to be used for medical
expenses. Any funds not used at the end of a year for
health-related expense, can then be used for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts, known as MSA's and backed by high-deductible
insurance policies designed to provide catastrophic coverage, are
now limited to small businesses with 50 or fewer employees and are
used primarily by younger or healthy individuals without families.
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm insisted that under the Republican proposal, MSA's
would eventually become the health insurance program of choice for
most Americans because they give patients's greater freedom to
choose their own doctors and other health care services. He said
that the savings could be used for investments and other purposes
also provides people with ``enough incentive to be cost
conscience'' about the kind of care they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fix the system not with lawsuits and heavy-handed
regulations...but by giving people more freedom,'' Gramm said.

THE FINE ART OF BITING INTO JAPANESE CUTENESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Edward M. Gomez writes regularly about Japanese art and design.  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Since the late 1980s, a number of
younger Japanese artists have emerged on the international scene to
challenge the old notion that all modern art from Japan is merely a
pale imitation of modern art from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Yasumasa Morimura, Tatsuo Miyajima, Mariko Mori
and Takashi Murakami, whose goofy, glossy work has found an avid
audience outside Japan. Rooted in Japanese popular culture,
Murakami's art communicates across borders in a media-driven era of
global pop to which fashion, animation, music and electronic
gadgetry from Japan have all contributed.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the focus of ``The Meaning of the Nonsense of the
Meaning,'' a mini-retrospective on view here at the Center for
Curatorial Studies Museum at Bard College through Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, art people and intellectuals get what my art is
about, but for the Japanese it's still threatening,'' Murakami said
recently while installing his show. At 37, his boyish looks are
accentuated by his hip-hop uniform: baggy shorts, a T-shirt, a
baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami, who grew up in Tokyo, is a member of what his
countrymen call the shinjinrui (new human species), the postwar
generations whose easy access to leisure, travel and consumer goods
was unknown to the millions who struggled to rebuild the nation
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami's art has been called neo-pop or critical pop. ``In
Japan, communication is about appearances and surfaces,'' he said.
``We use cuteness and formality to disguise what we really want to
say. My work looks at the other side of that cuteness.''
</P>
<P>
   That calculated cheerfulness is visible in the cartoon-character
corporate logotypes seen all across Japan for everything from
fast-food outlets to banks, and in an endless outpouring of anime
(animated films), manga (comic books) and video games that often
share heroes and story lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our traditional arts, whose rules are strict, but in a
contemporary context there is no fine art anymore,'' said Murakami.
``Pop-culture imagery has become the dominant language, so through
it I try to create a fine art for our times.''
</P>
<P>
   These may be surprising words from someone who, in 1993, earned
the first doctorate degree in nihonga ever awarded by the
prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music.
Nihonga is a Japanese genre that mixes local, traditional subject
matter with 19th-century European-derived painting techniques.
Murakami also taught drawing before setting out on an art career in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier conceptual-action works, Murakami recruited four
art students to pose simultaneously as the same Japanese television
star who had lost the right to use his stage name in a dispute with
his manager, and in another work, he appropriated a well-known
comic strip satirizing Japanese middle-class life. Meticulously
assembled, his more recent art is inspired by Japan's otaku, or
``geek,'' subculture. Otaku are obsessive fans of sexy manga, anime
and computer games.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Murakami had devised his own edgy cartoon-character
alter ego. Known as Mr. DOB, it vaguely resembles a certain famous
mouse but also recalls an inflatable pygmy doll that the artist
once spotted in a toy shop. Mr. DOB has turned up in lusciously
textured paintings, on T-shirts, as a plush toy and in large
balloon sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murakami sees no distinction between his fine art and his
merchandise; his goal is to speak to and about current Japanese
society by creating and distributing works that are understood by
all,'' said Amada Cruz, the director of Bard's Center for
Curatorial Studies Museum and a curator, with Dana Friis-Hansen, of
the artist's show.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest works at Bard, Murakami metamorphoses Mr. DOB into
DNA helixes, ectoplasmic webs and three-dimensional toadstools that
look like fixtures from a psychedelic amusement park. Mr. DOB's
smile often reveals spiky, monstrous teeth; many pieces on view
exude a sinister charm.
</P>
<P>
   Murakami, who now regularly uses skilled assistants, maintains
studios in Tokyo and New York and has galleries in those cities as
well as in Los Angeles. He admits to being much more ambitious than
his casual demeanor suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Critiquing pop culture's daunting effluence even as he adds to
it, Murakami said slyly: ``Eventually, if my characters go in the
direction of kitsch, that's O.K. If I see them on coffee mugs in
airport souvenir shops everywhere, that's fine with me.''

 &HT;    Court overturns school prayer ruling
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal appeals court panel Tuesday said a judge's
ruling on school prayer in Alabama went too far and restricted the
right of students to lead a prayer or express religious feelings in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 3-0 decision said
U.S. District Judge Ira DeMent wrongly restricted students'
religious expression in his 1997 ruling. DeMent's ruling stemmed
from a lawsuit brought against Alabama's DeKalb County schools by
Michael Chandler on behalf of his son, Jessie, a pupil there.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 years of legal precedent had gone against
school-sanctioned prayers. The appellate decision also runs counter
to a three-judge panel's ruling in a similar Florida case, but that
ruling has been set aside and the case will be heard by all 11
members of the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   DeMent's order covered a range of school religion issues. The
appeals court's decision focused on sections that had been
challenged by Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor described the decision Tuesday as a victory for all
Alabamians, particularly schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was looking forward to returning to DeMent's
courtroom to have the rules redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court held that schoolchildren are not `state actors' and,
following that reasoning, they can seize the intercom and pray,
which a school employee cannot do. But what this now allows
teachers to do is choose a kid to pray over the intercom, or at
graduation or assemblies,'' said Pamela Sumners, the Chandler
family's attorney in Birmingham.

PARTISAN SHOWDOWN LOOMS OVER BUDGET SURPLUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means Committee took the first
step Tuesday toward a partisan showdown over allocating the
projected federal budget surplus, opening debate on a Republican
proposal to send $864 billion back to taxpayers over the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that unless excess revenues were returned to
taxpayers, Washington would spend the money and cause the federal
government to become even more bloated. Democrats responded that
there was room for a modest tax cut, but that there were other
needs for the money and that the Republican plan would dig the
nation back into a deep fiscal hole in the name of rewarding the
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   After months of sparring, committee members also got down to
examining details of the legislation, working deep into the night
in a hearing room packed with lobbyists, accountants and others
with an interest in the bill provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by the committee chairman, Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, would cut personal income tax rates by 10 percent in four
steps over the next decade. It would also cut the top tax rate on
capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent, repeal the tax on
large inheritances, give a break to many married couples and
simplify tax preparation for many people by phasing out the
alternative minimum tax for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's bill would gradually reduce the capital gains tax rate
for corporations, from 35 percent to 25 percent, a provision valued
at $17.4 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It would respond to pleas from particular industries, like
restaurants, which would benefit from its proposal to increase the
deductibility of business meals gradually from 50 percent to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains even more narrowly drawn special interest
provisions, like the repeal of a 10 percent excise tax on fishing
tackle boxes, at a cost to the Treasury of $30 million over the
next decade,
</P>
<P>
   The committee, where all tax legislation in Congress must
originate, plans to vote on the plan on Wednesday, with approval
all but certain given the Republican majority. The full House is
scheduled to take up the plan later in the month and is likely to
pass it largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   A similar process will begin next week in the Senate, which will
have before it a slightly smaller tax-cutting package that
Republicans hope will draw some support from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made clear that he will veto any bill
resembling the current Republican proposals. But he has also
signaled his willingness to negotiate a compromise, although no
serious talks are likely for several months.
</P>
<P>
   With projections of the federal budget surplus growing almost by
the month, Republicans see this as the most propitious time since
the beginning of Ronald Reagan's administration to push a broad tax
cut through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this month
that the surplus would total $2.9 trillion over the next decade. Of
that, $1.9 trillion comes from excess payroll tax revenues
earmarked for Social Security, and the two parties have agreed to
use that money only to reduce the national debt or shore up the
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the money _ nearly $1 trillion _ is up for grabs
in political terms.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say nearly all of it should go to tax cuts, and that
there is plenty of other money for spending programs and to solve
the looming financial problems in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about is a defining difference between the
Republicans and Democrats,'' Archer said. ``We believe the people
can spend their money more wisely than the bureaucrats in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to use $250 billion of the surplus for tax cuts
and to divide the rest among Medicare and various spending programs
including education, health and the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``By pushing this colossal tax bill, Republicans are forcing
members to choose between decent health care for our nation's
seniors and tax cuts,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the
senior member of his party on the Ways and Means Committee. ``If we
proceed in a fiscally responsible way as the president has laid
out, we can address the challenges of Social Security and Medicare
and still consider targeted middle-income tax relief.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the projected surpluses are relatively small in the next
few years but become substantially bigger in subsequent years,
Archer's tax bill delays most of its tax cuts until well into the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $864 billion in tax cuts he is proposing, only $4.6
billion would take effect next year (the reduction in the capital
gains tax would apply retroactively to profits on transactions
after June 30 of this year).
</P>
<P>
   The cuts would increase to $25.5 billion in 2001, $46.7 billion
in 2002 and $203.4 billion in 2009. Because the tab mounts
substantially over the years, Democrats said, the cost in future
decades will be far larger than in the first decade, endangering
the nation's ability to avoid another crippling round of budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest component of Archer's bill is the reduction
in personal income tax rates, which would total $405.2 billion over
10 years. The cuts would start in 2001, when the current 15 percent
income tax bracket would be reduced to 14.7 percent, the current 28
percent bracket would be reduced to 27.3 percent and the top
bracket of 39.6 percent would fall to 38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Further reductions would be implemented in 2005, 2008 and 2009,
leaving the lowest bracket at 13.5 percent, the current 28 percent
bracket at 25.2 percent and the top bracket at 35.7 percent.

DOW JONES EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strong gains in advertising and low newsprint prices combined to
propel Dow Jones &AMP; Co.'s second-quarter earnings above analyst
expectations. The company reported Tuesday that its net income for
the quarter reached $57.2 million, or 62 cents a diluted share, a
penny above the consensus estimate reported by the First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive quarter in which earnings exceeded
expectations, and the strongest improvements came in the company's
print publishing operations. Ad lineage at The Wall Street Journal
increased 6.9 percent in the second quarter over the comparable
period in 1998. But the improvement accelerated sharply in June,
when advertising lineage was up 19 percent over June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue at all Dow Jones United States publications
grew 10 percent, pushing print publishing revenue up 6 percent, to
$327 million. Over all, revenues rose 4.9 percent over the 1998
period, to $510.6 million. Operating income was $104.8 million, up
6.9 percent from the pro forma figure for the second quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's Ottaway community newspapers division,
operating income rose 47 percent to $23.6 million, despite slight
advertising losses, because of economies that pushed up that
division's cash-flow margins to 33.1 percent, up from 25.1 percent
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an investor's point of view, it is sensational The
Journal is doing as well as it is,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``It is carrying the whole company.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was more guarded about the prospects for the company's
electronic publishing division, where operating income dropped 44.6
percent, to $10.2 million, despite a 1.4 percent rise in revenue,
as the sales force was expanded to sell the Dow Jones news wires
product overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons investors are interested in Dow Jones is
the emerging electronic segment, and there are a lot of caveats,''
Ms. Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday, she pointed out that The Wall Street
Journal's interactive edition continued to grow, with 306,000
subscribers to date, up from 223,000 a year ago; it brought in $7.9
million, up 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the far larger news wire business, Ms. Fine wrote, ``is
relatively stagnant.'' The company reported total electronic
revenue of $98.9 million for the quarter, up 1 percent from a year
ago; revenue from the news wires were $51.1 million, basically
unchanged.

BOSTON EDISTON COMPLETES SALE OF 27-YEAR-OLD N-PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the right price, anything _ even a 27-year-old nuclear power
plant that someday could cost $600 million to clean up _ can be a
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving what some US energy analysts once thought was
impossible, Boston Edison's parent company Tuesday completed its
$81 million sale of the Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Plymouth,
Mass. to a unit of New Orleans energy giant Entergy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrim deal, one of a handful that have been in the works,
was the first successfully completed nuclear plant sale in US
history. It may herald a new era for many of the nation's 103
nuclear power plants, which not long ago were widely considered
doomed albatrosses.
</P>
<P>
   As industry restructuring pushes utilities to unload their
generating assets to competitive power producers, a handful of
national energy giants such as Entergy and Amergen are lining up.
On their shopping lists: such nuclear plants as Pilgrim, Seabrook,
Vermont Yankee, and the Millstone complex in Connecticut, once seen
as hopelessly uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   Amergen is looking over Vermont Yankee and is close to a final
deal on the Three Mile Island 1 plant in Pennsylvania, the
undamaged sister of the now-closed plant involved in the 1979
disaster that chilled nuclear power development nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   While buyers are accepting potentially enormous risks, a huge
enticement is that utilities are offering below-fire-sale prices
for nuclear plants. Pilgrim is selling for barely 11 cents on the
book-value dollar, or perhaps six months' gross revenues.
</P>
<P>
   And state regulators in Massachusetts and elsewhere are allowing
utilities to pass along huge cleanup costs to ratepayers. Edison
will charge customers $271 million in coming years to fund a
federally required decommissioning account for the time when
Pilgrim is permanently shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim can produce up to 670 megawatts of electricity, about 3
percent of New England's peak power needs. Under Tuesday's deal,
Edison will buy 100 percent of Pilgrim's output through the end of
2002, after which Entergy will begin converting Pilgrim to a
``merchant plant'' competing with gas, oil, coal, and other units
to sell to the New England grid.
</P>
<P>
   As long as current regulatory and market conditions last,
``Nuclear power is going to get a second look,'' said analyst Ethan
Cohen of the Yankee Group in Boston. ``Once you've covered the
installed cost base, it is exceptionally cheap energy to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Maloney, president of Devonrue Ltd., a Hingham consulting
firm active in energy deregulation issues, said of the Pilgrim
sale: ``It's like buying a car for the price of the gas in the
tank. It's basically a giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Plymouth, Entergy president Don Hintz
said: ``I believe this sale is the first of many. Entergy believes
that well-run nuclear plants, at least of a certain size and in a
good area, can be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to acquire as many of the big nuclear plants
in good power regions as we can,'' Hintz said, including New
England. Entergy, which beat out 10 bidders for Pilgrim, owns five
Deep South nuclear units. It predicted Pilgrim will add 5 cents a
share to this year's net profits.
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation deals being discussed with New Hampshire and
Connecticut regulators, by December 2003 Northeast Utilities is
proposing to sell its stakes in the Seabrook and Millstone plants,
although it may have a subsidiary bid on Millstone.
</P>
<P>
   Hintz also said that although Pilgrim's operating license
expires in 2012, ``I would be surprised if we didn't make the
decision to'' ask federal regulators to extend the license.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Nuclear already has contracts to decommission the Maine
Yankee and Millstone 1 Connecticut unit. ``I'd sooner operate
nuclear plants than decommission them,'' Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim employs more than 600 people and pays one-quarter of the
town's property taxes. After a rocky safety record in the
mid-1980s, Pilgrim this month completed 500 days of uninterrupted
operation, Edison chairman Thomas May said.
</P>
<P>
   The $81 million purchase price includes $67 million for
radioactive fuel on site and just $14 million for the plant itself,
which cost $231 million to build in 1972 and has a net book value
of $700 million, counting capital improvements since.
</P>
<P>
   Edison is transferring about $200 million in the decommissioning
fund to Entergy and will add the $271 million that will be billed
to its 650,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy officials are confident the $471 million, plus future
investment returns, will cover ultimate shutdown costs. Edison
spokesman David Tarantino said Edison customers will save more than
$100 million in future decommissioning charges they would have had
to pay if Edison continued to own Pilgrim through 2012. Edison also
expects to get $31 million in insurance rebates if Pilgrim operates
without incident through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrim site also includes 1,600 acres of land abutting Cape
Cod Bay, some of which could be prime development land. Also, if
the nuclear generator is ever shut down, the site could well be
used as a platform for a new gas-powered plant.

FUGITIVE SUSPECTED OF COMMITTING AT LEAST EIGHT MURDERS IS
ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After eluding an international manhunt for months, a
Mexican fugitive suspected of jumping freight cars to commit at
least eight brutal murders in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky
surrendered on Tuesday morning after his family negotiated his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, walked across a bridge
from Juarez, Mexico, to the Usleta border checkpoint in El Pasoat 9
a.m. and extended his hand to a Texas Ranger who greeted him with a
handshake and handcuffs. Resendez-Ramirez, 39, a slight man who
wore a striped shirt and wire-rimmed aviator glasses, was described
as calm and ``very pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after thousands of law-enforcement officers in the
United States and Mexico followed thousands of tips in vain, the
case broke because a sister of the suspect called the Texas Ranger
who later made the arrest on the bridge. The ranger, Andrew Carter,
had traded calls with the sister, who lives in Albuquerque, for two
weeks before she reached him Sunday on his cellular telephone as he
fished off the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramirez's sister called him on his cell phone and said, `We
need to talk,'''said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department
of Public Safety. ``She thought her brother was ready to
surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unexpected break in a case that had looked hopeless as
recently as last week when the authorities and the suspect's
common-law wife in Mexico had issued a public plea for
Resendez-Ramirez to surrender. With each of the eight killings
occurring near railroad tracks, guns sales in many railroad
communities in Texas rose sharply as law-enforcement officials
warned that the ``railroad killer'' could strike again.
</P>
<P>
   For months, grainy photographs of the suspect had been plastered
in post offices across the country as Resendez-Ramirez was named to
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List on June 21. A federal, state and
local law enforcement task force in Houston had followed thousands
of tips, most of them false leads. The last credible sighting came
on June 18 when he was spotted at a homeless shelter in Louisville,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez appeared on Tuesday morning before a state
magistrate in El Paso on a pending burglary charge from the Houston
area. He was then flown to Houston, accompanied by Carter, and
placed in the Harris County Jail in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris County District Attorney's Office is expected to
charge him with murder. He has been linked to five slayings in
Texas since last December. He faces two murder charges in Illinois
for the June 15 shotgun slayings of an elderly man and his
daughter. Another murder charge is pending in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Resendez-Ramirez faces the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission accomplished, for the moment,'' said Don K. Clark, the
FBI special agent in charge in Houston, speaking at a news
conference on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a phalanx of investigators, Clark paused to make a
statement to the families of the victims. ``We cannot bring your
loved ones back,'' he said, ``but we did pledge to work endlessly
to work for justice, and we did just that.''
</P>
<P>
   But until Tuesday's arrest, the investigation had met with
criticism, particularly after it was discovered that Border Patrol
agents had picked up the suspect on June 2 and released him into
Mexico even though the FBI was searching for him and the Houston
police had told the Immigration and Naturalization Service that
Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the suspect was released, a 73-year-old woman,
Josephine Konvicka, was found beaten to death in her home in
Fayette County west of Houston. On the next day, June 5, a Houston
school teacher, Noemie Dominguez, 26, was found clubbed to death in
her home. Ms. Dominguez's car was later found in the border town of
Del Rio, reportedly with fingerprints of the suspect inside.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Resendez-Ramirez had remained a
mysterious figure. Even his true identity was uncertain since
investigators say he has used more than 30 aliases. Born in the
Mexican city of Puebla, he first entered the United States
illegally in 1976, when he was arrested in Brownsville by
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 23 years ago, Resendez-Ramirez led the life of a
transient, illegally jumping freight cars from Mexico into the
United States. His adventures carried him from Vermont to
California, and he bounced in and out of federal prisons and local
jails on a long string of immigration violations and other minor
non-violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his non-violent history, investigators have linked
him through physical evidence, including fingerprints in some of
the cases, to the five Texas killings as well as the slayings in
Illinois and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The first murder occurred on Aug. 29, 1997, when Christopher
Maier was killed along the railroad tracks in Lexington. Maier's
girlfriend was raped and beaten but survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Maier case remained unsolved, and Resendez-Ramirez had
apparently not yet emerged as a suspect in 1998. He was stopped by
border agents and deported six times that year, the last time in
April. Eight months later, the first of the five related Texas
murders occurred when Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, was raped and stabbed
to death inside her home in West University Place on Dec. 17, 1998.
Then, last April 30, the Rev. Norman Sirnic and his wife, Karen,
were bludgeoned with a sledgehammer inside their home in Weimar,
Texas. Fingerprints and other evidence linked Resendez-Ramirez to
the crime, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But the big break came on Sunday. Cox, the spokesman for the
Texas Department of Public Safety, said that Carter had first
visited the suspect's sister about two or three weeks ago at her
home in Albuquerque and had remained in regular telephone contact
with her. At the same time, the sister apparently had contacted
another brother in Mexico who knew the whereabouts of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of receiving the cellular call on his fishing trip,
Carter flew to Albuquerque with an FBI agent and a U.S. marshal to
meet with the sister. By Monday, an agreement had been drafted by
the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston that
offered the suspect and his family three things: a pledge of safety
in the Harris County jail, the promise of regular visits from his
family and a full psychological examination.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that winning the trust of Resendez-Ramirez' sister was
essential in breaking the case. He said that Carter, 32, ``was able
to build up some rapport and trust with them'' and ultimately his
siblings and a family minister convinced the suspect to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark was noncommittal when asked if the sister would
receive the $125,000 reward offered in the case, other officials
said it appeared that she would. Officials would not say if the
prospect of the reward prompted the sister to turn her brother in.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that Mr. Resendez-Ramirez could be charged in
additional murder cases as the investigation progresses. He said
that 50 or 60 law enforcement agencies from throughout the country
had contacted the task force with possible related cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the summers of 1996 and 1998, Resendez-Ramirez labored as a
migrant worker at a tobacco farm in Russell County, Ky. Official
say they are investigating him for several murders that occurred
near railroad tracks in the area during those same summers.
Investigators also suspect that Mr. Resendez-Ramirez may be
connected to the Oct. 2, 1998, slaying of an elderly man in the
northeast Texas town of Hughes Springs.

COLLEAGUES CREDIT TEXAS RANGER WITH MAKING SURRENDER HAPPEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Rangers Sgt. Andrew F. ``Drew'' Carter Jr.
was fishing on the Gulf Coast near Houston on Sunday when his
cellular phone rang, with probably the biggest phone call in his
short career as a Texas Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from Albuquerque, N.M., the home of the sister of
suspected serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez. Manuela Maturino
said her brother might be willing to give up if certain concerns
were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspect's sister had said that he would only surrender to
a Texas Ranger, not a federal officer or any other officer,'' said
Mike Cox, spokesman for the Department of Public Safety, the agency
that oversees the Rangers. He attributed the surrender in large
part to ``the rapport they (Carter and Maturino) had built up.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a Houston-based Ranger who had gained the woman's
confidence during the weeks-long international manhunt for her
brother, immediately returned to Houston. He conferred with Harris
County prosecutors about how to entice Resendez-Ramirez out of
hiding in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   They drew up a document that assured the suspect he would be
safe while in jail, that he would be allowed family visitors and
that he would get psychological help, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours later, Resendez-Ramirez _ insistent on
surrendering to a Texas Ranger _ walked across the Mexican border
near El Paso, shook hands with Carter and then allowed Carter to
end his freedom by slipping a pair of handcuffs on him.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for the man who had cracked the FBI's Ten Most Wanted
list was over _ and several colleagues credit Carter with making it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turned 32 Tuesday, joined the legendary and elite
Texas Rangers only last year, after a career with the Texas
Department of Public Safety that began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was initially assigned as a highway patrolman in
Huntsville before stints in Brenham, Tyler and Houston. During his
11 years in state law enforcement he has gained 14 commendations.
He rose to lieutenant with the DPS. But, because officers must
enter the Rangers as a sergeant, he accepted a pay cut to join.
</P>
<P>
   Described as ``quiet and easygoing,'' Carter had little to say
after Resendez-Ramirez was in custody. In brief comments in El
Paso, he credited other law officers and the cooperation of the
family of Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been involved in this case since early on,'' Cox said,
noting that Carter originally worked on the Texas murders of the
Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife, Karen, in May in Weimar.

ARMSTRONG'S TOUR DE FRANCE TOUR DE FORCE ROLLS ON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SESTRIERE, Italy _ Lance Armstrong opened the defense of his
yellow jersey in the best possible way Tuesday as he demolished the
field in the Tour de France and won the first stage in the Alps,
put even more time between him and his rivals and showed that he
was the man to beat _ if anybody can _ in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think before today there were some questions about my
abilities in the mountains, so I think it was important to show
that the team and I are strong in the mountains,'' Armstrong said
Tuesday after his easy victory over five climbs and 213.5
kilometers (132.65 miles) from Le Grand Bornand, France, to
Sestriere, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The American leader of the U.S. Postal Service said he had
surprised even himself with his show of strength. Not an
overwhelming climber in earlier years, Armstrong has worked at his
power and lost a few pounds to help get over the peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Armstrong _ an outspoken opponent of the use of
performance-enhancing drugs in the sport _ given this Tour a
resoundingly positive image, he has also provided a inspirational,
feel-good story. A 27-year-old Texan, Armstrong was the world
road-race champion at 21 and was fighting testicular cancer at 25.
After surgery and three months of chemotherapy late in 1996, he
skipped the 1997 season to recover and returned to racing seriously
barely a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three victories in the 1999 Tour, he has emphatically
embraced his position as a role model for anyone who has confronted
serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this can be a fantastic example for all cancer
patients, all survivors,'' Armstrong said after his victory in the
Tour's opening prologue in Le Puy du Fou on July 3. ``Hopefully, I
can prove it's possible to return to a normal professional life,
and maybe I can prove it's possible for you to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   If Armstrong wins the Tour, he would be only the second American
to win a race that began in 1903 and the first American to win it
since Greg LeMond did it for the third and last time in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Is the race over with nearly two weeks to go before the finish
in Paris on July 25? ``No, no,'' he said. ``I'm still nervous. We
don't think we have the race won at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rivals still have three or four days in the mountains and
they're going to be even tougher now. They're all fighters,
scrappers, whatever you want to call them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, Armstrong finished first by 31 seconds over Alex
Zuelle, a Swiss with Banesto whom he rates as his most dangerous
rival. Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme, was third, 1
minute 26 seconds behind, the same time as Ivan Gotti, an Italian
with Polti, in fourth place. Two other major rivals were far back _
Abraham Olano, a Spaniard with ONCE, lost 3:10, and Laurent Dufaux,
a Swiss with Saeco, lost 3:30.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, from Texas, widened his overall lead over the
second-place Olano to 6:03, with Christophe Moreau, a Frenchman
with Festina, third, 7:44 behind. Zuelle, who lost more than six
minutes after a mass crash on the second stage, is fourth, 7:47
behind, and Dufaux is fifth, 8:07 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all big numbers this early in the 86th Tour, or any
other Tour. Especially interesting, Armstrong said earlier that of
the two days in the Alps, he rated his chances much higher on the
second day, the race to Alpe d'Huez on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpe d'Huez suits me better because it's harder and more
selective,'' he said before Tuesday's race, speaking like the
master climber he was.
</P>
<P>
   With a sly grin, Armstrong admitted after this ninth of 20 daily
stages that he had also said beforehand that he planned to be
conservative in at least the first of two days in the Alps. Then he
was one of the first over the major climb of the day, the Galibier
pass, found himself without a teammate in the lead group but rode
at the front and attacked successfully with about six kilometers
(3.7 miles) to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did say that about being conservative,'' he said. ``But
sometimes the tactics dictate otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he said to the field: ``Here I am, come and get
me if you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong noted that, although he was without a teammate in the
lead pack and surrounded by three riders _ one from Banesto
(Zuelle), and two from Polti (Gotti and Richard Virenque, the star
French climber), ``I was concentrating on putting time between me
and Olano,'' he said. And he rode along securely.
</P>
<P>
   He even had a good word for the occasionally drizzly and cold
weather high in the Alps, which turned into a downpour just before
he crossed the line with his arms upraised. ``This kind of weather
makes half the field give up early,'' he said. ``I don't like it
myself, but it does make the job easier.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The stage began in the Alpine resort of Le Grand Bornand under
overcast skies as an immense crowd of vacationers cheered the
riders. The crowd thinned notably atop the Galibier, a climb of 18
kilometers (11.2 miles) with a grade of 6.9 percent. It is rated
beyond category, on a scale mounting from 4 to 1 in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the other climbs were only hills but the final one to
the Italian resort of Sestriere was tough, 11 kilometers (6.8
miles) at a grade of 5.8 percent. The ramp to the finish was awash
in tifosi, the Italian bicycle fans, who plastered every rock and
fence with signs for their heroes, many of them unknown outside
their own kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight riders who dropped out Tuesday were such names
as Mario Cipollini, the champion Italian sprinter for Saeco, who
showed up for the start in a Julius Caesar costume, and Jaan
Kirsipuu, an Estonian with Casino, who wore the yellow jersey most
of last week until he yielded it to Armstrong after the time trial
in Metz on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep the yellow jersey as long as possible,''
Armstrong said. ``If that means a day, a week, into Paris _ I have
no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, barring illness or injury, he is alone in that
uncertainty. &QL;

HOME WITH KIN BEING SOUGHT FOR HONDURAN RUNAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About two dozen people have made inquiries about
giving a home to the 13-year-old Honduran runaway who captivated
New Yorkers with a fictional tale of a 3,200-mile odyssey, but city
officials said Tuesday that they remained hopeful that the boy
would find a home with his kin.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, had told an elaborate tale of
traveling solo from Honduras to New York to find his father, who
was later revealed to have died last year. Employees with the city
Administration for Children's Services are currently talking with
the boy's grandmother, Paula Vasquez Hernandez, who raised him at
her home in San Buenventura in Honduras, about taking him in, said
Leonora Wiener, a spokeswoman for the agency. They also plan to
contact Edwin's mother in Choloma, a town in northern Honduras, and
an aunt in Hialeah, Fla., Ms. Wiener said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to all the relatives and to the Honduran
consulate to try and find the best permanent home for him,'' said
Ms. Wiener.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin's mother, Angela Enamorado, said in an interview on
Honduran television Sunday that she would not let her son live with
her because he was too troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Edwin told police officers and the Dominican taxi
driver who spotted him standing on a Bronx highway and put him up
for the night that his mother had been killed in Hurricane Mitch
and he had traveled to New York to try and find a father he had
never seen. In fact, his relatives later said, it is the boy's
father, Grevis Sabillon, who is dead.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after Edwin's hoax was uncovered, Mrs.
Hernandez said that she wanted Edwin to return to Honduras, but
that she did not want him back in her home: ``I'll put him in
reform school until he straightens out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora Rodriguez, Edwin's aunt in Hialeah, Fla., where he stayed
for two months after running away from his grandmother's home in
the spring and before coming to New York, has said publicly that
she also does not want him back. But Ms. Wiener said the
Administration for Children's Services was still hopeful that Edwin
would find a suitable home with relatives.

   ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a two-part film being shown
next Sunday and Monday on Showtime, may well be the highest-level
mob memoir and tutorial (``Mafia is a process, not a thing'') to
find its way to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   It is quite certainly the only one ever to list another
acknowledged Mafioso _ Bonanno's son Salvatore, known as Bill _ as
an executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   And it is undoubtedly the first to tie strife in the Mafia's
ruling commission to the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, as carried out, in this version anyway, by the Chicago
Mafia boss Johnny Roselli hiding in a Dallas sewer facing the
motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this purports to be factual _ Roselli's supposed prison
confidences to Bill Bonanno.
</P>
<P>
   So does the picture of the Bonannos as guardians of rigorous
Mafia family values, betrayed by ``a new generation of Americanized
Mafia with a different set of values, blinded by the desire for
money and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bonanno, 66, who described himself in an interview as
``just a small farm boy from Arizona trying to make it in this
business,'' said that he and the screenwriter, Thomas Michael
Donnelly, ``worked as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't want a whitewash,'' Bonanno said,
speaking from his home in Tucson, where his father had sought
refuge from the murderous vendettas that embroiled the New York
Mafia clans in the 1960s. ``I wanted the writer to write and
Showtime to produce an accurate story.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime says it did not want to ``censor'' the Bonannos. ``This
is what they say happened; it doesn't mean we're endorsing it,''
said Jerry Offsay, president for programming at Showtime, speaking
from Los Angeles. Wherever possible, he said, researchers checked
facts and at times Showtime insisted on the inclusion of
unflattering material that the Bonannos might have preferred to
skip over.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, ``Some of it is unverifiable but it sure is
an interesting tale, and we are in the entertainment business, not
documentarians.''
</P>
<P>
   It would hardly be the first time, of course, that fact and
fiction have been interwoven on screen in the fanciful way, say,
that Oliver Stone portrayed the Kennedy assassination as a vast
government conspiracy reaching up to Vice President Lyndon B.
Johnson (depicted here as the Mafia's dictated choice as Kennedy's
running mate). But it may be becoming increasingly common. Books,
too, are blurring the line, with reviewers failing all too often to
flag the fiction in works of ostensible nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent a good part of the 1980s studying the Bonanno crime
family for a book on the Sicilian-American heroin network known as
the Pizza Connection, I was struck by the production's creative and
humanistic touches and presumably inadvertent humor. ``What's with
these people?'' the Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana rages against the
ingrate Kennedys before the supposed mob hit on the president.
``Don't they have any sense of honor?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfolding as a long flashback, the film traces Joseph Bonanno's
roots in Castellammare, Sicily; his New York Mafia apprenticeship
under the wily and grasping Salvatore Maranzano, whose 1931 murder
opens the way for Bonanno's elevation at 26 as the youngest boss
ever, and the slow disintegration of his world under mob rivalries
and the growing aggressiveness of federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It ends with an abortive plot against fellow bosses and his
withdrawal to Arizona, before damaging revelations link the Bonanno
crime family to a vast traffic in narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in the Castellammarese area of Sicily, Rome and Montreal
(where Bill Bonanno was non grata to the Canadian authorities from
his 1966 arrest in an unregistered car with fellow mobsters and
guns), the production stars Martin Landau as the aging don, Bruce
Ramsay and Tony Nardi as his younger selves, and Edward James Olmos
as Maranzano. Michel Poulette directed.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's partners included the Bonannos' company Armeda Ltd.,
along with Daniel L. Paulson Productions and Productions la Fete,
which produced Showtime's 1998 film of Armistead Maupin's ``More
Tales of the City.'' The screenwriter, Donnelly, also wrote and
directed ``The Garden of Redemption,'' a 1997 Showtime production
set in a Nazi-occupied Italian village.
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering whatever happened to omerta, the
so-called Mafia code of silence, Joseph Bonanno says: ``In my
world, omerta is a noble principle. It praises silence and scorns
the informer. Omerta is an injunction against allowing yourself to
be used as the instrument of another man's downfall. Omerta,
however, does not mean that a man cannot say what he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, beginning more than 30 years ago, the Bonannos have been
speaking out, if selectively. First, in the mid-1960s, in the
middle of a mob war, Bill Bonanno began confiding in a New York
Times reporter, Gay Talese, whose resulting 1971 best seller,
``Honor Thy Father,'' centered on the younger Bonanno's struggle to
stay alive after his father was snatched off Park Avenue in 1964 in
a suspicious disappearance on the eve of a date with a grand jury.
He reappeared just as mysteriously, unscathed, 19 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged by his son's candor, Joseph Bonanno found an unusual
way to retaliate: he published his own book, ``A Man of Honor,'' a
1983 autobiography written with Sergio Lalli. Some reviewers found
it sanctimonious, and even Michael Korda, his editor at Simon &AMP;
Schuster at the time, calls it ``an exercise in caution,'' in his
latest book, ``Another Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bonanno book was forthcoming enough about the operations
of the little-known 50-year-old ruling Mafia commission to excite
the interest of an ambitious United States Attorney in Manhattan.
Taking it as his cue, as he later recounted, Rudolph W. Giuliani
put together the first case against the commission and eight crime
bosses and underlords accused of leading it, convicting all eight
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno, long in retirement, was not in the dock, but he spent a
year in jail on civil contempt in 1985 and 1986 for refusing to
testify. His only other prison time had come just a year before, in
1983 and 1984, when a five-year sentence was cut to a year and a
day after he was convicted of conspiring to thwart a grand jury
investigation into money-laundering through businesses owned by his
sons, Bill and Joseph Jr. Bill Bonanno himself spent 11 years in
prison on various convictions.
</P>
<P>
   This year it seemed the son's turn to publish once again, and he
came out with ``Bound by Honor: A Mafioso's Story.'' ``Most of the
activity in any crew anywhere was legal,'' he contends. The cash
envelopes that the men kicked up to their chiefs and captains were
strictly voluntary. If a crew member didn't pay, there were no
consequences. ``The key, always, was the willing bond of loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bonanno also maintains that his father was shocked when one
of his longtime group leaders, Carmine Galante, was charged with
drug trafficking in 1962: ``For us, this was the cruelest blow of
all because it meant that trafficking had been occurring in our own
Family for some time. My father was heartbroken by this, although
unwilling to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (No mention here of a meeting between Joseph Bonanno, Galante,
Charles (Lucky) Luciano and a major Sicilian drug trafficker and
Mafia leader, Gaetano Badalamenti, in Palermo in 1957, a sit-down
testified to by a leading Mafia turncoat, Tommaso Buscetta, in the
Pizza Connection trial. And no mention of all the Sicilian
drug-runners the Bonanno mob slipped into the country, as later
detailed by the FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone in his book and
movie ``Donnie Brasco.'')
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bonanno also writes: ``Because I happened, at the
time, to be the acting leader of the Bonanno `crime family,' I
eventually learned who shot the president _ and why.'' This turns
out to be Roselli, supposedly exacting vengeance for what Mafia
bosses viewed as a betrayal by Kennedy after they had swung crucial
election support to him, only to become targets of Robert F.
Kennedy's anti-racketeering investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to allege _ I was there,'' said Bill Bonanno on
the phone, claiming to have heard the story from a ``loose-lipped''
Roselli himself as they shared prison time at Terminal Island near
Los Angeles in the early 1970s, not long before Roselli's
dismembered body was found in an oil drum in Biscayne Bay, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Posner, author of the widely credited 1993 book ``Case
Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,'' called
Roselli's supposed account ``demonstrably false.'' ``No bullets
from the front hit; that was clear from the evidence,'' he said.
Even Jim Garrison, the renegade New Orleans District Attorney,
``dropped a sewer shooter as physically impossible.'' And, Posner
said, Jack Ruby was unconnected to Giancana, so he could hardly
have killed Oswald on Giancana's orders, as Bill Bonanno also
recounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Showtime production, based on both Bonanno books, has young
Joseph, son of a simpatico Mafia leader, hounded out of Sicily with
other anti-Fascists by Mussolini's Black Shirts. Smuggled into
Florida from Cuba, he seeks honest work, is rebuffed and drifts
into bootlegging, supplying liquor on credit to a grateful
speakeasy owner, played by Patti LuPone. ``You got to be some kind
of throwback to something I thought was extinct,'' she says
adoringly.
</P>
<P>
   He is at Maranzano's side when they wage war against a vicious
rival, Joe (the Boss) Massaria, who is lured to his death by Lucky
Luciano. Luciano in turn has Maranzano killed for supposedly
plotting against him. ``I turned a strong face to the world,''
Joseph Bonanno relates, ``but my heart was broken.'' In real life
he may have been more consolable, as his own book suggests. In any
case, he soon became boss himself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says: ``My title of godfather did not exempt me from
earning my own living. Among the businesses I was fortunate to own
were some in the garment district.'' This enables him to give a job
to the needy daughter of his old schoolteacher in Palermo.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, intimidation and violence sometimes do rear their
heads in the Mafia, as the film shows. A factory owner is persuaded
to put ghost employees on his payroll after a visit from the
Bonannos. A contractor agrees to withdraw his winning bid. A
numbers banker, so foolish as to skim from his Mafia superiors and
then to ignore a banishment order, is entombed in cement.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes even the innocent must die. ``Since when do we
bother people outside our world?'' Joseph Bonanno scolds a deputy
plotting the particularly heinous assassination of a crusading
anti-Fascist journalist, Carlo Tresca, in 1943. ``You want this
family to condone acting like common thugs?'' Yet Tresca is
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult moment of my life as a godfather,''
he laments. So difficult, apparently, that he could not even
mention it, or Tresca, in his autobiography. Nor does the movie
suggest that the killing was widely attributed to Galante.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was ashamed,'' Offsay of Showtime said. ``It was a moment
of great embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a Joseph Bonanno who carries the heavy burden of
history, yes, even the assassination of a president. ``If the
commission existed as Charlie Lucky and I had envisioned,'' he
says, ``this tragedy might never have occurred.''

MR. PEANUT, PARTY ANIMAL AND PITCHMAN, BACK IN THE LIMELIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Va., N.J, Pa.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the commercial for Almond Joy and Mounds candies that
declared, ``Sometimes you feel like a nut; sometimes you don't?''
Well, an advertising character that feels like a nut all the time _
because he is one _ is helping to increase sales for a venerable
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The character is Mr. Peanut, created in 1916 by a Virginia
school boy, Anthony Gentile, who won $5 in a contest for his
drawing of a ``little peanut person.'' After a commercial artist
added the elements that made Mr. Peanut a dapper society legume,
like his top hat, monocle and cane, the character has served as the
symbol of the Planters brand.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Mr. Peanut played a prominent part in advertising
and promotional efforts for Planters. For instance, consumers could
save package wrappers that could be redeemed for merchandise like
cups, banks, mechanical pencils, even a ``fascinating and
beautiful'' Mr. Peanut rag doll. But more recently the
spindly-legged character had been relegated to a supporting role in
keeping with a general trend to play down longtime brand icons that
were perceived as outdated or irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Mr. Peanut is reassuming a central place in the
Planters marketing pantheon. His comeback echoes those of
characters like Mr. Whipple, for Charmin bathroom tissue; Buddy
Lee, for Lee jeans, and Charlie the tuna, for Star-Kist. The goal
is to capitalize on nostalgia among older shoppers as well as the
trend for ``retro-chic'' styles among the young.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Planters and its agency, Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in
New York, say it is no coincidence that the Mr. Peanut revival has
been accompanied by a surge in sales for Planters nuts and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make nuts more appealing as an everyday snack
rather than for a special occasion,'' said David Yale, vice
president and general manager of the Planters Co. in Parsippany,
N.J., part of the Nabisco Inc. unit of Nabisco Group Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows Mr. Peanut to be seen as a regular guy,
everyman,'' he added, ``with qualities that appeal across a wide
range of demographic and socioeconomic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mr. Peanut is considered ``a party animal, but
dignified,'' Yale said. ``And people, especially younger people,
realize that his appearance is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, with a
fun edge.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added, the character has become ``a leverage
point to talk about the quality, taste and fun that separate us
from other nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Information Resources Inc., a market research
company, sales of Planters packaged nuts in food and drug stores
and mass-merchandise outlets for the 52 weeks ending June 6 totaled
$610.4 million, up 13.3 percent from sales in the period a year
earlier. That outpaced the total category's growth rate of 9.2
percent, to sales of $1.4 billion. The Planters share of market was
42.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at sales for only 1999, the momentum seemed to
accelerate. Planters sales through June 6 rose to $270.4 million,
up 16.6 percent from figures in the period a year earlier, again
outpacing the total category's growth rate, which was a 13.5
percent increase, to $623.3 million. The Planters share of market
rose, too, to 43.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Mr. Peanut has always been identified with the brand,
over the years he has been dialed up or down to different
degrees,'' said Bill McDonough, executive vice president and
worldwide account director for Nabisco at Foote, Cone New York, a
unit of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mr. Peanut conjures up Planters,'' he added. ``So we've
dialed Mr. Peanut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Foote, Cone, which has handled the Planters account since 1995,
introduced the current theme, ``Relax. Go nuts'' in 1997. Then,
beginning last year, Mr. Peanut stepped back into the limelight
with initiatives like a colorful oversized billboard in Times
Square, appearances on Max Racks postcard ads distributed in bars
and restaurants, a star turn on the Planters Web site
(www.planters.com), a cross-country tour of ``Mr. Peanut's Hot
Rod'' to publicize the Planters sponsorship of NASCAR races and a
``Find Mr. Peanut'' promotion on packages.
</P>
<P>
   The Planters ad budget was increased significantly, too,
according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of VNU NV that
tracks ad spending, to $9.5 million in 1998 from $2.7 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another big step for the character was a television commercial
last year by Foote, Cone New York that took an unusual twist to
demonstrate devotion to Mr. Peanut _ and by extension the Planters
brand.
</P>
<P>
   The spot showed three men walking in the woods who feed a nut to
a beaver. In gratitude, the animal carves a likeness of Mr. Peanut
from the trunk of a tree. ``Think that'll fit in the van?'' one man
asks another admiringly. That commercial has since been followed by
two more, featuring a woodpecker and a dog that also pay homage to
Mr. Peanut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sought to understand Mr. Peanut and what liberties we
should and should not take with him,'' McDonough said. ``There is a
certain integrity to him, as amusing as that sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mr. Peanut never speaks, nor is he made to behave in a
faddish manner. There is no Ms. Peanut nor a rapping Master Peanutz
dressed in baggy jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Peanut is a wonderful, powerful tool,'' said Ted
Littleford, executive vice president and executive creative
director at Foote, Cone New York. ``We're using him now as a true
icon, as the physical manifestation of the need for peanuts, as if
this subconscious desire for peanuts is exposed through his
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Littleford said, laughing, ``Mr. Peanut's attire is
coming back,'' citing the sartorial style of the actor Rupert
Everett in the film ``An Ideal Husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Peanut's renewal is being welcomed ardently by members of a
national group of his aficionados known as Peanut Pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a warm fuzzy in a world of guns and bombings,'' said
Joyce Spontak, a member who is the co-author of two books on
``Planters Peanut Collectibles'' (Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1995)
and has thousands of items in a ``museum room'' in her home in
Bridgeville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough, I have a father-in-law who you can't even give a
cap with a company name on it,'' Mrs. Spontak said. ``He says: `I'm
not getting any money. Why should I be a billboard?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think of Mr. Peanut as promoting the company.''
she continued. ``It's my link to the past, to my grandmother, who
would send away wrappers for anything for her grandchildren. And
it's my link to the future because I'm getting my grandchildren
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mr. Peanut gets ready to enter the 21st century, the Times
Square billboard will come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be there, celebrating the millennium,'' McDonough said.

34 CHEFS IN FRANCE CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
 (yn) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The inmates of Sante Prison in Paris probably don't know
how close they came to culinary heaven Tuesday when 34 chefs,
including some of the best in Paris, were convicted of corruption
in the kitchen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the cooks escaped with fines instead of jail terms and will
not be pursuing their profession behind bars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Martinez, now chef of the Relais Louis XIII with one star
(``a very good table in its category'') in the prestigious Michelin
Guide, said he would probably appeal the $10,000 fine he were
ordered to pay for having accepted what he called ``tips'' from a
fish supplier when he was cooking at the Tour d'Argent in the early
1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody got rich,'' Martinez said dismissively from his kitchen
Tuesday night. ``We spread it around among the staff. It was a kind
of tradition in the business to create good will. It's not as if it
was public money and these were kickbacks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christian Constant, who has two-star recognition (``excellent
table, worth a detour'') from Michelin in this year's guide for
dishes like salad of scallops with truffles and Parmesan cheese at
his Violon d'Ingres, was fined $12,250 for taking envelopes from
the business that supplied fish to the prestigious Les Ambassadeurs
in the Hotel Crillon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Constant could not be reached for comment. Other chefs fined
included Philippe Renard of Lutetia on the Left Bank and Guy Legay,
the chef at the Ritz Hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale fishmongers Patrick and Claudine Perrin, whose
company was called Scotfish when culinary corruption came under
scrutiny by Judge Eric Halphen, one of the investigating
magistrates who have turned French business practices upside-down
over the last 10 years, got suspended six-month jail terms and
$15,400 fines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guy Nicolas, their lawyer, said the verdict by a criminal court
in suburban Creteil that found his clients guilty of active
corruption and their customers answerable for the passive version
of the same crime, was ``neither fish nor fowl.''

ARCHER UNVEILS $864 BILLION TAX-CUTTING PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer
presented his much-anticipated, $864 billion tax-cutting package to
Congress on Tuesday, with a plan to raise the standard deduction
for married couples as a way to deal with the so-called ``marriage
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton repeated his call for Republicans to pare
down their tax package, while House Democrats scoffed at Archer's
plan as an unrealistic political manifesto with no chance of
becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the chief tax writer in the House, unveiled a bill that
would lower taxes for corporations, abolish the alternative minimum
tax and allow employees to shelter more income in 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded with these and other tax changes popular with
Republicans, the Texas Republican's bill is expected to sail
unscathed through committee this week and then go to the House
floor for a vote, sometime by end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats plan to launch a counteroffensive in the House,
they are not expected to muster enough votes to block its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del., has drafted a substantially different bill, which would
slash taxes by about $792 billion. That measure has attracted at
least some Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, which favors a far more modest tax cut on
the order of $250 billion, has threatened to veto any tax-cutting
plan the size of the Republican bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking Tuesday at a Communication Workers of America
convention in Miami, argued lawmakers should shore up Social
Security, put Medicare on a more sound financial footing and pay
off the national debt within the next 15 years before undertaking
such a huge tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is on a path to becoming debt-free, interest rates
will be lower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, emboldened by hopes of recapturing the House in
the next election and cognizant of Archer's intention to retire at
the end of next year, dismissed his tax package as a political bone
to Republican loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tax bill is not going to be signed into law,'' said Rep.
Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. ``It's not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, called the proposal ``Republican
fiscal irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, arguing for the need to reduce taxes as a way to curb
the power of the federal government, pointed to figures that
suggest the average American household stands to pay $5,300 more in
federal taxes than the government will need to pay its bills over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not right,'' Archer said. ``Americans shouldn't be
working for Washington. Washington should be working for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While many details of his tax bill have trickled out over the
last week Archer revealed plans Tuesday to eliminate the highly
unpopular marriage penalty, the aspect of the tax code that forces
many dual-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would if
they were filing as singles.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's proposal would increase the standard deduction for
married couples filing jointly from the current $7,200 a year to
$8,600. The standard deduction for married couples would then be
twice the deduction allowed for single filers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would benefit about 21 million couples, saving the
average family about $243 a year in taxes, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, however, would not just help those couples hit
by the marriage penalty _ typically those in which both partners
contribute at least 40 percent of the family income _ but any
couple taking the standard deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's office estimates 6 million families that currently
itemize would be able to simplify their tax reporting requirements
by taking the standard deduction instead.
</P>
<P>
   Roth has offered a different strategy to get rid of the marriage
penalty. His proposal would allow married taxpayers to file joint
returns as if they were single filers to dodge the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's tax package also would reduce over 10 years the capital
gains tax rate corporations pay on investments, from the current 35
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Archer proposed reducing the top capital gains rate
individuals pay from 20 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His bill also would eliminate the alternative minimum tax _ the
tax wealthier individuals and corporations with a large number of
deductions are forced to pay to ensure they send Washington at
least some cash.
</P>
<P>
   His bill also would allow employees who are currently able to
shelter up to $10,000 a year in a 401(k) savings plan to increase
that contribution to $15,000 a year.

WHITE HOUSE CAN DO LITTLE BUT WATCH PROTESTS IN IRAN
</HEADLINE>
  (With IRAN-PROTESTS) 
 ( nk ) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, fearful of the
consequences of the Iranian government crackdown on pro-democracy
student demonstrators, is worried that its muted public statements
about the protests have been twisted to the benefit of Islamic
hard-liners, administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had hoped that the demonstrations would
strengthen the hand of Iran's popular reformist leader, President
Mohammad Khatami, by making clear the public's support for
democracy and the rule of law, these officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But with reports Tuesday night that the government had placed
thousands of armed troops and police on the chaotic streets of
Tehran and that street battles were raging through the capital,
there was fear at the White House and the State Department that
diehard Islamic revolutionaries may have the upper hand, and that
the democratic movement could face a severe setback.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also worried that the crackdown would undermine
hopes of improved relations between the United States and Iran, a
goal of the Clinton administration since Khatami was elected
president two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They said Khatami also appeared to be alarmed by the possibility
that the protests had spun out of control. In a televised statement
Tuesday night, he warned that he would use force to end the
demonstrations, even though many of the protesting students are
among his most passionate supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much we can do but sit back and watch this
unfold,'' said a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we have little ability any more to monitor
what's happening on the ground or influence events in Iran,'' he
said. ``And any time we open our mouths about Iran, the hard-liners
seize on it as evidence that we're trying to interfere with their
domestic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that a
clear American statement of support for the goals of the students
``would simply backfire on them'' by empowering their extremist
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Since the students took to the streets last week, the Clinton
administration has said little about the protests beyond making
boilerplate statements of support for the concepts of freedom of
speech and peaceful assembly, and urging Iran not to use force
against the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear that we are concerned by the use of
violence to put down demonstrations by Iranian students in support
of freedom of expression and democratic values and the rule of
law,'' said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``And we
regret the injuries, the loss of life, and call for the respect of
international human rights standards.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin was adamant in denying any suggestion that the United
States was trying to encourage the demonstrators, who have joined
in protests in at least 18 cities and towns throughout Iran.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was ``utter nonsense'' to suggest that the United
States was behind the protests in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Even the limited American comments about the situation _ and
similar statements by the Israeli government _ have drawn official
protests in Iran. In Tehran on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Iranian
Foreign Ministry called ``the statements made by officials of the
U.S. and the Zionist regime'' ``examples of interference in Iran's
internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Murphy of the Council on Foreign Relations, a former
U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Syria, said the Clinton
administration is best advised to say nothing about the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should keep our mouths shut,'' he said. ``What can we
contribute?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iranians are making very clear through the students their
unhappiness with the way the regime has conducted itself,'' he
said. ``And unfortunately, given the twists and turns of
U.S.-Iranian relations, anything we say is going to be twisted by
elements in the regime who want to say that the demonstrations are
the work of a foreign hand. Even the most innocuous statement gives
those elements credibility.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seven months before the first votes are cast, two
Republican presidential candidates are dropping out because of Gov.
George W. Bush's dominance of the race.
</P>
<P>
   One, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, faced with the reality that his
campaign had not taken off, seems ready and willing to embrace
Bush's success. The nine-term lawmaker will formally withdraw on
Wednesday and endorse Bush, Republican officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the other, Sen. Robert Smith of N.H., excoriated the
Republicans, saying they had become too willing to compromise their
principles in pursuit of victory. He announced that he was leaving
the Republican Party and would run for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Both are staunch conservatives and both are getting more
attention by pulling out of the race and going their separate ways
than they ever did while in it. The contrasting decisions, from two
long-shot candidates who had been struggling in single digits in
the polls, go to the heart of the turmoil within the G.O.P. to
regain control of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The development leaves 10 Republicans vying for their party's
nomination: Bush, the governor of Texas; Sen. John McCain of
Arizona; Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the Red Cross; former
Vice President Dan Quayle; Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah; Lamar
Alexander, a former education secretary; Steve Forbes, a
multimillionaire publisher; Alan Keyes, a former diplomat; Gary
Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council; and Patrick
Buchanan, the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush solidified his claim as the front-runner in the race nearly
two weeks ago with record fund-raising of more than $36 million for
the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee for the past five
years, has wielded enormous influence over the spending cuts
championed by Republicans, as well as their plan to balance the
budget. He had hoped to run a populist campaign built on a
foundation of fiscal responsibility, but could not keep pace
financially with Bush, Republican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich has clashed with fellow Republicans before, notably over
how to balance tax cuts and reductions in the federal deficit. But
as his own presidential dream faded, he became a loyal foot soldier
and took up Bush's banner, Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman and his campaign aides declined to comment
Tuesday, waiting until Kasich's formal announcement on Wednesday,
first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Washington, the second
occurring with Bush at his side.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's bolt from the Republican Party, most likely to seek
the nomination of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, underscores how
third-party candidacies have gained momentum in recent weeks among
conservatives who accuse Bush and party officials of failing to be
sufficiently conservative on issues like gun control, abortion and
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to clean out the pollsters and the consultants and the
spin doctors and the bloated staffs who tell us what to say, how to
say it, when to say it and how long to say it,'' Smith said in a
nearly hour-long speech on the Senate floor. His comments drew only
about a dozen Republican senators and a smattering of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has also been considering a third-party run, said,
``When a man as conservative and principled as Bob Smith walks away
from the Republican Party, perhaps the problem is not with Senator
Smith but with the Republican establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican Party's national chairman, and
other top party officials fear that third-party candidates, even
those attracting only negligible support, could still siphon off
precious votes from the Republican nominee in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nicholson criticized Smith's plans and urged him to
stay, saying in a letter that his decision was shortsighted and
would only help Vice President Al Gore, ``the most extreme liberal
in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Smith's chairmanship of the Senate Ethics
Committee and his seniority in the Senate Republican hierarchy
seemed imperiled. ``It'd be very hard to be running with another
party label and chairing a committee at the same time,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told reporters Tuesday afternoon: ``I'm prepared for
whatever judgment is handed to me. I'm not a Republican any
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But by late Tuesday, the momentum was shifting his way. Angered
by Nicholson's biting remarks and worried that stripping Smith's
chairmanship would seem vindictive and divide the party further,
Senate Republicans supported Smith's political perks even as they
assailed his political decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're not the party of punishment,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. Moments later, Lott backed off his earlier remarks, joking
how difficult it was to get senators to join the Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, few Senate Republicans who back Bush saw Smith as a
serious threat _ regardless of his party label. ``George Bush is
conservative enough for 99 percent of our party,'' said Sen. Gordon
Smith of Oregon. ``For every vote you chase at that end of our
spectrum, you'll lose two at the center.''

THE MP3 REVOLUTION: GETTING WITH IT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a year ago, writing an article about MP3 meant going into
elaborate detail in defining the technology.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the term _ shorthand for the 1992 formula used to
compress audio into manageable, easy-to-share computer files _ had
been mentioned in only four articles in this newspaper; since then,
it has been mentioned in more than 85, becoming a part of the
entertainment vocabulary almost as quickly as the name Lewinsky
became part of the political one.
</P>
<P>
   But in the many media reports about the record industry's
crackdown on the proliferation of illicit MP3s, the more
copyright-friendly alternatives being developed behind closed doors
and the many trumpeted agreements between recording labels,
technology companies and Internet start-ups, what has been
consistently overlooked _ even in the new MP3 issue of Wired
magazine _ is the message of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the future, but now: most of the recent controversy about
on-line music has been over how it is going to change the
experience of selling and purchasing music, but much more
interesting is the question of how it is changing our experience of
listening to and handling the music.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to music on the Internet is not simply a novel
alternative to CD players or a way to use the computer as a
separate but equal stereo system. Nor is it an opportunity to level
the playing field _ as utopians like to dream _ and allow all
musicians, great and small, access to all listeners mainstream and
marginal.
</P>
<P>
   It is a key to unlocking the restrictions that all audio storage
media before them have posed to musicians and fans. The CD was a
medium similar enough to a record that one could still call it an
album without being corrected. But with the Internet, the idea of
the album is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the CD did wreak its own changes, and not just in
the acoustic differences between analog and digital sound. Making
an album no longer meant coming up with 45 minutes of music,
conceptualized into two sets of five or so songs, each side
self-sufficient enough to stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it meant coming up with 60 to 70-something minutes of
songs, arranging them in a long ebb and flow and then maybe
throwing on a few leftover scraps as bonuses at the end. Creating
memorable artwork was no longer done in the painterly
two-dimensional space of an album cover or a gatefold sleeve, but
in the sculptural three-dimensional package and the choice of
materials used.
</P>
<P>
   And listening was a completely new experience: no longer were we
beholden to the flipping of sides every 22 minutes, but we could
put five or a hundred CDs into a player and shuffle and rearrange
the track order _ or just hit random and let the technology decide.
</P>
<P>
   As a musical format, the Internet is a much cooler medium. It
enables users to have multiple sound systems, to watch visual
displays synchronized to the music, to talk to other people
listening to the same Internet radio station, to make compilations
of favorite songs with a few mouse clicks, to e-mail a song to a
disk jockey to play, and to put a CD into a computer and, with the
click of a button, access digital liner notes.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on and on, and this is only the beginning of
the medium's evolution. With those who originally created much of
these capabilities falling prey to new industry regulations,
lawsuits and takeovers, it may also be the medium's creative summit
as well.
</P>
<P>
   With faster and better-sounding alternatives already available
or in development, there is little doubt that MP3 _ developed by a
multinational committee as an open standard free to anyone _ is a
transitional format. But it is MP3 that has the versatility and
added functions that make it more forward-looking than its more
proprietary corporate rivals developed by Real Networks, Liquid
Audio, Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the financial implications, the biggest change on-line
music distribution brings to those who make music is that it frees
them from the constraints of a platter, disk or cassette that holds
limited information and costs money and time to manufacture and
ship. A new studio recording could be a 3-minute song or a 24-hour
music cycle intended to accompany the listener throughout an entire
day.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions made by bands in the on-line world no longer
involve sequencing 70 minutes of songs, but determining at what
rate new music should be released to fans and in what amount.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario is slightly futuristic, because the medium of the
Internet won't change the message of the music until it becomes the
dominant form of distributing music (or at least a new market on
par with record stores). For now we will concentrate on the
present, on the hunter-gatherer experience of using the Internet
and computer as record store, record album and stereo.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, it's best to walk you through the process. So, if
you are reading this and you own a PC with a halfway decent
Internet connection, follow the instructions below and within an
hour or two you will have a completely free state-of-the-art
Internet stereo system that might explain what an MP3 player's got
that a CD player doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, you need software to play MP3s on your PC. I'd
suggest downloading two software players, Winamp (www.winamp.com)
and Sonique (www.sonique.com). The Winamp is the most commonly used
MP3 player, and many of the most interesting free MP3 programs on
the Internet are only compatible with Winamp; Sonique is more
self-contained, easier to operate and beautifully designed in
adjustable sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to a stereo, in addition to playing songs, both offer a
wide-band graphic equalizer, the shuffle capabilities of a CD
player, VU meters and spectrum analyzers, volume and balance
controls, and, in the case of Sonique, pitch control so that you
can change the speed of the song being played.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you'll want to download what are called skins and
plug-ins, most of them created not by entrepreneurs but by random
computer users as young as 11 years old. Skins are faceplates that
cover your MP3 player like masks, creating a visual appearance of
your choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds to choose from, and you can switch between
them as often as you want: you can have a Star Wars MP3 player, a
Britney Spears one, a wooden-looking stereo, a high-tech interface,
or you can scan your favorite image, design a skin yourself and
e-mail it to Winamp or Sonique for other MP3 users to download.
</P>
<P>
   Plug-ins are more exciting supplemental programs, ways to
personalize and soup up your MP3 player. The best of these allow
you to operate your Winamp with a remote control, add effects like
reverb to the music, search for and display song lyrics as you
listen, or match the beats on two different MP3 files and mix them
together like a D.J.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the visual plug-ins, the Internet equivalent of
cover art. These are programs in which waves, fractals, wallpaper
patterns, animated characters and all kinds of images dance and
morph on your computer screen in response to the rhythm, amplitude
and frequencies of a song as it's being played.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a fully loaded MP3 player brimming with skins and
plug-ins, you'll need music. A number of search engines capable of
scouring the Web for MP3 files have been built.
</P>
<P>
   These include mp3.lycos.com, www.audiofind.com,
www.audioseek.com or the mega-search engine www.palavista.com,
which tend not to differentiate between legitimate sites and
fly-by-night pirates and thus often lead to dead ends.
</P>
<P>
   For beginners, it's better to start at www.scour.net or the
newer www.listen.com, both of which have limited but very reliable
archives of legal music. If you can't find what you're looking for
at any of these sites, you can always go to the newsgroup
alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.requests and post a message naming the
album or song you're looking for and chances are someone will post
it for you within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Often an easier alternative to downloading music is streaming
music, or listening to music live in real time. This is the
province of Internet radio stations, which, in a medium as
democratic as the Web, are about as numerous as Internet radio
listeners. (All you have to do to start broadcasting is download a
special Winamp plug-in from www.shoutcast.com). There are a number
of good sites housing hundreds of radio stations, chief among them
www.shoutcast.com and icecast.linuxpower.org.
</P>
<P>
   But to better appreciate the advantage Internet radio has over
college radio stations, go to www.mp3spy.com and download the
program MP3spy. Once loaded, MP3spy will arrange Internet radio
stations by genre and let you know what song is playing, how many
people are listening and the quality of the transmission. While
listening, not only can you talk with other listeners and the D.J.,
but you can also send the disk jockey songs to play.
</P>
<P>
   To send your favorite songs to a D.J., you'll need the next
component of your Internet stereo system: the ``record'' button,
also known as the CD ripper, which enables you to turn CDs (or
records or cassettes or random noise recorded into a microphone)
into MP3 files. The best of these also serve as CD players and
jukeboxes, searching the Web as soon as you insert a CD and letting
you know the track sequence and recording notes.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are many of these programs, one favorite is
Musicmatch 4.0 (at www.musicmatch.com). Most users prefer to make
MP3 files from Real Audio's very quick, versatile and efficient
Real Jukebox. But one problem with Real Audio software is that it
is a bully, always trying to kick all other music software off your
desktop and then pop up at the ready whenever your computer starts
to do anything vaguely musical.
</P>
<P>
   So, with your MP3 player, your skins and plug-ins, your CD
ripper and your Internet radio connections, what have you learned?
Beside the fact that integrating the pieces of your MP3 software
and developing a system for downloading music and maintaining a
playlist can be a nuisance akin to finding the jewel boxes for the
disks in a 100-CD changer, you've learned that there is a whole
universe that already exists on line built around the MP3.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a world of pirated music, as the record industry would
have you believe, but one in which you can choose and design the
look and feel of your music player, the lengths and types of
compilations you want to make for yourself, and the interactive
visuals that accompany the sound.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the main difference between the MP3 and the CD is not
that the music is on line instead of in stores, it's that the MP3
is not packaged, perfected and made easy to use by an industry
before being given to consumers. The technology is open-ended and
evolving, which means that the message is that the medium is putty
and, for now, as a listener you can mold it in any way you want.

 &HT;    GOP PREVAILS ON 'PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS' AMENDMENTS
 &HT;    630&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans prevailed on largely party-line votes
Tuesday as the Senate began voting on amendments to legislation
regulating health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, which seemed to indicate that a GOP version of the
``patients' bill of rights'' legislation would be approved later
this week, prompted Democrats to charge that the bill would only
protect insurance companies and managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on more amendments is scheduled to continue Wednesday and
be completed late Thursday, when Republicans will have an
opportunity to offer their own substitute bill for a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told
reporters Tuesday that the final substitute could differ from a
Republican-sponsored version approved on a party-line committee
vote in March. The spokesman did not indicate what changes might be
made to the GOP version.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton joined Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and a group of health organization
leaders in attacking the Republican bill at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP bill ``is watered down, it is nowhere near
what the American people deserve or need. Not only does it offer
merely toothless and half-hearted protections, it fails to protect
all Americans in managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements Tuesday focused on whether health care decisions
would ultimately be controlled by doctors or insurers and on how
much tighter regulation would increase insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats claimed that a recent Congressional
Budget Office study indicated their version would raise insurance
premiums by less than $2 a month, but Republicans argued that the
same study predicted premiums would jump more than 6 percent and
cause more than 1.8 million people to lose or be denied health
insurance when the bill was fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Offering an amendment that would block the Democratic bill,
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., proposed that if
premiums increased by more than 1 percent or the number of
uninsured people increased by more than 100,000 when the bill was
fully implemented, its provisions would be suspended. That
amendment was adopted 52-48 with three GOP senators _ John Chafee,
R-R.I., Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., _
joining the unanimous Democrats in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter partisan debate was highlighted on the first
amendment offered. The Senate rejected, 48-52, a Democratic
proposal to allow women to designate their
obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care doctor and allow
women to remain in the hospital as long as their doctor recommended
after a mastectomy. Chafee, Specter and Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
joined the unanimous Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Several female Democratic senators angrily denounced the vote as
an affront to women and a display of insensitivity to their special
health needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we saw what compassionate conservatism pretends to be.
It's not compassionate, but it is conservative,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman, I'm angered and appalled,'' said Sen. Patty
Murray, D-Wash. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said virtually every
woman over the age of puberty ``knows that an ob/gyn is their
primary care physician.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also rejected, 47-53, an amendment by Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., that would have require insurers and HMOs to cover
patients who sought care in an emergency room if they had a
reasonable belief that their life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the amendment was flawed
because it would have required insurers to cover post-stabilization
care not related to the cause of emergency treatment. Chafee and
Specter joined the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Senate adopted two Republican amendments over unanimous
Democratic objections.
</P>
<P>
   On a 52-48 vote the Senate approved a GOP plan for creating
external and internal panels to consider appeals from patients if
an HMO denied coverage or treatment. Democrats argued that the
amendment did not go far enough because it would base appeals on
HMO definitions of what treatments were medically necessary.
Chafee, Fitzgerald and Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., joined the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On a 53-47 vote, the Senate approved an amendment to provide
full tax deductibility of insurance premiums by the self-employed.
Democrats argued that they already had supported a similar
amendment but noted that the GOP proposal would reduce the number
of Americans covered by the Patient's Bill of Rights. They argued
that most HMO patients would not be covered by the bill under the
GOP amendment. Chafee and Specter joined the Democrats.

 &HT;    Police learn more about Atlanta massacre
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and Tinah Saunders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 11 years old, Santonio Lucas has already seen a
lifetime of misery and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, rustled out of bed in his southwest Atlanta home
by his mother's boyfriend, the youngster was forced to watch the
murders of his mother, aunt and four siblings. Yanked by the neck,
Santonio was dragged from one room to another, while Cyrano Marks,
the man he knew as ``stepdad,'' shot each one of the sixth-grader's
family members in the head, Atlanta police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Santonio was able to escape the killer's grasp briefly and run
into a closet. But Marks found him, placed a pillow over the
terrified child's face and attempted to fire a bullet from a 9mm
semiautomatic pistol into the boy's head, said Atlanta Deputy Chief
C.B. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the gun didn't go off,'' Jackson said.
``Marks stepped back and tried to shoot again. This time the gun
worked and the bullet hit Santonio on the elbow. At that point the
child dropped down and pretended to be dead. Marks left him in the
closet and a few minutes later shot and killed himself.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, Santonio's mother, Deleane Briskey, 33,
and his aunt Essie Hugeley, 36, were dead. Also murdered were
Santonio's brothers and sisters David Antonio Lucas, 13; Craig
DeCarlo Briskey, 15; Antione DeAndre Lucas, 9; and Torsha Briskey,
16.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned of the carnage only after Santonio crawled out of
the closet where he hid, climbed over the bodies of his family and
ran to a neighbor's home.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent eight hours in the cramped space in a fetal
position, wondering when it would be safe to go for help.
</P>
<P>
   Police are still trying to determine why Marks, who dated
Briskey, woke up Santonio's family at about 6:15 a.m. Monday,
herded them into the master bedroom and announced he was going to
kill them, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also are trying to discern why Marks, 39, chose
Santonio as his human shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying not to press this child because he's been
through too much,'' Jackson said Tuesday. ``But everything we know
is coming from this boy. He was the only survivor and we're talking
to him slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police were not strangers to Briskey's home.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years officers had gone there for
domestic-related problems, Jackson said. But most of the time the
agressor was not Marks, but Briskey's former husband David Lucas.
Reports show Lucas sparked arguments at the house because he often
showed up unannounced to vist Santonio and his siblings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Clayton County police however, Marks had troubles
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1989, he was arrested and charged with the murder of
a Delta Airlines employee. The victim was hit in the back of the
head with an object police were never able to identify. A
description of a vehicle was traced to Marks and police learned his
name from people at the scene in the victim's apartment. But a
magistrate court decided evidence was insufficient and the case
never reached the Clayton County District Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   News of the murders saddened many at the schools where the
Briskey and Lucas children attended classes.
</P>
<P>
   Antione DeAndre was supposed to start the third grade at Miles
Elementary School this fall. While his brother David was to enter
eighth grade at Usher Middle School. Craig was going into the 10th
grade at South Atlanta High School and Torsha was a student at Mays
High School, where she was going into the 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Santonio, who turns 12 next week, is expected to enter the
seventh grade at Usher and his sister Jalisa Denise Lucas, 10, who
was not at home at the time of the shooting, will be in the fifth
grade at Miles .
</P>
<P>
   Antione was proud of himself because he had learned to read,
said his teacher Angela Daniels. She said the boy ``couldn't read a
lick'' when she started working with him daily in second grade. The
child was so excited about learning that he did extra work at home,
and by the end of second grade he could read, Daniels said. He
repeated second grade this past school year, but he would always
report to his former teacher: ``Miss Daniels, I can read real well
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very eager and very excited about learning to read,''
said Daniels, who was also Santonio's fourth grade teacher. ``He
appeared to be happy-go-lucky, always smiling. He always had a big
grin on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalisa, decsribed as an active student, is in Miles' gifted
program and in the school's modern dance group, Principal Gwendolyn
Mayfield said. Their mother kept in regular contact with the
school, Mayfield said. Daniels said all three of the Lucas children
were ``mannerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miles school community has been hit hard by the tragedy,
Mayfield said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the teachers have been calling or coming by,'' Mayfield
said. ``They just need to talk and determine what kinds of things
we need to do to assist the family members.''
</P>
<P>
   The older children held jobs as well as keeping up with their
schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags Over Georgia officials said Torsha worked at the theme
park's Sweetwater Falls attraction. Her brother Craig resigned
earlier this month, apparently because of a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, members of Santonio's family gathered at the home of of
Lovie Moten, the boy's maternal grandmother. The massive clan,
aunts, uncles, cousins, other grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, spilled out onto Moten's lawn and driveway.
They were alternately solemn and then smiling as they recalled
happy family memories.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Briskey Bailey, 28, the youngest sister of the two
murdered women, showed off the braids Deleane Briskey had done for
her Saturday night. Another relative, Mattie Pearl Briskey, shook
her head as she told how she learned of the shooting from
television _ ``just like everyone else. It hurt, it really hurt,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the familial chatter, laughter and tears, Moten,
remained calm, her smooth, unwrinkled face serene, because she
claimed she had done all her crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only hope they didn't hurt too much,'' Moten said. ``They
were probably scared for a minute when they knew something bad was
going to happen, but it all happened so quickly they probably
didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong faith in God carried her through, Moten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know Jesus, I would be totally destroyed. But I do
know Him and I know it's a better place for the children. I know
I'll see them again one day.''
</P>
<P>
   A trust fund has been established at NationsBank to help pay for
funeral arrangements for Briskey, Hugeley and the four children,
police said. For information contact the city's office of community
affairs at 404-330-6023.

U.S. ASKING TAIWAN TO EXPLAIN INDEPENDENCE STATEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Startled by the sudden declaration by Taiwan that
it no longer stood by the ``one China'' policy that has been the
pillar of stability between China and Taiwan, the Clinton
administration said Tuesday that it was urgently seeking an
explanation from the Taiwanese leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American official in Taiwan, Darryl Johnson, is
scheduled to meet on Wednesday with President Lee Teng-hui, who
outlined the switch in policy over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that Johnson planned to stress
in the meeting that the United States considered Lee's move away
from the one-China policy ``unhelpful'' and that he would ask for
specific clarifications.
</P>
<P>
   Lee stopped short of making a declaration of independence for
Taiwan, but said from now on Taiwan would treat contacts with China
as ``state-to-state'' relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such special nation-to-nation relations,'' he said,
``there is no longer any need to declare Taiwanese independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's statement could be interpreted in one of two ways, the
State Department official said. Either Lee, the first
Taiwanese-born president of Taiwan, was stating a ``new reality''
or he was repeating a version of what he had said before.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the State Department believed that Lee still
favored the eventual reunification of Taiwan and the mainland, but
that Taiwan also wanted to be treated as a ``sovereign state,'' and
not a renegade province, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the terms used in describing the ``one-China'' policy
often seem a matter of semantics to outsiders, the words mean
everything in China and Taiwan and for U.S. policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has been at the heart of the U.S. posture toward
mainland China since 1972. Taiwan's shift from that long-held
position occurs at a low point in Washington-Beijing relations and
threatens to sour the atmosphere further.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is at odds with Beijing on a number of issues,
including negotiations over China's desire to join the World Trade
Organization, a subject that remains at an impasse, and the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in the
Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   American officials noted Tuesday that both issues touched the
question of sovereignty, which is at the center of the differences
between Taiwan and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a major dispute over the sovereignty of Taiwan was bound
to irritate further Beijing's attitude to the stalled talks over
its admission to the trade organization, which regulates global
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to increase the pressure on the United States to
try and smooth the way for getting China into the trade group,''
said Robert Suettinger, a China specialist who was on the National
Security Council under Clinton and is a senior analyst at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO intervention in Kosovo was bitterly opposed by the
Beijing government on the grounds that it represented interference
in a sovereign country. The accidental embassy bombing served only
to worsen Beijing's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   With the administration's relations with Beijing at a near
nadir, the statement by Lee was highly likely to encourage Taiwan's
allies in Congress to push legislation to authorize the sale of
more sophisticated weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings on the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, sponsored by
Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Robert Toricelli, D-N.J., are
scheduled for early next month, and the legislation may well be
pushed along if relations with Beijing continue to plummet,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Washington dropped its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
and opened an embassy in Beijing. The ``one-China'' policy,
supported by the United States and reiterated by Clinton on his
trip to mainland China last summer, allows Washington to support
Taiwan but recognize Beijing as the capital of China.
</P>
<P>
   In reiterating the policy, Clinton said it was up to the people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve the relationship
between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has encouraged talks between Beijing and
Taipei. But officials said Taiwan's new pronouncements might dash
hopes for talks that had appeared likely toward the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Communist government of mainland China regards
Taiwan as a renegade province that broke away when the Chinese
National Party and its supporters fled to the island after their
defeat by the Communists 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the mainland China-Taiwan friction so volatile is the
refusal by Beijing to rule out the use of force if Taiwan insists
on independence. The last time that Lee used new definitions with
China, in 1996, Beijing showed its anger by testing missiles and
holding war games in the Taiwan Strait.

REHEARING SZELL: INTENSITY WITHOUT PONDEROUSNESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when so many orchestras and conductors are changing
partners, it is good to be reminded of the artistic benefits of
retaining a long-term maestro. One such reminder comes in the form
of a Sony Classical reissue of two classic recordings by the
Cleveland Orchestra under the direction of George Szell:
Prokofiev's Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1959, and Bartok's Concerto
for Orchestra, recorded in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   These performances may not induce discophiles to part with their
version of the Prokofiev by Herbert von Karajan or of the Bartok by
Fritz Reiner, but both offer orchestral playing of breathtaking
refinement while challenging the notion that Szell was a dour
taskmaster and an interpretive literalist.
</P>
<P>
   Composed during World War II, the Prokofiev and Bartok works
have remained popular for more than 50 years because of their
powerful expression, each in its own way, of wartime anxiety,
despair, humor and hope, although routine performances often reduce
both to generic applause generators.
</P>
<P>
   Szell treated both pieces with the interpretive respect he more
famously gave to Mozart. Not that his respect kept him from a bit
of creative tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   The two performances (Masterworks Heritage MHK 63124; CD)
display the Cleveland hallmark: a level of ensemble usually found
only in the greatest string quartets. The flawless but never
soulless execution of phrasing and dynamics is perhaps most obvious
in the Bartok, which spotlights one section of the orchestra after
another.
</P>
<P>
   But the thickly scored Prokofiev symphony occasions an even more
impressive exercise of orchestral ESP. Throughout the symphony,
Prokofiev scores melodic lines for players in different, often
physically distant instrumental families.
</P>
<P>
   These organlike mixed colors are essential to the dark, brooding
character of the first movement as well as to the triumphant close
of the last, but they can be destroyed by the slightest degree of
a-synchrony. Here the instrumental colors fuse perfectly, as the
musicians show the utmost care in intonation, balance and the
shaping of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Prokofiev's Fifth abounds in notational ambiguities and, for all
its epic scope, often feels like an improvisation. The opening
movement is marked Andante, but the metronome mark of 48 suggests
adagio, or slower. The contrasting theme of this movement feels as
though it wants to go faster than the opening, but how much?
Prokofiev says only ``poco piu mosso'': a little faster.
</P>
<P>
   Karajan (on Deutsche Grammophon) begins very slowly, lending the
opening a portentous gravity that exerts its pull even as the tempo
quickens. Szell's faster, lighter opening gives little indication
of the drama to come; instead, it serves to start the musical line
in motion, setting up a momentum that becomes ever more propulsive
as the movement unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   When the tightly controlled rhythmic tension is finally
released, at the end of the second and fourth movements, the
performance achieves a heart-pounding state of exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   Szell is often termed a Classicist, but that does not mean that
he was a miniaturist. His control of the musical line, which made
him an eminent Mozartean, also produced some of the greatest
performances of late Romantic repertory, like the Cleveland
Orchestra's renditions of Strauss' ``Death and Transfiguration''
and Mahler's Sixth Symphony (both available in inexpensive reissues
from Sony Classical). This Prokofiev Fifth is no less impressive as
a model of intensity without ponderousness, the Szell-Cleveland
style.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bartok, Szell's approach is again idiosyncratic and, at
one crucial point, seemingly perverse. As its name implies, the
Concerto for Orchestra is full of solos for nearly every
instrument, and Szell, functioning like an opera conductor, often
sets a tempo slower than expected, allowing the players to shape
their solos; listen to the wistful tenderness of the flute solo at
the opening, played by Maurice Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Szell holds back the tempo for the big brass fanfare in this
movement, a passage that often sounds like background music for an
army recruitment movie, so that you can hear each player's
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Even more divergent from other performances is the fugato of the
finale, which Szell takes much slower than normal, bringing out the
peasant humor of its hen-scratch repeated notes. Then he indulges
his interpretive license with a cut that may sour this performance
for some listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Bartok's finale seems to end several times, and indeed, the
score offers two alternative conclusions. Szell evidently felt that
the problem was not the ending itself but a penultimate passage,
which he skips. His excision is shocking the first time you hear
it, but it has a harmonic logic that becomes convincing; the
fourfold repeat of a phrase before the cut, on the other hand, is
clumsy and un-Bartokian. Even Homer nods, and so did even George
Szell.
</P>
<P>
   The album notes relate a story that at once confirms and
challenges the standard picture of Szell's forbidding personality.
Cloyd Duff, the Cleveland Orchestra's legendary timpanist, recounts
that before recording the Bartok, Szell called him up and said,
``Cloyd, I want you to play that snare-drum part.''
</P>
<P>
   A snare-drum solo opens and closes the second movement. Duff
pointed out to Szell that he would be stepping on the toes of the
other percussionists, but Szell insisted that only Duff had the

</P>
<P>
   The story illustrates Szell's fanatical concern for musical
detail, if not for human feelings, but it is also the first account
I have heard in which Szell called an orchestral player by his
first name. Perhaps he wasn't quite the monster he was made out to
be. With performances like these, listeners may not care.

TOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN PREDICTS DEAL ON NEW LIMITS ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After lying idle for nearly a month, gun-control
legislation drew renewed attention from House Republicans and
Democrats on Tuesday, with one leading House Republican predicting
that House and Senate negotiators would agree on several new
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, said that despite
the defeat of a gun-control package in the House last month, the
measures in that package that had drawn broad support were likely
to be part of the compromise legislation forged by the committee
that reconciles the House and Senate's separate juvenile crime
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' DeLay said. ``You can't ignore amendments that
got 300-plus votes.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay was referring to provisions like the one requiring that
child safety devices be included with all handguns sold by
federally licensed dealers, a ban on the importation of
high-capacity ammunition clips and new restrictions for the
possession of semi-automatic weapons by those under 18.
</P>
<P>
   All proved to be relatively noncontroversial in the gun-control
debate in the House in June and passed decisively. But they died
with the overall gun-control package, which Democrats almost
solidly opposed, on the ground that it was significantly weaker
than the package that passed the Senate and even relaxed a few
aspects of current law.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's comments, which echoed similar remarks by House Speaker
Dennis Hastert earlier this month, made clear that the ultimate
absence of gun control in the House's juvenile crime bill did not
doom the inclusion of gun control in whatever comes out of the
House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of whatever gun-control legislation that committee
winds up drafting remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, while House Republican leaders said on Tuesday
that they would appoint lawmakers from their chamber to the
conference committee by the end of the week, Senate Republican
leaders were still trying to figure out how to deal with a threat
by Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire to mount a kind of filibuster
against the appointment of conferees from that chamber. Smith, who
renounced his Republican affiliation on the Senate floor on
Tuesday, is an ardent opponent of gun control and a candidate for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Democratic and Republican advocates of gun control
in both chambers might decide to oppose the committee's compromise
legislation if its language, like the final gun-control package in
the House, embraced only relatively noncontroversial measures.
</P>
<P>
   These advocates are particularly committed to a provision _
approved by the Senate but defeated in the House _ that institutes
mandatory background checks on all customers at gun shows and gives
dealers as many as three business days to get the results of those
checks before completing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., tried on Tuesday to attach that
measure as an amendment to a spending bill before the House
Appropriations Committee, but in a decision that split largely
along party lines, his amendment was defeated, with 24 members for
it and 35 voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected, by votes of 24 to 34, amendments by
Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., and Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., that would have
banned the import of high-capacity ammunition clips and required
the sale of child safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were trying to attach these measures to a
spending bill because Republican leaders were still dragging their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel so passionately that this is an opportunity to save
lives,'' Ms. Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of Republicans on the committee, many of whom
had voted for the child safety device measure on the House floor,
opposed it and the other amendments on Tuesday, saying the addition
of gun control to an unrelated spending bill was inappropriate.

RESENDEZ-RAMIREZ WENT FROM `MINOR CRIMINAL ... TO WHERE HE IS
TODAY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ From an unremarkable beginning, Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez evolved into an international fugitive whose
suspected crimes near rail lines changed the way people went to bed
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Born Angel Leoncio Reyes-Resendiz on Aug. 1, 1959, in the
Mexican state of Puebla, Resendez-Ramirez was raised by an uncle
whose name he is now known by. It is one of 30 aliases he has used
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the Mexican state of Durango when his mother married
a soldier in the Mexican army. He was his mother's favorite child,
her ``beautiful little baby.'' Friends and family, including his
common-law wife, said after he became a suspect that they could not
believe he was capable of murder.
</P>
<P>
   But from an early age, Resendez-Ramirez spent most of his life
as a petty criminal. He frequently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border
illegally beginning on Aug. 31, 1976, when he was arrested by U.S.
border agents in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   The last reported arrest came June 1, when he was arrested by
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in Santa Teresa,
N.M. By then, he had already been linked to three slayings, but
unaware U.S. officials deported him to Ciudad Juarez, across the
border from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, police say, Resendez-Ramirez would return to
the United States and claim his fifth victim. Hours later, he would
take his sixth. Before the month ended, he would be included on the
FBI's Ten Most Wanted list and be the subject of an intense
manhunt. Thus far, Resendez-Ramirez has been linked to at least
eight slayings in three states.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not linked Resendez-Ramirez to any killings
prior to 1997. And what has remained puzzling about the once
elusive serial killer is why, after 20 years in and out of jail for
nonviolent crimes, Resendez-Ramirez would begin to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the impression that he was a minor criminal, and I don't
know when he made the transition to where he is today,'' said
Georges Scott, spokesman for the New Mexico Department of
Corrections, where Resendez served six months for a March 1992
burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez has traveled coast-to-coast, from Seattle to
Miami and San Bernardino, Calif., to South Burlington, Vt. He
mainly traveled by freight trains like a hobo.
</P>
<P>
   He told his wife, the mother of their 3-month-old daughter, that
he picked oranges in Florida, asparagus in Washington and tobacco
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is known as Angel Maturino Recendez in Rodeo,
Durango, where he moved with his family in the 1990s. Those who
know him in Rodeo describe him as quiet and introverted. They say
he likes dogs, that he often shows up driving late-model cars that
he gives to relatives or sells.
</P>
<P>
   But as Resendez-Ramirez, authorities say, the serial killer
wasn't commonly known until the Dec. 17 slaying of Dr. Claudia
Benton of West University Place, an affluent enclave of Houston. He
was linked to the slaying by a fingerprint found on a steering
column broken off the victim's Jeep Cherokee and lying on the
garage floor.
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently was linked to four more deaths in Texas, two in
Illinois and another in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez was arrested in Miami in 1979 for breaking into
a house and beating the homeowner while attempting to steal his car
keys. He was tried for burglary, aggravated battery and grand
theft, and received a 20-year sentence. He was released in 1985
from a facility in Glades, Fla., after serving sentences in a
series of Florida prisons.
</P>
<P>
   His criminal career continued.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release from the Western New Mexico Correctional
Facility in Grants, N.M., on April 30, 1993, Resendez-Ramirez would
be arrested twice more: five weeks later in Carson County, not far
from Amarillo, by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper; and
on Aug. 19, 1995, in San Bernardino, Calif., by Santa Fe Railroad
police for trespassing and carrying a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   After he was supposedly spotted a month ago in a Louisville,
Ky., homeless shelter, Resendez-Ramirez disappeared.

SERB ON `WANTED' LISTS SUGGESTS ASYLUM IN BELGIUM BUT IS REBUFFED
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Serbian paramilitary leader Arkan has made inquiries
about whether he would be safe from arrest if he moved to Belgium,
a spokesman for the chief Belgian prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Jos Colpin, said Belgium's response was that if
Arkan were found in Belgium, he would be detained and extradited to
Germany, where there is a warrant for his arrest on criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Arkan, whose real name is Zeljko Raznjatovic, is wanted in
connection with bank robberies and other crimes in several European
countries. An international arrest warrant was also issued in
March, when the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague
announced that it had indicted him in connection with war crimes in
the Balkans in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His inquiry suggests that he may no longer feel safe in Serbia,
where there are growing signs of discontent with President Slobodan
Milosevic. Arkan is often seen in Belgrade, where he spends much of
his time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if he still has contacts with Milosevic, with
whom he cooperated closely in the fighting during the breakup of
Yugoslavia. While Arkan is protected at the moment by the Milosevic
government, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has also been indicted by the tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The two men know a great deal about each other. Arkan's armed
gang, known as the Tigers, coordinated with the Serbian secret
police and the military in Croatia and Bosnia in 1992 and his group
has been accused of some of the most vicious ethnic purges there.
There have been reports that the Tigers were also active in Kosovo
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   If Arkan moved to Belgium, he would also be subject to
extradition to the Netherlands, the seat of the tribunal. Officials
in The Hague said the militia leader had not tried to contact the
court or to seek a deal for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made no attempt whatsoever to contact us,'' said Graham
Blewitt, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor. Moreover, Blewitt said,
plea bargaining does not exist at the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to negotiate if someone is already
indicted,'' he said. ``If someone were not indicted, it might be
slightly different.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels Colpin said a lawyer there, Pierre Chome, contacted
the office of the chief prosecutor in late June to ask what the
chances were for Arkan to be allowed to live in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told there was no chance,'' Colpin said, ``that if
Arkan was found, he would be arrested. Perhaps he was just testing
the water. Perhaps he wants to turn himself in to avoid being shot
somewhere. We just don't know. We haven't heard anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   Chome could not be reached. His office said that he was on
vacation and that no one else could comment.

CLINTON TO PURSUE DISCOURAGED FOOD STAMP RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed at a precipitous drop in the food stamp
rolls, President Clinton will announce on Wednesday a major
national effort to sign up people who are eligible for such aid.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the number of people receiving food
stamps has dropped more than 35 percent, to 18.1 million this
spring, from a peak of nearly 28 million in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people leaving the welfare rolls have also lost food
stamps. Even though they are still eligible for the coupons,
stringent rules limiting eligibility for cash assistance appear to
have discouraged many people from seeking food stamps, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An Agriculture Department official said Clinton would announce a
``national education and information campaign to reach out to
potential food stamp recipients'' and help them apply for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 law gave states vast discretion to design and operate
their cash welfare programs with lump sums of federal money. State
and local officials, including New York City's welfare
commissioner, Jason Turner, have complained bitterly that they do
not have similar flexibility and freedom to run their food stamp
programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, administration officials said, Clinton will
announce several steps intended to increase access to food stamps
for the working poor, while giving states new discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, states are subject to financial penalties if they
give food stamps to someone who is later found to be ineligible.
But if a state improperly denies food stamps, the state is
generally not penalized. Therefore, state officials say, in close
cases, they have a financial incentive to reject food stamp
applications or to terminate benefits for people already receiving
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they would offer several options
to states, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ States could relax the requirement for food stamp recipients
to report an increase in the hours they work, provided they are
still working part-time for the same employer at the same hourly
wage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Households would not have to report a change in income unless
the change exceeded $100 a month. (The threshold is now $25.) Under
this option, a household with earnings of $500 a month would not
have to notify state officials unless its monthly income rose above
$600 or fell below $400.
</P>
<P>
   _ People receiving food stamps could file regular reports on
their income every three months. Under current rules, they are
supposed to report any significant change in income, but the
requirements are so complex that many people fail to comply.
</P>
<P>
   _ If every member of a household is receiving cash assistance or
other benefits financed by the new federal program of Temporary
Assistance for Needy Families, the household would be automatically
eligible for food stamps. The household would be able to get such
food aid even if it had an automobile worth more than the limit of
$4,700.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's new initiative will reduce the risk of states'
suffering financial penalties when they provide food stamps to the
working poor, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   States could, for example, liberalize requirements for food
stamp recipients to report changes in household income. This would
simplify life for state officials and for the working poor, whose
household income, on which food stamp allotments are based, often
fluctuates.
</P>
<P>
   A parent who leaves welfare and finds a job typically works 34
hours a week and earns about $6.50 an hour. A family of three with
such earnings would be eligible for food stamps worth almost $150 a
month, or nearly $1,800 a year, assuming it had moderate housing
costs.

SERB OPPOSITION LEADER NOW PLANS PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A powerful opposition politician
announced Tuesday that he would call his supporters into the
streets in an effort to topple President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic, to
mobilize members of his Serbian Renewal Movement Party was made
after weeks of abstaining from street protests. Demonstrations
associated with another opposition group have recently been held in
towns in southern and northern Serbia to protest Milosevic's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is one of the most unpredictable and mercurial
political leaders here. He has swung in the last 10 years from an
embrace of Serbian nationalism, even leading Serbian militias in
Bosnia, to calls for a Western-style democracy. He was thrown out
of Milosevic's government during the NATO bombing campaign after
public denunciations of Milosevic's leadership.

HEALTH OFFICIALS EXAMINING CLINICAL TRIALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal health investigators have begun two separate inquiries
to determine whether the rapidly changing system for clinical
trials, particularly in industry-sponsored research, properly
protects the interests of patients and other potential test
subjects, according to government officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiries, conducted by June Gibbs Brown, inspector general
of the Department of Health and Human Services, are focusing on two
areas: the recruitment practices in research sponsored by the drug
industry and the system of oversight used to detect possible fraud
by clinical investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The examinations follow drastic changes in the clinical trials
system, which in just the last decade was largely based in academic
medical institutions and conducted by professional researchers. But
it has now become a multibillion-dollar industry, with hundreds of
testing and drug companies working with thousands of private
doctors who mine their patient lists for test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into recruitment will focus on just that change,
government officials said. The inspector general's office plans to
examine the use of private doctors in research and whether that
creates any conflicts between the doctor's obligations to the
patient and responsibilities to the drug company sponsoring the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the inspector general's office will examine the
use of financial incentives to encourage doctors to speed up
patient recruitment, including payments made for each patient
signed up as a test subject and bonuses used to encourage the
recruitment of a particular number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   By conducting this inquiry, government officials said, federal
health investigators hope to identify recruiting practices that
appear questionable, to determine what guidelines exist on
recruitment and what difficulties the industry faces in recruiting
patients in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish these goals, the inspector general's office plans
to gather information several ways. Those include conducting
in-depth visits at investigative sites in three large cities,
accompanying inspectors with the Food and Drug Administration on
required reviews of both investigators and ethics boards that must
approve all human experimentation and surveying a random sample of
those boards about their concerns and experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The second inquiry is intended to determine whether there is
adequate oversight of clinical investigators who are subject to
regulation by the FDA. In particular, that study is examining
whether the FDA's authority to disqualify investigators who are
either dishonest or who fail to follow procedure is being used in a
way that properly protects participants in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these areas were examined in a series of articles that
appeared in The New York Times beginning in May.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those articles, the result of a 10-month investigation into the
modern system of drug research, described a system that is fueling
a pharmaceutical renaissance but is fraught with conflicts of
interest that patients know nothing about; that places a premium on
speed and meeting quotas; that relies on government and private
monitoring that can be easily fooled and that some researchers say
is inadequate, and that secretly offers a share of the cash to
other health professionals who may influence patients to join a
study.
</P>
<P>
   The articles also examined the case of a California doctor,
Robert Fiddes, whose research center engaged in a multiyear
research fraud that went undetected by monitors until an employee
at the center disclosed his actions. Government officials said
Fiddes was not disqualified by the FDA as a researcher until after
he was sent to prison for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after those articles appeared, the House Commerce
Committee sought a briefing from the FDA about the Fiddes case and
whether the agency made any missteps that allowed the fraud to
continue for so long, according to a May 17 letter to the FDA from
Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that briefing, the congressional committee has
also surveyed other government health agencies to determine any
reviews or activities being conducted in the area of clinical
research. On July 13, the committee sent a letter to Ms. Brown
regarding the two separate inquiries she is conducting. In the
letter, the committee asked that the inspector general's findings
be shared with Congress when the inquiries are completed. &QL;

KOSOVO DAMAGE SEEMS LESS THAN FEARED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ European and U.S. officials said Tuesday
that Kosovo appeared to be less damaged by war than they had
feared. But they refused to predict the amount of the final repair
bill or to spell out how it would be divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real standard of living is higher than the statistics
would indicate,'' Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European
Commission's head of financial and monetary affairs, said. ``The
damage to infrastructure is less than expected.''
</P>
<P>
   That optimism was cautiously supported by the new U.S. treasury
secretary, Lawrence Summers, and James Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank. The officials spoke as a new steering group assembled
to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   European nations are generally expected to take over the biggest
costs of rebuilding Kosovo and helping neighbors like Albania,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro and Romania recover from the Kosovo
conflict. Finance Minister Hans Eichel of Germany said on Monday
that the European nations anticipated spending no more than $500
million this year on Kosovo aid. A donors' conference is set for
July 28 in Sarajevo, Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have said they do not want to increase their
total foreign aid budgets, prompting World Bank officials to worry
that other countries in dire straits would be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Tuesday was the first formal attempt by Western
countries and international institutions to plan for Balkan
reconstruction. The steering group includes the finance ministers
from the seven major industrialized countries, as well as officials
from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European
Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended four weeks ago, U.S. officials have said
that European nations should take the main responsibility for
reconstruction because American planes provided most of the NATO
firepower in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have agreed with that in principle. But Silguy
said Tuesday that reliable assessments might take months to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said cities like Pristina, the capital of Kosovo,
were in considerably better shape than they had expected.
Nevertheless, tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed, most
of them owned by Kosovo Albanians and demolished by Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the European Investment Bank, Brian Unwin, said
the infrastructure remained in surprisingly good shape, adding, ``I
don't think the basic infrastructure damage in Kosovo itself is
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the fact that the war ended when it did might have
helped.
</P>
<P>
   The list of needs is formidable: a reliable banking and payment
system; laws to enforce contracts; a prerequisite for building
confidence among foreign investors, and a ``currency arrangement''
independent from the Yugoslav dinar.

 Leslie Camhi's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the Chinese director Wu Tianming.  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Benoit: bon vivant, raconteur and smalltime intellectual.
His parents are shopkeepers, his girlfriend plays the flute, and he
would be great company were he not a mass murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit is the hero of ``Man Bites Dog,'' a 1992 classic of
underground Belgian cinema. In the course of this 92-minute
pseudo-documentary, he quotes Jacques Brel and rails against the
architecture of low-cost housing while killing old people, women
and children.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Benoit manages to appear at once socially
deviant and entirely ordinary, and in this he is like many of his
cinematic compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   From the little boy who dreams of being a transvestite in Alain
Berliner's ``Ma Vie en Rose,'' to the corporate executive who
learns to enjoy life from a hitchhiker with Down's syndrome in Jaco
van Dormael's ``Eighth Day,'' to the 18th-century castrato who
longs for a satisfying relationship in Gerard Corbiau's
``Farinelli,'' to the dwarf-size legal clerk who falls in love with
a mountainous Anita Ekberg in Yvan Le Moine's ``Red Dwarf,'' these
Belgian Everymen seem afflicted with a perpetual identity crisis,
products of a deeply divided land and a national cinema that
fluctuates wildly between extremes of the mundane and the peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   This year in particular marked the triumph of the realist strain
in Belgian film, as ``Rosetta,'' directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre
Dardenne (brothers whose previous films include ``La Promesse'')
captured top honors, including the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes
International Film Festival. (While across town ``The Carriers are
Waiting,'' a comedy about a working-class family by a firsttime
Belgian director, Benoit Mariage, played to packed houses at the
Director's Fortnight, a sidebar to the main festival.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosetta,'' which will open here in the fall, uses a hand-held
camera and a cinema verite style to tell an intense moral fable
about an impoverished young girl's struggle to hold down a menial
job while maintaining shreds of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Now from the Flanders region comes ``Rosie,'' a sensitive and
provocative debut feature, directed by Patrice Toye, focusing on
the inner life of a 13-year-old girl. ``Rosie,'' which opens in New
York on Friday, begins as its eponymous heroine is being questioned
by the warden of a girls' reformatory.
</P>
<P>
   Flashbacks show her with long hair, in a ratty fake fur coat and
purple mittens, rollerskating to the dingy, gray block of
apartments where she lives with her young, single mother and where
their frequent guests include her mother's fly-by-night brother and
her numerous suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Something terrible has certainly happened: why else would Rosie
be imprisoned? But the film draws its strength from the restraint,
complexity, tenderness and assurance with which Ms. Toye approaches
her delicate material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to tell an ABC story,'' says Ms. Toye, a warm
and ebullient woman. ``You know, the kind of film where you watch
the first five minutes and you can already tell what's going to
happen. I wanted to keep some things in reserve, to make partners
of the spectators, so that they feel as vulnerable as Rosie, and as
guilty. It was a way of trying to get people into her head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie'' is set in a working-class suburb of Antwerp, a
strangely empty, colorless landscape. ``There's a weird atmosphere
in those suburbs,'' Ms. Toye says. ``Thousands live there, but it
seems so dead, because there's no life outside. There are no cafes.
There's just one supermarket. I used the neighborhood to reflect
the feelings people have in my film, the coldness and lack of
communication. Filming inside small apartments, I wanted to show
that these people don't have space, vistas, a future. When they
look at each other, their vision is cramped; they lack
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   To escape, Rosie heads for an abandoned industrial wasteland at
the outskirts of the city where she takes refuge in fantasies
spawned by romance novels and in the company of Jimi (Joost
Wijnant), a boyfriend with the looks and swagger of a teen idol.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toye, who at 32 is the first woman to direct a feature film
in Flemish, grew up in southern Belgium. ``The rest of the country
calls the people in the south dumber and sweeter,'' she explains
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   She studied filmmaking at the St. Lucas Fine Arts Academy in
Brussels and, after graduating in 1990, began making short films
and documentaries for television. For ``Rosie,'' she drew
inspiration from newspaper stories and personal experience. She was
fascinated, for example, by the case of a toddler killed by two
10-year-old boys in Liverpool in 1993. ``You wonder, were they
monsters? Where did they come from?''
</P>
<P>
   A child of divorce, Ms. Toye is familiar with the insecurities
caused by upheaval. ``What's strange,'' she notes, ``is that you
immediately understand, at the age 8 or 9, that having warmth at
home, and a place you can always go to, is not something that's a
given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosie'' also grew out of two documentaries Ms. Toye worked on,
one about 13-year-old girls and the other about young prison
inmates. ``I'm not a psychologist,'' Ms. Toye says, though she
notes that ``Rosie'' has been studied in clinical schools in
Belgium. ``I just wanted to see things from the child's
perspective. For me she's neither angel nor devil. I wanted to show
that people are a mixture of things, that most of the time, when
they act wrongly, they're trying to get something right, trying to
get some love in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian actress Sara de Roo plays Irene, Rosie's mother.
``It was hard to make a sympathetic character out of this woman who
loves her child, but neglects her,'' she says. ``But if the mother
appears monstrous, then it's easy to blame the whole mess on her.
What I like about this interpretation is that the child is also
partly responsible for her actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one false note mars the performance of Aranka Coppens, 13,
who makes her acting debut as Rosie. ``I wanted Aranka's
performance to be as authentic as possible,'' Ms. Toye says. ``But
at the same time, she really had to understand not to mix herself
up with the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toye recalls a scene ``where Aranka had to kiss the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She refused,'' Ms. Toye says. ``I asked why, and she said,
`I've never kissed a boy before, and I want to save that for the
boy I love.' Well, there was nothing I could say.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. de Roo and Frank Vercruyssen, who plays Michel, Irene's
troublesome brother, are members of an Antwerp-based actors'
collective. Ms. Toye worked closely with them and with Richard van
Oosterhout, her director of photography, who happens to be her
partner of 10 years. (The couple are expecting their first child in
November.)
</P>
<P>
   The small Belgian film community has limited access to financing
and resources, but its size can also be an advantage. ``You can't
act like you're some big shot in this country,'' says Vercruyssen.
``Famous doesn't exist here. The eyes of Belgium are always on the
world rather than on itself. So we have a lot of people who are
used to working with both feet on the ground. Perhaps that's why
the most interesting Belgian films today deal with very real
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toye's next project will be an English-language feature,
based on a Spanish novel and shot in Berlin. Still, she remains
fascinated by the contradictions of her homeland, which has only
recently emerged from a series of crises involving the
contamination of its food, the sexual abuse of children by clergy
and government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time,'' she says, ``we just didn't talk about
our problems. We didn't hang our dirty laundry in public. But
sometimes you're better off doing that. Because at least things get
aired.''

   PIPELINE (Seattle) _ An inspection of the 400-mile Olympic
pipeline turned up hundreds of potential problems three years ago,
forcing workers to dig up and repair or even replace some sections.
But Olympic Pipe Line Co. decided none of the problems in and

anomalies were found. It was that section of pipe that ruptured
June 10, resulting in an explosive fire and three deaths.

   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ The narrowness of Carnoustie's fairways
has drawn numerous complaints from players preparing for this
week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen fairways as penalizing as that for a major
championship,'' said Phil Mickelson after Tuesday's practice round.
``You might as well stick red hazard posts down the fairways. But
everybody has to play the course the way it is. You cannot argue
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernhard Langer, a two-time Masters champion from Germany, has
played courses worldwide, but he had never seen anything quite like
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very tough, the hardest course I've ever played, I
would say,'' Langer said. ``If the wind blows? It's hard enough
without the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden, who made the field by finishing
first at a Monday qualifying tournament, was particularly critical
of the par 4, 479-yard No. 12. ``I think it's OK at some of the
shorter holes when you have the fairways 15 to 20 yards wide, but
at the 12th hole, it's ridiculous,'' Johansson said. ``I don't know
how wide that landing area is, but it looked to me like 10-15
yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk left the par 5, 578-yard No. 6 shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the toughest par 5 I've ever played,'' Furyk said.
``There's no right way to play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the narrow fairways, length off the tee may not be
that much of an advantage. Vijay Singh, one of the game's longest
hitters, only used his driver on three holes Tuesday, opting for
accuracy over length.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the driver could be taken out of a lot of players'
hands,'' Singh said. ``You can always get up and down if you miss
the greens. But where are you going to hit a driver?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janzen Doesn't Feel It
</P>
<P>
   Unless Lee Janzen was intentionally playing down his chances,
don't look for him to be holding the claret jug Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say on a scale of 1 to 10, my game is about a negative 4
right now,'' said Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champion. ``I'm not
doing anything very well. I think the winner will be a guy who is
playing extremely well, and I think that's great. That's what
everybody wants to see: a worthy champion.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Eyes a Return in Style
</P>
<P>
   The British Open will be Payne Stewart's first tournament since
winning last month's U.S. Open. ``I needed the three weeks off,''
Stewart said. ``I'm very excited about playing again. But what I
accomplished three weeks ago is something I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the deep rough at Carnoustie, knee-high in some
spots, Stewart said: ``It's thick, it's nasty and it's not very far
off the fairway, if you call those fairways. Those are kind of like
walking paths we have in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Count Stewart among those who would gladly take an even-par
score to the clubhouse Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the weather is going to do, but if it blows
30 mph, you can see an astronomical score win,'' Stewart said.

   Christopher Maier, 21, of North Canton, Ohio. The University of
Kentucky student and his girlfriend left a party on Aug. 29, 1997,
and walked along Norfolk Southern railroad tracks about a mile from
the Lexington campus. A man jumped from the darkness and demanded
money from Maier and his girlfriend, whose name has been withheld.
Maier was bludgeoned to death while the 20-year-old woman was
raped, beaten and left for dead but survived. DNA evidence linked
Resendez-Ramirez to the attack, authorities said. The woman has
recovered from her injuries, including a broken jaw and a crushed
eye socket, and is considering returning to school.

   Dr. Claudia Gabriella Benton, 39, of Houston. Her husband and
twin daughters were traveling out of state, leaving Benton alone in
her home, near railroad tracks, in the wealthy Houston enclave of
West University Place on Dec. 17, 1998. A Baylor College of
Medicine physician, Benton was undergoing training in genetics. She
was found sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten to death, a
butcher knife beside her body. Her Jeep Cherokee was later found
abandoned in San Antonio. Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint was on the

sledgehammer as they slept. Authorities found their stolen 1998
Mazda pickup in nearby San Antonio. Forensic evidence reportedly

   Josephine Konvicka, 73, a widow, who lived between Weimar and
Schulenburg. Her only company was an old dog that was nearly deaf
and couldn't bark. The mother of a Houston policeman, she died from
a single blow to the head while in her bed June 4. Her house is
about three miles from the Sirnics' home. The suspect tried but
failed to steal Konvicka's Dodge Spirit. He apparently couldn't
find the keys and was unable to hotwire it. His fingerprint
reportedly was found in Konvicka's home. Dogs tracked the suspect's
scent to nearby railroad tracks.

   Noemi Dominguez, 26, of Houston. The bilingual teacher from the

Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint was found in her 1993 Honda Civic,
which was abandoned near a border crossing in Del Rio. Traces of
Dominguez's blood were found in Konvicka's home, indicating that
Dominguez's slaying might have occurred first.

   George Morber, 79, and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 51, of
Gorham, Ill. After 30 years as a prison guard, Morber retired to a
house on the Mississippi about 100 yards from a railroad track in
Gorham in southern Illinois. On June 14, he took his ailing wife to
the hospital. The next day, Morber was mortally wounded in the head
with a shotgun and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 51, was beaten
to death. Morber's truck was recovered June 16 in Cairo, Ill.,
about 60 miles away. While investigating the double slaying, the
local sheriff noticed a train passing nearby and recalled that the
serial killer had slain several people along railroad tracks. He
requested fingerprint records from Texas and ``one of the prints
matched'' Resendez-Ramirez, said Jackson County Sheriff William
Kilquist.

COMPANY CHARGED WITH MURDER IN VALUJET CRASH; EMPLOYEES ALSO
INDICTED
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The aviation maintenance company that delivered
oxygen canisters believed to be responsible for the 1996 Valujet
crash was charged with murder and manslaughter Tuesday, and the
company, a vice president and two mechanics were charged with
carelessly handling deadly materials. Aviation experts say the
charges were the first criminal charges brought in an airliner
accident in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety investigators said the maintenance company,
Sabretech, improperly packed and labeled old airplane parts called
oxygen generators from two other Valujet planes and then delivered
them to the flight, causing a fire in a cargo hold that may have
broken out even before takeoff. All 110 people aboard were killed
when the DC-9 went down in the Everglades on May 11, 1996, shortly
after takeoff from Miami on a flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash was completely preventable,'' said Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, state attorney for Miami-Dade County. ``This was
not an accident. It was a crime. It was a homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110 counts of murder against the company were filed by Ms.
Rundle's office; a federal grand jury in Florida handed up the
indictments on improper handling of materials.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the federal charges, the three men could be
sentenced to up to five years in jail and a fine of $250,000, and
the company could face a fine of almost $6 million. The company
would also face a fine under the state charge, although prosecutors
did not say how large.
</P>
<P>
   But because Sabretech has ceased operations and sold its assets,
meaningful punishment is unlikely unless the company sought to
resume operations, said Donald R. Ungurait, a spokesman for Ms.
Rundle.
</P>
<P>
   Sabretech's assets were sold to Aviation Management Systems Inc.
of Orlando, Fla. Valujet renamed itself Airtran Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Sabretech, Kenneth P. Quinn, said the
charges against the company were ``utterly preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are attempting to criminalize a series of mistakes by
many parties, not just Sabretech or some of its former mechanics,''
he said, pointing out that the National Transportation Safety Board
had found fault not only with Sabretech but also with Valujet, for
failing to oversee its contractor, and the Federal Aviation
Administration, which did not require smoke detectors in DC-9 cargo
holds, among other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the company and the three men would plead not guilty.
He said the men would negotiate surrendering to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment named Eugene Florence, 37, and Mauro
Valenzuela, 30, both mechanics employed by sub-contractors to
Sabretech, and Daniel Gonzalez, who is in his mid-50s, then
Sabretech's vice president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not criminals; they are honest, well intentioned
mechanics who were trying to do the best they could with inadequate
information that had been given them, by the airline, and the
federal government,'' he said. After the accident, the FAA
suspended their licenses for a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a corporation is considered the same as a person
and can be charged with many of the same crimes that a person can
be charged with. On conviction, a corporation can be fined and put
on probation, like a person, and its activities limited or
supervised by a judge or court-appointed official. Most charges
against corporations fall short of murder, however; more
frequently, they are charged with violations of pollution laws or
financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety officials said that bringing murder charges against
Sabretech might make it difficult in future crashes to win the
cooperation of the various parties involved in investigations,
including the airline, the aircraft manufacturer, manufacturer of
engines and other parts and the unions representing the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Aviation subcommittee, Rep. John J.
Duncan, R-Tenn., a former criminal court judge, said Tuesday he
doubted the wisdom of the decision to indict and that if the case
did not succeed, he would favor a congressional inquiry about why
it was brought.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The indictments largely echoed the findings of the Safety Board,
that technicians had removed the oxygen generators, small chemical
reactors that provide oxygen in case of emergency, from the
overhead panels of another airplane because their shelf life had
expired, but had failed to install plastic caps that prevent the
generators from starting up.
</P>
<P>
   Sabretech, located across a runway from the Valujet ramp at
Miami International Airport, conducted a hurried clean-up of its
hangar because another prospective airline client, Continental, was
taking a tour, and technicians packed the canisters loosely into
cardboard cartons, with bubble rap; then someone delivered them to
a Valujet plane that was being loaded with baggage for a flight to
Atlanta. Sabretech said it was returning the canisters to Valujet
because the airline owned them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rundle said, ``We were not able to prove that any single
individual was responsible for the homicides,'' but that
``cumulative acts'' made the airline culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney, said ``critical
maintenance steps were left out,'' and that company personnel
falsely indicated that the safety caps had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not say why the investigation took three years, but
said it was an ``intense, painstaking, careful'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts differed on what precedent the indictments
would set. Vernon E. Grose, a member of the Safety Board in 1983
and 1984, said the threat of prosecution would make aviation
companies ``reticent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think I had equipment that looks like it's going to be
raised as causative, then I'm going to be very, very cautious'' in
cooperating in an investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eliot Brenner, the chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the threat of indictment is always present,
and that many companies and individuals had been indicted, and
convicted, in cases that did not involve crashes, for crimes like
selling counterfeit parts.

NATO PLANS TO CUT FORCES IN BOSNIA BY HALF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO is planning to cut its military forces in
Bosnia by half, an indication of improvements in the security
situation there and of the strain on the alliance of undertaking a
second Balkan mission, in Kosovo, at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, made the announcement
Tuesday during a visit by Defense Secretary William Cohen to the
American base in Tuzla, Bosnia. He cautioned that the decision to
reduce forces in Bosnia was preliminary, pending full NATO
approval, and was based on a recent six-month review showing
positive changes there.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the size of the force would be reduced
from 6,200 to 4,000 troops, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great progress has been made,'' Cohen said Tuesday. ``If
progress continues to be made at the current pace, we can look
forward to seeing some reductions in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kosovo mission is fully in place, more than 80,000 NATO
troops will be in the Balkans, and several NATO countries have
appealed to the alliance to reduce the Bosnia operation in order to
allow them to transfer forces directly to neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really more a timing issue, whether the troops will be
withdrawn in the fall or next spring,'' said a Pentagon spokesman.
``Some nations just can't do both. We could do it, but they
can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme commander of NATO forces, who
joined Cohen in Bosnia Tuesday, said the alliance was also
encouraged that more Bosnian refugees have been returning to their
homes in the last six months, a major goal of the peacekeeping
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very pleased to see the courage of the people
here, in going home,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the preliminary assessment of a further
withdrawal of American troops from Bosnia was greeted with
enthusiasm after much contentious debate over President Clinton's
repeated extensions since troops were first sent there more than
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an encouraging sign that a sustained Western
commitment in the Balkans eventually can make a real difference in
the security situation there, although there is still much work to
be done in Bosnia,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the commander of the American sector said Tuesday
that the monthlong peacekeeping operation has seen decreasing
violence between the Serbian and Albanian communities. The
commander, Brig. Gen. John Craddock, said in an interview with
Pentagon reporters here that he is planning joint patrols with
Russian troops in the American sector to calm further the ethnic
antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   Craddock said he was surprised that his forces have suffered no
casualties and that ``we're farther ahead than where I thought we'd
be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, American soldiers have become targets of
sniper attacks by people Craddock described as thugs who had freely
looted in the sector until the peacekeepers arrived. ``I think that
we are moving into areas where we're threatening their livelihood,
and what we are doing is we're drawing that fire,'' the general
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually NATO will have 55,000 troops in Kosovo, a buildup
that is putting a strain on the smaller nations, said a Pentagon
spokesman, who declined to identify those countries. But
administration officials said that NATO would approve a troop
reduction in Bosnia to help lessen the load for the Kosovo mission
only if it was convinced that it would not undermine the peace in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts questioned whether a troop withdrawal meant
that NATO had lowered its ambitions in Bosnia, rather than a
visibly improved security situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please tell me what has happened in the last six months that
leads NATO to believe it can do with less in Bosnia,'' said Ivo
Daalder of the Brookings Institution. ``What is changing is what we
are willing to live with. We aren't willing to aggressively insure
that the divided communities are re-integrated.''

LATINOS FUEL MLB GROWTH, GAME SPOKESMAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID BEARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The rise of Pedro Martinez, Sammy Sosa, Ivan
Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez has placed a spotlight on a sport
where nearly four in 10 professional players, and one in four major
leaguers, are Latino, said a special assistant to the Major League
Baseball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing presence of Latinos is a primary reason why Major
League Baseball has been able to expand to 30 teams, said Tony
Bernazard and other baseball executives speaking at a symposium on
``Latinos in Beisbol,'' sponsored by Northeastern University's
Center for the Study of Sport in Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would not be an Arizona Diamondbacks'' without the flow
of players from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and
Mexico, said Roland Hemond, assistant general manager of the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bernazard, a big league second baseman from 1979-91, said the
influx prompted Major League Baseball to begin issuing all legal
documents to Latino players in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Often slighted by English-speaking sportswriters because of
language differences, Bernazard said the dramatic rise in Latino
participation will make it impossible to minimize the Latino role
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't hide it anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that based on midseason statistics, Latinos were
not well represented at the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Many major league teams have not made the sustained commitment
to integrate Latino players into society through English-language
programs, said another panelist, Northeastern University
sociologist Alan Klein, author of ``Baseball On the Border,'' a
study of Mexican baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, in interviews with Red Sox fans over the past two
seasons, has found more disturbing news: while Fenway fans
overwhelmingly admire and respect Pedro Martinez as a player and
person, a plurality of fans have negative reactions to the
increasing number of Latinos who attend games when Martinez
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Klein harkened back to the words of Celtics great Bill Russell
in observing that many fans see no contradiction between worshiping
a person of color on the court or playing field _ and not wanting
to sit next to a person of color in the seats.

PALESTINIANS MOVE TO AVOID FRICTION WITH ISRAEL AT U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ To avert friction with Israel's new government,
Palestinian leaders will seek the speedy adjournment of a U.N.
meeting that was to have considered possible sanctions against
Israel for human rights violations and settlement activity in Gaza
and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, in Geneva on Thursday, should end after just ``an
hour or two'' of formal remarks and resolutions to hold a future
conference on the issue, a senior Palestinian official said
Tuesday. The conference had been intended as an open-ended
examination of Israeli control of the West Bank and Gaza, sponsored
by the General Assembly and led by Switzerland, in its role as
custodian of the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a compromise,'' said Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian
Authority's minister for planning and international cooperation, in
a telephone interview from Geneva. ``The idea is to make the
message clear, but not confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   In public statements and in meetings with Western diplomats
here, the newly appointed foreign minister, David Levy, has said
the conference could be a divisive distraction from the planned
resumption of peace talks. Though Palestinian officials say Prime
Minister Ehud Barak did not raise the conference in his 75-minute
meeting Sunday with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, Barak
stressed the importance of beginning comprehensive negotiations in
an atmosphere of mutual trust, without recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really giving Barak an opportunity to set up his
program of action,'' Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli diplomats criticized the Palestinian plan to
reconvene the conference in November, or next January. ``We see
this entire exercise as an attempt to single out Israel, and we
firmly reject it,'' Dore Gold, Israel's representative at the
United Nations, said Tuesday in a telephone interview from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Israeli diplomats are urging European members of a
steering commission for the gathering to oppose setting a new date
for the conference, which could in theory attempt to impose
economic sanctions or other penalties on Israel. The threat of such
a conference would be ``a sword of Damocles hanging over the peace
process,'' one Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.N. General Assembly almost unanimously
adopted a resolution calling for a conference of all Geneva
Convention signers on July 15 to examine violations of the
convention by Israel in the occupied territories of the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip. Israel and the United States cast the only
dissenting votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Israeli diplomats have tried without success to
scuttle the conference, contending that there was no precedent for
a new Geneva Conference focusing on a single regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signatories of the Convention have never been convened for
any purpose since 1949 _ not when the Soviets invaded
Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan, or when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait,''
Gold said. Israeli diplomats say they have sought to convince other
U.N. members with histories of border wars that there could be
similar intervention in their own territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva meeting is being boycotted by the United States, as
well as by Israel, which says that Australia and several other U.N.
members have also decided to avoid the session.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials who originally pushed for the conference
acknowledged that their motivation was to bypass the standard
diplomatic mechanisms of the United Nations, where anti-Israel
resolutions are passed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly only
to be quashed by U.S. vetoes in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath, one of the architects of the conference, suggested a few
months ago that the tenets of the original convention would permit
imposing penalties against Israel for its treatment of the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he struck a more conciliatory note, while emphasizing
the continuing Palestinian concern about Israeli settlers and a
commitment to meet eventually on the issue.

REPUBLICANS DEFEAT DEMOCRATIC PROPOSALS ON MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first tests of strength on managed care
legislation, Republicans in the Senate on Tuesday beat back
Democratic amendments on such emotional issues as emergency room
access and special medical protections for women. The Republicans
also went on to pass measures of their own that in large part
dismantled the Democrats' managed care bill.
</P>
<P>
   The five votes on amendments to rival bills were a strong signal
that the Republicans would stick together and pass their own bill
at the end of a four-day debate over how to regulate health
maintenance companies in the new era of managed care. Every vote
ran largely along party lines, with at most four Republicans
breaking with their party.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, Sen. Don Nickles, the majority whip from Oklahoma,
was virtually declaring victory. ``We've made some good progress to
hopefully passing our bill and defeating a bill that would impose
costs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though two more days of maneuvering are scheduled and the final
shape of the legislation that will emerge from the Senate is not
yet clear, the developments were a sign that the debate over
managed care could well end in a stalemate and a political issue
for the 2000 election. Aides to President Clinton said that if the
Republican version of the bill prevails, they would recommend that
he veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in an appearance on Tuesday with Democrats on the South
Lawn of the White House, accused Senate Republicans of supporting
``a watered down'' bill to regulate managed care companies that
contains ``toothless and half hearted protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The president charged that the Republicans had submitted to
pressure from health insurance companies, which helped scuttle his
own attempt to win universal health care coverage in 1994. ``This
is about political power in Washington trying to shut off something
that is manifestly in the best interest of the average citizen of
this country _ and not just the average citizen _ every single
person covered by an HMO,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans replied by rejecting the idea that federal
regulation is the answer to consumer concerns over managed care
coverage. ``He's always had this idea that the federal government
knows best,'' said Nickles. ``I reject that philosophy that
Washington, D.C., knows best on health care.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's debate marked the first time since the new era of
managed care that the Senate has considered how to protect the
rights of patients and regulate the companies that provide health
insurance to most Americans. Republicans and Democrats have offered
rival bills reflecting different philosophies over how much federal
regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The measures differ on issues such as how many consumers would
be covered by the legislation and what kinds of requirements would
be imposed upon the managed care companies. The Republicans would
offer a number of their consumer protections to the 48 million
Americans in health plans offered by large employers, which are
regulated exclusively by the federal government. The Democrats'
bill would cover all 161 million Americans with private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   With health care issues expected to be potent in next year's
elections, the two sides were going to great lengths to seize the
advantage in the debate and force votes on amendments that they
hope to turn to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats had held out hope that they might prevail on
some amendments, the day's first 52-48 vote defeating an amendment
sponsored by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., quickly made such a turn of
events look highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the amendments the Democrats planned to offer across four
days of debate, they considered this to be the one most likely to
draw cross-over Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   Touching on an emotional health issue for a sought-after
political constituency, the measure would have stipulated that
women could choose obstetrician-gynecologists as their primary care
doctors and ensured that a woman could stay overnight in a hospital
after a mastectomy if her doctor recommended it. It also included a
tax credit favored by Republicans that would allow people who are
self-employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of purchasing
health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cited instances where insurance companies required a
mastectomy to be treated as out-patient surgery. ``Make no mistake,
a mastectomy is an amputation and it has all the horrible, horrific
consequences as an amputation,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md..
Even so, she said that in some cases, after a woman has had such
surgery, ''she's told to call a cab and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would offer their own amendment Thursday
addressing some of the same issues, but they objected to the
designation of a obstetrician-gynecologist as a primary care
physician. Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said such doctors want to be
considered specialists. He said that in the Republican bill, a
woman would be allowed to choose to see an obstretician-gyneclogist
without a referral from another physician. ``That's what women tell
me they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only three Republicans _ Sens. John Chafee of Rhode
Island, John Warner of Virginia and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _
crossed party lines to join the Democrats on that vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately made clear how they would portray the vote
next year. ``All but three Republicans turned their backs on the
women of America,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In rapid secession after that the Republicans won vote after
vote on Tuesday night. By a vote of 52-48, they stripped from the
Democrats' bill provisions that would grant doctors the right to
decide what procedures are medically necessary. They replaced that
with a Republican provision that would leave that decision up to a
doctor in the insurance company and then set up an external appeals
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 52-48, the Senate passed a measure that would keep
the Democrats bill from taking effect if it causes an increase in
insurance premiums of more than 1 percent. The Congressional Budget
Office has said that the latest version of the Democrats bill would
increase premiums by 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate defeated, 53-47, a Democratic effort to give all
Americans with private health insurance assured access to an
emergency room even if it is outside a managed care network.
</P>
<P>
   And by 53-47, Republicans passed their own amendment that would
give a 100 percent deduction for health care coverage to all
self-employed individuals, instead of the current 40 percent
deduction. The amendment, which amounts to a $3 billion tax
reduction, also contained language blocking a Democratic effort to
make the Republican managed care bill cover all 161 Americans with
private health insurance.

 &HT;    Smith defects from GOP; Could take Bush votes

   AUSTIN, Texas _ New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, whose bid for the
Republican presidential nomination never even achieved favorite-son
status in his home state, quit the party Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the move did little to increase his longer-than-long shot
at becoming president, officials in both parties said it could
increase Smith's chances of effecting the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, complaining that the GOP had abandoned its conservative
principles, plans to run a third-party presidential campaign that
could drain votes from the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, polls indicate that will be Gov. George W. Bush,
whose moderate positions came in for specific criticism Tuesday
from Smith. The two-term New Hampshire senator said the GOP
platform is ``not worth the paper it's printed on.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he remains true to his platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pro-life, it's pro-Second Amendment, it's pro-military,
it's pro-sovereignty, it's pro-character and integrity,'' he said.
``Many who want to lead our party _ specifically candidate Bush _
won't take a position on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor ``hates to see
(Smith) leave the party.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Smith, as a third-party candidate, should not take
many votes from the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who is looking for the party that represents
conservative principles will support the conservative Republican
nominee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush will make a stop in Washington to pick up an
endorsement from Ohio Rep. John Kasich, who is giving up his bid
for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's comment about Bush came prior to a Senate floor speech
in which he announced his decision to bolt from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson was among
those downplaying the significance of the move by Smith, who barely
showed up in national polls and never topped 3 percent in his home
state.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Smith, Nicholson said the move would have ``only
a marginal political impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire GOP Chairman Steve Duprey said any impact
Smith does have will come at the expense of the Republican
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the irony here,'' said Duprey. ``Bob Smith leaving our
party might have the effect of helping Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   As a third-party candidate, Smith _ already unknown to most
voters _ would be underfunded and unable to mount a serious
challenge. He could, however, find support from social
conservatives who have targeted Bush as too moderate. Bush has
declined to guarantee he would pick a running mate and judges who,
like him, oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Bush off limits to people like Bobbie Gobel,
chairwoman of the Iowa Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a large percentage will leave their party and follow
him,'' Gobel said of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Of Bush, she said, ``If he could pick and choose somebody that
could straddle the fence and not honor God's word that is out of
the Holy Bible then I believe he is not the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from the 1996 presidential election, a popular and
electoral vote landslide that kept Democrat Bill Clinton in office,
shows how shifting a relatively few votes can change who gets a
state's electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got California's 54 electoral votes but garnered only 51
percent of the state's popular votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also got Florida's 25 electoral votes, though he
outpolled Republican Bob Dole by only 300,000 votes out of 5.3
million. Ross Perot got 484,000 votes, enough to change the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Though debate remains on who Perot took votes from, most
Republicans believe he hurt their candidate, especially
then-President George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt that any campaign coming from the right of
the GOP nominee would hurt the Republican contender next year.
That's why national Democrats were enjoying Smith's performance on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can clearly have an effect on the race'' as a
third-party or independent candidate, said Joe Andrew, general
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``When you have
extreme positions, as Bob Smith has, and he takes those votes with
him, 100 percent of them are coming from whoever the Republican
nominee is.''

POP PABLUM AND BAROQUE BOILERPLATE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celine Dion singing ``My Heart Will Go On'' and a Locatelli
violin concerto send me to the radio's ``off'' button with equal
velocity. A decision about Ms. Dion took about 45 seconds,
Locatelli more like 30 years. But the two are annoying for similar
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dion makes it easy. The disposable charms of a momentarily
famous pop singer are brief by nature. Yet how has a love affair
with the Italian Baroque _ born of the postwar long-playing record
boom _ gone so wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us raised on the big pieces of the 19th century, a lot
of Mozart and a little Haydn raced to the record stores to hear the
latest Torelli and Corelli from chamber orchestras like I Musici or
I Virtuosi di Roma. We were charmed by the elegance and the
certitude. We liked the absence of bigness for its own sake and the
clarity of small string ensembles in synchrony.
</P>
<P>
   With exceptions (Vivaldi is one), I find this music increasingly
difficult to listen to. Saturation? Perhaps. Near-symmetry, often
repeated, numbs the spirit; the frictionless paradoxically becomes
an irritant. This civilizing of human passions runs like a current
beneath the great musical events of the 18th century, although the
best composers, refusing to be so easily tamed, fought against the
tide.
</P>
<P>
   Locatelli's upbeat energies are arranged like a well-engineered
stairway. The patterns rise uniformly, and the principal tension is
uncertainty as to when the ascent will stop. Anguish in the minor
mode has a similar formality, resolved, finally, by strong
cadences. Here are sad stories with happy endings; dei ex machina
descend in the form of the major third.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dion, like Locatelli, satisfies the listener's need for
order. ``My Heart Will Go On'' is, if anything, reliable: four-bar
phrases, four beats each; eight-bar stanzas. The bass line adds a
comforting thump at the beginning of every measure.
</P>
<P>
   Equally reliable are the melodic shape and its delivery, with
little variation, often none. Harmonic change takes a small step
forward and a small one back. Rhetoric waves passionately, but the
music hangs limp; we know the end at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Complacency, not disruption, is the gift offered, and the casual
ear accepts it with gratitude. Ms. Dion energetically assures us
that love is in the air and that it will eventually make us happy.
</P>
<P>
   The Andante from Locatelli's B flat Concerto for Violin and
Strings (No. 7 from his ``Art of the Violin,'' published in 1737)
is Ms. Dion's ancestor: more sophisticated but bearing family
resemblances. Again four-beat, four-measure phrases, though
Locatelli keeps us on our toes by elongating or shrinking his
stanza endings by a measure or two.
</P>
<P>
   The sequences get a little busier as they mount but offer no
surprises. The soloist's elaborate embellishments of repeated
material remind one of Nabokov's pronouncement that important
novels invent their own world while mediocre fiction ``embroiders
the commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to pick too strenuously on Locatelli. He had plenty of
company. Also, keep in mind that early-18th-century music evidently
made a different impression on its contemporaries from that on
late-20th-century ears. Any listening problems we may have now say
as much about us as about the music.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, history looks back admiringly on Locatelli, pointing out
his innovations in playing the violin and their effect on music to
come. A colleague, Albinoni, made interesting experiments in form
and organization.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that their audiences, inhabiting another
world and possessing a different sensibility, heard in their pieces
the same red heat that we find in Messiaen and Aretha Franklin.
Indeed, colleagues of Corelli called his music ``the bread of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, its superior gravity and dignity set it somewhat apart
from the rest of the Italian Baroque, but we still find little
rescue from the numbness of predictability.
</P>
<P>
   The period piece is our topic. It is an artifact that speaks to
its own time but no other. Mediocre pop singing like Ms. Dion's
unashamedly defines what ``period piece'' means, though the period
is measured less in generations or centuries than in months or
weeks. Locatelli's period is not ours, and perhaps his postwar
exhumation by the early-music movement and the recording business
is momentary as well.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Dion's fans are merely lazy, Locatelli's 18th-century
listeners were optimistic. His well-ordered music regurgitated the
Enlightenment's belief in the human brain and heart, and their
powers to soothe the savage breast and clarify the muddles of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, scientific symmetries proved on Monday are replaced by
Wednesday. Human invention and development, rather than curbing our
cruelest instincts, make their employment more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Locatelli's better colleagues were less trustful than he. Bach
was the master saboteur of symmetry. His sequential patterns alter
constantly, giving us the better than expected. Vivaldi's pictorial
drama excites again and again: he is the era's true eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Haydn based his musical life on the delightful, touching or
deeply moving surprise. Mozart managed to be sad and happy at the
same time. It is this ambiguity that is so splendidly
disconcerting. Cimarosa's operas, in contrast, charm for one act
but have annoyingly little new charm for the next two.
</P>
<P>
   The pop music world shows good sense by making products whose
obsolescence is not only planned but welcomed. When the occasional
meteor burns brighter than the rest, its durability will depend on
its own resources. Classical music needs to monitor a little better
the argument between disposability and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately classical music has its audience, which may
enthusiastically greet the historical fad but eventually knows how
to forget the forgettable.

EARLY VOTES IN MEDICAL CARE DEBATE GO TO GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate cast its opening votes Tuesday in the
battle over patient's rights, striking down a Democratic measure
that would require insurance companies to pay for any treatments
that doctors say are medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also defeated a Democratic amendment that would have
expanded medical care options for women. Both proposals were
defeated on a near party-line vote of 52-48.
</P>
<P>
   The votes came after a day of heated debate, as Democrats
pressed the most extensive plan to overhaul the nation's health
care system since President Clinton's failed effort in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic measure would have required health insurance
companies to pay for care that fits under the generally accepted
principles of medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans argued that ``one size fits all'' was not
practical and replaced the Democratic medical necessity language
with a measure that would allow patients to appeal if an insurance
company denies coverage for a medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make sure that every person has the right to
the best medical care available,'' said Senator James Jeffords, a
Vermont Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The women's health care amendment would have allowed women
longer hospital stays after mastectomies and would have given women
the option of choosing their obstetrician-gynecologists as their
primary-care physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shameful vote,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy
afterward. ``I'm shocked at the Republican Party's insensitivity to
the needs of American women.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to offer their own version of the bill
later this week that would provide similar benefits for women. But
the competing GOP measure would apply to about 50 million fewer
women than the Democrat proposal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president would veto the GOP bill
if it reaches his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretends to guarantee direct access to obstetricians and
gynecologists, but it is so narrowly crafted that it will bring
few, if any, benefits to the women eligible for its apparent
protection,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also rejected, 47-53, a Democratic measure that would
prevent HMOs from charging patients more if they sought emergency
care from hospitals not covered under their medical plan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans offered an amendment, which passed 52-48, that
focuses on how the Democratic bill would drive up insurance costs.
The Democrats' measure would boost premiums by 4.8 percent,
according to congressional experts. Under the Republican amendment,
the bill's provisions would be canceled if the cost is increased by
more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected Wednesday to vote how many people the
legislation should cover, access to emergency room care and the
cost of the bill. Final passage is expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and Democrats have proposed dueling measures
to protect patients in health-maintenence organizations or other
health care plans. The bills address such issues as patients'
access to specialists, emergency care coverage and grievance
procedures if treatment is denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan is more far-reaching, covering about 161
million Americans and establishing a more comprehensive framework
for federal regulation of health insurance. But Republicans want to
minimize new federal regulations, covering only the 48 million
Americans in health plans exempt from state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also want to allow patients to sue HMOs and collect
damages when HMOs withhold treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to empower the patients and the doctors making the
decisions, not empower the HMOs,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said excessive litigation would drive up costs
and would prompt employers to drop health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You simply cannot sue your way to better health,'' Jeffords
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's debate began, President Clinton, at a morning
rally with Senate Democrats at the White House, accused Republicans
of caving in to pressures from health insurance companies and
backing a ``watered-down'' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is nowhere near what the American people deserve or need.
Not only does it offer merely toothless and half-hearted
protections, it fails to protect all Americans in managed care,''
Clinton said.

SUSPECT'S ARREST BRINGS RELIEF TO AREAS WHERE KILLINGS OCCURRED

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Living in what felt like a secure neighborhood in West
University Place, attorney Karen Chisolm learned wariness after
another woman there fell victim to a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 17, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez allegedly emerged from the
railroad tracks that run half a block from Chisolm's home in West
University, an affluent enclave of Houston, and bludgeoned Dr.
Claudia Benton to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a lot more careful about keeping my alarm on since
then,'' Chisolm said, ``even when I'm at home and awake.''
</P>
<P>
   News that the suspect had surrendered Tuesday in El Paso was
welcome, but it failed to make her feel completely safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attention, the uncertainty, the fear, stay with
you even after the immediate threat is gone,'' Chisolm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security was somewhat illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Kissinger, a caterer and commercial artist, has lived with
her back to the same old Southern Pacific tracks for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The house where the slaying occurred is just across the street,
and Kissinger says she would pick up the mail when Benton was out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger's husband was working late and she was home alone the
night their neighbor was slain. Kissinger says the killer probably
walked right past her window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grow all my vegetables in the back,'' she explained, ``and
ever since, I haven't felt comfortable being out there without my
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest also brought relief to a neighborhood a few miles
away, in southeast Houston near the Texas Medical Center, where
Noemi Dominguez, a 26-year-old teacher, was beaten to death June 5.
</P>
<P>
   The fenced backyard of the two-story fourplex where she lived is
separated from grocery warehouses by a Houston Belt and Terminal
Railway track.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, a Rice University graduate who was on sabbatical from
teaching to finish her master's degree, was bludgeoned in her
bedroom and found by her brother. Evidence links Resendez-Ramirez
to the killing, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   One of her neighbors, whose door opens onto the tracks a few
feet away, has burglar bars, a security system and a barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   She was relieved but said she must remain cautious, since her
young granddaughters live with her.
</P>
<P>
   A worker in the nearby U.S. Post Office said he comes to work at
4 a.m. and has made a point of watching the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Hispanic workers here,'' he said, ``and they were
saying that it's not right for people to think that all Hispanics
are immigrants _ and most definitely not all are criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   At Methodist Hospital in Houston, two workers having lunch
gasped when told that the suspect had surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a single woman living alone and this really affected my
life,'' said Irene Minor. ``I would have family members call to
check on me and make sure my doors and windows were locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was happening in all areas of the city and country,'' Minor
said. ``It was terrifying that one man could have such an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is also suspected in the 1997 murder of
Christopher Maier, 21, in Lexington, Ky., and the rape of his
girlfriend. That bludgeoning also occurred as the couple walked
along a rail track.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother said her daughter is taking a summer class
in England. Although they had not spoken since the arrest, she felt
confident her daughter had heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the world has e-mailed her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fear and relief were felt well beyond the communities where
Resendez-Ramirez is said to have found his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bell, who has a sheep ranch near Kerrville in the Texas
Hill Country, was in Houston on business Tuesday and lunching at
Cleburne Cafeteria near Benton's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd read in our weekly paper that they'd had five or six
sightings a week,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody would have seen him in the supermarket, having a cup
of coffee. And the police would come and check it out, but either
the person they saw would be gone or it wouldn't be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no killings in the Kerrville area have been linked to
Resendez-Ramirez, he was blamed for two slayings in Weimar and
another about three miles away in Fayette County.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Houston, the sound of trains near her house in
Magnolia used to give Helen Mateos a soothing sense of peace. Now
they are a disturbing reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day I was putting on my makeup when I heard the
train,'' Mateos said. ``I stopped and thought, I just don't like to
hear it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Evans, director of social psychology at the
University of Houston, said such effects can be expected to fade
with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning,'' he said, ``there's an overreaction among
people who live alone or in secluded areas, even though the chance
of being a victim is very small.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take steps to take care of themselves, but the fear
element begins to diminish very rapidly. Once he's captured, the
excitement of the chase is gone,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Resendez-Ramirez is not a celebrity like O.J. Simpson,
Evans said, there probably will not even be much news interest in
seeing how his personality unfolds in his trial.
</P>
<P>
   And because his alleged crimes are spread out over the country,
Evans said, there will be nothing like the series of funerals and
community grief that helped sustain interest in the Columbine High
School shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement and fantasy of someone on the loose in railroad
cars will be gone,'' Evans predicted. ``That's what gave the story
legs to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the interest was very much alive. Liz Galvan, a
Spanish teacher who lives across the street from Benton's home, got
three phone calls during a 5-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   The phone started ringing as soon as the surrender was announced
on television, she said, and hadn't stopped.
</P>
<P>
   It was also ringing for Gary Brye, the West University Place
police chief. He said he had not known the arrest was imminent and
had not taken a break since it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the calls, he said patiently, were from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Brye said his investigators had contacted Benton's husband,
George, with the news of Resendez-Ramirez's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the house has been sold, and George Benton has
moved out of state with the couple's twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information I have,'' Brye said, ``is that, as one could
expect, the grief was still there, but they were very happy that
the suspect is in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is shared by all 21 members of the West University
Place police force, he said, each of whom has worked on the case at
one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased he's in custody and is off the streets,''
Brye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an extremely brutal individual.'' &QL;

 _ SF CHRON  
 Keeping It in the Family  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A lot of entrepreneurs successfully build businesses, but many balk
at handing over the reins and the assets during their lifetime to
the next generation. That can be a terrible oversight because the
heirs would be hit with a 55 percent tax on estate assets exceeding
$3 million in value.
<P>
   In the United States, family businesses account for an estimated
90 percent of the 15 million total enterprises. But only about 30
percent make it to the second generation, and just 8 percent
survive for the grandchildren. Some companies go public or are sold
at a profit. A great number of potential successors simply lack the
acumen to continue the business; many others are forced to sell the
business to pay the hefty tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   While death is inevitable, an entrepreneur can reduce the tax
burden considerably by taking action early and intelligently. A
number of techniques are available to transfer wealth, including
the use of one-time exclusions from estate taxes, tax-free annual
gifts and discount valuations allowed for assets of privately owned
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Robert Pecota, 60, and his brother Joseph, 69. Both
took aggressive measures to pass their wealth to the next
generation and help ensure that their separate businesses stay in
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pecota started his own wine venture in 1978 after
learning the wine and vineyard trade at Beringer and its former
parent company, Nestle USA, in Napa Valley. Today, Robert Pecota
Winery produces about 15,000 cases of ultra-premium wine with
revenues topping $2 million and a fair-market value approaching $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a San Francisco dry cleaner, and one of 11 children,
Robert Pecota displayed his business know-how early on. After
working his way through the University of San Francisco and getting
an MBA on a scholarship at the University of California at
Berkeley, Pecota, then in his mid-20s, bought the cheapest home in
the most expensive Greenbrae neighborhood with all-borrowed funds.
Three years later, he sold it for a $50,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he bought 40 acres three miles north of Calistoga at
the upper end of the Napa Valley, Pecota had purchased and sold two
vineyards for even quicker profits and had built a nest egg of
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; By continuously taking out new loans on his appreciating
vineyard land, refinancing the property as interest rates fell and
using cash flow from sales, Pecota has been able to pour more than
$3 million into capital equipment and an equal amount into
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard land in choice parts of the Napa Valley now goes for
well over $100,000 per acre, and Pecota's 40 acres is worth more
than 20 times the $4,500 to $5,000 an acre he paid for it more than
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the values continued to grow, I realized we would be eaten
alive by the estate taxes that encourage the destruction of family
businesses,'' Pecota said in an interview as he gazed across his
bright green Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many people, money is a way to control the kids, to get
them to come and visit. My view is to get the money in their hands
as soon as possible and they will make sure you are well taken care
of. In a family business, your kids are your 401(k) plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pecota got some pointers from his older brother, Joseph,
who gave away his entire Tri-Phase Inc. circuit-board assembly
company in Sunnyvale to his three children a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the younger Pecota attended an estate-planning
seminar and then talked with his accountants and Napa lawyer Robert
Fanucci about an estate and transition plan.
</P>
<P>
   Most crucial to the continued success of a family run and owned
business, Pecota maintains, is a clear understanding of the
strengths, weaknesses and interests of the next generation. Two of
Pecota's three children, 33-year-old Kara and 25-year-old Andrea,
work at the winery while son Steven, 27, is a baker in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   After plotting management strategy, Pecota's next step was using
corporate and tax laws to shift assets out of his estate as quickly
and efficiently as possible. For starters, he set up a revocable
living trust to avoid probate and reduce the chance of delays and
disputes after he dies.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his attention to establishing a fair-market value
of his company. In this case, giving away shares in a privately
held company is different from giving away cash or publicly traded
stocks because there is no standard market value. That can be a
major benefit to family businesses because they often can get
discounts of 30 to 50 percent off the fair-market value of their
assets because the transferred shares are minority interests and
stock in the company cannot be easily bought or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Pecota hired Hal Forcey of Pacific Coast Appraisal, a specialist
in winery and vineyard valuation, to come up with a reasonable
discount on the fair-market value for his winery. Then using the
so-called applicable exclusion from estate taxes, which this year
rises from $600,000 to $650,000 for an individual, Pecota gave away
45 percent of his winery over five years _ 15 percent to each of
his children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pecota, who is divorced, is making $10,000 annual
tax-free gifts to each of his children. These are used to pay the
premiums on a $1.5 million variable annuity insurance policy on his
life so that when he dies, the proceeds will be outside of his
estate and can be used to pay estate taxes or for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To lower the tax bite and reduce potential liability problems,
Pecota also formed a family limited partnership for the vineyards
and converted from a sole proprietorship to a limited liability
company for the winery. ``No one should enter this process without
a good accountant and estate attorney,'' Pecota warns. And be
prepared to spend some bucks to save more bucks. Pecota figures he
has paid about $50,000 on legal, accounting and appraisal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Robert Pecota would like to match his older
brother's feat of transferring the entire business in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   After working for Hewlett-Packard and several electronics sales
representatives, Joseph Pecota started his own electronics company
in 1965 in Sunnyvale. Called Tri-Phase Inc., it grew and prospered,
and two of Pecota's three children joined the company.
</P>
<P>
   Then a decade ago, Joseph Pecota decided it was time to give his
business away to avoid onerous taxes in the future.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife gave away the entire company in three equal
pieces to their three children, using up about $1 million of their
lifetime exclusion from estate taxes. At the same time, son Andrew,
now 42, became CEO and president and Joseph Pecota willingly became
a paid consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the sole owner, the top banana,'' Joseph Pecota recalled
from his home at Clear Lake. ``But it was time for a change. It
made sense to give away an appreciating asset when the tax base was
low. It was the right time, and luckily I had children who were
interested, able and responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Andrew Pecota runs the company, which has more than
doubled in size over the past decade, daughter Elizabeth, 31, is
treasurer. Son William, 39, a former major-league baseball player,
is not involved with Tri-Phase.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving the company to his children, Pecota and
his wife have used the annual $10,000 tax-free gift allowance to
transfer ownership of a separate 8,000-square-foot industrial
building in Silicon Valley to their children.
</P>
<P>
   There is no single right way to transfer assets to the next
generation. Rather, there are multiple approaches and philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Many business owners prefer to give equal shares in the business
to all their children, regardless of whether they are involved in
the family business. Some issue nonvoting shares to those who are
not working in the company to avoid unnecessary interference with
management.
</P>
<P>
   But some successful entrepreneurs oppose this approach. They
argue that if family members don't have the same interests or share
the same vision, giving them common stakes is a recipe for
infighting and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our love of our children and desire to be fair often sets the
stage for conflict,'' said Marshall Paisner, author of the new book
``Sustaining the Family Business: An Insider's Guide to Managing
Across Generations'' (Perseus Books, $26).
</P>
<P>
   ``Give stock only to those in the business,'' advises Paisner,
who at 69 has transferred 100 percent of his ScrubaDub car-wash
chain in Massachusetts to his two sons who work in the business. He
has used an insurance policy on his life and that of his wife to
provide equal financial benefits to a third child who is not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great equalizer in America is insurance,'' Paisner and
some others argue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is easy to overlook estate and retirement planning,
Paisner said it is essential to think about it early and execute a
plan. Because you can give a family business away at a discount,
why wait until death, when you have to pay taxes on the full market
value.
</P>
<P>
   Paisner, for example, divided ScrubaDub shares into two classes,
voting and nonvoting. He initially kept the 10 percent that had
voting power for himself to maintain control, and he and his wife
gave away the 90 percent that didn't have voting rights to their
two sons in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Since these nonvoting shares lacked management control and could
not be sold easily because the company is privately owned,
ScrubaDub's appraiser gave Paisner a 50 percent discount on the
valuation of the transfers. That effectively doubled the value of
the annual $20,000 tax-free gifts that Paisner and his wife gave
each child working in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at retirement age, Paisner sold his 10 percent voting
stock back to his children and set up a life insurance policy to
eventually pay off the bank loans used by the company to buy back
these shares.
</P>
<P>
   Paisner and other experts also strongly recommend setting up
formal conflict-resolution procedures rather than leaving it to
chance. Family conflicts can range from differences over business
strategy to which siblings or cousins get which jobs, to arguments
over dividend policy.
</P>
<P>
   Have an outside board of directors or advisers, the experts say.
Set up regular family council meetings to discuss potential
problems and iron out difficulties. Consider putting 2 percent of
the stock in the family business into a deadlock trust where a
mutually agreed upon trustee has the clout to hammer out compromise
and break ties.
</P>
<P>
   Have formal stock redemption agreements such as acceptance of a
lower-than-market price for stock passed between family members.
The mere existence of such agreements might help keep conflicts in
check.

`MUPPETS FROM SPACE' LACKS ENERGY AND ZING, IS ERRATICALLY PACED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1996 film, ``Muppet Treasure Island,'' showed the clever and
canny Muppets could survive the death of their creator, Jim Henson.
But ``Muppets From Space'' raises questions about their movie
future. It's neither very witty nor a particularly original
animatronic puppet adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's a turgid rehash of several good (and bad) sci-fi
movies, including ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   In this spoof of UFO flicks, Gonzo is in the midst of an
identity crisis. All the other Muppets know who and what they are
and where they come from. But poor Gonzo feels lost and alone.
Where is his real home?
</P>
<P>
   When he starts receiving cryptic messages from outer space, he
realizes his roots are somewhere in the stars. Even a sandwich
mysteriously begins to transmit information to him and, when Miss
Piggy broadcasts a report on Gonzo's behavior on the local TV
station, a paranoid government agency catches wind of it. Soon
Gonzo, who is thought to be an alien, along with his roommate and
pal, Rizzo the Rat, are enduring more than a mere rectal exam at
the hands of a mad doctor obsessed with his scary scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
   It's up to the Muppets to rescue their friends and rush Gonzo to
his appointed date with destiny: to meet his real family.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the message remains that Gonzo will learn family is
where your heart is, not necessarily blood _ or alien _ ties.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rizzo has several funny ``small'' moments, the film lacks
energy and zing. It's erratically paced and quite often predictably
dull storywise and even smaller children may not find its jokes and
situations very compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the film is packed with ``human'' guest actors, they
all appear to be slumming. Ray Liotta, Andie MacDowell, F. Murray
Abraham, Jeffrey Tambor and Josh Charles receive such negligible
screen time and so little to do that they seem sheepish at having
agreed to co-star with such upstaging Muppet stars.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this not-so-big adventure has little of the goofy
intelligence of ``The Muppet Show.'' It's as if, without Henson's
off-kilter sense of humor, the puppets have lapsed into rather
pedestrian situations and schemes. The element of surprise that was
such a delight in the TV series _ and in the last film _ is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problem may be that they're working with a
first-time feature director but my sense tells me it's more of a
script issue and the challenge to keep the Muppets on top of the
fast-changing, more sophisticated realm of kids' movies. Let's hope
they retain their individuality rather than try to keep up with
competition that is trendy and fashionable but mediocre in spirit.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Ehud Barak steps into his new role as prime
minister, he is working hard to convince the region's players that
because he is a different kind of leader with a different outlook
than his predecessor, he can be trusted to take a different path to
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, on the eve of a weeklong visit to
Washington, Barak said he does not want to impose an Israeli
blueprint for peace, because ``coming from me, that blueprint will
have a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Weary of doing battle, the former general said he wants to forge
a Middle East peace agreement that ``works for everyone.'' It is
not a starry-eyed plan for regional brotherhood and love; his goal
is separation, rather than integration of Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants to break a few standing conventions at once.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to negotiate on several fronts simultaneously _ with
the Palestinians, the Syrians and the Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to persuade Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to
abandon his demand for the full and immediate implementation of the
most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the Wye River
memorandum, an American-brokered land-for-security deal concluded
last fall in Wye, Md..
</P>
<P>
   And while Barak said he intended to embrace President Clinton as
a ``major partner,'' he also wants the Americans to scale back
their role in the region. He described it as ``overly involved'' _
a result of the recent deterioration in Israel's relationships with
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that the Americans should be able to return to their
``special role as facilitators'' and stop acting as ``arbitrator,
policeman and judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the CIA should be involved in counting the
number of policemen in the Gaza Strip to check up on the
Palestinians,'' Barak said, referring to an American task assigned
at Wye. ``I think the American role should be more special. This is
the reason I'm going to Washington tomorrow. I want to share ideas
and build an overall strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said:
``The heavily involved role that we and the CIA have had is because
of the breakdown in trust and confidence between the Israelis and
the Palestinians. We would prefer a situation where the
Palestinians and the Israelis could work these problems out
directly without our extensively involved role.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barak discussed some of this thoughts on
peacemaking and peacemakers. He characterized his relationship with
Arafat, for instance, who had called him a ``friend and partner''
after their first face-to-face meeting on Sunday, in guarded terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Palestinian leader,'' Barak said. ``He's not a Zionist
or a member of B'nai B'rith. We are partnerish rivals, I would
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat appeared physically frail in his public appearance on
Sunday. He attended the summit meeting with his personal physician.
But Barak said the Palestinian leader seemed to be in keen shape
intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say anything about his health,'' he said. ``But his
mind is sharp, alert and clear. He is in full control of his
political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   It was evident Tuesday that Barak, who began a whirlwind
diplomatic tour three days after his swearing-in last week, has
barely moved into his new office. The walls were blank except for
portraits of Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated prime minister and his
mentor, and David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, graced
the walls. The bookshelves were half-filled, including a full set
of the Encyclopedia Judaica left behind by his predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, generals, and politicians revolved through his office
at a relentless pace. Early Tuesday morning, the American
ambassador, Edward S. Walker Jr., left the suite as a cadre of top
army officials entered, carrying maps of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday night, Barak was in Jordan, meeting with King
Abdullah at the royal palace in Aqaba, where Barak planned to
discuss his peace strategy and to enlist the king's participation.
</P>
<P>
   That Barak, a night owl, is running on very little sleep can be
seen only in his tired eyes. He has adapted very quickly to holding
the reins of power, and his mood is expansive and confident. He
clearly finds it a relief that he is no longer in a position to
merely advise, as he did with Rabin and Rabin's successor as prime
minister, Shimon Peres, but to make decisions himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Barak said that the new momentum toward
peace could provoke terrorist attacks by those eager to stop the
process. He ordered Israeli security agencies to ``remain alert''
and to increase coordination with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Barak cited the risk of terrorism as one
reason he is reluctant to ``proceed at full gallop'' toward
carrying out the Wye agreement. Not because he fears terrorism per
se, he said, but because he believes that terrorism spoils the
climate for peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror can kill the whole process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In making this kind of a threat, Barak is taking a risky tack,
one that some experts believe grants terrorists too much control
over the peace effort. Although he did not elaborate in the
interview, it is possible that Barak believes that Arafat has
greater power than ever to prevent terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he intends to abide by Wye, which Netanyahu froze
last December. In the next few weeks, he will move to carry out
some aspects of the agreement, he said, but thereafter he hopes to
proceed gradually _ if, and only if, Arafat concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly implementation of Wye should begin so they will see
that something has changed, and that we are determined to move and
not just to speak,'' Barak said. ``But full implementation now is
too risky. It would reduce our chances of achieving a permanent
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli and Palestinian analysts say that Arafat never
expected Netanyahu to proceed with honest intentions into the final
status negotiations. Those are the talks to make a permanent peace,
which involve the thorniest issues, including the status of
Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the final
borders of the Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, analysts say, approached the Wye negotiations as if they
were the last chance to obtain a transfer of land from Israeli to
Palestinian control in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If he were convinced that Barak was serious about making a final
deal, Arafat might be willing to start the final status talks
before the third phase of Wye was carried out, Palestinian
officials said. That phase calls for the return of 13 percent of
the West Bank, reportedly in the Hebron area. It would leave 15
Jewish settlements surrounded by areas under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts believe that this final phase could be
both unpopular and dangerous, creating political instability in
Israel and increasing the risk of terrorist attacks on the newly
isolated settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis awaiting us at the end of the street,'' Barak
said. ``It doesn't need a genius to identify that we're entering a
gantlet with a lot of dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is reportedly why Barak thinks that carrying out all the
provisions of Wye right away would reduce the chances of reaching a
final agreement. He may also want to hold on to the land as a
bargaining chip in negotiating other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that he would give Arafat a deadline; he would
promise to return the land by a given date no matter where the
final status talks stood at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Arafat we are going to follow the kind of relationship
you had with Rabin,'' Barak said. ``Namely, we'll have crises. It
won't be easy. We'll have ups and downs and setbacks and moments
when only a direct contact between us can avoid collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will do it in a direct, frank way,'' he continued, as
if talking to Arafat. ``It's clear that we have different
interests. But if we carry on with determination to put an end to
the conflict, there's a good chance we will be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the leaders in the Mideast find themselves in a crucial
moment, Barak said, with the possibility of working together or
seeing the region disintegrate or explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to climb together like a team of cliff climbers, to go
to the summit together,'' he said. ``Otherwise, the alternative is
that we may all fall into the abyss below.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what I told Arafat, I told Mubarak, I will tell King
Abdullah tonight, and I will tell Assad when we meet in the
future,'' he said, referring to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt,
the king of Jordan, and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not afraid to fight the Arabs,'' Barak said. ``And I'm
not afraid to make peace with them.''

</HEADLINE>
 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Transferring Assets to Your Kids 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Q: I have a family business and am starting to think about
estate planning even though I have no intention of retiring soon.
What are some of the things to consider?
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Experts say the time to start worrying about the next
generation of owners and operators is as soon as the family
business becomes successful.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you feel your children or other relatives should make it
on their own, you might want to start planning and transferring
assets early. Death can be expense. Without proper planning, when
the owner dies, the heirs often have no choice but to sell the
business to pay federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a brief list of some of the things to consider and tools
to use to transfer the business:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tax-free gifts. The annual allowance to give $10,000 tax-free to
almost anyone is a favorite way to transfer family assets. If you
have a family business, ``you have a dual motive,'' said Ronald
Linder, a San Francisco CPA and attorney. ``You can shift future
appreciation of the assets and you can often claim a 30 to 50
percent discount on their value because it's a minority interest in
a nonmarketable security.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
The applicable credit. Formerly called the unified credit or the
lifetime exclusion from federal estate taxes, the amount rises this
year to $650,000 from $600,000 for individuals and to $1.3 million
from $1.2 million for married couples. By 2006, it will rise to $1
million for individuals and $2 million for couples, and can be used
during one's lifetime to transfer assets while they are still
appreciating.
</P>
<P>
   Many business owners with multimillion-dollar estates also take
advantage of the $1 million exemption ($2 million for couples) from
generation-skipping transfer taxes. Setting up a
generation-skipping trust reduces estate tax on the children's
estates by allowing assets to pass directly to their children.
</P>
<P>
   If you are giving shares in the family business, you will need a
fair-market appraisal from an experienced and qualified appraiser.
Because shares are minority interests, often without voting rights,
in a private business, you should be able to get a nice discount
from the fair-market value.
</P>
<P>
   Appraisals often are called for every time one makes a transfer.
But in practice, an appraisal often can last for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Because valuations are ``somewhere between an art and a
science,'' Napa Valley appraiser Hal Forcey recommends finding an
experienced, ethical appraiser with an excellent reputation in your
particular industry. Otherwise you could be on weak footing if
challenged by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The family-owned business deduction. Started in 1997, IRS Code
Section 2057 allows deductions of up to $675,000 for family-owned
businesses that meet certain qualifications. When the founder dies,
the heirs must continue to run the business for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Special Use Valuation. This IRS Code Section 2032A gives family
businesses as much as a $760,000 additional break this year on the
standard fair-market valuation of their real estate. For example,
if the highest and best use for a piece of property is residential
but it is being used for agriculture, the heirs can take the lower
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Business structure. How your company is organized is as important
to preserving your family business assets as tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Regular corporations, or C corporations, pay taxes on corporate
income and shareholders pay taxes on dividends. Partnerships,
limited liability companies and S corporations generally are not
subject to double taxation at the corporate and individual levels,
and income flows directly to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Some types of business organizations also shield owners more
effectively from legal liability and taxes. For example, property
put into family limited partnerships garner low valuations for tax
purposes because of lack of voting rights and the difficulty
selling partial interests in a private business.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Irrevocable life insurance trusts. These can be useful for creating
an ``alternative estate'' for family members who are not involved
in the business. Or they can be used to pay off estate taxes or for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Several other types of trusts can be used to shift assets to the
next generation while guaranteeing income for the founder,
according to Mark Watson, a partner with KPMG's National Tax
Practice in Washington, D.C. They include:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Granter trusts. Business-owner parents can sell stock in their
private company to a granter trust in exchange for a promissory
note with annual interest payments and a balloon payment of
principle at the end. This is a nontaxable event, and the advantage
is that any appreciation of the company and its assets above the
roughly 6 percent interest rate is shifted to the next generation
or other beneficiaries tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Granter retained annuity trusts. These are a variation on the same
theme. The granter transfers stock to the trust as a gift but
retains the right to receive an annual payment, or annuity, from
the trust. To the extent that the stock goes up in value more than
the interest rate, the excess appreciation similarly flows to the
beneficiaries of the trust tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from financial planning, you need to focus on who is going
to run the business after you are gone. If your relatives have the
interest and capability, great. If not, it might make sense to
bring in professionals to manage the business for them or sell it
and give your heirs the proceeds. It also is essential to establish
ways to resolve conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When family businesses work well, they are full of trust,
passion and fun,'' said Jack Cakebread of Cakebread Cellars in
Oakville, who has successfully transferred about 36 percent of his
Napa Valley winery to his family. ``But when they don't, they're
hell on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Estate planning is complicated and takes a lot of time. Most
likely, you will need to consult professionals though you might
want to start by doing some reading on your own.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo Press and IDG's Books for Dummies have some relevant books
on the topic. You also might check out ``The Family Business: Power
Tools for Survival, Success and Succession,'' ``Generation to
Generation: Life Cycles of the Family Business,'' ``The Survival
Guide for Business Families'' and ``Sustaining the Family Business:
An Insider's Guide to Managing Across Generations.
</P>
<P>
   Several online sites, including the Family Business Center
(www.fambiz.com), also have useful information.

 _ SF CHRON   DoubleClick to Buy NetGravity for $530 Million 
 &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Internet advertising firm DoubleClick Inc. boosted its standing as
a one-stop shop for clients by acquiring San Mateo's NetGravity
Inc. yesterday in an all-stock deal valued at about $530 million.
<P>
   The deal gives DoubleClick, which sells advertising space on a
network of 1,500 Web sites, the technical know-how to offer
customers the software they need to manage online ads.
</P>
<P>
   NetGravity will also provide DoubleClick with a solid customer
base including the likes of IBM, Time Inc. and E-Trade Group. And
the company boasts an established presence in Asia and Latin
America, where DoubleClick had yet to forge significant inroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it's a match made in heaven, but it's
pretty close,'' said Jeff Goverman, research director at Pacific
Crest Securities in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The NetGravity deal follows DoubleClick's $1 billion purchase
last month of Abacus Direct Corp., which provides
consumer-purchasing data to direct marketers like catalog
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the three pieces, it will be very hard to
duplicate this company,'' Goverman said. ``They can bring the right
ad to the right people at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   While that might be an exaggeration, it's not far off. The
NetGravity and Abacus acquisitions position DoubleClick as the
premier supplier of advertising resources in an e-commerce-hungry
world.
</P>
<P>
   Online advertising is expected to reach $3 billion this year,
according to market researcher Jupiter Communications. This would
be up more than $1 billion from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Spivey, NetGravity's president and CEO, said he had been
approached by DoubleClick's chief executive, Kevin O'Connor,
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey had only been on the job since April, having replaced
co-founder John Danner with a mandate to hasten NetGravity's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   He and DoubleClick's top brass met at a hotel in Burlingame last
Wednesday, and spent the ensuing days fleshing out terms of a
possible merger with investment bankers. The secret talks, Spivey
said, were code named ``Project Ice Cream Scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like ice cream,'' he noted. ``Someone on the
investment banking side liked ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, DoubleClick will issue 0.28 shares of
its common stock for each share of NetGravity stock. Based on
Monday's closing prices, this represents a 26-percent premium over
NetGravity's 30-day average price.
</P>
<P>
   NetGravity closed yesterday down $2 at $25.50, while DoubleClick
rose $2.50 to $96.50. Neither company has yet to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A combined offering is going to be very powerful, and no one
else will be able to offer the breadth and depth of what we have,''
Spivey said. ``We're going to be a very important company in this
space.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Spivey won't be on hand long to enjoy it. When the deal
is completed, probably in October, he has agreed to exit the stage.
``I'll have to get a new CEO job,'' he observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have relationships with most major Web
publishers and advertisers domestically and internationally,''
DoubleClick's O'Connor said in a statement. ``NetGravity's
strengths combined with DoubleClick's technology infrastructure and
Abacus Direct's data will create a company uniquely positioned to
be the overall leader in targeted advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry was definitely due for some consolidation,'' said
Rob Martin, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in
Arlington, Va. ``This is making it happen.''

THE DANGERS OF TAX CUTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the recent talk of cutting taxes, Congress rarely cuts
them when the economy is growing robustly, as it is now, and
unemployment is low. The worry among economists is that the extra
money in people's pockets may make an already strong economy too
strong, finally stoking inflation after a long period of relatively
stable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that danger is hardly mentioned in the rising public debate
over the Republican and Democratic proposals for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? In part, it is because the advocates of the tax cuts,
as well as many of the opponents, agree that any reductions will
probably be small, at least in the initial years. Few analysts
expect any final tax cut to come close to the $864 billion over the
next decade that has been proposed by House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the tax cut proposals are phased in gradually over a
number of years,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the chairman of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the author of a proposal to
cut taxes by $137 billion over 10 years, most of it toward the end
of the period. ``I think the immediate economic stimulus will be
small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, however, is concerned. ``If taxes were cut
while the nation's resources are highly employed, that would put
more pressure on monetary policy,'' Edward Gramlich, a Fed
governor, said. He suggested, in effect, that the Fed might have to
raise interest rates to prevent the extra spending that would
overstimulate the economy. Others worry that the higher rates might
reduce investment or bring down inflated stock prices, damaging the
economy through these avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices should already be reacting to the prospect of a tax
cut, some people say, but they have not so far because too many
people on Wall Street express doubt that tax cut legislation will
be enacted before next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of friends on Wall Street have asked me why the
markets are so quiet about the tax cut proposals,'' said James E.
Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. ``Wall Street
is unusually quiet because it realizes that there will just be
gridlock on this issue near-term _ a lot of proposals and no real
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gramlich's concern reflects a view widely shared among
economists _ that broad tax cuts, covering most Americans, tend to
stimulate spending and therefore should be reserved for recessions
or periods of slow growth. In the early 1960s, President Kennedy
proposed a tax cut in this spirit, and President Reagan's tax cuts,
which started during a recession, contributed to the long expansion
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, President Johnson's 10 percent income tax cut,
carrying through on the original Kennedy proposal, came when the
economy had turned from the weak Kennedy years to the much more
robust mid-1960s. The Fed responded by raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   The altered mix was damaging, says Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton
University economist who served as Fed vice chairman from 1994 to
1996. The new mix _ higher interest rates to offset more fiscal
stimulus from the tax cut and from stepped-up spending for Vietnam
and for Johnson's social programs _ shifted the economy toward
consumption and away from investment. Inflation also got a
foothold.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists argue that fiscal policy has lost its punch
since the 1960s while monetary policy has evolved to the point that
the Fed can regulate the economy through interest rate adjustments,
offsetting tax cuts without damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy administered by the Fed is far more important
as far as economic stabilization is concerned and regulating
aggregate demand,'' said James Gwertney, the Republican-appointed
chief economist for the Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Blinder disagrees. Monetary policy has its limits, he said. A
tax cut offset by higher interest rates ``would reverse the policy
mix that we have followed in the 1990s with such splendid effect:
low interest rates and high corporate investment,'' Blinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist and consultant, adds a
related reason for not using the budget surplus to finance tax
cuts, as both parties now propose. ``With the surplus, we could
have some timely fiscal action when the economy goes inevitably
into recession,'' he said. ``We would not for once have to worry
about deficit financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials argue that their more modest
tax cut proposal gets around the problem of encouraging too much
consumption. By offering incentives, particularly to the poor, to
invest the tax cuts in retirement accounts, they say, private
savings will rise, and the savings will then be available for
corporations to borrow and invest in productive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But many economists argue that such tax rebates would not go
dollar for dollar into retirement accounts. Upper-income people in
particular have the wherewithal to shift savings from one account
to another to qualify for a tax refund, which would then be spent
on consumer goods, according to this view. That has been the
experience with individual retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the supply-side view. For supply-siders, tax cuts _
particularly a Republican proposal to reduce the capital gains tax
on the profit made from the sale of stocks and other assets _
encourage investment by reducing its risk. While supply-siders are
a distinct minority among economists, they are a vocal one in the
incipient debate about a tax cut's impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, suppliers, not consumers, are the chief economic
actors. And suppliers respond to tax cuts by investing their
capital in new supply. Far from stimulating demand beyond an
economy's capacity, the supply-siders argue, a tax cut increases
the supply of goods and services, which are then consumed.
</P>
<P>
   No one pushes this view harder than Jude Wanniski, an economics
consultant and adviser to Steve Forbes and various other
Republicans involved in tax cutting proposals. ``The government, by
cutting tax rates, is simply removing the barrier to investment,''
he said.

 Intel's Earnings Take a Dip  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Intel reported quarterly sales and earnings yesterday that were
slightly below expectations, in part because the company succeeded
so well in its efforts to sell more cheap chips for low-cost PCs.
<P>
   The Santa Clara chip giant announced revenues of $6.7 billion
for its second quarter, which ended June 26. That is a 14-percent
increase from $5.9 billion in the same quarter a year ago, but 5
percent below first-quarter 1999 revenues of $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had forecast months ago that revenues would be flat or
down slightly compared to the first quarter, but the final figure
was, in the words of Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant, ``at the
lower end of this guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, a 49-percent
jump from $1.2 billion the same period last year, when Intel and
the PC industry were beset by excess inventory. But earnings were
down 13 percent from this year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were 51 cents per share, falling short of the 53 cents
analysts were expecting, according to First Call Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call for analysts, Intel Executive Vice
President Paul Otellini described the company's last two quarters
as ``a perfectly normal first half.'' He also said Intel looks
forward to ``a pretty good second half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues were below expectations, and it looks like it was
caused by average selling price coming down,'' said analyst Steve
Salopek of Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. ``They (Intel) went
after market share at the low end, and cut prices more than people
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst Mark Edelstone of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in San Francisco, the average selling price for Intel chips
in recent years has been between $205 and $215. ``In the second
quarter,'' he said, ``we believe it dropped to $207.''
</P>
<P>
   The price decline reflected increased sales of Intel's
entry-level chip, the Celeron. The company has priced the chip
aggressively in an effort to stop the market-share growth of its
principal competitor, Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale. In
recent quarters, AMD had been gaining ground by marketing its K6
chips to a growing roster of companies making low-end PCs for home
and small-business users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said they had succeeded in regaining market
share in this ``value segment,'' or low end. But they confirmed
that price cuts had reduced the average selling price for their
chips. Unit volumes were also down slightly compared to the first
quarter, a normal seasonal pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of declining prices, Intel managed to hold its gross
margins steady last quarter at 59 percent, and officials predicted
that for the full year the figure would rise to around 60 percent.
They credited across-the-board cost reductions, including a switch
to new packaging that makes the Celeron cheaper to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Otellini also cited strong increases in sales of the company's
current flagship product, the Pentium III. During the current
quarter, he predicted, unit sales of the chip will pass those of
its predecessor, the Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   He said Intel expects sales of the Xeon, a series of
Pentium-derived chips designed for powerful server computers, to
``lift a bit'' in the coming quarter. After a delay of more than
four months, the company will soon release a new set of related
chips that will allow PC-makers to combine eight Xeons in one
top-of-the-line system.
</P>
<P>
   If Intel's aggressive campaign to bolster its market share
weakened the company's bottom line, it did even more damage to AMD.
The Sunnyvale company will not report its results for the last
quarter until later today, but last month it warned investors to
expect losses of around $200 million because of lower shipments and
average prices.

 Pasqua Holders Feel Stiffed by Bankers Trust  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A small group of Pasqua Inc. shareholders is accusing Bankers
Trust, Pasqua's former controlling shareholder, of stiffing
minority investors when the San Francisco coffee chain was sold to
Starbucks earlier this year.
<P>
   A complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court accused
Bankers Trust of undervaluing Pasqua ``in order to avoid
jeopardizing a long-standing business relationship (with)
Starbucks.'' A Bankers Trust lawyer denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks paid $7.1 million for the 56-cafe chain in a deal that
became final March 1, according to the complaint. In the suit, led
by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that
the company's market value was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's
stock. They are accusing Bankers Trust, which owned 45 percent and,
they say, effectively controlled the board, of breaching its
fiduciary duty by not considering bids from Starbucks' rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasqua shareholders also contend that Bankers Trust failed
to disclose a conflict of interest: that an affiliate, BT Alex.
Brown, Starbucks' longtime investment bank, was advising Starbucks
on the Pasqua merger and receiving fees for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations are ``silly,'' said Peter Ostroff, a partner
with Sidley &AMP; Austin who represents Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor
group earlier this year to stop the merger. But the court allowed
the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they
received fair-market value for their shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the right to any relief other than an
appraisal,'' Ostroff said. ``If it turns out that the appraiser
agrees the price isn't fair, they'll get an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, which originally was filed in June, was amended
in a filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Tabacco, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said in a telephone
interview yesterday that Pasqua's board did not seriously consider
offers from other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Peet's Coffee &AMP; Tea of Emeryville offered $15
million for Pasqua in February, a month before the Starbucks deal
closed. Pasqua's board should have ``engaged in an auction to
obtain the best price, that's certainly an opportunity they had,''
said Tabacco, a partner with Berman, DeValerio, Pease &AMP; Tabacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Ostroff said the Peet's offer was ``too little, too late and
much too contingent'' on unknowns to scuttle the Starbucks deal.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee-industry source who conducted an independent valuation
of Pasqua two years ago said Starbucks' $7 million price tag ``is
not out of line'' with his assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pasqua had 1998 sales of $26.5 million and its Bay Area
stores were mostly healthy, its operations in New York and Los
Angeles were ``hemorrhaging money,'' this source said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, who served as Pasqua's chairman and chief executive
for many years, said he was the lone Pasqua board member to oppose
the Starbucks deal. Because shareholders never gathered for the
vote (which was conducted by mail), it was difficult to fight the
Starbucks acquisition before the deal closed, he said in a
telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman could not explain why investors holding the remaining
35 percent of Pasqua shares, including co-founder Martin Kupferman,
did not join in the suit. Kupferman could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tabacco said 90 percent of such cases end in settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Peet's did not return a telephone call. A spokesman for
Starbucks, which was named in the suit as the successor to Pasqua,
declined to comment.

CONTROVERSY ERUPTS ON EVE OF PBS FUNDING DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What had promised to be a triumph for public
broadcasting erupted into a bitter dispute Tuesday, as House
Republicans discovered that a Boston television station had
divulged its donor list to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a new era for the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who once
threatened to ``zero out'' funding for the public network, was
gone. Political support from both parties was at an all-time high.
House members were to work on a bill Wednesday that would give an
unprecedented $525 million in new funds to public broadcasters
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning Tuesday that Boston's WGBH-TV handed its
donor list to the Democratic Party earlier this year, several
Republicans on the House Commerce Committee shifted their stance,
demanding a reexamination of public broadcasting as a whole. Now,
instead of preparing to debate a funding increase, House members
are poised to again fight the so-called Battle of Big Bird over
whether to fund a system Republicans accuse of pandering to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been besieged with calls this afternoon from
Republicans wanting everything from reducing funding for public
broadcasting to providing criminal penalties. There are some
members who would like to sanction the station,'' said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana
Republican who is chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is, it undermines our effort to foster
bipartisan support for public broadcasting,'' Johnson added.
Johnson said Tauzin and Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, had ``worked
very hard in recent years to dispel the myth that public
broadcasting is a left-leaning, liberal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Johnson added, ``this type of activity by WGBH feeds all
the old stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at WGBH first admitted cooperating with the Democratic
Party more than two months ago. In May, a spokeswoman said some
recent hires at the station had initiated an informal swap with
Democrats, handing over the names of several thousand public
broadcasting donors in exchange for a comparable list of political
contributors. When the incident came to light, WGBH officials
apologized, saying it was in clear violation of station rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional fallout did not come until Tuesday, when a
copy of a May 8 Boston Globe article about the incident was
circulated by Republican staff members at a meeting of the House
Commerce subcommittee that oversees the funding. Immediately
afterward, several Republican members, who had remained quiet on
the issue, began lining up amendments _ a procedural maneuver that
could effectively put the authorization on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe funding for public broadcasting is going to
suffer,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey sounded more optimistic. Though describing what WGBH did
as ``wrong, and a mistake,'' he said it ``shouldn't interfere with
our ability to authorize funding for public broadcasting for the
entire United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The reauthorization bill would provide $400 million over five
years for public broadcasters to switch to a digital transmitting
system, which they are required by law to do by 2003. It would also
add approximately $175 million to the $350 million appropriation
that public broadcasting received last year. The money would go to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella organization
of the nation's public broadcasting stations, including the Public
Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The political explosion caught many public broadcasters by
surprise. Just last week, it appeared the funding for public
broadcasting would face far less opposition than ever before.
Democrats, Republicans, and media analysts said the climate in
Washington had noticeably changed since 1994, when Gingrich called
the national network of public radio and TV stations a ``little
sandbox for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   A massive public outcry followed earlier Republican threats to
kill the Public Broadcasting Service. WGBH says its donations
doubled in 1995 and 1996, with more than $1 million in new
contributions those years as opposed to the $500,000 in new
donations in years past. At the same time, public broadcasters
started to notice less resistance from Republicans, who many
believed discovered a suburban constituency that watched PBS and
listened to National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Monday, Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president for
communications at WGBH, described the prospects for public
broadcasting as ``much more positive than we ever expected.''
Tuesday night, she sounded far less upbeat as she learned of the
political tornado gathering speed on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were completely out front the minute it happened. It was a
mistake,'' Hopkins said. ``It doesn't seem all of public
broadcasting should be affected by one mistake at one station. This
was not a partisan act. It was an individual, human error.''

<P>
   WEIMAR, Texas _ The freight trains still rumble through town day
and night, but for the first time in weeks folks here don't have to
worry that one of them is carrying accused serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mexican fugitive's surrender to authorities Tuesday
morning in El Paso, this farm town of 2,300 residents in west
Colorado County can reclaim a semblance of its peaceful former
self.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where two of the eight victims thus far attributed to
Resendez-Ramirez were killed. The bodies of the Rev. Norman
``Skip'' Sirnic, 46, and his wife, Karen, 47, were found May 2 in
their home near the railroad tracks that bisect the town. They had
been bludgeoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a month later and only a few miles west of here in Fayette
County, 73-year-old Josephine Konvicka was murdered, presumably by
the same killer.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities mounted a nationwide manhunt, but the fear in this
town was that the elusive killer might return in the dead of night
to kill again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of families have been sleeping altogether in one room,
with the lights on and the doors double-locked, since this began,''
said Mayor Bennie Kosler. ``This (surrender) is a great thing to be
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon Tuesday, Kosler was just about talked out,
having been collared by almost every one of the dozen or more
out-of-town reporters prowling the town for reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was, in a word, relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought he'd give himself up,'' said Kosler, 67.
``Some of these guys can hide forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Crelier, a 66-year-old resident of nearby Columbus who
pastures cattle near Weimar, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure didn't think he'd ever surrender,'' Crelier said. ``A
lot of us figured he'd come back here a third time just to prove he
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney Kasper, owner of the local meat market, said he had kept
six guns _ a couple of pistols, three rifles and a shotgun, all
loaded _ at the ready in his house outside town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed everyone in my family where the guns were, just in
case they needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Leticia's Mexican Restaurant, waitresses Raquel Guerrero and
Ema Cedillo, whose homes are within a few blocks of the tracks,
were looking forward to being able to actually sleep through the
night hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I heard a noise at the window. My husband said it
was probably a cat, but I couldn't close my eyes the rest of the
night,'' Guerrero said. ``We're so glad this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   For Police Chief Bill Livingston, Tuesday was marked by
long-awaited phone calls to Lubbock and College Station in Texas,
then to Colorado and California to tell relatives of the Sirnics
that Resendez-Ramirez had been taken into custody. Later, the chief
drove to Houston for a news conference related to the suspect's
arrival and booking at the Harris County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from Santa Maria, Calif., Norman N. Sirnic,
the minister's 70-year-old father, said he had figured Tuesday
would be ``terrible'' because it had been the scheduled date for
his son and daughter-in-law to arrive there for a long-planned
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really feeling down today,'' he confessed. ``(But) it
turned out it's rather satisfying now that we have him in custody.
It bothered me this guy was still running loose and could kill
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirnic's son was the pastor at Weimar United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   From Lubbock, Anna Belle Mohr, the minister's mother, said she
was ``very pleased'' at news of the fugitive's surrender. But she
said her grief would linger: ``I would never wish this kind of pain
on anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she wasn't sure what punishment Resendez-Ramirez
deserves if he is convicted of murder, she said his alleged crimes,
in her view, ``just prove he's an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Weimar privately share that view, agreeing in so many
words with the opinion of Keith Foltermann, Karen Siric's brother
and a College Station-area game warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think society as a whole tends to look for excuses for
everybody,'' he said by phone. ``But some people are just bad.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the sorts of conflicting emotions people here expect
to be sorting through and trying to resolve for weeks to come. To
help in the process, city officials planned a community memorial
service for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the high school athletic
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling of celebration, I guess,'' Mayor Kosler
said. ``But before we celebrate I believe we should thank God this
was brought to an end.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 39-year-old Mexican drifter suspected of killing
eight people and striking fear in people who live along railroad
tracks throughout the south, surrendered peacefully Tuesday in El
Paso in an arrangement brokered by his sister and a rookie Texas
Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, referred to by the FBI as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez _
one of 30 aliases he has been known to use _ was whisked to Houston
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held on a burglary charge until authorities conduct
DNA tests that they say could link him to five slayings in Texas.
He already faces murder charges in two deaths in Illinois and one
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Devon Anderson, the assistant Harris County district attorney,
said Resendez-Ramirez will be arraigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest ended a six-week, nationwide manhunt for the man
authorities believe is the so-called railway serial killer, who on
June 21 was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, whose real name is believed to be Angel
Leoncio Reyes Resendiz, was accompanied by his brother as he rode
part way across an international bridge linking Juarez, Mexico, and
southeast El Paso. A second vehicle carried other relatives, and a
sister in the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the bridge
communicated with him by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet from the U.S. border, the pickup carrying
Resendez-Ramirez stopped and he walked to the border and
surrendered to Texas Ranger Sgt. Drew Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was quickly handcuffed and led away to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter told me that he extended his hand, they shook hands,
and he handcuffed him. He was very pleasant, not aggressive,'' said
Bruce Casteel, Department of Public Safety senior captain and
commander of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of law-enforcement officials took part in the search
for Resendez-Ramirez, and authorities throughout Texas received
reports of possible sightings of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But police acknowledged Tuesday that they were never certain of
his whereabouts until his dramatic arrival at the U.S. border
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the past few days, a special agent for
the FBI, a deputy United States Marshal and a Texas Ranger have
been negotiating for Ramirez's surrender,'' said FBI Special Agent
Don Clark of Houston. ``Mission accomplished, for the moment. ...
Law enforcement has done this country a great service by getting
this guy off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement thanking law enforcement
agencies for their work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans can rest easier knowing that law enforcement
authorities will bring the full force of the law to bear in this
case,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesman Mike Cox said the break in the case came during
the weekend when Carter received a call from Resendez-Ramirez's
sister while on a fishing trip to the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The sister, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., said she had been in
touch with Resendez-Ramirez through an intermediary, apparently
their brother.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and federal investigators met with the sister Sunday
night and Monday to discuss a surrender on a burglary warrant
related to the slaying of a doctor in the Houston suburb of West
University Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sister told Carter that he would only surrender to a Texas
Ranger, not any other officer,'' Cox said. ``This again really adds
to the Texas Ranger mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turned 32 Tuesday and has been a Ranger for less
than a year, had established a rapport with the sister, Cox said.
He had appeared for three consecutive weeks on the television show
``America's Most Wanted'' to discuss the search for
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender agreement included assurances that
Resendez-Ramirez will get a psychological evaluation, will be safe
in jail, and can be visited by his family, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not shield Resendez-Ramirez from the death penalty
if he is charged with capital murder in Texas, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Resendez-Ramirez would surrender to face the death
penalty, Casteel said, ``I've been in this business a very long
time, and I'm struggling to answer that myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brief court appearance in El Paso, Resendez-Ramirez was
handcuffed and chained around the waist. He was asked by Magistrate
James Carter if he had any questions about the burglary charge
against him and whether he had any other questions. Twice
Resendez-Ramirez responded softly, ``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then put on a small plane with Carter, another Ranger, an
FBI agent and a U.S. Marshal for the flight to Houston, and slept
for much of the flight, a DPS spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, he emerged from the plane wearing jeans, a striped
long-sleeved shirt and gold-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Resendez-Ramirez is charged with two murders in
Illinois and one in Kentucky, he apparently will be tried first in
Texas, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Resendez-Ramirez could be charged with ``probably at
least five'' Texas slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Resendez-Ramirez's arrest spread quickly in Weimar, a
community between Houston and San Antonio where he is suspected of
killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we didn't believe it, it was too good to be true,''
said Larry Wick, one of the owners of M-G Farm Service Center in
Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Since May 2 when Weimar minister Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 47, and
his wife, Karen, 47, were found dead in their home near the
railroad tracks, the community of about 2,000 has been jolted out
of its tranquil routine.
</P>
<P>
   The second blow came June 4 when Josephine Konvicka, 73, was
found slain in her Fayette County home about three miles from the
Sirnics'.
</P>
<P>
   Wick said his store normally sells four to six guns a month, but
sold 61 in June because people were afraid that the killer would
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a typical summer,'' Wick said. ``Normally,
late in the evening, you would see people out walking at night,
kids out playing in the yard. You haven't seen any of that. Doors
have been locked, people have been sleeping in one room. When you
have three murders in a town of 2,000, people get pretty worried.
Maybe now we can start relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Konvicka's 17-year-old grandson, Allen Konvicka of Schulenberg,
said he had borrowed a lawnmower from his grandmother about six
hours before authorities say she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his family were angered when reports surfaced
that Resendez-Ramirez had been in custody of the INS on June 2 _
before his grandmother was killed _ and then deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me mad, very mad,'' he said. ``They could have
locked him up and that would have been the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wick said the INS' release of Resendez-Ramirez ``basically cost
four more lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe an agency could do that, though we
understand the fact that they process a million-and-a-half coming
across the border,'' he said. ``We still couldn't understand how
they would let him slip through. I guess you could say the system
let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the Justice Department is
looking into why Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether
INS knew about Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being
contacted by local law enforcement earlier this year.''

HOUSTON HISPANICS BELIEVE RACIAL TENSIONS MAY ENDURE DESPITE
SUSPECT'S ARREST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Tilde needed over n in Trevino) 
 
By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
and MARIA LUISA PEREZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tuesday's arrest of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez came as a
particular relief to many Hispanics in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one Latino does something wrong, then people blame everyone
with dark skin,'' said Pablo Trevino, a restaurant worker from
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally!'' said Alberto, a painter who recently moved to
Houston from Honduras. ``He has made it more difficult to find
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the manhunt began, local immigrant-rights advocates say
police have begun stopping more Hispanics, some of whom said they
were mistaken for him.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Jimenez, local director of the American Friends Service
Committee, said racial tensions have increased because of
Resendez-Ramirez and the ensuing search for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office has been getting some terrible calls from people,
sounding mostly elderly, about Mexicans looking alike, saying they
were `small, dirty and ugly,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Resendez-Ramirez is now behind bars, Jimenez said the
tensions may endure, because it exacerbates two of the worst
stereotypes of immigrants: That they are violent criminals and
drifters who cross the border illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will say all Latinos are bad,'' said Santiago
Gaspar Bareno, a Guatemalan who works at a Mexican restaurant.
``The truth is, most of us are here because we want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexicans also expressed concern that Resendez-Ramirez may
be put to death if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't kill him,'' said Jose Luis Garanza, a native
of Mexico, which does not have the death penalty. ``They can give
him life in prison, but he's a human being, and he shouldn't be
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   A ranking official in the office of the Mexican president,
contacted in Mexico City, said the government would likely make a
diplomatic plea if Resendez-Ramirez is condemned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult case,'' said the official, who asked to
remain anonymous. ``But if he gets the death penalty we will almost
certainly ask that it be commuted to life in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodulfo Figueroa, Mexico's consul general in Houston, said
Resendez must be considered innocent until he has been tried and
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts in the United States still have to prove that he is
guilty,'' Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the consulate is prepared to provide him legal
assistance, but no special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do with him the same as with any other Mexican who is
in trouble,'' Figueroa said. ``We will contact him and help him in
his defense because he is for sure going to need legal help.''

MINORITY WOMEN ARE NOT GETTING TO THE TOP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the efforts of companies to diversify their top
management, many minority women say there are few cracks in the
``concrete ceiling,'' the social barriers that they say prevent
them from reaching the top of Corporate America. They are lagging
behind both white women and minority men in the kind of jobs they
hold and the pay they receive, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey, the largest of its kind, of minority women
managers and professionals found that many of these women view
their company's diversity programs as largely ineffective and say
opportunities have not improved over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have known intuitively, and this report validates
it, that women of color have not progressed at the same rate,''
said J.T. Childs Jr., the vice president for global work force
diversity at International Business Machines in Armonk, N.Y., who
was on the advisory board for the study.
</P>
<P>
   While companies have sought to employ and promote more women and
minorities, many have neglected the specific issues that concern
minority women, said Sheila W. Wellington, the president of
Catalyst, the New York not-for-profit group that conducted the
three-year study. Catalyst, which focuses on issues concerning
women managers and professionals, surveyed 1,735 black,
Asian-American and Hispanic women at 30 large U.S. companies and
conducted dozens of focus groups and individual interviews. The
study, which did not provide comparative data for minority men, was
financed by the Ford Foundation and 18 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau of Labor statistics, although they do not specifically
address Asian-American women, indicate that minority women managers
and professionals are earning less than their white and male
counterparts. Black and Hispanic women have seen the gap widen over
the last five years. In 1998, for example, Hispanic women made
roughly 60 percent of what white male managers did, while they made
nearly 70 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are engaged in talking to women of color at your
corporation, this is the kind of thing you hear. You may not like
to hear it,'' said Paul A. Allaire, the chairman of Xerox and a
Catalyst board member, who said the company modified its programs
once it realized that programs focusing on women and minorities
were not addressing the specific needs of minority women.
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly competitive and diverse labor market, and
faced with the changing profile of its customers, more and more
businesses are struggling with the need to hire minorities,
including women, and to make sure they stay. ``Our customer base
includes a strong representation of minority women,'' said Stephen
W. Sanger, the chief executive of General Mills Inc. ``Our talent
pool is that same group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's most dramatic findings center on the usefulness of
diversity programs. While three-quarters of the 500 largest U.S.
companies have some sort of policy or program in place to encourage
diversity, according to Catalyst, they are not viewed as an
effective force of change. Slightly more than half of the minority
women surveyed thought that the diversity programs failed to
address subtle racism or sexism in the workplace, compared with a
third that agreed that diversity programs at their company created
a supportive environment. Only 26 percent said they thought career
development was an important aspect of diversity programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Catalyst has long studied the advancement of women, the
study and the experiences of some of the companies make clear that
minority women do not necessarily benefit from general initiatives
to foster diversity. At Motorola Inc., for example, the push to
advance women in the early  &UR; ' &LR; 90s did little to help minority
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were moving women, but we were basically moving white
women,'' said Roberta Gutman, the vice president and director for
global diversity at Motorola, one of the three executives invited
by Catalyst to talk about the findings at a news conference
Tuesday. By 1995, only two or three of the 25 women vice presidents
were minorities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Motorola began to focus on the issue of making sure
minority women were promoted and included in its executive ranks
did the company make progress: it now now has 11 vice presidents
who are minority women out of its 54 women vice presidents, Ms.
Gutman said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalyst also found striking differences among white women and
minority women in their perceptions of the progress that has been
made. In similar surveys, 60 percent of white women thought that
there had been improvements in their opportunities over the last
five years, while only 47 percent of minority women agreed.
</P>
<P>
   What many minority women say hinders them from advancing,
according to Catalyst, is the lack of a mentor or the chance to
network informally with colleagues. Even joining in a simple game
of golf can be challenging, as one of the panelists, Karen Fukuma,
the chief financial officer the Lotus Development Corp., which is
owned by IBM, recounted. ``I never have been given an opportunity
to play with the men since I have been at IBM for 20 years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The message for companies, Ms. Wellington said, is that managers
must step in to help minority women navigate organizational
politics and plan their careers. ``Managers of women of color must
receive training and support from managers and corporate leaders so
they can be both mentor and manager,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other concern voiced by minority women is that their
companies are paying little more than lip service to the issue.
Less than 20 percent of the minority women surveyed said that their
managers were held accountable for or rewarded for their efforts to
advance minority women.
</P>
<P>
   The study also highlighted significant differences among
different minority groups. ``Most corporate programs approach women
of color as a monolithic group,'' Ms. Wellington said. While the
majority of African-American women surveyed felt as if they were
stereotyped, for example, Asian-American women are least likely
among minority women to be supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a national issue. The monochromatic, monolithic
company will not survive into the future,'' she said. ``It will not
be ready for the future.''

BIG GUYS WEREN'T ALL ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enough about the All-Stars. What about the All-Stars of
All-Stars?
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer can say he's an All-Star. Hey, he's got the uniform
to prove it. Well, no offense, Ron, but if you wanted to see some
serious All-Stars, you should have been at the Grand Ballroom of
the Sheraton Tuesday afternoon. Hank Aaron. Willie Mays. Bob
Gibson. Brooks Robinson. Tom Seaver. Warren Spahn. Ernie Banks.
Mike Schmidt. Bob Feller. Stan Musial. These are the kind of guys
who,when it came time to see whether they got into Cooperstown,
they didn't count the votes. They weighed 'em.
</P>
<P>
   They're all in town as part of Major League Baseball's next big
promotion. Effective immediately, you can vote for the Major League
Baseball All-Century Team from a list of the top 100 players of all
time, as chosen by the proverbial panel of experts. The final team
will be announced at World Series time.
</P>
<P>
   This 20th century list includes seven active players (Barry
Bonds, Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey, Tony Gwynn, Rickey Henderson,
Mark McGwire, and Cal Ripken). It also includes 12 players who
logged at least some time for the Red Sox and six who performed for
the Braves. One thing every one of the 27 retired players who were
on hand agreed upon was that whichever era they played in
constituted the Good Old Days compared to the micromanaged mess
baseball is today.
</P>
<P>
   We can safely say, for example, that we will never again have
the opportunity for a pair of pitching greats to compare
recollections of their epic 1-0, 16-inning confrontation decided by
a Mays home run. Nowadays a 16-inning scoreless game would involve
about 10 pitchers. This one needed only two. Hall of Famer Juan
Marichal won it. Hall of Famer Warren Spahn lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the ninth inning,'' recalls Marichal, ``and I told
(manager) Alvin Dark to let me go two more innings. Then it was one
more and one more, and when I got to the 15th I said, `I'm 22 years
old and he's 42, and I'm not coming out before he does!' Then I
find out he's telling his manager (Bobby Bragan), `That little kid
isn't going to beat me, so I'm going to stay in, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mays settled things with his homer, and Spahn still isn't
comfortable with that. He won 363, but the 364th would have been
something to cherish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Juan in trouble several times,'' moans Spahn. ``I, for
one, led off one inning with a double. But the next three men
couldn't get the ball out of the infield. The more trouble Juan was
in, the tougher he got. So next time we meet, I'm going to beat his
ass!''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Aaron grabs the microphone. ``Warren,'' he says
with a laugh, ``you couldn't score from second on a single. To get
you in, we'd have needed two more hits to score you.''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later Marichal, a.k.a. the ``Dominican Dandy,'' was
back out there. ``I always pitched every fourth day,'' Marichal
says. ``That was the only time in my career I was given an extra
day's rest before I made my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but these guys played when men were men and no one ever
heard of a pitch count. Nor did batters whine about someone
pitching inside. Someone asked Frank Robinson, for example, if he
would ever even think about donning the medieval armor the Mo
Vaughns and others do when they stride to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never!'' barks Robinson, who spent more than 20 years hanging
himself over the plate, daring pitchers to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I put it (his elbow) out there, I should pay the price,''
he explains, ``and the price is pain. And you never let the pitcher
know you're hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all macho those-were-the-days talk, either. The
Legends were as caught up in the majesty of Mark McGwire's
astonishing long-ball exhibition Monday night as anyone else.
``What rockets!'' exclaimed Harmon Killebrew, the gentlemanly
slugger who struck more sheer terror in the hearts of Red Sox
pitchers facing him in Fenway than any other righthand batter
during a good 12-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Killebrew used to put some pretty good wood to baseballs
himself. One adolescent recollection of a Killebrew blast evoked a
frustrating memory from the great Minnesota slugger. It was a hot
Sunday afternoon in June 1965. It was also Yankee Stadium Bat Day,
producing a mammoth crowd of 71,244, a significant portion of which
was a walk-up deal. Those sitting in the bleachers will never
forget the sight of Killebrew one-hopping the 457-foot sign in
Death Valley for the world's most outrageous ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember that?'' he beams. ``I remember pulling into third
base. I don't remember who the third-base umpire was, but he said
the ball had bounced over the fence and I'd have to go back. I
couldn't believe it. I said, `Can't I at least have a ground-rule
triple?' ''
</P>
<P>
   These are not the kind of stories you get when you're dealing
with ordinary stars, or even ordinary garden variety All-Stars. The
men in our midst Tuesday did what they did in italics and uppercase
bold face. If the 60 players fortunate enough to be selected for
this year's All-Star Game drink their milk to the bottom of the
glass, look both ways before crossing, and say their prayers every
night, why they, too, might grow up to be as revered and respected
as the men on the Top 100 list.
</P>
<P>
   And within the Top 100 there are further gradations, as one of
the whippersnappers on the list readily acknowledges. Paul Molitor,
the quintessentially classy ballplayer of his generation, cannot
believe that by the simple expedient of alphabetical placement he
found himself sitting next to Willie Mays in such a gathering.
``You can't imagine when you start out in the sandlots that 35
years later you'll be sitting there as one of the 100 greatest
players,'' Molitor says. ``It's unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more star struck is a man who is known for his haughtiness.
This All-Star business has been a moving experience for Carlton
Fisk, by nature the very personification of the flinty,
unimpressionable New Englander. Being named to be the honorary
captain of the American League was thrilling enough. But when he
found out he was going to be on this ballot as one of the Top 100,
he almost lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of that,'' Pudge told Matt Damon, ``I get
goosebumps.'' For emphasis, Damon says, Fisk stuck out his forearm.
It was laden with goosbumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best,'' says Fisk. ``But, hey, I should make that
list. I played my 12 games a year in high school. That's where I
got my expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he got it, wherever they all got it, they most
definitely had it. Imagine walking into a ballpark and seeing
Marichal and Spahn matching zeros for 15-plus and Willie Mays _
Willie Mays! _ ending it with one swing. Talk about goosebumps.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Mexican fugitive suspected of killing eight people
in three states, avoiding capture by hopping freight trains,
surrendered peacefully on Tuesday in El Paso, after members of his
family negotiated his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the suspect, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old
drifter from Mexico, walked across a bridge from Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, to turn himself in, he had become the most-wanted fugitive
in two countries, a man the authorities here say could be
responsible for many more murders than those for which he has been
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The search for him involved thousands of investigators around
the country and in Mexico, who despite an endless supply of tips,
were often thrown off the trail by an elusive suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was a simple telephone call from his sister
who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., to a Texas ranger, Andrew Carter,
who told the ranger, ``We need to talk,'' according to Mike Cox, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought her brother was ready to surrender,'' said Cox,
who would not reveal the sister's name.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Resendez-Ramirez would surrender even though he faces
the death penalty if convicted, Bruce Casteel, commander of the
Texas Rangers, said, ``I've been in this business a very long time,
and I'm struggling to answer that myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors, however, agreed to allow Resendez-Ramirez to
have family members visit him in jail and to have a psychological
examination.
</P>
<P>
   For months leading to the surrender, news of Resendez-Ramirez's
alleged exploits terrified people living and working near railroad
tracks, especially in Texas, where five of the eight victims were
found over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   When he struck, said the authorities who knew him as ``the
railroad killer,'' the anonymity of freight yards and rails
provided a safe backdrop. Federal and state investigators, who have
collaborated on one of the biggest manhunts in recent years, say
the proximity to railyards of the five deaths in Texas, plus one
other, two years ago in Kentucky, has been one of the most obvious
similarities in building cases against Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   But other evidence also convinced investigators that the murders
were committed by the same person, including the means by which the
victims were killed _ savage beating with blunt objects _ and
fingerprints and other evidence that the authorities say tie the
killings to Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   And the authorities say he could be responsible for many other
deaths. Don Clark, an agent with the FBI in Houston, told reporters
on Tuesday afternoon that since Resendez-Ramirez's surrender ``50
to 60 other police departments have requested information to see if
he is connected to unsolved murders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used every tool possible to make this come about,'' Clark
added of the capture of Resendez-Ramirez, who was added to the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List on June 21. ``But we're not finished in
this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The big break in the case came through the telephone call on
Sunday night to the Texas Rangers, which is the state police, from
Resendez-Ramirez's sister, said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the
Houston Department of Public Safety. ``She said he wanted to come
in.''
</P>
<P>
   That conversation led to others between Ranger Carter and the
sister as well as with other relatives of Resendez-Ramirez's in the
United States. Ms. Mange said that a written agreement was drafted
that outlined terms of a surrender, and the family accepted late
Monday night or early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities stressed on Tuesday that they made no promises
to Resendez-Ramirez that he would avoid execution by surrendering.
Since the death penalty was declared constitutional in 1976, Texas
has put more inmates to death, 180, than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement in place, Resendez-Ramirez walked across the
bridge into El Paso early on Tuesday morning to give himself up.
Later, the authorities flew him here, where he was placed in the
Harris County jail in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Handcuffed when taken into custody, Resendez-Ramirez looked
tired and wan as he appeared before a state magistrate in El Paso
on a pending burglary charge from the Houston area. He wore a
wrinkled blue-stripped shirt, tattered blue jeans and aviator-style
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   He looked no different, although perhaps a little more tired, as
he emerged from a twin-engine state plane that flew him into
Houston. The authorities said he slept for part of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   He was questioned by law-enforcement officials at the Houston
police department on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he is expected to face murder charges, stemming from the
five killings in Texas that investigators say he is linked to.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently facing two murder charges in Illinois in
connection with the June 15 shotgun slayings of an elderly man and
his daughter. Another murder charge is pending in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy was to put as much pressure as we could on this
individual so that he would have no place to hide,'' Clark said.
``The investigation left no place to turn.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the search for Resendez-Ramirez exasperated
federal authorities in the United States _ even though Border
Patrol agents picked him up on June 2 and released him into Mexico.
They apparently did not know that the FBI was searching for him and
that the Houston police had told the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that Resendez-Ramirez was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after he was released, a 73-year-old woman from Fayette
County, Texas, Josephine Konvicka, was found beaten to death in her
home. And a day later, Noemie Dominguez, 26, a Houston
schoolteacher, was found beaten to death in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her car was found in Del Rio, a Texas border town, with
fingerprints that the authorities say could be Resendez-Ramirez's.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Resendez-Ramirez had remained a
mysterious figure. Even his true identity was uncertain since
investigators say he has used more than 30 aliases. Born in the
Mexican city of Puebla, he first entered the United States
illegally in 1976, when he was arrested in Brownsville by INS
agents.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 23 years, Resendez-Ramirez led the life of a
transient, illegally jumping freight cars from Mexico into the
United States. His adventures carried him from Vermont to
California, and he bounced in and out of federal prisons and local
jails on a long string of immigration violations and other minor
non-violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his non-violent history, investigators say they have
linked him through physical evidence, including fingerprints in
some of the cases, to the five Texas killings as well as the
slayings in Illinois and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The first murder occurred on Aug. 29, 1997, when Christopher
Maier was killed along the railroad tracks in Lexington. Maier's
girlfriend was raped and beaten but survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Maier case remained unsolved and Resendez-Ramirez had
apparently not yet emerged as a suspect in 1998. He was stopped by
border agents and deported six times that year, the last in April.
Eight months later, the first of the five related Texas murders
occurred when Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, was raped and stabbed to
death inside her home in West University Place on Dec. 17, 1998.
Then, on April 30, the Rev. Norman Sirnic and his wife, Karen, were
bludgeoned with a sledgehammer inside their home in Weimar, Texas.
Fingerprints and other evidence linked Resendez-Ramirez to the
crime, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   But the big break came Sunday. Cox, the spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety, said that Ranger Carter had first
visited the suspect's sister about two or three weeks ago at her
home in Albuquerque and had remained in regular telephone contact
with her. At the same time, the sister apparently had contacted
another brother in Mexico who knew the whereabouts of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of receiving the cellular call on his fishing trip,
Carter flew to Albuquerque with an FBI agent and a U.S. Marshal to
meet with the sister. By Monday, an agreement had been drafted by
the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston that
offered the suspect and his family three things: a pledge of safety
in the Harris County jail, the promise of regular visits from his
family and a full psychological examination.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that winning the trust of Resendez-Ramirez's sister was
essential in breaking the case. He said that Carter, 32, ``was able
to build up some rapport and trust with them'' and ultimately his
siblings and a family minister convinced the suspect to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark was noncommital when asked if the sister would
receive the $125,000 reward offered in the case, other officials
said it appeared that she would.

 _ SF CHRON//CORRECTS HEADLINE   Intel's Earnings Miss Mark 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Intel reported quarterly sales and earnings yesterday that were
slightly below expectations, in part because the company succeeded
so well in its efforts to sell more cheap chips for low-cost PCs.
<P>
   The Santa Clara chip giant announced revenues of $6.7 billion
for its second quarter, which ended June 26. That is a 14-percent
increase from $5.9 billion in the same quarter a year ago, but 5
percent below first-quarter 1999 revenues of $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had forecast months ago that revenues would be flat or
down slightly compared to the first quarter, but the final figure
was, in the words of Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant, ``at the
lower end of this guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for the second quarter were $1.7 billion, a 49-percent
jump from $1.2 billion the same period last year, when Intel and
the PC industry were beset by excess inventory. But earnings were
down 13 percent from this year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were 51 cents per share, falling short of the 53 cents
analysts were expecting, according to First Call Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call for analysts, Intel Executive Vice
President Paul Otellini described the company's last two quarters
as ``a perfectly normal first half.'' He also said Intel looks
forward to ``a pretty good second half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenues were below expectations, and it looks like it was
caused by average selling price coming down,'' said analyst Steve
Salopek of Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. ``They (Intel) went
after market share at the low end, and cut prices more than people
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst Mark Edelstone of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter in San Francisco, the average selling price for Intel chips
in recent years has been between $205 and $215. ``In the second
quarter,'' he said, ``we believe it dropped to $207.''
</P>
<P>
   The price decline reflected increased sales of Intel's
entry-level chip, the Celeron. The company has priced the chip
aggressively in an effort to stop the market-share growth of its
principal competitor, Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale. In
recent quarters, AMD had been gaining ground by marketing its K6
chips to a growing roster of companies making low-end PCs for home
and small-business users.
</P>
<P>
   Intel officials said they had succeeded in regaining market
share in this ``value segment,'' or low end. But they confirmed
that price cuts had reduced the average selling price for their
chips. Unit volumes were also down slightly compared to the first
quarter, a normal seasonal pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of declining prices, Intel managed to hold its gross
margins steady last quarter at 59 percent, and officials predicted
that for the full year the figure would rise to around 60 percent.
They credited across-the-board cost reductions, including a switch
to new packaging that makes the Celeron cheaper to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Otellini also cited strong increases in sales of the company's
current flagship product, the Pentium III. During the current
quarter, he predicted, unit sales of the chip will pass those of
its predecessor, the Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   He said Intel expects sales of the Xeon, a series of
Pentium-derived chips designed for powerful server computers, to
``lift a bit'' in the coming quarter. After a delay of more than
four months, the company will soon release a new set of related
chips that will allow PC-makers to combine eight Xeons in one
top-of-the-line system.
</P>
<P>
   If Intel's aggressive campaign to bolster its market share
weakened the company's bottom line, it did even more damage to AMD.
The Sunnyvale company will not report its results for the last
quarter until later today, but last month it warned investors to
expect losses of around $200 million because of lower shipments and
average prices.

SEAVER SOUR ON PITCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It is an endless debate but you hear it a lot these
days. Today's pitchers just don't have it when compared to the
heros of the 60s and 70s. And when Tom Seaver says so, you listen.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Seaver is living in past glory. He is a
broadcaster for the New York Mets, and his views are as respected
today as they were during his 20-year career, which ended in Boston
in 1986. Seaver is a fan of Pedro Martinez, whom he declared a
``throwback'' to the breed of pitchers once common in the major
leagues . . . talented and smart.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not so sure about the rest of the class of 1999, which
includes some of the highest-paid pitchers in baseball history.
They are giving up runs and base hits at almost a disgraceful rate.
Why? Most of them just don't understand what pitching is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are the hitters so successful?'' said Seaver, who was in
town with several other Hall of Famers who were named to the
All-Century team that was honored in Boston Tuesday as part of the
70th All-Star celebration. ``I think it's bad pitching. Pitchers
don't get enough innings in the minor league. They're afraid to
throw inside. It's the intimidation factor. Pitchers are doing a
lot of basic things wrong. I see more 2-0, 3-0, 3-1 counts. They're
giving hitters more chances to hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person who loves his trade, it's embarrassing for me.
It's bad for the pitching fraternity. If you give Mark McGwire a
2-0, 3-1 count in the same at bat, you're going to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a theme heard often Tuesday from Hall of Fame players
assembled by Major League Baseball. Seaver, who posted a 311-205
record and appeared in 10 All-Star Games, Bob Gibson, and Warren
Spahn were just three pitchers who beat teams the old-fashioned
way. They challenged you.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't jam people anymore,'' said Spahn, baseball's
all-time winningest lefthander. ``I've seen McGwire play and I
admired him because he was strong. I know what I would have done.
If his bat was over the plate, I worked inside. But today you just
don't see inside pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ownership has encouraged this. They lowered the mound
and made the ball livelier. The turf has hurt pitching and it's
tough on defensive people. It goes back to the days of Babe Ruth.
Yankee Stadium was constructed the way it was because owners
believed that people wanted to see home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, another Hall of Famer, agreed that the delicate
balance between hitters and pitchers has changed the past two
decades, and baseball has suffered because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing,'' said Robinson. ``Today's pitchers would
have a hard time measuring up to Seaver. He was a professional
pitcher. There's a difference between pitching and throwing. You
saw more pitching in those days. Today you see more throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw more throwing inside. But when I played, pitchers had
the right to throw inside. That was part of the game. Today, the
hitters don't think that pitchers have the right to even throw
inside. They want the ball over the plate. If you throw inside on
the plate, hitters get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson added that rules that allow hitters to wear ``armor''
to the plate doesn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day you'll see a World Series decided by a ball thrown
into the padding,'' said Robinson. ``It'll be two out, bottom of
the ninth, and the bases loaded. The hitter will just stick out his
padded arm. The game will be over and everybody will be yelling
foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver said there might be more professional pitchers if today's
crop could spend more time in the minors. But don't count on it
happening soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they babied? Yes. And there is no single reason,'' said
Seaver. ``I think that organizations want to protect their players
without understanding what a higher degree of excellence they can
get if you put more demands on them. They need to understand there
are mechanical things you can do. But the limitations today are so
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver believes Martinez is one of those pitchers who has done
his apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Red Sox came to New York recently, I was with the
Mets as an announcer and needed to get someone for an interview,''
he said. ``I looked over and Pedro was standing about 10 feet away
talking to somebody in the runway. I knew everybody was after him
but I called out, `Pedro.' He stopped and came over and took my
hand and shook it. I knew then he understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best pitcher around and yet he knows you can see
there is more than him starting an All-Star Game. He realizes that
he is a part of history and there are people before you and people
coming after you. He was already a good pitcher when he came here.
In Boston, he's shown he has some personality and smarts. That's
what's made him an outstanding pitcher.''

   Christopher Maier, 21, of North Canton, Ohio. The University of
Kentucky student and his girlfriend left a party on Aug. 29, 1997,
and walked along Norfolk Southern railroad tracks about a mile from
the Lexington campus. A man jumped from the darkness and demanded
money from Maier and his girlfriend, whose name has been withheld.
Maier was bludgeoned to death while the 20-year-old woman was
raped, beaten and left for dead but survived. DNA evidence linked
Resendez-Ramirez to the attack, authorities said. The woman has
recovered from her injuries, including a broken jaw and a crushed
eye socket, and is considering returning to school.

   Dr. Claudia Gabriella Benton, 39, of Houston. Her husband and
twin daughters were traveling out of state, leaving Benton alone in
her home, near railroad tracks, in the wealthy Houston enclave of
West University Place on Dec. 17, 1998. A Baylor College of
Medicine physician, Benton was undergoing training in genetics. She
was found sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten to death, a
butcher knife beside her body. Her Jeep Cherokee was later found
abandoned in San Antonio. Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint was on the
vehicle.

   Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 47, and his wife Karen, 47, of
Weimar near Houston. The bodies of the popular Church of Christ
minister and his wife, the church secretary, were discovered May 2
in their Weimar home. They had been fatally beaten with a
sledgehammer as they slept. Authorities found their stolen 1998
Mazda pickup in nearby San Antonio. Forensic evidence reportedly
links the suspect to their murder.

   Josephine Konvicka, 73, a widow, who lived between Weimar and
Schulenburg. Her only company was an old dog that was nearly deaf
and couldn't bark. The mother of a Houston policeman, she died from
a single blow to the head while in her bed June 4. Her house is
about three miles from the Sirnics' home. The suspect tried but
failed to steal Konvicka's Dodge Spirit. He apparently couldn't
find the keys and was unable to hotwire it. His fingerprint
reportedly was found in Konvicka's home. Dogs tracked the suspect's
scent to nearby railroad tracks.

   Noemi Dominguez, 26, of Houston. The bilingual teacher from the
South Texas town of La Feria was found dead on June 5 from a fatal
blow to her head. Railroad tracks run behind her house.
Resendez-Ramirez's fingerprint was found in her 1993 Honda Civic,
which was abandoned near a border crossing in Del Rio. Traces of
Dominguez's blood were found in Konvicka's home, indicating that
Dominguez's slaying might have occurred first.

   George Morber, 79, and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 51, of
Gorham, Ill. After 30 years as a prison guard, Morber retired to a
house on the Mississippi about 100 yards from a railroad track in
Gorham in southern Illinois. On June 14, he took his ailing wife to
the hospital. The next day, Morber was mortally wounded in the head
with a shotgun and his daughter, Carolyn Frederick, 51, was beaten
to death. Morber's truck was recovered June 16 in Cairo, Ill.,
about 60 miles away. While investigating the double slaying, the
local sheriff noticed a train passing nearby and recalled that the
serial killer had slain several people along railroad tracks. He
requested fingerprint records from Texas and ``one of the prints
matched'' Resendez-Ramirez, said Jackson County Sheriff William
Kilquist.

ANALYSIS: `WHAT IS CHINA?' TAIWAN'S NEW ANSWER IS PUZZLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ What in the world is Taiwan's president up to?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that puzzled countless government officials,
scholars and common people in China and Taiwan on Tuesday, many of
them surprised by the news that the president, Lee Teng-hui, had
suddenly changed the island's official stance toward China by
dropping his Nationalist government's long-standing premise that
Taiwan and the mainland are parts of the same country.
</P>
<P>
   Danger was the first word in many minds, because tampering with
Taiwan's political status is akin to tweaking a hornet's nest,
easily provoking military action from Beijing, where eventual
reunification with Taiwan is considered a patriotic imperative.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China have acted independently of each other for the
50 years since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces retreated to
the island, defeated by the Communists in a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But any hint that Taiwan is moving toward a formal declaration
of independence rings loud alarm bells in Beijing. Lee's shift
inevitably complicates relations between Beijing and Washington,
which itself continues to abide by the one-China formula, and local
politics in Taiwan, where a presidential campaign is getting under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lee seems to be looking farther afield. Expected to step
down next spring after 12 years in office, a time of remarkable
transition in Taiwan from an authoritarian state to an economically
lively democracy, Lee appears to want to cement his legacy as the
father of a modern Taiwan separate from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and scholars who have followed the career of Lee,
Taiwan's first native-born president, say he is driven by a
overwhelming sense of mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Teng-hui in his heart is a romantic,'' said Fung
Hu-hsiang, a Taiwan legislator who opposes Lee's moves away from
China. ``In his later years, his sense of mission is pushing him to
clarify Taiwan's role with the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fung, a political opponent of Lee's who believes the policy
shift is potentially disastrous, cited another possibility echoed
by several political analysts: Lee may want to create a crisis to
justify a postponement of next year's election so that he can
remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, China launched several missiles into the ocean
near Taiwan in what was officially described as a military exercise
but was clearly intended to intimidate voters who were about to
cast votes in Taiwan's first free presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being intimidated, anxious voters rallied around
Lee, giving him an overwhelming victory. It was a risky strategy,
but Lee apparently reasoned that the chances of a military invasion
by China were slight, and he was proved right.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's like 1996 again, and missiles are raining down, he
could try to justify staying on,'' said Chang Ling-chen, a
political science professor at National Taiwan University. ``If
China is smart, they won't respond so strongly this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's new move came on Saturday when he said in a German radio
interview that China and Taiwan should deal with each other on a
``state to state'' basis, implying that they are two separate
countries. On Monday, a government spokesman, clarifying Lee's
remarks, went a step further and dropped the ``one China'' idea
that has guided China-Taiwan ties, effectively giving up the notion
of eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   It all complicates Taiwan presidential politics, perhaps most
notably for James Soong, the popular former official from Lee's
Nationalist Party, who is expected to run as an independent.
Soong's position on relations with Beijing is less than clear, and
a new focus on the issue could damage him.
</P>
<P>
   But of paramount concern to outsiders is the reaction from
Beijing, whose long-held official position is that reunification of
the motherland is a historical necessity and that it will use
military force to achieve it if negotiations fail. Short of
military action, China could apply economic pressure on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run media Tuesday issued some of the vitriol that
has come to be expected on this issue from the Communist
authorities, who called Lee's move ``a monumental disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Beijing's public response was not as harsh as could have
been. Zhang Qiyue, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, sidestepped
several questions about Taiwan, suggesting that China's leadership
is mulling a course of action, which could take some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably trying to figure out what Lee is doing, and
why he is doing it now,'' said an international relations scholar
in Beijing, who felt the topic too sensitive to be quoted by name.
``They may think the U.S. is behind him, telling him what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, U.S. diplomats here seemed as surprised as anyone by
Lee's move, which counters Washington's efforts to push Taiwan and
China into meaningful discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A critical meeting is scheduled for October in Taiwan with
China's top Taiwan negotiator, Wang Daohan, who would be the most
senior official from Beijing to visit since the civil war ended in
1949. Whether that meeting will be held is now in doubt.

CONTROVERSY ERUPTS ON EVE OF PBS FUNDING DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What had promised to be a triumph for public
broadcasting erupted into a bitter dispute Tuesday, as House
Republicans discovered that a Boston television station had
divulged its donor list to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a new era for the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who once
threatened to ``zero out'' funding for the public network, was
gone. Political support from both parties was at an all-time high.
House members were to work on a bill Wednesday that would give an
unprecedented $525 million in new funds to public broadcasters
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But after learning Tuesday that Boston's WGBH-TV handed its
donor list to the Democratic Party earlier this year, several
Republicans on the House Commerce Committee shifted their stance,
demanding a reexamination of public broadcasting as a whole. Now,
instead of preparing to debate a funding increase, House members
are poised to again fight the so-called Battle of Big Bird over
whether to fund a system Republicans accuse of pandering to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been besieged with calls this afternoon from
Republicans wanting everything from reducing funding for public
broadcasting to providing criminal penalties. There are some
members who would like to sanction the station,'' said Ken Johnson,
a spokesman for Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana
Republican who is chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is, it undermines our effort to foster
bipartisan support for public broadcasting,'' Johnson added.
Johnson said Tauzin and Representative Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, had ``worked
very hard in recent years to dispel the myth that public
broadcasting is a left-leaning, liberal organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Johnson added, ``this type of activity by WGBH feeds all
the old stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at WGBH first admitted cooperating with the Democratic
Party more than two months ago. In May, a spokeswoman said some
recent hires at the station had initiated an informal swap with
Democrats, handing over the names of several thousand public
broadcasting donors in exchange for a comparable list of political
contributors. When the incident came to light, WGBH officials
apologized, saying it was in clear violation of station rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional fallout did not come until Tuesday, when a
copy of a May 8 Boston Globe article about the incident was
circulated by Republican staff members at a meeting of the House
Commerce subcommittee that oversees the funding. Immediately
afterward, several Republican members, who had remained quiet on
the issue, began lining up amendments _ a procedural maneuver that
could effectively put the authorization on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe funding for public broadcasting is going to
suffer,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey sounded more optimistic. Though describing what WGBH did
as ``wrong, and a mistake,'' he said it ``shouldn't interfere with
our ability to authorize funding for public broadcasting for the
entire United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The reauthorization bill would provide $400 million over five
years for public broadcasters to switch to a digital transmitting
system, which they are required by law to do by 2003. It would also
add approximately $175 million to the $350 million appropriation
that public broadcasting received last year. The money would go to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the umbrella organization
of the nation's public broadcasting stations, including the Public
Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The political explosion caught many public broadcasters by
surprise. Just last week, it appeared the funding for public
broadcasting would face far less opposition than ever before.
Democrats, Republicans, and media analysts said the climate in
Washington had noticeably changed since 1994, when Gingrich called
the national network of public radio and TV stations a ``little
sandbox for the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   A massive public outcry followed earlier Republican threats to
kill the Public Broadcasting Service. WGBH says its donations
doubled in 1995 and 1996, with more than $1 million in new
contributions those years as opposed to the $500,000 in new
donations in years past. At the same time, public broadcasters
started to notice less resistance from Republicans, who many
believed discovered a suburban constituency that watched PBS and
listened to National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Monday, Jeanne M. Hopkins, vice president for
communications at WGBH, described the prospects for public
broadcasting as ``much more positive than we ever expected.''
Tuesday night, she sounded far less upbeat as she learned of the
political tornado gathering speed on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were completely out front the minute it happened. It was a
mistake,'' Hopkins said. ``It doesn't seem all of public
broadcasting should be affected by one mistake at one station. This
was not a partisan act. It was an individual, human error.''

 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from London.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``Fair enough then. So we're alone.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dame Judi Dench, playing a grieving veteran theater
actress, speaks the final line of ``Amy's View'' Sunday on Broadway
during the last performance at the Ethel Barrymore Theater of David
Hare's play, the remark may make theatergoers sit up with a start.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the frisson comes from the elegant visualization of
those closing moments, in which cascading sheets of silk prompt a
far more real emotive response than any musical's mechanized
scenery ever could. For that, credit Richard Eyre, the director,
and Bob Crowley, the designer, alongside that rare performer, Dame
Judi, who is never more moving than when she is being most
matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the simplicity of a scene that works simultaneously
as baptism and requiem, is the stark, declarative nature of the
concluding remarks of Dame Judi's character, Esme Allen. In just
those six unsentimental words, Esme gives voice to a condition that
has been dramatized of late with varying degrees of urgency and
pathos on New York and London stages.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1987 Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical ``Into
the Woods'' went to great lengths to reassure us and the show's
battered fairy tale folk that ``no one is alone,'' a number of
provocative recent plays have decided the opposite: in the worlds
of ``Amy's View,'' ``Closer'' and ``The Weir,'' among others,
solitude would appear to be the natural human state.
</P>
<P>
   So prevalent has this sentiment been that one began to encounter
it seemingly everywhere. At the Off Broadway cabaret performance
``Street of Dreams'' last spring, for instance, it was mildly
startling to hear that most engaging performer James Naughton
suddenly sounding as if he had become Esme: ``We go out into the
dark naked and alone,'' Naughton told his listeners, referring to
the lot of the actor.
</P>
<P>
   But he could just as well have been about to describe a primal
attraction of the theater, which is its ability _ however brief _
to make human beings feel less alone when subsumed within that
collective known as an audience.
</P>
<P>
   After all, why else would one of Britain's leading touring
troupes call itself Shared Experience? (That company's ``Anna
Karenina'' traveled to the Brooklyn Academy of Music last fall.)
For good or ill, we're all in this thing called life together. Or
maybe we're not, if some contemporary drama is to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, ``Wit,'' the Off Broadway hit now at the
Union Square Theater that presents self-isolation as something
willed. In Margaret Edson's play, a distinguished academic dying of
cancer is happier in the centuries-old literary company of the
Metaphysical poet John Donne than she is with the humankind from
whom she has quite deliberately removed herself.
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. Vivian Bearing (being played through Aug. 8 by Kathleen
Chalfant), it is as if other people allow into one's life far too
much of that very sentimentality that, Vivian argues, Donne's own
rigor keeps at bay _ starting with his punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vivian and Hare's Esme find what succor life affords in the
esthetic realm. To that end, they are not substantially different
from the various musicians (and the women in their lives) who
populate Warren Leight's ``Side Man.'' The play, at the Golden
Theater, speaks mournfully about the discordant music made by human
beings as against the transporting sounds of, say, the saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Broadway's recent visitors from Britain and Ireland
that have thrown this sorrowful condition into the sharpest relief.
In ``Closer,'' the London play now at the Music Box Theater,
Patrick Marber takes a scalpel to the ways of modern-day death and
desire, contrasting in the process a Victorian-era park
memorializing do-gooders with the slick London of a century later,
where good deeds result in both parties getting bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Among the multiple ironies of the play is the fact that _
Marber's title notwithstanding _ its lustful quartet could not be
farther apart. Indeed, one could argue that the closest connection
made in the play is also the most deceitful and isolating: the
erotic exchange in cyberspace between a male obituary writer named
Dan (played by Rupert Graves), relishing his e-mail persona as a
female, and an apparently civilized dermatologist, Larry (Ciaran
Hinds), who is (another irony) a self-described ``caveman'' of the
sort to leave the likes of Rob Becker in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   What do you have to do to get a bit of intimacy around here?
bellows Larry, and the request itself couldn't be more at odds with
the tenor of the remark. Is there any chance, Marber's play asks
shrewdly, of getting close to someone in a world founded on
surfaces and lies?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Anna (Polly Draper, replacing Natasha
Richardson), the older of the play's two women, is a photographer
whose livelihood _ by definition _ depends on the image of the
thing and not the thing itself. The younger woman, Alice (Anna
Friel) _ who, like Anna, moves between both men over the course of
four years _ would seem to be the play's most direct, uncomplicated
character, until one discovers that her entire life has been built
on subterfuge.
</P>
<P>
   As the full extent of Alice's self-invention is laid bare, Dan
dryly tosses off the line that locates this play squarely within
what one might call ``Esme's view.'' Describing an (unseen) former
lover, Ruth, who went on to marry a Spanish poet, Dan can't resist
naming the title of the collection of poems that apparently
clinched the romance. ``You know what they were called?'' he asks
Anna. ``Solitude.'' The two laugh.
</P>
<P>
   For all the Irish banter that characterizes ``The Weir,'' Conor
McPherson's drama is another play that keeps the prospect of people
at their most essentially solitary just beneath its surface. That
may seem surprising, given the volume of words that fill the
bartender Brendan's pub one blustery night as four men and one
woman gather in a desolate region of northwest Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't simply literary ancestors like Samuel Beckett or
Brian Friel who remind us of the rich Irish tradition of language
serving as a stopgap, however mellifluous, between birth and death.
``We give birth astride a grave'' is Beckett's pithy summation of
existence in ``Waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Weir'' is a ghost story of sorts, to be sure, but only as
the play nears its end at the Walter Kerr Theater do we discover
the specific nature of the haunting _ and the theme of aloneness.
That moment comes in the second of two monologues delivered by the
aging and unmarried Jim (played by Jim Norton), as he relates the
missed romantic opportunity that has shadowed him most of his life,
much as the chill of death itself shadows the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my condition,'' he says tersely, referring to a solitude
leavened only by evenings at the pub and the memory of a brief
instance of compassion. ``Well. That wasn't a ghostly story.
Anyway, at least, ha?'' Jim says, concluding his poignant tale,
although we know as surely as he does the admission encoded in his
statement: in a play rife with talk of otherworldly specters, Jim
is a living, breathing ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Weir'' does hold out the option of companionship as
an antidote to life alone. Again, one thinks of Beckett, whose
tramps have one another, even if Godot never arrives.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``Amy's View,'' over four scenes covering 16 years,
strips Esme of a beloved mother-in-law, a lover, a daughter and an
income. By play's end, she has returned to that vocation _ the
theater _ vilified by the younger generation but bred deep in her
bones, to find a sanctification in art that has been denied her in
life.
</P>
<P>
   Is Esme, then, truly alone? By any objective standard, yes. But
what makes the ending of ``Amy's View'' finally so stirring, more
than justifying the blind alleys (the title included) that the play
travels en route to its finish, is what it suggests _ that Esme in
her very solitariness is never more at one with those of us out
there in the dark who are lifted up by the power of empathy into
the light.

<P>
   MIAMI _ In a rare look at crime aboard the nation's growing
cruise fleet, Carnival Cruise Lines reported in court papers filed
Tuesday that its crew members were accused of sexually assaulting
passengers and fellow workers aboard its ships 62 times in a
five-year period that ended last August, a rate of nearly once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics represent the first public disclosure by a cruise
line about the number of alleged rapes and other sexual assaults
that occur on cruises. Industry officials have said cruises are
safe, but there have been no figures because big cruise ships are
registered in foreign countries and are not required to report all
incidents to U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing criticism by crime victims and others
that the industry covers up crime on its cruises. Officials of the
FBI said last year that they had investigated fewer than two
accusations of rape a month in the Port of Miami, the nation's
busiest cruise passenger center.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Lines, a subsidiary of the Miami-based Carnival
Corp., said in court papers that it investigated the 62 incidents
but did not disclose the results or say whether any arrests were
made. The figures did not include accusations involving only
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival produced its numbers in connection with a lawsuit in
Miami against the company by a former crew member who says she was
raped and sodomized by an officer aboard Carnival's Imagination
last Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival is the world's largest cruise company, carrying about a
third of the nearly 6 million passengers who travel out of U.S.
ports every year. Tim Gallagher, a company spokesman, said he was
unaware of the assault figures and referred questions to a lawyer
for Carnival, Curtis Mase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any allegation would be taken seriously, but do these
statistics suggest that Carnival ships are unsafe?'' Mase said.
``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are not large when considered in the context
of big-city crime, crime on cruise ships is particularly
troublesome because of the jurisdictional issues, the supposedly
protected environment and the fact that there are no
law-enforcement officials aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The company provided only sketchy information about the
incidents, which Mase said covered a broad range of sexual
misconduct, including molestation and rape. A chart compiled by
Carnival listed the date of each reported incident, the date the
company learned of it, the name of the ship where it occurred and
the job title of the accused employee.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents were scattered among the company's ships, and
involved employees ranging from cabin steward and assistant cook to
supervisors, engineers and a chief security officer. The statistics
are limited to accusations involving attacks by crew members and do
not include any incidents that may have occurred between
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the company said that it investigated the alleged
incident and reported it to the appropriate authorities if
requested to do so by the purported victim. Cruise ships are not
required to report crimes to U.S. authorities when they occur in
international waters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some members of Congress have complained that
the fast-growing cruise industry is permitted to operate beyond the
reach of the nation's criminal and environmental laws. They also
have raised questions about the industry's ability to avoid paying
corporate income taxes to the United States by incorporating in
foreign countries and flying foreign flags on their vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise companies are registered in countries without any
corporate tax, and fly the flags of countries with with lax law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, people who have said they were raped and their
lawyers complained that Carnival and other cruise lines were not
helpful in investigating reports of assaults on cruise ships and
that ship personnel were sometimes untrained in gathering evidence
in cases involving accusations of rape. They also contended that in
some instances victims were discouraged from reporting the crimes
to the FBI or other law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The suit that led to Carnival's disclosure of the assault
statistics involved an incident last August aboard the Imagination.
A 26-year-old woman, identified as Jane Doe in court papers, said
that she was raped and sodomized by Yurij Senes, a ship's engineer,
after she invited him to her cabin. At the time of the alleged
incident the woman had worked for Carnival for three years, and
Senes had joined the company two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to her suit and her lawyers, the woman immediately
told security that she had been attacked and identified her
attacker, but she was persuaded not to file a report. A day later,
when the ship docked in Miami, the woman reported the incident to
the FBI. When agents tried to question Senes they learned that he
had been fired and escorted to the airport by Carnival employees
for a flight to his home in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Carnival said earlier that the woman initially did
not want to report the incident to the authorities and that Senes'
departure occurred before the company realized the FBI wanted him
for questioning. He has since been indicted by a federal grand jury
on charges of aggravated sexual assault, but he remains in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   When the woman's lawyer, Gary Fox, sought to obtain information
from Carnival on the frequency of sexual assaults on its ships, the
company objected. The statistics were turned over only after the
trial judge in Miami-Dade County and a Florida appellate court
twice rejected efforts by Carnival to block their release.
</P>
<P>
   From the first hearing in the case, Carnival has maintained that
the sex between the woman and Senes was consensual, something she
has repeatedly denied. Mase, the company's lawyer, also asked
numerous questions about the woman's sexual history and attitudes
in her deposition. At one point, he asked if she considered herself
sexually liberal or conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with colleagues on the ship, she said, she considered
herself a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Mase said the personal questions about the woman's sexual
experiences were important to the company's defense. He said that
evidence would show that people could differ on whether the sexual
contact was consensual, though he declined to specify the nature of
the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in civil suits, cruise lines usually settle
cases of accused rape with agreements that neither side disclose
the terms or talk further about the incident. But Fox said his
client was determined to pursue her case and would demand that
rape-detection kits be carried on every Carnival ship as a
condition of any settlement.

A YOUNG COMPOSER REMADE?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some artists bloom young; others do not find themselves until
they are a decade or two into adult life. George Benjamin, 39, the
English composer who is in residence at the Tanglewood Music Center
Festival of Contemporary Music, which begins on Thursday in Lenox,
Mass., and will feature his music, has followed both patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In his late teens and early 20s Benjamin produced a quick
succession of bold and beautiful works, full of energy and color,
and remarkable also for their technical finish. Then the flow
almost stopped until, as he entered his 30s in 1990, he emerged
again as an even stronger creative presence, with the same keen ear
but a weightier mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanglewood programs include pieces from both the youthful
flourishing and later. Benjamin himself conducts his ``At First
Light,'' of 1982, and Peter Serkin plays ``Meditation on the Name
of Haydn,'' from the same year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two works from the present decade: ``Sometime
Voices'' _ an aria for Shakespeare's Caliban, here a baritone _ and
``Viola, Viola,'' a viola duo that is Benjamin's most recent piece.
The composer will show another of his talents when he improvises a
piano accompaniment to F.W. Murnau's silent film ``Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's jump-start around 1980 was helped by the time he
spent as a pupil of Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatory. He
went to Paris when he was only 16, having heard that Messiaen was
due to retire, and he obviously appealed to the senior composer,
across an age gap of more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   He was young. He was eager, enthusiastic and charming (all
youthful qualities he retains). He was immensely gifted. And he was
quick to learn. He could have been made for the role of Messiaen's
last star pupil, which was how Messiaen came to see him.
</P>
<P>
   The affection between them was mutual and lasting, and Benjamin
has remained on close terms with Messiaen's widow, Yvonne Loriod,
whom he assisted in the completion of Messiaen's last, unfinished
work, the ``Concert a Quatre.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left Paris, after two years, he was beginning to
make a reputation, which was confirmed by the music he wrote while
studying with Alexander Goehr at Cambridge, England. His first
orchestral score, ``Ringed by the Flat Horizon'' (1980), had a
string of prestige performances, as did ``At First Light,'' for 14
players, which has been conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, Pierre
Boulez and Esa-Pekka Salonen.
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Light'' shows what was so exciting about Benjamin's
early music. There is a feeling for sound, for the substance of
sound, which has to do with finding instrumental combinations that
work well together, with orchestrating chords so that even the
grossest dissonance is good to hear, and with using special effects
so that they sound right and not just special.
</P>
<P>
   But the sounds of ``At First Light'' are not just well chosen:
they are also well placed. One thing leads to another, whether by
simple repetition, by having one instrument or group mimic the
sound of another, or _ most important _ by insuring a strong
harmonic progress in music where simple major or minor chords and
complex combinations are part of the same resonant world. The
feeling for the substance of sound is also a feeling for the
substance of time.
</P>
<P>
   There are, inevitably, echoes of other composers in ``At First
Light'': of Edgard Varese, in the way the piece is initiated by a
repeated signal on a high trumpet; of Gyorgy Ligeti, in some of the
fine tuning; of Elliott Carter, in the strong character of the solo
melodies, and of Messiaen, in the occasional harmonic detail, like
the superb sea swell in A major, Messiaen's blue key.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, who was 22 at the time, greets these predecessors as
colleagues and equals, not mentors. And in handling an ensemble
with a tricky preponderance of winds over strings, he had nothing
to fear from any comparison.
</P>
<P>
   In expressive terms, though, the piece is unashamedly and
wonderfully juvenile. It communicates a young man's affirmation,
celebration and looking forward, and Benjamin soon came to want
more of himself.

COURIER, MARTIN SET TO LEAD US EFFORT, COACH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The US Davis Cup singles team is Jim Courier
and Todd Martin _ not Pete Sampras, captain Tom Gullikson said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bait. But hardly anyone is biting.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what the boys are saying, it's a team decision,''
Australian captain John Newcombe said. ``So if you're the team, and
you want to win the match _ I think Jim said in the papers this
morning that their objective is to beat Australia, so to win three
matches before we do _ well, why would you have Pete sitting on the
bench?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm not trying to force him to play. I'd rather him
stay on the bench for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sampras, the No. 3 singles player in the world,
joined the US team June 9, it has been widely debated whether he
will compete in singles.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson maintains a final decision will not be made until the
day of the tie, which begins Friday at Longwood Cricket Club. But
Martin, whose spot Sampras would take in singles, seems to have his
mind made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Gulli to feel like he would be able to put the best
team out on the court and not feel bad about it,'' Martin said.
``Pete's swallowed enough pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypothetically speaking, if Jim and I play and we lose, what
good does that do anyone here? If Pete plays and carries the team,
well then I'm going to be the first one patting him on the back and
telling him, `Good job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And while Courier and final team member Alex O'Brien have not
spoken publicly, like Martin, both have said their goal is to win _
a sentiment echoed by their captain.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson offered a slight contradiction, conceding that a team
with Sampras playing singles would be the team with the best chance
to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most logical choice,'' Gullikson said. ``(But you
have to consider) the feelings of Todd, and the feelings of Jim,
and the feelings of Alex, and the feelings of Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, intending not to detract from the first-round success
Courier and Martin had against Great Britain in April _ a success
many critics had all but ruled out before the tie began _ said he
would play only doubles.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, saying Sampras was a better player, volunteered to
relinquish his singles spot.
</P>
<P>
   When the scenario was posed to the No. 2 singles player in the
world, he said the solution was a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Australian Patrick Rafter said when asked
whether he believed Sampras would just compete in doubles. ``I
don't think he's come all this way to sit on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   With the US team members either boosting Sampras or stating that
they want to win, while agreeing that Sampras gives them the best
opportunity to do that, should there be any doubt who will be the
No. 1 singles player?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, fans and media watched as Sampras and O'Brien practiced
doubles at Longwood. Many are ready to second-guess Gullikson, but
witnessing the proposed doubles combo at work, no one is quite
ready to call it a bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and O'Brien beat practice partners James Blake and Chris
Woodruff in a set that went to a 7-5 tie-breaker. Although the set
was close, Gullikson was happy with what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have some potential as a doubles player,'' Gullikson
said of Sampras. ``I'm sure if he concentrated on it more, he'd
have a lot of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Question is _ will that success be at Longwood this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find out on Friday,'' Gullikson replied. ``Right now,
it's Courier and Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the bait. But hardly anyone is biting.

 UNDATED: of himself.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1983, the year after ``At First Light,'' he began an
orchestral work, which stalled. He thought he might find a way to
progress by expanding his harmonic resources to include microtones,
and he returned to Paris to work at Boulez's research institute on
what emerged in 1987 as ``Antara,'' for a small orchestra with two
electronic keyboards sampling panpipe sounds. But this piece,
beautiful as it is, did not open a way forward, and for another
three years Benjamin completed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly his silence was more than a personal problem of having
high expectations of himself and being unwilling to settle for
less. It would have been hard, in the middle and late 80s, to go on
communicating the thrust and optimism that had characterized his
earlier music.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the AIDS epidemic emerging, but Britain was under
the assertively philistine and materialist government of Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   However that may be, Benjamin's works of the 90s are darker and
more complex, and show their experience also in a richer range of
musical reference. Of the first of them _ ``Upon Silence,'' a
setting of the Yeats poem ``Long-Legged Fly'' for soprano and viols
_ he has suggested a connection with Indian music, but one might
also hear in it the gagaku of Japan, or European chant or folksong.
</P>
<P>
   What one emphatically does not hear, despite the antique medium,
is any kind of pastiche. ``Upon Silence'' is as new and searching
as anything in Benjamin's earlier output, and his gifts of precise
imagination and technique had not deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they since. ``Upon Silence'' was a prelude to the
orchestral piece ``Sudden Time,'' completed in 1993, which begins
with one of the most fascinating essays in musical clockwork since
the opening of ``L'Heure Espagnole'' by Ravel, a composer Benjamin
often recalls in his supreme accomplishment and his simultaneous
expression of pleasure and pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sudden Time'' also manages to be at once exuberant and
uncertain, and it does this partly by having two or three different
tempos happening at once _ and powerfully _ for much of the time.
The ending of the first section is music to cleave the brain as it
forces one to hear time proceeding at contradictory speeds. And the
work achieves another welding of dissimilarities on the poetic
level, bringing into an airy Ravel-Debussy world a Mahlerian sense
of the composer's emotional self.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Sudden Time'' was a release, Benjamin has remained a
painstaking artist, completing just three works in the subsequent
six years: the two that will be played at Tanglewood and the Three
Inventions for Chamber Orchestra, which veer from frenzy (in a
jazz-expressionist clarinet solo) to grippingly expressed
obsessiveness and dissatisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   This piece, together with ``Sudden Time,'' ``Upon Silence'' and
the student-period Octet, has been recorded on a Nimbus CD, and
most of Benjamin's earlier works are also available from Nimbus.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, a new orchestral score is promised for
Boulez's 75th-birthday tour next year, and farther ahead must
surely lie the opera of which ``Upon Silence'' and ``Sometime
Voices'' provide such tantalizing pre-echoes.

<P>
   VALHALLA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton's ``listening tour'' ran
into Albany's budget impasse Tuesday when the first lady expressed
seeming incomprehension about the lateness of the state budget,
noting that it must cause havoc for local school boards trying to
plan their fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   By extension, although not by name, Mrs. Clinton appeared to
criticize Gov. George Pataki, the Republican blamed by Democrats
for the stalemate, who last weekend called Mrs. Clinton's likely
Senate campaign ``cockamamie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made her remarks during a two-hour talk with about
50 education officials, parents and students at Westchester
Community College, in the heart of what is a marginally Democratic
county of swing voters who are crucial to her chance of winning a
Senate race. When a parent from Yonkers complained about state
education financing, Mrs. Clinton responded, in what sounded like
such a faux-innocent tone that she drew laughter from the crowd:
``I don't understand how you can get your budgets ready when you
don't have a state budget. I really don't understand how you
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton traveled to the event with H. Carl McCall, the
state comptroller and a Democrat, who warned Monday of unnecessary
property tax increases in suburbs if there was not a budget letting
school districts know what they were to receive in state aid. Mrs.
Clinton brought up the budget impasse in the car, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `Explain why New York has these chronically
late budgets,''' McCall said. ``So I did spend some time kind of
walking her through the budget. I told her what I have been saying
publicly, which is that the governor has not provided the
appropriate leadership to have the budget passed. She just
listened.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening was the stated theme of the day, which included a trip
to greet astonished sunbathers at Jones Beach in Nassau County. But
at the Westchester event, as at Mrs. Clinton's other ``listening''
events last week, the first lady was more of a moderator who found
ample opportunity to interject with her support of programs popular
to her listeners. When one Westchester Community College graduate
spoke of his family's difficulties in paying his tuition, Mrs.
Clinton answered that her husband had worked to make college more
affordable, but added, ``We haven't gone far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton then said, ``I think that tuition should be tax
deductible, that people should be able to save in IRA college
accounts, tax free.'' Mrs. Clinton's proposals are in fact in two
separate bills introduced this year by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bills go considerably further in helping families
pay college tuition than two Clinton administration initiatives
that passed in 1997. First, Schumer's proposal would allow college
tuition of up to $20,000 a year to be tax deductible for families
that make up to $140,000 annually. And second, families earning up
to $200,000 annually would be able to contribute up to $2,000 a
year, tax free, in an Education IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton initiatives allow families with less than $80,000 in
annual income to take up to $1,500 in tax credits for the first two
years of college, plus a $5,000 tax credit for additional schooling
or adult retraining.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHAUMBURG, Ill. _ A year ago, Motorola Inc. was faltering
badly. Investors were dumping shares, complaining that the company
had lost its way. It had missed a critical beat a few years
earlier, betting on analog products when the world began craving
all things digital.
</P>
<P>
   The company took a charge against earnings of $1.9 billion a
year ago, but today it is on the rebound. Shares that were selling
for $38 in October are going for nearly $100 _ a $30 billion leap
in market value.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: a restructuring that trimmed the work force and
refocused the company's marketing of cellular telephones and
semiconductors. In addition, demand has begun to revive in the
critical Asia market, which slumped in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Motorola handily beat Wall Street projections by
reporting earnings of $273 million, or 44 cents a share, for the
second quarter of the year, up from $6 million, or 1 cent a share,
a year ago. Analysts had estimated 41 cents a share. The
announcement came after the close of trading. But ahead of the
earnings release, shares of Motorola closed at $96.50, down $2.50,
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Motorola's recent spate of good fortune is a less
well-known strategic shift, top executives say. The company plans
to recast itself from a manufacturer of technology hardware to a
software maker that is boldly vowing to bring the World Wide Web
not only to cellular telephones and pagers but even to the
automobile, which could soon be wired to download video games for
backseat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Motorola's futuristic musings are just
that, but the company has already invested billions of dollars and
hired thousands of new software engineers. It also says it will
equip every cellular telephone it makes next year with an Internet
browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming much more of a software company,'' said Dennis
Roberson, chief technology officer at Motorola. ``It's a very
significant break for us. There are more software capabilities in
the devices we produce, and we're expanding into the Internet
space.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these ambitions would be possible, of course, without a
recovery in the sale of cellular telephones and microchips, which
account for about 68 percent of revenue. This year, the company is
finally selling substantial numbers of digital cellular telephones,
allowing Motorola to compete against Nokia of Finland and Ericsson
of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives at company headquarters here in Schaumburg, a
suburb of Chicago, are cautious about using the word ``turnaround''
just yet, and for good reason. Motorola faces some huge problems,
ranging from a billion-dollar investment in a tottering satellite
venture called Iridium to the challenge of regaining market share
in the increasingly competitive market for wireless products and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is now making and selling digital products, for
example, Motorola still does not have a digital telephone able to
supply the One Rate plan at AT&AMP;T Wireless, one of the nation's
largest wireless service providers. Motorola executives say such
multiple-system phones should be ready later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Galvin, the 49-year-old chief executive, talks about
creating a ``new Motorola,'' a company in search of ``breakaway
opportunities.'' Doing so means fostering double-digit growth at a
technology giant with $30 billion in revenue and more than 130,000
employees. Motorola is emphasizing software ventures, in part, to
make the company more flexible and less capital intensive.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been almost universally optimistic
about Motorola in the last year. But several analysts said the
company still had to prove it could execute its plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been a well-regarded stock lately,'' Kenneth Leon, a
wireless communications analyst at ABN Amro, said of Motorola.
``But they have a growth rate in the low teens, and their
competitors, like Lucent and Nokia, have growth rates in the 20s
and 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola says a corporate makeover is well under way. Some
factories have been shuttered and their functions farmed out, and
executives have been trying to do away with a ``warring tribes''
culture that pitted one division against another.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the sense of invincibility that once pervaded the
company, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola had an insular attitude,'' said Merle Gilmore, an
executive vice president at the company. ``We need to change that
view. Things are happening too fast. Customer demands are too
exacting. Now you need to be part of an overall echo system.''
</P>
<P>
   The company found itself outside that echo system in recent
years and did not adequately foresee technological changes and
market trends.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola stumbled when the wireless industry began to shift from
analog to digital technology. In 1994, it practically owned the
cellular market, with a 60 percent share in the United States.
Nokia, which then had only 11 percent of the U.S. market, is now
the leader at about 34 percent, with Motorola second at about 31
percent, according to Herschel Shosteck Associates. Motorola
executives saw the shift coming but did not expect it to come so
swiftly, they now acknowledge.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Motorola's problem was compounded by a rash of product delays,
marketing miscues (Motorola's once trend-setting flip phones have
recently been perceived as having lost their fashion edge) and
repeated complaints that the company was using bully tactics with
some of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be very arrogant,'' said Phillip Redman, an
analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ``They used to push phones
on people and say, `If you want our phones, you have to buy so
many.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The company suffered huge losses in cellular handsets and
infrastructure _ the bay stations and servers that make cellular
calls possible. A $1.1 billion profit in 1997 became a loss of $1
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is trying to fix its cellular and chip divisions. In
recent months, the company has sold off its low-end chip
manufacturing business, laid off more than 17,000 employees and
shifted more than 3,000 engineers to develop new digital handsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In handsets, Motorola is emerging as a winner again,'' said
Matthew Hoffman, an analyst at Dataquest. ``And the pie is growing
30 to 40 percent a year. There could be 200 million handsets sold
this year. And that's good for Motorola.''
</P>
<P>
   The company faces a fierce competition in cellular
infrastructure from Ericsson, Nortel and Lucent Technologies. All
three rivals possess a ``switching technology'' _ the costly and
critical component that is at the hub of all telephone service.
Motorola is the only major supplier of cellular service without an
end-to-end solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a big challenge ahead on the infrastructure side,''
said Jane Zweig, an telecommunications analyst at Herschel
Shosteck.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's executives say, however, that they are working on a
solution: a complex packet-switching technology that would shuttle
voice, data and video from the Internet to wireless devices. To get
there, Motorola has announced ambitious joint ventures with Cisco
Systems Inc., a leader in networking, and with Sun Microsystems
Inc., best known for its Java programming language and its Solaris
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola and its partners are by no means alone. Lucent (which
bought Ascend Communications) and Nortel (which acquired Bay
Networks) are also working to develop wireless Internet access and
what they call the ``broadband living experience.'' But Motorola is
betting that its approach will put it ahead of the pack,
eliminating the need for circuit switching technology.
</P>
<P>
   The company is experimenting with microchips for everything from
shoes, doorknobs, sofas and the family pet that it hopes will
pervade an interactive society in which trillions of snippets of
voice, data and video are beamed around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson, the chief technology officer at Motorola, foresees
enormous opportunities as well as fun in the ``trillion device
problem'' of linking everything up wirelessly. ``Embedded
processors of the world unite,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola chips already power cellular phones, digital cameras
and 3Com Palm Pilots, television sets, printers and microwaves. But
in the company's view of the future, Motorola chips will also be
the ``Digital DNA'' inside a new breed of ``smart'' products.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola does not just want to make the chips. It wants to
design and develop the software that runs them, and to work with
customers to create new products.
</P>
<P>
   The company is developing myriad devices, from flat-panel
displays and set-top boxes to a wireless biotechnology product that
may someday take an individual's blood sample and instantly
transmit it to doctors, or even offer a diagnosis using a genomics
database.
</P>
<P>
   For the short-term, Motorola is trying to broaden its revenue
sources. The company has a strong business in two-way radios (sold
to governments and large industry), consumer-oriented
walkie-talkies, called Talk About, and ``smartcards,'' which can be
used for security clearances, automated tellers, debit cards and
other types of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Its paging business is slumping, but Motorola is a leader in
cable modems and chips supplied to networking companies like Cisco
Systems. Motorola is also a leading supplier of the auto industry,
selling global positioning satellite technology. A new division of
the company is working on high-definition television and
interactive television.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more troublesome projects, however, is the
Motorola-led consortium called Iridium, a big satellite
communications network that has been on the brink of bankruptcy in
recent months. The network of 66 satellites, which offers telephone
service anywhere in the world, has had a difficult time signing up
subscribers and making loan payments, some of which are guaranteed
by Motorola. Analysts worry that Motorola could be be hurt by a
mounting debt load.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium is an exposure, and no one is happy with it,'' said
Wojtek Uzdelewicz, an analyst at S.G. Cowen. ``The biggest risk is
that Iridium will stay afloat and Motorola will increase its
financing, and then you'll have this sinkhole. The hope is that
Motorola makes a decision very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is moving ahead with another satellite venture called
Teledesic LLC, which would deliver voice, data and high-speed
Internet access to hand-held devices. Other partners in the $9
billion effort include Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman; Craig
McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, and Boeing. Last week,
Motorola won the contract to develop the satellites for a low-orbit
system that is expected to be launched in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say that if the satellite ventures work,
Motorola's prospects will be enormous. Meantime, they are cheering
Motorola's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the story; we think the turnaround is for real,'' said
Michael Ching, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The challenge,
of course, is execution. Now Motorola has to deliver the products
on a timely basis.''

INTEL REVENUES AND EARNINGS FALL SHORT OF ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Intel Corp. reported second-quarter revenues
and earnings that fell slightly short of analysts' estimates, which
the company attributed to a normal seasonal slowdown. Intel said it
expected a strong second half.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported its results after the close of the market.
Its shares closed at $65.375, down 6.25 cents, in Nasdaq trading
Tuesday. In after-hours trading, shares initially slipped $2.25, to
$63.125, but rebounded to $65.125.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the earnings disappointment, though small, was
likely to take the high-flying Nasdaq down a bit on Wednesday.
Intel shares had dropped last month after the company warned that a
new chip would be delayed by two months, prompting some analysts to
reduce estimates for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The delay will affect one version of Intel's Pentium III
processor, to be produced using a new process that reduces the
width of each electronic circuit to .18 micron, from the current
.25 microns. The smaller circuits will enable the chip to run
faster and produce less heat.
</P>
<P>
   Although the delay did not have an impact on the second quarter,
analysts are watching it closely because Intel needs these faster
chips, which command higher prices, to offset declining profit
margins on the bulk of its product line, especially at the low end.
Should the delay be prolonged, Intel's chances for a strong second
half could be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we're through the period of seasonal weakness for the PC
market, Intel should clearly benefit when the usual seasonal uptick
takes place,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.
``The big question in the second half,'' he said, is, ``will they
be able to get .18 micron Pentium III's ramped up on schedule so
they can continue to refresh the high end of their product line.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel has been locked in a bloody price war with Advanced Micro
Devices Inc., particularly at the low end of its product lines.
Although Intel can offset this price cutting to some extent by
charging premium prices at the high end, its power to do so has
lessened in an increasingly cost-sensitive market.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended June 26, Intel reported earnings of $1.75
billion, or 51 cents a diluted share, up 49 percent from $1.17
billion, or 33 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues rose 14 percent to $6.75 billion from $5.93 billion in the
second quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Intel to earn 53 cents a share, according
to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we announced first quarter earnings in April, we
projected second quarter revenue would be flat to slightly down,''
Andy Bryant, Intel's chief financial officer, said in a telephone
conference call. ``Revenues for the second quarter were at the
lower end of this guidance,'' representing a 5 percent decline from
the first quarter, he said. Bryant said price declines were offset
by reductions in costs and improved manufacturing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said average selling prices of microprocessors were down
in the second quarter as the company moved to regain market share
in the low-priced PC segment. Market research had shown Intel
losing share in that market to Advanced Micro and to a lesser
extent to the National Semiconductor Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Still, the major sufferers of the price wars have been Intel's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro, which has had trouble shipping faster chips,
last month said it would report a second quarter loss of about $200
million. The actual results will be reported on Wednesday. National
Semiconductor announced in May that it was exiting the PC
microprocessor business and was seeking a buyer for its Cyrix
subsidiary because price competition had made the business
unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said that it now expected gross profit margins for the
full year to be 60 percent, plus or minus a few points, up from
prior guidance of 57 percent, plus or minus a few points. Intel
said the change reflected the positive impact of the company's
continuing focus on cost improvements and manufacturing
efficiencies.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 39-year-old Mexican drifter suspected of killing
eight people and striking fear in people who live along railroad
tracks throughout the south, surrendered peacefully Tuesday in El
Paso in an arrangement brokered by his sister and a rookie Texas
Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, referred to by the FBI as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez _
one of 30 aliases he has been known to use _ was whisked to Houston
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He was being held on a burglary charge until authorities conduct
DNA tests that they say could link him to five slayings in Texas.
He already faces murder charges in two deaths in Illinois and one
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Devon Anderson, the assistant Harris County district attorney,
said Resendez-Ramirez will be arraigned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest ended a six-week, nationwide manhunt for the man
authorities believe is the so-called railway serial killer, who on
June 21 was placed on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, whose real name is believed to be Angel
Leoncio Reyes Resendiz, was accompanied by his brother as he rode
part way across an international bridge linking Juarez, Mexico, and
southeast El Paso. A second vehicle carried other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 feet from the U.S. border, the pickup carrying
Resendez-Ramirez stopped and he walked to the border and
surrendered to Texas Ranger Sgt. Drew Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was quickly handcuffed and led away to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter told me that he extended his hand, they shook hands,
and he handcuffed him. He was very pleasant, not aggressive,'' said
Bruce Casteel, Department of Public Safety senior captain and
commander of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of law-enforcement officials took part in the search
for Resendez-Ramirez, and authorities throughout Texas received
reports of possible sightings of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But police acknowledged Tuesday that they were never certain of
his whereabouts until his dramatic arrival at the U.S. border
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the past few days, a special agent for
the FBI, a deputy United States Marshal and a Texas Ranger have
been negotiating for Ramirez's surrender,'' said FBI Special Agent
Don Clark of Houston. ``Mission accomplished, for the moment. ...
Law enforcement has done this country a great service by getting
this guy off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement thanking law enforcement
agencies for their work on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans can rest easier knowing that law enforcement
authorities will bring the full force of the law to bear in this
case,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   DPS spokesman Mike Cox said the break in the case came during
the weekend when Carter received a call from Resendez-Ramirez's
sister while on a fishing trip to the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The sister, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., said she had been in
touch with Resendez-Ramirez through an intermediary, apparently
their brother.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and federal investigators met with the sister Sunday
night and Monday to discuss a surrender on a burglary warrant
related to the slaying of a doctor in the Houston suburb of West
University Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sister told Carter that he would only surrender to a Texas
Ranger, not any other officer,'' Cox said. ``This again really adds
to the Texas Ranger mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who turned 32 Tuesday and has been a Ranger for less
than a year, had established a rapport with the sister, Cox said.
He had appeared for three consecutive weeks on the television show
``America's Most Wanted'' to discuss the search for
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender agreement included assurances that
Resendez-Ramirez will get a psychological evaluation, will be safe
in jail, and can be visited by his family, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not shield Resendez-Ramirez from the death penalty
if he is charged with capital murder in Texas, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Resendez-Ramirez would surrender to face the death
penalty, Casteel said, ``I've been in this business a very long
time, and I'm struggling to answer that myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At a brief court appearance in El Paso, Resendez-Ramirez was
handcuffed and chained around the waist. He was asked by Magistrate
James Carter if he had any questions about the burglary charge
against him and whether he had any other questions. Twice
Resendez-Ramirez responded softly, ``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   He was then put on a small plane with Carter, another Ranger, an
FBI agent and a U.S. Marshal for the flight to Houston, and slept
for much of the flight, a DPS spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, he emerged from the plane wearing jeans, a striped
long-sleeved shirt and gold-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Resendez-Ramirez is charged with two murders in
Illinois and one in Kentucky, he apparently will be tried first in
Texas, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Resendez-Ramirez could be charged with ``probably at
least five'' Texas slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Resendez-Ramirez's arrest spread quickly in Weimar, a
community between Houston and San Antonio where he is suspected of
killing three people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we didn't believe it, it was too good to be true,''
said Larry Wick, one of the owners of M-G Farm Service Center in
Weimar.

EDITORIAL: PERU'S INTERNATIONAL DEFIANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 14:
</P>
<P>
   In the international equivalent of taking your marbles and going
home, Peru has announced it will no longer abide by the decisions
of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Peru long ago accepted
the court's jurisdiction, but a recent ruling against it angered
the government of Alberto Fujimori. The court and its related human
rights commission, which are part of the Organization of American
States, have become important defenders of rights and the rule of
law in a hemisphere where judicial systems are often too
politicized or weak to protect their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Court was established in 1979, but has been
issuing real decisions only since 1988. The court's first decisions
held Honduras responsible for the forced disappearance of two men.
Honduras paid their families compensation. Virtually all the
court's decisions have been honored, if at times slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The first crack in the system came in 1998. Trinidad and Tobago,
fearful it would have to delay scheduled hangings, denounced the
human rights convention it had signed that accepted the court's
jurisdiction. The OAS responded with the gentlest possible
criticism of Trinidad and Tobago, which probably encouraged Peru's
decision _ which has so far been met with OAS silence.
</P>
<P>
   The court's current ruling criticizes Peru's use of unfair
military tribunals to try civilians for terrorism. Fujimori is
probably also worried about the outcome of two upcoming court
cases. One involves his having stripped the Israeli-born Baruch
Ivcher of his television station and Peruvian citizenship when
Ivcher began broadcasting reports of government corruption and
murder. The other centers on three judges of Peru's constitutional
tribunal who blocked Fujimori's maneuverings to become eligible for
a third term. He had them sacked.
</P>
<P>
   There are other countries, such as Guatemala, where the military
resents the court. Peru's decision may now encourage these
opponents to press their governments to withdraw. The OAS, and the
Inter-American Development Bank, should be vigorous in defense of
this organization, which for some nations offers the only justice
the armed forces or unscrupulous presidents do not control.

   Since May 2 when Weimar minister Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic, 47, and
his wife, Karen, 47, were found dead in their home near the
railroad tracks, the community of about 2,000 has been jolted out
of its tranquil routine.
</P>
<P>
   The second blow came June 4 when Josephine Konvicka, 73, was
found slain in her Fayette County home about three miles from the
Sirnics'.
</P>
<P>
   Wick said his store normally sells four to six guns a month, but
sold 61 in June because people were afraid that the killer would
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has not been a typical summer,'' Wick said. ``Normally,
late in the evening, you would see people out walking at night,
kids out playing in the yard. You haven't seen any of that. Doors
have been locked, people have been sleeping in one room. When you
have three murders in a town of 2,000, people get pretty worried.
Maybe now we can start relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Konvicka's 17-year-old grandson, Allen Konvicka of Schulenberg,
said he had borrowed a lawnmower from his grandmother about six
hours before authorities say she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his family were angered when reports surfaced
that Resendez-Ramirez had been in custody of the INS on June 2 _
before his grandmother was killed _ and then deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me mad, very mad,'' he said. ``They could have
locked him up and that would have been the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wick said the INS' release of Resendez-Ramirez ``basically cost
four more lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe an agency could do that, though we
understand the fact that they process a million-and-a-half coming
across the border,'' he said. ``We still couldn't understand how
they would let him slip through. I guess you could say the system
let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the Justice Department is
looking into why Resendez-Ramirez ``was not detained and whether
INS knew about Resendez-Ramirez's criminal activities after being
contacted by local law enforcement earlier this year.''

COMPANY CHARGED WITH MURDER IN VALUJET CRASH; EMPLOYEES ALSO
INDICTED

murder charges against companies.) 
(ATTN: Fla., Ga. )  (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An aviation maintenance company was charged with
murder and manslaughter Tuesday in the 1996 Valujet crash, and a
vice president and two mechanics were charged with carelessly
handling deadly materials. Aviation experts say these were the
first criminal charges brought in an airliner accident in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety investigators said the maintenance company,
Sabretech, improperly packed and labeled old airplane parts called
oxygen generators from two other Valujet Airlines planes and then
delivered them to the flight, causing a fire in a cargo hold that
may have broken out even before takeoff. All 110 people aboard were
killed when the DC-9 went down in the Everglades on May 11, 1996,
shortly after takeoff from Miami on a flight to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crash was completely preventable,'' said Katherine
Fernandez Rundle, state attorney for Miami-Dade County. ``This was
not an accident. It was a crime. It was a homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110 counts of murder against the company were filed by Ms.
Rundle's office; a federal grand jury in Florida handed up the
indictments on improper handling of materials.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the federal charges, the three men could be
sentenced to up to five years in jail and a fine of $250,000, and
the company, which also was charged with the improper handling of
materials, could face a fine of almost $6 million. The company
would also face a fine under the state charge, although prosecutors
did not say how large.
</P>
<P>
   But because Sabretech has ceased operations and sold its assets,
meaningful punishment is unlikely unless the company sought to
resume operations, said Donald R. Ungurait, a spokesman for Ms.
Rundle.
</P>
<P>
   Sabretech's assets were sold to Aviation Management Systems Inc.
of Orlando, Fla. Valujet renamed itself Airtran Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Sabretech, Kenneth P. Quinn, said the
charges against the company were ``utterly preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are attempting to criminalize a series of mistakes by
many parties, not just Sabretech or some of its former mechanics,''
he said, pointing out that the National Transportation Safety Board
had found fault not only with Sabretech but also with Valujet, for
failing to oversee its contractor, and the Federal Aviation
Administration, which did not require smoke detectors in DC-9 cargo
holds, among other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the company and the three men would plead not guilty.
He said the men would negotiate surrendering to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment named Eugene Florence, 37, and Mauro
Valenzuela, 30, both mechanics employed by sub-contractors to
Sabretech, and Daniel Gonzalez, who is in his mid-50s, then
Sabretech's vice president for operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not criminals; they are honest, well intentioned
mechanics who were trying to do the best they could with inadequate
information that had been given them, by the airline, and the
federal government,'' he said. After the accident, the FAA
suspended their licenses for a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a corporation is considered the same as a person
and can be charged with many of the same crimes that a person can
be charged with. On conviction, a corporation can be fined and put
on probation, like a person, and its activities limited or
supervised by a judge or court-appointed official. Most charges
against corporations fall short of murder, however; more
frequently, they are charged with violations of pollution laws or
financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Ungurait said that in April his office brought a murder charge
against a company that builds bus shelters after a boy was
electrocuted in one of them. He said that murder charges against
companies are ``not the most frequent occurrence,'' but that there
have been others.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety officials said that bringing murder charges against
Sabretech might make it difficult in future crashes to win the
cooperation of the various parties involved in investigations,
including the airline, the aircraft manufacturer, manufacturer of
engines and other parts and the unions representing the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Aviation subcommittee, Rep. John J.
Duncan, R-Tenn., a former criminal court judge, said Tuesday he
doubted the wisdom of the decision to indict and that if the case
did not succeed, he would favor a congressional inquiry about why
it was brought.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The indictments largely echoed the findings of the Safety Board,
that technicians had removed the oxygen generators, small chemical
reactors that provide oxygen in case of emergency, from the
overhead panels of another airplane because their shelf life had
expired, but had failed to install plastic caps that prevent the
generators from starting up.
</P>
<P>
   Sabretech, located across a runway from the Valujet ramp at
Miami International Airport, conducted a hurried clean-up of its
hangar because another prospective airline client, Continental, was
taking a tour, and technicians packed the canisters loosely into
cardboard cartons, with bubble rap; then someone delivered them to
a Valujet plane that was being loaded with baggage for a flight to
Atlanta. Sabretech said it was returning the canisters to Valujet
because the airline owned them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rundle said, ``We were not able to prove that any single
individual was responsible for the homicides,'' but that
``cumulative acts'' made the airline culpable.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney, said ``critical
maintenance steps were left out,'' and that company personnel
falsely indicated that the safety caps had been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not say why the investigation took three years, but
said it was an ``intense, painstaking, careful'' process.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation experts differed on what precedent the indictments
would set. Vernon E. Grose, a member of the Safety Board in 1983
and 1984, said the threat of prosecution would make aviation
companies ``reticent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think I had equipment that looks like it's going to be
raised as causative, then I'm going to be very, very cautious'' in
cooperating in an investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eliot Brenner, the chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the threat of indictment is always present,
and that many companies and individuals had been indicted, and
convicted, in cases that did not involve crashes, for crimes like
selling counterfeit parts.

CLINTON URGES GOP TO SHRINK TAX-CUT PLAN TO AID MEDICARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ Before a round of golf and a million-dollar
fund-raising dinner, President Clinton appealed Tuesday to
Republican leaders in Washington to scale back their tax-cut plan
to allow the government to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am asking Republican leaders, in the interest of saving
Medicare, to reconsider the size of their tax-cut plan,'' he said
in a speech to a friendly audience of the Communications Workers of
America in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal government expecting a surplus of perhaps $2.9
trillion over the next 10 years, the Republicans have proposed
cutting taxes by $864 billion. The president prefers more modest
tax breaks amounting to $250 billion. He refrained Tuesday from
some of the harsh criticism leveled by other administration
officials against the Republican plan, but he still portrayed it as
devastating to education, research and defense.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the life of Medicare without devoting some of the
surplus to saving it, he said, would cut the quality and quantity
of health care available to the elderly. ``That will not happen on
my watch,'' Clinton declared to a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   After his 35-minute address, the president ventured out into the
steamy afternoon to the Indian Creek Country Club, where he played
golf with his brothers-in-law, Hugh and Tony Rodham, and friends.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the evening raising money for the state Democratic
Party, mostly for the highly competitive race for the Senate seat
being vacated by Connie Mack, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, attended by about 60 people who paid up to $100,000
each, raised from $500,000 to $1 million. Its host was Alfonso
Fanjul, a member of a family of rich Cuban exiles who have become
influential Florida sugar growers and have donated millions of
dollars to both the Republican and Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
   Fanjul's access to Clinton became apparent inadvertently during
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
reported that Fanjul had telephoned Clinton in the Oval Office on
Presidents Day, Feb. 19, 1996, or Dump Day, as Ms. Lewinsky called
it. Fanjul was urging the president, unsuccessfully, to oppose a
proposed tax on sugar farmers to pay for a cleanup of the
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Fanjuls control about half of Florida's sugar-cane
production and receive about $60 million a year in federal
subsidies, according to a General Accounting Office report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent to Congress this month a $7.8 billion plan to
restore the Everglades. It is endorsed by the sugar growers, and
the cost is to be divided between Florida and the federal
government. Environmental groups say it should set aside more land
from sugar companies.

ARGENTINA RATTLES A BIT, AND LATIN INVESTORS SHAKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Worries about Latin America have spooked investors again. And
when worried, they jump for the relative safety of the U.S. bond
market.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a nice rally in bonds, despite the looming
possibility of another interest rate increase by Federal Reserve
policy makers in August.
</P>
<P>
   The latest market tremors come from Argentina, now facing a
tough recession, a growing budget deficit and a presidential
election in October. All that adds up to building uncertainty about
the country's economic restructuring _ something not helped by a
presidential candidate's comment last weekend that he would ask the
pope to support debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the prices of Argentine bonds fell sharply, pushing
interest rates higher, and the country's main stock index dropped
8.7 percent. The sell-off spread quickly to markets in Brazil,
Mexico and the rest of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Argentina had a small rebound and the demand for U.S.
Treasury securities eased. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond,
which dropped to 5.9 percent on Monday from 6 percent on Friday,
was unchanged. Several emerging-market analysts said that the Latin
American sell-off had been overdone and that fears of an Argentine
bond default or currency devaluation were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the markets went too far, the outlook for Latin
markets for the next several months is no longer rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect continued pressure on Argentina's markets.
And such concerns could spill over to the rest of the region,
especially if the Fed decides to raise rates further next month.
Higher U.S. rates would make it harder for Latin nations to attract
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is all the noise you can have between here and
the election,'' said Jose Luis Daza, managing director of emerging
markets at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Cottani, chief economist for Latin America at Lehman
Brothers, said that Argentina would continue to be a ``target of
instability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that the government will be able to do,'' he
said, ``is try to convince investors that this has been an
overreaction, that things are likely to improve.'' Still, he noted,
``Nobody expects, even in the government, that the situation will
be too good for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Argentina's economic future cannot be cleared up
easily. The election will produce a new administration, with
unknown policies, and until then the candidates may try to attract
domestic votes with comments that unsettle international investors.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off on Monday was a case in point. Gov. Eduardo Duhalde
of Buenos Aires, a presidential candidate, said he wanted to ask
Pope John Paul II to support a debt moratorium for Argentina and
other struggling countries.
</P>
<P>
   For the market, that was not a good move. Investors grow uneasy
over suggestions that a country may not keep paying its debt, even
though a candidate's priorities may shift when elected. Venezuela's
new president, Hugo Chavez, spoke of restructuring that nation's
debt during his campaign, but since taking office has tried to
reassure investors.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, until the election is resolved, there is little
the outgoing government of Carlos Saul Menem can do to rebuild
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina is expected to be able to meet its borrowing needs for
the rest of the year, which diminishes any immediate threat of
default. But there is a much greater likelihood of corporate
defaults, Cottani said.
</P>
<P>
   Also by the first quarter of next year, the outlook on a
government default could be more uncertain. And it will fall to a
new administration to determine how large the financing gap will be
and how to bridge it. ``We will have time to see whether the risks
remain entering the first quarter of next year,'' Cottani said.
</P>
<P>
   Daza said that Latin American interest rates did not indicate
investor fears about an Argentine debt default. Short-term rates
would be higher than longer-term rates if the markets were worried,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the widening spreads between the rates on Latin debt and
those for comparable U.S. Treasury debt show that many investors
are indeed concerned about their ability to sell Latin bonds
quickly, and without big losses, if the Argentine situation _ or
the overall outlook _ takes a sudden turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to J.P. Morgan, the spread for Argentina shrank
Tuesday by 35 basis points _ or hundredths of a percentage point _
after widening 98 points Monday, to 9.72 percent. At the same time,
the spread between Brazil's debt and comparable American bonds
narrowed by just 1 basis point after widening by 70 points Monday.
And the spread with Mexico grew by 10 basis points after widening
by 56 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the markets seem to have overreacted Monday to Argentina's
situation. But its problems continue to concern investors about
countries that have been considered safer bets.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the market climate for Latin America is much
better than last summer and fall, when first Russia defaulted on
its debt and devalued its currency and then Long Term Capital
Management, the giant hedge fund, teetered near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Daza said, the Argentine government and the nation's
presidential candidates ``need to work more to calm the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the sensitivity of investors, that is no small task. ``The
guy who got mauled last year is saying `I have to lighten up,' ''
said Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager at Prudential Mutual
Funds. ``People are antsy.''

BUSINESSES, AND WORKERS, MAY NOT LIKE TOO MANY CHANGES IN MEDICAL
BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Congress goes too far with its health-care regulatory bid,
the eventual outcome could be radical changes in how businesses
provide employee medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate began debate on the Patients Bill of Rights Act
this week, the cost of some proposed reforms was a significant
concern. Some small-business advocates voiced concern about
increased benefit costs because employee health-care coverage was
already barely affordable at small firms.
</P>
<P>
   For larger companies, of course, dropping health-care coverage
isn't an option, because failing to offer this benefit would make
it too difficult to recruit high-quality talent.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a company underwrites health-care coverage,
however, doesn't mean it must be responsible for administering the
benefit, too. Companies, after all, don't feel the need to
underwrite and administer auto or homeowner insurance for
employees. If political leaders insist on health-care reform
without regard for costs, business may be forced to reassess its
approach to providing health-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans covered by medical insurance, it's safe to say,
get their coverage at the office. Thus, legislation affecting
health-care providers or insurance companies is usually between
businesses and government rather than individuals and their
government. The cost may be passed on to employees in the form of
wage restraint or increased paycheck deductions for the employee
share of the cost, but this is up to the company.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always like this, though. Just before World War II,
only 10 percent of U.S. workers were covered by employer-provided
coverage. Most Americans bought health insurance on their own,
generally to protect them from the extraordinary expense of serious
disease or injury.
</P>
<P>
   When wartime legislation limited wage increases, the law
provided for employer-paid medical insurance in lieu of wage
increases. It would be another decade, though, before major medical
coverage made its debut. By 1979, nearly all employees in medium to
large companies had major medical coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that companies often get nothing but headaches for
their trouble. Except for the most generous plans offered by the
richest companies, health-care coverage is often a source of
employee-employer contention. The contentious potential of the
arrangement can only intensify as health-care costs continue to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the spectacular growth of the managed-care concept so
many Americans love to hate was spurred by companies trying to
control the soaring cost of health-care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than companies continuing to squeeze benefit outlays on
their own at the risk of exacerbating employee alienation,
executives may want to seriously consider a return to the old days.
Instead of providing and administering medical coverage, companies
might be better served to give employees the money instead and let
individuals cut their own deals with insurers.
</P>
<P>
   This approach would allow workers to choose plans that best fit
their individual medical and economic needs. Meanwhile, whenever
lawmakers mulled costly reforms, it would be between themselves and
the voters, without corporate health-care intermediaries insulating
them from the political consequences.

STANDARDS ARE SET FOR TECHNOLOGY TO THWART MUSIC PIRATES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With few surprises, the music and electronics industries
released the specifications Tuesday for technology that will
prevent portable digital devices from playing pirated music. Now
comes the next hurdle: choosing which technology best translates
the new specifications into reality.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever company is chosen to create the screening technology
could suddenly become a major _ and probably wealthy _ force in the
distribution of digital music, since anyone that uses the
technology, from record labels to Web sites and makers of consumer
electronics devices, may have to pay the company a licensing fee.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, the 110 participants in the industry
consortium, called the Secure Digital Music Initiative, or SDMI,
plan to have selected the technology that will determine whether a
given piece of music loaded onto a device in the next generation of
portable music players was acquired legally.
</P>
<P>
   It will fall to the developers of the new technology to clear up
questions left unanswered by the document released Tuesday, which
only vaguely described security measures to be included in
SDMI-compliant players.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lacy, head of the portable device working group for the
SDMI, said 11 companies had submitted proposals for screening
technology, but he declined to identify them. Several other people
involved in the negotiations said that of the 11, five or six were
under serious consideration, with bids coming from a range of small
and large companies. Some candidates are general technology
concerns while others are focused on the digital music industry,
these people said.
</P>
<P>
   The technologies are currently under review to test how well
they detect illegal music, how susceptible they are to hacking and
whether they diminish the music's sound quality, SDMI officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy said the technology chosen could be either a single kind of
operation from one company or a hybrid of several.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one were chosen, that would be a major coup for the person
chosen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Moore, general counsel for Diamond Multimedia Systems &UR; ,  &LR; the
San Jose, Calif.-based maker of the Diamond Rio player for MP3
files, said that by letting a third party determine which
technology works best, SDMI was ensuring that no one was playing
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no arm-twisting,'' he said, adding that the record
companies would only embrace the most effective technology. ``If
they don't come up with the best solution, they won't be able to
sell it to their artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary SDMI standards were released late last month,
and the new ``final specifications'' offer few revelations. The
document is technical but very general, which its authors say will
let it be adopted to various business models.
</P>
<P>
   One requirement is that SDMI-compliant software will prevent
anyone from making more than four copies of a song at a given time.
This means that someone who copies songs from a compact disk onto a
computer's hard drive would then be able to copy it from the
computer to a portable player only four times. The individual could
eventually make more copies of the song, but not before going back
to the original CD and again copying it as an audio file.
</P>
<P>
   That specification appears inconsistent with earlier
pronouncements that portable digital devices would be able to play
``legacy'' content, that is, music recorded onto commercial compact
discs before the advent of the SDMI. But Lacy said the rule was
merely designed to ``put a throttle'' on music piracy by making the
copying cumbersome.

VATICAN ORDERS PRIEST AND NUN TO END MINISTRY TO GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert ``in Maryland'' and ``national'' in lede graf and
to add clarifying information in 12th graf, beginning: Controversy
within ...)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vatican on Tuesday ordered an American priest and a nun in
Maryland to end a national ministry to gay men and lesbians, saying
that the pair's work since the 1970s had strayed from church
teaching that homosexual activity is immoral.
</P>
<P>
   The action was unusual in its severity and in that it fell on
people who lack the academic stature of some theologians who have
run afoul of the Vatican in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith,
the body charged with safeguarding church teaching, declared that
the Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick had allowed
``ambiguities and errors'' to color their public discussions about
church teaching on homosexuality and had sown confusion among Roman
Catholic lay people.
</P>
<P>
   Although it stopped short of citing detailed examples, the
congregation said Nugent and Sister Gramick had not sufficiently
emphasized the teaching that homosexual acts are ``intrinsically
disordered'' and ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, officially called a ``notification,'' comes after
a lengthy investigation, lasting well over a decade, by American
Catholic authorities and by the Vatican, into Sister Gramick's and
Nugent's work, which they began in the 1970s, putting them in the
forefront of church figures who reached out to gay and lesbian
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The decision's severity came as a surprise to some.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick and Nugent are permanently prohibited from
conducting the workshops, discussions and retreats (some with the
parents of gay Catholics) that have been the focus of their
ministry for two decades. In addition, they are forbidden
indefinitely from holding office within the religious orders to
which they belong.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, some prominent theologians whose writings the
Vatican has judged unacceptable have been ordered silenced for a
specific period. The Brazilian Leonardo Boff, an exponent of
liberation theology, a controversial system of thought that argues
that the church side with the poor and oppressed, was ordered to
cease his writing for a year.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after he arrived in the United States from Rome
on Tuesday, Nugent said he was surprised by the decision. ``It
puzzles me, because I have never questioned any dogma of the
church,'' he said. He added that he and Sister Gramick had
occasionally come under criticism from gay and lesbian groups ``for
being defenders of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nugent said he would accept the decision. ``There are all
kind of ministries,'' he said, ``and I need time to discern what
kind of pastoral work I'd like to do, now that I'm shifting away
from this type of ministry. I just hope the work I've been involved
in bears fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gramick declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy within the church has dogged the two since 1977 when
they founded New Ways Ministry in Mount Rainier, Md., to reach out
to gay and lesbian Catholics. Situated within the boundaries of the
Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., the organization came under
criticism from Cardinal James Hickey, Washington's archbishop,
prompting Sister Gramick and Nugent to resign as leaders of the
organization in 1984. While they live in Maryland, they had
continued to hold workshops and retreats on homosexuality and the
church across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Vatican said it had ``received numerous
complaints and urgent requests for clarification'' from American
bishops and others about what Nugent and Sister Gramick were saying
even after they left New Ways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Vatican created a commission under Cardinal Adam
Maida, archbishop of Detroit, to determine whether Nugent and
Sister Gramick had moved outside church teachings on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   After the two published a book on their work, the commission met
with them in 1994, then forwarded its findings to the Vatican,
which continued the investigation through correspondence with
Nugent and Sister Gramick.
</P>
<P>
   These exchanges continued from February 1996 through January
1999, the Vatican's statement said, but they did not dispel church
authorities' concern that Nugent's and Sister Gramick's views were
``doctrinally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Catechism describes homosexual acts as
``intrinsically disordered'' and contrary to natural law because
they do not lead to procreation. But it also states that gays
should be treated with ``respect, compassion and sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Vatican said Nugent and Sister Gramick were
presenting only half the message. And in so doing, it said, they
did not allow people ``struggling with homosexuality'' to hear
``the true teaching of the church from those who minister to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the decision ran from supportive to critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised at how severely they came down,'' said Sister
Rosemary Howarth, superior at the School Sisters of Notre Dame,
Sister Gramick's order. ``Yes, we are saddened and disappointed at
how hard it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bruce Williams, a Dominican priest and moral theologian
who had been an adviser to Sister Gramick and Nugent when they
appeared before Maida's commission, said the two ``went to heroic
lengths to cooperate very thoroughly with Vatican authorities.'' He
called the decision dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop William Lori, auxiliary bishop of Washington, said
that Cardinal Hickey considered the decision ``doctrinally and
pastorally correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far back as 1981, Cardinal Hickey observed that the
approach of Sister Jeannine and Father Nugent to the question of
the immorality of homosexual activity was very ambiguous,'' Lori
said. ``The phrase he always used was `studied ambiguity,' such
that the authentic teaching of the church was undermined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, errors with regard to the faith come from a certain
selectivity, and I think this is a classic instance of selecting
some of the teaching and distorting the other part,'' Lori said.
</P>
<P>
   In separate statements, Maida and Bishop Joseph Fiorenza,
president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said they
hoped Sister Gramick and Nugent would accept the Vatican's
decision. Fiorenza also quoted from a 1986 Vatican statement
endorsing the ``pastoral care'' of gays and lesbians and said such
work should continue within church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry,
called the Vatican's decision misguided and unjust. Speaking of
Nugent and Sister Gramick, he said, ``They have consistently
presented the compassionate face of the church to gay and lesbian
people, and they have done so faithfully to church teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Although DeBernardo said the decision would be ``particularly
hurtful'' to gay and lesbian Catholics, he said the discussion
about homosexuality and the church would continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America,
offered a view different from some others, saying the decision, in
coming after so many years, showed a careful deliberation, yet
appeared to lack important details. ``On the positive side, it's
clear that the Vatican took a long time before it made its
decision,'' he said. ``On the negative side, there's very little
specificity in the report from the Vatican about what they were
doing that was contrary to church teaching.''

REPORT SAYS PROFIT-MAKING HEALTH PLANS DAMAGE CARE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patients enrolled in profit-making health insurance
plans are significantly less likely to receive the basics of good
medical care _ including childhood immunizations, routine
mammograms, pap smears, prenatal care, and lifesaving drugs after a
heart attack _ than those in not-for-profit plans, says a new study
that concludes that the free market is ``compromising the quality
of care.''
</P>
<P>
   The research, conducted by a team from Harvard University and
Public Citizen, an advocacy group in Washington, is the first
comprehensive comparison of investor-owned and nonprofit plans. The
authors found that on every one of 14 quality-of-care indicators,
the for-profits scored worse.
</P>
<P>
   But because the researchers favor national health insurance,
some questioned their findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is destroying our health care system,'' Dr. David
U. Himmelstein, associate professor of medicine at Harvard
University Medical School and the study's lead author, said in a
telephone interview. ``We have had a decade or more of policies
aimed at making health care a business, and they have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor-owned health plans, which are typically made up of
loose networks of doctors, have come to dominate the American
medical landscape in recent years. These plans, offered by
companies like Aetna, U.S. Healthcare and Cigna Healthcare, last
year covered 62 percent of all patients in HMOs, as compared to 26
percent in 1985. Yet most research on quality of care in HMOs has
focused on traditional nonprofits, among them Kaiser Permanente, in
California, and HIP, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, which appears this week in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, analyzed quality-of-care data from
248 investor-owned and 81 not-for-profit plans in 45 states and the
District of Columbia. These plans provided coverage to 56 percent
of all Americans enrolled in HMOs in 1996, the year from which the
patient information was drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings: In profit-making HMOs just 63.9 percent of
2-year-olds were fully immunized, as compared to 72.3 percent in
nonprofits. Lifesaving beta-blocker drugs were given to 59.2
percent of heart attack patients in for-profit plans, but 70.6
percent of patients in nonprofits got the drugs. Diabetes patients
were less likely to receive annual eye exams to prevent blindness
in profit-making plans; the figure was 35.1 percent, as against
47.9 percent in nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   The investor-owned plans fared worse, the authors said, even
when all other factors, like location of the plan, and whether the
doctors were employees or members of networks, were taken into
account. While the study had certain limitations _ it did not
examine patient outcomes, for instance _ the authors, who paid for
the research themselves, said the data were the best available.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being published just as the Senate is embroiled in
a divisive debate over how to protect patients' rights and regulate
HMOs. While the authors say the timing is coincidental, the work is
already influencing the discussion. In a statement released
Tuesday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is pushing for HMO
regulation, said the research ``contains strong new support for HMO
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the insurance industry, which opposes
regulation, argue just the opposite. They say the study
demonstrates that, even at their worst, health maintenance
organizations provide better care to patients than fee-for-service
arrangements that were common 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best conclusion that can be drawn from this study is that
managed care is improving the quality of health care for those
Americans that are covered by health plans,'' said Susan Pisano, a
spokeswoman for the American Association of Health Plans, which
represents both for-profit and nonprofit plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pisano also accused the authors of confusing ``analysis and
ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmelstein did not dispute that he has a bias. ``My bias is
that for-profit HMOs kill people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eli Ginzberg, a health care economist at Columbia University
who did not participate in the study , said Himmelstein's political
views did not discredit his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that he has an agenda, but I think he is
reading his data correctly,'' said Ginzberg, who said it was hardly
surprising that nonprofit plans deliver better care. ``Let's face
it, people went into the for-profit managed care business to make
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was made public here Tuesday at the offices of Public
Citizen, whose director, Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, was a co-author.

BOC, BRITISH SUPPLIER OF GASES, TO BE BOUGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's BOC Group PLC, the world's second largest
supplier of industrial gases, will be taken over and divided up by
Air Liquide SA of France and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of the
United States under an $11.2 billion cash deal announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which will give the two buyers roughly half the
world market for gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, was announced
three weeks after BOC had rejected a takeover overture from the
same suitors.
</P>
<P>
   The 113-year-old British company is valued at 1,460 pence a
share, or $22.63, under terms of the deal, a 42 percent premium
over the price before takeover talk began to drive up BOC stock in
early May. Air Liquide is the world's leading industrial gases
supplier and Air Products is the industry's fourth biggest. BOC had
been under pressure to avoid a drawn-out takeover campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, BOC said a proposal from the two rivals was
unsatisfactory. But Christopher Marsay, head of investor relations
at BOC, said the bidders had strengthened their commitment to
overcoming regulatory hurdles and had improved the financing,
lowering the risk to BOC shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   A BOC statement said the deal provided for Air Liquide to
acquire all of BOC's gases operations in Britain and Ireland. Air
Products is to take over BOC operations in Australia and New
Zealand. The two buyers will split BOC's United States businesses
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Air Liquide is already the market leader in the United States,
with a 19.8 percent share in 1998, and the division of BOC's U.S.
assets is apparently designed to counter antitrust concerns,
analysts said. Remaining businesses, such as those in South Africa,
will be divided up on a ``country by country or region by region
basis,'' a BOC statement said. BOC shares fell by 15 pence to 1,372
pence or about $21.23 _ below the bid price _ reflecting a
perceived risk that the deal still might unravel during regulatory
hearings in Europe, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been driven by slow growth in the $28.5 billion
gases market. The market has been hit by Asia's slump and reduced
demand from American steelmakers, analysts said. The prospect that
BOC will be dismantled raised worries among British labor unions
representing BOC's 11,000 employees in Britain. Roger Lyons, of the
Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, called the deal ``a
disaster for British jobs and for the British chemical industry.''

HISTORIC BOOT COMPANY IN IS STOPPING PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Olathe Boot Co., which according to legend
supplied footwear to Wild Bill Hickok and Annie Oakley, is shutting
down production and looking for a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Boot production will cease at the end of the week, although the
company's Olathe, Kan., and Denver showrooms will remain open. In
the meantime, talks are being held with potential buyers of the
business, said Chris D'Adamo, the owner of Olathe Boot.
</P>
<P>
   The change comes amid a soft market for boots. In June,
financing to run the business fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `To heck with it,' '' D'Adamo said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Adamo, who has owned the company for 12 years, said the boot
business was hot in the early 1990s thanks to the popularity of
line dancing. Production increased, but sales have since fallen
sharply for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe Boot had 80 employees as recently as last year but now
has 20. Some will lose their jobs when production ceases this week.
</P>
<P>
   D'Adamo said Olathe Boot's sales to rodeo stars and ranch
workers had remained strong. But the general retail business at its
Olathe and Denver showrooms had suffered since 1994. Those sales
were off about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   D'Adamo said he was optimistic that a sale could be worked out
and that boot production could resume. Three of those interested
are from the Kansas City area and one is from out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe Boot goes back to 1875 and evolved from the Hyer Boot Co.
of Olathe. It was founded by C.H. Hyer and developed a reputation
for producing top-quality handcrafted boots. Orscheln Industries
purchased the company's assets in the 1970s. It was sold to D'Adamo
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As talks continue, the showrooms will stay open and the
inventory of boots will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of boots _ that's part of the problem,''
D'Adamo said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ It's a different country. A different
world, really. The accents certainly don't sound like they did in
Pinehurst, N.C. Scottish lilt has replaced southern drawl. Though
they are technically the same language, they can be equally
incomprehensible at times.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of the stark differences, Payne Stewart has arrived
at Carnoustie for his first golf tournament since winning the U.S.
Open, and one important thing hasn't changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   He's in his element.
</P>
<P>
   Another beastly golf course is laid out before him in the
British Open. More predictions of high scores are being made. And
Stewart again is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make us look foolish if the wind blows real
hard,'' Stewart said Tuesday. ``If it blows 30 mph, you could see
an astronomical score win this golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why not? They're going to hand somebody the Claret Jug on
Sunday no matter what the score is. And I'd love for it to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Par on any hole this week is going to be like a small victory,
which is why people aren't ruling out the possibility that Stewart
could become the first player since Tom Watson in '82 to win Opens
on both sides of the Atlantic. Lee Trevino did it before that in
'71.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has a flair for success on courses where birdies are
rare. He won the U.S. Open at 1 under par for the 72 holes. He has
patience and persistence to survive grueling conditions, which this
week most assuredly will present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I come in with confidence,'' he said. ``I don't want
to come here and play poorly and then say, `Well, I won the U.S.
Open, so that's OK.' I won't accept that. I want to come in and
perform the way that Payne Stewart is capable of playing. I hate to
play in a golf tournament that I don't feel I have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I really didn't have a grip on my golf game like I
do this year. I'm swinging at the ball better. I'm hitting the ball
more solid. So I've got more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And a place like Carnoustie could be a hand-in-glove fit for
Stewart, although it's hard to imagine anybody feeling comfortable
on the long, bunkered and narrowed fairways of this old course.
</P>
<P>
   But for Stewart, winning the British Open would be another
feather that he has been reaching for throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought I had a really good chance to win an Open
Championship,'' he said. ``I think I can play a bunch of different
golf shots. I can work the ball in both directions. I'm a good
chipper. And I putt the ball well. And there's not severe breakage
in these greens. They are relatively flat and not too speedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is the home of golf. There's so much history here in
Scotland. It's a tournament I've always wanted to do well in.''
</P>
<P>
   And one that Stewart believes he can win, especially in the meat
grinder that is expected to be Carnoustie this week. Its ribbonlike
fairways slice through knee-high weeds and brush. The bunkers have
been made more severe than normal, and the greens well, the greens
actually will be like 18 little sanctuaries. They are mostly flat,
and although they are big, they should allow for two putts from
just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall severity of the course plays into Stewart's
strength, which is maintaining his poise and his scorecard on
courses where par is a good score.
</P>
<P>
   And even though he didn't pick up a golf club for a couple of
weeks while he basked in the U.S. Open win, Stewart knows he is
capable of picking up right where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have a confidence about you,'' he said. ``That
confidence frees everything up. It frees up your swing and your
mind, and you just ride the wave. It's like getting on top of the
wave, and you ride it as long as you can stay up there on top of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Stewart said he did enjoy getting away for the
three-plus weeks since winning at Pinehurst No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of weeks, all I did was answer the phone and
open up mail,'' Stewart said. ``I got a letter from Bill Clinton,
which I thought was pretty neat. He said he and Hillary were
excited for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the three weeks off. The last Open I won in
Hazeltine, I went right into the Irish Open and never really had a
chance to sit back and reflect and enjoy what I had accomplished. I
had a chance to do that this time. It's been special. It's
something I will never forget in my life. And I'm very excited
about playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough has Stewart and everybody else concerned about what
kind of score will win this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thick, it's nasty, and it's not very far off the fairway
_ if you call those fairways,'' Stewart said. ``Those are kind of
like walking paths we have in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to make a lot of money when they cut and bale
the hay out there. The cows are going to eat good this year, very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the thoroughbreds who will be tromping around
Carnoustie's hayfield starting Thursday morning?
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, for one, is ready to romp. It's not surprising
considering he feels like he's on a familiar track.

 &HT;    Rose, `Shoeless' on Century list
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _Major League Baseball unveiled the ballot for its All
Century Team on Tuesday afternoon, and the 100 players appearing on
the form posed an interesting philosophical question for
commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose and ``Shoeless'' Joe Jackson, both suspended from the
game for life and banned from the Hall of Fame, were included. That
was promptly brought to Selig's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't in any way affect (their) status with Major League
Baseball,'' Selig said. ``However, they are two players that have
made an impact on the field and they're entitled to be on the
ballot. But it does not in any way alter the circumstances both of
them are under right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballot includes four Braves _ outfielder Hank Aaron,
pitchers Warren Spahn and Greg Maddux, third baseman Eddie Mathews
_ and seven other active players other than Maddux _ Mark McGwire,
Cal Ripken Jr., Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn, Rickey
Henderson and Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two candidates were on hand for the announcement,
including Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough team to vote for,'' Aaron said.
``There are so many great players to chose from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be available at major-league parks, Kmarts and in
selected magazines as well as over the Internet. Voting will
conclude Sept. 15, with the team announced during the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity fever
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Kevin Millwood found himself suffering through the
same experience as many first-time All-Stars: the fame factor.
Millwood was signing souvenirs in a room off the clubhouse Tuesday
when he turned around to see San Diego's Tony Gwynn, a 15-time
All-Star. Though nearly strangers, the two soon were in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started talking about stuff,'' Millwood said. ``Kinda
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood handled the situation better than Texas rookie reliever
Jeff Zimmerman, who rode an elevator with Ripken on Monday.
Zimmerman wanted to introduce himself but was too nervous and rode
to his floor in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Save Fenway
</P>
<P>
   Boston is awash in sentimentality about Fenway Park, which the
Red Sox are planning to replace, whenever they can find the money.
But that hasn't stopped the public cries for preserving the
87-year-old stadium.
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre wants to retain as much of its
history as possible: ``I'm going to cherish this night.'' Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa's first career home run came in Boston on June 21,
1989, when he was with the Chicago White Sox facing Roger Clemens.
``From that day on,'' said Sosa, ``I say I know how to play this
game.'' . . . Seattle will host the 2001 All-Star Game at new
Safeco Field. Though no official determination has been made for
2002, Milwaukee is jockeying for that game at Miller Park, which
opens next season. . . . Trevor Hoffman needed no formal
introduction to Fenway. When the San Diego reliever was still in
high school, he was allowed to take part in Red Sox pre-game drills
when his older brother, Glenn, played for Boston.

PAINE WEBBER POSTS 26 PERCENT GAIN IN 2ND QUARTER EARNINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHOLNN FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another record quarter, Paine Webber Group Inc.
posted a 26 percent gain in second-quarter earnings Tuesday,
beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage company reported a profit of $163.5 million, or
$1.02 a diluted share, compared with $129.5 million, or 82 cents a
share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Analysts had
expected a profit of 94 cents a share, according to the First Call
Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Paine Webber, traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
fell 37.5 cents Tuesday, to $45.125.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber generated $488.9 million in income from brokers'
commissions, up 22 percent from $402 million in the quarter a year
earlier. Income from managing assets grew 23 percent, to $224.5
million from $182 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the industry, Paine Webber benefited from the
booming stock market. Its strength came in the face of concerns
about profitability from investors and analysts who see the threat
of online trading cutting into commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They quite handily beat the Street, but the one real negative
is the effect of the Internet,'' said Derek Statkevicus, an analyst
at Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. ``Paine Webber will always be able
to compete. But is the pricing pressure going to be detrimental to
earnings in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber's client assets grew 17 percent, from $329.3
billion to $384.2 billion in the period a year earlier. Donald B.
Marron, the company's chief executive, said the firm's strategy was
to focus on picking up accounts from wealthy clients who will
continue to demand the advice of brokers. With household assets
growing 8 percent a year in the United States, he said, Paine
Webber will continue to thrive off the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from trading stocks and bonds rose to $279.8 million, an
increase of 15 percent from $244.1 million in the quarter a year
earlier. Investment banking revenue dropped 9 percent, from $176.7
billion to $160.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company is different,'' said Amy Butte, a brokerage
industry analyst at Bear, Stearns. ``Its revenues will continue to
be based on advice and centered on the high net worth individuals.
And people are starting to recognize the difference in the Paine
Webber model.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Paine Webber announced a plan to offer online trading
later this year, joining other Wall Street firms in the growing but
fiercely competitive Internet market. Two days earlier, Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. said it would start offering online trading in July.
Online brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and ETrade have thrived
on the explosion in online trading.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Paine Webber has provided updated account and other
market information to clients with accounts of at least $50,000
through its Paine Webber EDGE service. The system now includes
102,500 households, up 31,000 from the beginning of the year. The
firm has 7,118 financial advisers in 303 sales offices.

FIRM AT THE FOREFRONT OF HOME LOANS TO AMERICAN INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ President Clinton's trip last week to the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in North Dakota put a spotlight on
the fact that American Indians have largely been left out of the
growth in home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are significant obstacles to overcome in making
home loans on land, experts say there are American Indians with the
resources to own homes but pitifully few houses to be had. A small
group of players in the mortgage industry is blazing a trail
through this thicket. Among the players are large companies such as
George K. Baum &AMP; Co., but also at the forefront is a small mortgage
broker from Johnson County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   First Americans Mortgage is owned by Delmar Janovec, who is a
quarter Santee Sioux, and his partner, Dustan Shepherd. It has
originated about 180 mortgages in the past year in a market that
measures totals only in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The partners merged the operation last year into a penny-stock
company controlled by Janovec, a company with significant financial
obstacles of its own. But if this new housing market blossoms as
many expect, bigger players say First Americans can be expected to
flower along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last of the untapped housing markets,'' Shepherd
said recently from his office in the Louisburg Shopping Center in
Overland Park, Kan., where sculptures and statues of Indians make
up the only decor. ``There are in excess of 2.5 million American
Indians on and off the reservation and only a few players in this
market. We are getting in on the ground floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Garrison agrees. Garrison works for PMI Inc., one of the
largest private mortgage insurers in the country. PMI was
introduced to the American Indian market by First Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to look at an American success story, look at
them,'' Garrison said. ``They are small, but what started as a
dream is turning into a housing program with $65 million in funds
and rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolling is right. At his Pine Ridge news conference, President
Clinton announced that George K. Baum &AMP; Co. agreed to underwrite
$100 million in bonds annually for five years to create a market
for reservation mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd had worked several years in homeless and
affordable-housing programs when a friend suggested that he look
into housing for American Indians. He met Janovec, who had been in
the construction business with Tomahawk Construction. After some
tough years, Tomahawk was put into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1994
and emerged with a debt payback plan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd said the two men started First Americans Mortgage in
1995 and naively thought they could develop a profitable business
within 24 months. He said the company broke even in 1998.
Securities and Exchange Commission documents indicated that
AmeriResource Technologies had 1998 revenue of $47,560, all from
First Americans, and a net operating loss of $3.5 million. That
compared with a 1977 operating loss of $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Janovec said, among other things, that reservation casinos had
improved the annual income for American Indians, increasing demand
for home loans. First Americans found, however, that making home
loans on reservations required creative programs, Shepherd said.
What court system do you use to file a mortgage or in case of a
default? There also is the lack of a single-family housing history
for the buyers or the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are working with first-generation homebuyers, people with
no history in how it works,'' Shepherd said. ``Normally, someone
finds a house or a builder, shops the market for loans and then
picks a lender. We had to do everything in reverse. They would
start with us, and we would help find a builder and get a lender.''
</P>
<P>
   They started working with the Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma,
where American Indians own their own land instead of it being owned
by the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   During his work, Shepherd hooked up with a mortgage insurer, PMI
of San Francisco, and with Washington Mutual of Seattle, one of the
country's largest thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   The group developed a program with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development in which a buyer could put 1 percent
down. The tribe would pay 2 percent of the down payment and closing
costs. PMI would insure part of the mortgage and the tribe would
insure part. Washington Mutual would make the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The program started with a $10 million commitment from the
tribe. It has been expanded to other tribes and grown to $55
million in commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison of PMI says the more the company learns about working
with the tribes, the more it wants to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affordable housing is the future of mortgage insurance, but
you have to roll up your sleeves and put programs together. These
are not slam dunks,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Castro, a vice president with Washington Mutual, said the
company had made loans to American Indians in the Northwest, where
the company is housed. Shepherd offered them entry into new
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``While economies are growing on many reservations, there is
lack of housing stock,'' Castro said. ``We do view it as an
emerging market with a lot of potential.''
</P>
<P>
   First Americans has made its money through the fees it charges
by originating loans. It has expanded to 15 employees in
anticipation of the expanding loan market. It also would like to
build some of the homes and has formed First Plains Construction to
do that.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd said he and Janovec decided to merge the company into
AmeriResource last year because a public company gave them access
to capital not available to a private company. He acknowledged that
AmeriResource had past problems, most related to the bankruptcy of
Tomahawk Construction, but he said the company was prepared to face
them.
</P>
<P>
   According to SEC documents, AmeriResource has about $464,000 in
debt owed by Tomahawk. It paid some of its bills last year by
issuing 32 million shares of stock and bought First Americans by
issuing 45 million shares. It has $63,318 in tax liabilities, a
$430,000 judgment and legal claims against it amounting to more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the acquisition of First Americans would give the
shareholders that hung on to the company some values down the
road,'' Janovec said. ``My goal and Dustan's goal is to be involved
in a business where we don't just create a good business profit but
we help other people.''

WALKER WEDDED TO ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chances of the Red Sox prying Larry Walker from
the Colorado Rockies is miniscule, particularly after Rockies
management has deemed Walker ``untouchable'' in trade proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, widely considered one of the best all-around players in
the National League, would look ideal in the outfield at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get our own team straightened out,'' said
Walker, hitting a major league-leading .382 with 25 homers and 77
RBIs at the break. ``There will always be people talking about
trades and people denying them. I don't spend much time thinking
about it. I'm very happy where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, under highly regarded manager Jim Leyland, have
been an enigma. Walker doesn't understand why a talented team has
had so much trouble sustaining a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start playing together as a unit and we haven't
done that for a few years,'' Walker said. ``We played well for
three games vs. Texas recently and then we started to go the other
way again. I've tried to figure it out the past few years and I
have no idea what the solution is.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker may be untouchable, but he is frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in his fourth All-Star Game Tuesday night, he's been
hitting over .350 since May 3. He's also scored 50 percent of the
time he's reached base (69 for 138) and is hitting .405 with
runners on base. Over his last 162 games, Walker is batting .391.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was asked whether the Rockies have what it takes to turn
their fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say no I'm ripping my teammates,'' said Walker. ``I
believe my teammates can get the job done. If there are a couple of
moves that need to be made that would help certain areas of our
team, then that would probably be beneficial to us. We might be a
team that needs to make some moves, but I'm just a player, not a GM
who might be able to speak more openly about those moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have been a big-name team the past few years, but
haven't lived up to expectations. Walker fondly remembers the 1994
Montreal Expos, who were leading the National League East when the
strike hit in mid-August, ending the Expos' chances of winning with
a younger, ``no-name'' team that at the time included Walker and
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring it up again, I always do. I always bring up '94.
Nobody thought we were doing anything. We weren't big names at the
time, though a few of us have become big names as the years have
turned. It doesn't matter what numbers you put up individually, but
if you can't get it done as a team they don't mean much. In '94 we
got it done as a team. It was fun because we were all young players
trying to establish ourselves and we did it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spring training this year we were all so optimistic. You
always hope to be over .500 at the break and we haven't even done
that, so it's been disappointing. After making the playoffs in '95
as the wild card, it's been downhill since. There's been no
answers. We've tried everything from the ridiculous to the sensible
stuff and it hasn't worked. I just think we need to be more
consistent. There's still some time to make a difference in this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker played on an Expos team that was run by Dan Duquette, and
there's always been the feeling that Duquette would eventually make
a run at him for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockies aren't willing to dismantle the whole operation
and start over again just yet. Too bad for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great ballpark for a hitter, whether you're
lefthanded or righthanded,'' said Walker. ``It's an honor to play
here and I know the guys who get to play here feel they're playing
someplace special.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker did make an All-Star prediction for Martinez: ``Knowing
Pedro and the adrenaline is flowing it wouldn't surprise me if it
was three up and three down. He's an awesome pitcher. Anyone who
has ever faced him knows how overpowering he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what happened in the first inning. Three
batters, three strikeouts.

SONY AND TIME WARNER MAKE MUSIC DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the growing ranks of media companies with
quasi-independent Internet units, Time Warner and Sony said Tuesday
that they would merge Columbia House, the music club they jointly
own, with CDnow, the struggling online music store.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting company will focus on selling compact disks and
video tapes from all labels and studios, although the emphasis will
be on promoting Sony and Time Warner products. And by the end of
the year, it will offer music that can be downloaded directly from
the Internet, a market that many in the music industry have long
feared but are now moving quickly to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first business that will benefit the most from the
Internet will be the revolution in music,'' Gerald Levin, the
chairman of Time Warner, said.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, not yet named, will be publicly traded so that
it can give employees stock options and use its shares as currency
in acquisitions. CDnow's existing shareholders will have 26 percent
of the new company. Time Warner and Sony get 37 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Other big media companies are also rushing to create publicly
traded Internet operations. On Monday, Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co. said it had
agreed to buy the 58 percent of the Infoseek Corp. it did not
already own and would create a new class of stock tied to its
online operations. And the NBC unit of the General Electric Co. is
creating a similar venture by merging its stake in Snap, &UR;  &LR; a search
service, with Xoom, a publicly traded online merchant.
</P>
<P>
   As in other industries, record labels are moving to sell
directly to their customers on line at the risk of alienating their
traditional retailers. In April, Bertelsmann and Universal Music, a
unit of Seagram Co., agreed to form their own Internet music store
called Getmusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   CDnow has been struggling to increase sales and move toward
profitability. Selling compact disks is a business with low profit
margins, and CDnow has spent tens of millions of dollars on
promotion _ as much as $70 to bring in each new customer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, within months after opening its own music store
last year, Amazon.com surged past CDnow in sales by doing little
more than promoting compact discs to its book buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tuesday, CDnow officials told analysts that revenue in
the second quarter would be about $35 million, less than expected
and less even than the company's sales in the first quarter, a rare
decline for an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Even a recent merger with its chief rival, N2K, has failed to
reverse CDnow's fortunes. As a result, its share price has declined
slightly over the last year as shares in other Internet companies
have skyrocketed. Tuesday, the market reaction was no better.
CDnow's shares fell $1.9375, to $20.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts questioned whether the business formed from CDnow and
Columbia House would be as attractive as an Internet company.
Columbia House has revenue of $1.3 billion, but its sales have been
declining because baby boomers have stopped buying compact discs to
replace vinyl records. The combined companies will also have about
$250 million in Internet sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why CDnow wants to align with big record
companies,'' said Derek Brown, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP;
Co. ``But I'm not sure what Columbia House record club brings to
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Columbia House has been in the works for nearly
a year. It was initially proposed by Nancy Peretsman, an investment
banker with Allen &AMP; Co., in a discussion with Richard J. Bressler,
then the chief financial officer of Time Warner. The companies
agreed in principle to the deal early this year, but negotiations
were protracted _ in part because CDnow was occupied with its own
merger and with disputes among its executives, people close to the
transaction said. Moreover, there were differences to work out
between Time Warner and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, other companies, including BMG-Universal and
Deutsche Telekom, &UR;  &LR; expressed interest in CDnow, executives close to
the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday is a complex web of commitments. Sony
and Time Warner will guarantee $200 million in existing CDnow debt
and another $150 million in new debt. And they will promote CDnow
on their existing Internet sites as well as on their album covers
and broadcast networks and even through inserts in boxes of Sony
electronics products. Some of this promotion will simply be given
to CDnow. In other cases, the company will have the right to buy
advertising at a discounted rate.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is expected to hire a chief executive from
outside the company. Richard Wolter, the chairman of Columbia
House, will run the record club. Jason Olim, the chief executive of
CDnow, will run the online record store. And Jonathan V. Diamond,
the chairman of CDnow, will leave the company.

   INTEL PROFIT INCREASES 49 PERCENT BUT FALLS SHORT OF FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Intel reported second-quarter profit that was up 49 percent but
fell slightly short of analysts' estimates. The company attributed
the results to a normal seasonal slowdown and said it expected a
strong second half.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the earnings disappointment, which was announced
after the close of markets, was likely to take the NASDAQ down a
bit Wednesday. After closing at $65.375, the company's shares

EARNINGS, NEW DRUG GIVE BOOST TO AMGEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wall Street gave a major endorsement to biotech
giant Amgen Inc., boosting shares 9 percent in the wake of
better-than-expected profits and a bullish outlook for an arthritis
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen stock jumped $6 to $72.3125 on heavy volume of 14.4
million shares. Gruntal &AMP; Co. repeated its ``strong buy'' rating;
Caroline Copithorne at Prudential Securities raised her price
target to $89 from $83; and AmeriCal Securities analyst Charles
Engelberg said the stock could hit $100.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's enthusiasm stems from the growing belief that
Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks northeast of Los Angeles, is finally
making good on its promise to broaden its offerings beyond its
flagship Epogen and Neupogen drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been big cheerleaders for Amgen but they beat
everyone's numbers and revealed a depth to their products in
development,'' Engelberg said Tuesday. ``We believe that the stock
price has suffered from Wall Street's perception that it didn't
have a significant pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen disclosed late Monday it expects to file for government
approval of a IL-1ra for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis later
this year because the Food and Drug Administration has decided the
standard ``Phase III'' trial won't be needed. That could mean the
new drug would hit the market in the second half of next year, 18
months ahead of what had been previously expected, according to
James McCament, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being cleared from doing the Phase III trial is a big deal,''
McCament said. ``It doesn't happen very often and it means that
there's a much higher probability the drug will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe IL-1ra could compete against Immunex Corp.'s
Embrel drug in a market worth $1 billion domestically. ``There's
likely to be a fair amount of competition but Amgen's drug could be
synergistic with Embrel,'' McCament noted. ``Amgen is a company
with good sales force and they're entering a nice attractive market
with this.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2.5 million Americans suffer from arthritis and about 20
percent of those have ``moderately severe'' symptoms or worse,
according to Engleberg.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen also reported late Monday second-quarter profits rising 24
percent to $267.6 million, or 50 cents a share, on a 25 percent
gain in revenues to $820.5 million. Earnings were 4 cents ahead of
Wall Street's consensus estimate. The company also said year-end
profits should be in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 a share, or a dime
ahead of what had been the consensus forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's other key development drugs include a second-generating
chemotherapy treatment drug, a prostate cancer drug and NESP, a
successor to its anti-anemia Epogen drug.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amgen hit an all-time high of $81.375 in early April
but then fell back on worries the company would fall short of
profit forecasts. Shares began rising two weeks ago on heavy
trading following speculation that Amgen would top forecasts,
prompting Amgen management to release earnings 10 days early.

HOTEL CHAINS IMPROVED THEIR HIRING, NAACP SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y., Wash., Fla., D.C.)  (Eds., also filed in `f' code)  
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's largest hotel chains improved in hiring
minority workers and reaching out to minority businesses and
consumers last year, according to an annual survey conducted by the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, president of the association, unveiled a ``report
card'' for hotels and a separate one for telecommunications
companies Tuesday afternoon at the group's annual convention at the
New York Hilton and Towers in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, quite frankly, that unless communities of color
become disciplined consumers, we run the risk of still sitting like
beggars on bags of gold, looking at the lack of reciprocity in our
communities, and continuing to see trade as a one-way street,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both surveys were based on information provided by the companies
in five areas: hiring of minority workers, promotion of minority
employees, relationships with businesses owned by members of
minorities, advertising in black media outlets and philanthropy in
minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott topped the list of 14 companies in the hotel survey,
getting a B+ (and a numerical grade of 3.7), followed by the
economy-chain Cendant (B+ and 3.56), whose properties include Days
Inn, Howard Johnson and Super 8 Motels. The Hilton chain ranked
third with a B.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 1 and we intend to stay there,'' said Dave Sampson,
vice president for diversity projects at Marriott International.
The company was handing out announcements saying Marriott was the
``highest-rated hotel company'' in the survey. Last year, Marriott
was given a C+.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson oversees a department that was created 18 months ago to
recruit small service providing businesses owned by women and by
members of minorities. So far, his department has contacted about
200 such companies and signed about 20 to contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the two earlier hotel surveys, none of the
companies received a failing grade this year. But four _
Bass/Holiday (which includes Holiday Inn) Wyndham, Starwood
(Westin, ITT Sheraton) and Omni _ came in at the bottom with a
grade of C.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Rogers, 57, a delegate from Racine, Wash., said she took
the report cards seriously and would avoid hotels that had low
grades. ``If you walk into a hotel that's all white, you're not
going to feel as welcome and accepted, and you will be neglected,''
she said. ``So to us, this is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the telecommunications survey, Bell South received the
highest grade of B+ (numerical grade 3.55), followed by Bell
Atlantic, the largest phone service provider in New York, with a B+
and 3.5 The only failing grade went to Alltel, because it did not
respond to requests for information, said Linda Haithcox, national
manager of economic development for the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   This was only the second year for the telecommunications survey,
and Mfume said that it was too soon to see any improvements. But he
urged the delegates not to patronize companies that had a D or a
failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Like report cards from school, the highest grade is an A, but
Ms. Haithcox said that no company had yet received it. ``If they
deserve an A, they will get it,'' she said without explaining
further about those qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Several representatives of companies ranked in the NAACP report
cards attended Tuesday's presentation and most emphasized that
their companies had made long-term commitments to diversity that
would not change because of the report cards.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bonavia, a director of corporate communications for Sprint,
said his company had made many improvements even though it received
a C grade for the second year. For instance, he said, Sprint has
made a point of recruiting at historically black colleges like
Howard University in Washington and Florida A &AMP;M University in
Tallahassee. Last year, about 20 percent of the company's 12,000
new employees were black.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bonavia said, Sprint spent $8.14 million in 1998
for advertising in magazines, newspapers and television stations
that cater to blacks, but $1.45 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that we made colossal progress year to year
on paper and in practice, you really can't step up your diversity
efforts on multiple fronts because you want to improve your
grade,'' he said.

REBEL PUSH IN COLOMBIA ADDS URGENCY TO WASHINGTON TALKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ With sporadic clashes between government
troops and left-wing guerrillas still being reported after last
weekend's fierce rebel offensive, Colombia's defense minister and
armed forces chief were set to arrive in Washington on Wednesday
for consultations with U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement signed last November calls for such contacts
regularly. But the military and political crisis that has erupted
here just days before the formal start of peace negotiations
between the government and leaders of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, scheduled for July 20, has given added urgency
to the visit by Luis Fernando Ramirez and Gen. Fernando Tapias.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of raids that began last Thursday, the FARC, as the
main rebel group is known, attacked more than 20 towns, including
one barely 25 miles from the capital, and blew up bridges and power
stations. Over the weekend, in an effort to weaken the group's
supply and reinforcement network, the government decreed a partial
curfew in nearly a third of the country and ordered the military
into a state of heightened alert.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Colombian nor U.S. officials contacted here and in
Washington Tuesday would specify what issues are to be discussed at
the talks. But military cooperation between the two governments has
been growing steadily since President Andres Pastrana took office
in August, replacing an administration that Washington regarded as
corrupt and beholden to drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Congress approved $289 million for Colombia to
help fight drugs, tripling the previous amount and making Colombia
the largest recipient of U.S. security aid after Israel and Egypt.
More recently, in a move that has alarmed human rights groups, the
Clinton administration has quietly begun sharing intelligence on
guerrilla activities with the Pastrana government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything clearly points to a buildup in the relationship,
but our concern is the resistance within the Colombian military to
addressing human rights concerns,'' said Winifred Tate, a Colombia
specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy
and research group. ``There is no guarantee that this information
is going to be used for counternarcotics operations'' and not
shared with paramilitary death squads or otherwise abused.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded intelligence-sharing arrangement was authorized in
March, according to a General Accounting Office report published
last month titled ``Narcotics Threat From Colombia Continues to
Grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The information is intended to be used only to fight drug
trafficking, but a Colombian official said that ``since the
guerrillas operate in drug-producing areas and are part of the
trafficking network, some information about them'' is now also
being supplied.
</P>
<P>
   A series of electronic surveillance and radar stations, built
and staffed by U.S. technicians, are maintained around Colombia as
part of the enhanced cooperation strategy. It is not clear,
however, whether the United States made information obtained from
those listening posts available over the weekend to the Colombian
military.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Washington, Tapias asserted that the army had
achieved ``complete victory'' over the rebels, saying more than 300
insurgents had been killed since Thursday. In the past, however,
the United States has been critical of the performance of the
Colombian military, regarding it as inept and corrupt, and has
preferred to cultivate a close relationship with the national
police, which is a separate entity.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States sees it, the drug war here is going badly
in large part because of the military's inability to stem the rebel
tide. Official U.S. estimates, based on satellite and aerial
surveillance, indicate that the amount of land devoted to
cultivation of drug crops rose by more than a quarter last year,
despite an American-supported drug eradication effort in producing
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultivation is way down in the Guaviare region, but way up in
the Putumayo and Caqueta areas, which are under guerrilla control
and therefore much more difficult to get in there to eradicate,''
said one U.S. official with long experience here. ``These are
industrial-sized fields, not a couple of hectares for peasants, and
it will take a much more coordinated effort within Colombia to get
a handle on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, all U.S. assistance, including the recent purchase
of helicopters and the training of a new air-mobile battalion, is
directed toward antinarcotics efforts. But the guerrillas, who earn
hundreds of millions of dollars a year from their involvement, see
the effort as aimed at them, and have repeatedly threatened
Washington with retaliation if it continues to step up its support
and involvement here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Yugoslavia,'' Jorge Briceno Suarez, the second in
command of the FARC, said in an interview with an Argentine
newspaper this month. ``If the United States intervenes, it will
see blood flow.''

BORDER AGENT

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Those who saw him surrender were struck most by
the small stature and almost meek demeanor of the man portrayed for
weeks as a brutal, rail-riding serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of the most wanted man in the nation, you would
think he would not be so quiet, so docile,'' said Anne Estrada,
deputy district director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service office in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   As described by Estrada and others present, the surrender of
accused serial killer Rafael Resendez-Ramirez was a remarkably
low-key ending to a frantic international hunt for the suspect in
at least eight slayings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised he was such a slight man and quiet man,''
said Luis Garcia, INS district director in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents processed Resendez-Ramirez for admission to the
United States after he surrendered to law officers on the bridge
linking Zaragoza, Mexico, and the rural Ysleta community southeast
of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The officers alerted the INS early Tuesday that Resendez-Ramirez
was in Mexico and had agreed to turn himself in at the
international bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bridge is the most lightly traveled of three that
cross the Rio Grande in the El Paso area, it saw nearly 8 million
of the area's 55 million bridge crossings last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 8:30 a.m. CDT, the suspect's sister, Manuela Maturino of
Albuquerque, N.M., arrived at the INS checkpoint in Ysleta, said
Arthur Gonzales, INS supervisor in charge of inspections at the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino, described by authorities as a key intermediary in
negotiating Resendez-Ramirez' surrender, was accompanied by an
Albuquerque pastor.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking by cellular phone to the suspect and two other
brothers on the Mexican side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., Resendez-Ramirez arrived in a white pickup driven by
his brother, Florentino Maturino Recendis, identified by Estrada as
a church pastor in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Several other family members followed in a blue van, she said.
</P>
<P>
   They pulled into the right lane and stopped about 100 feet from
the checkpoint on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, described as about 5-feet-6-inches tall with a
slight build, stepped out of the pickup and hugged Manuela
Maturino, Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gonzales and Texas Ranger Andrew F. ``Drew'' Carter Jr.
approached the suspect, who identified himself and was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmen did not have guns drawn because they expected no
resistance, and there was none, Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in law enforcement 30 years, and people know when it
is time to give up,'' Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   The group then went to an INS interview room and processing
center.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, who has used numerous aliases, gave his full name
as Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis. Authorities said recently that is
his true name, but continued to call him Resendez-Ramirez during
the manhunt because the name had become familiar to the public and
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   No lawyer was present, Estrada said, and Resendez-Ramirez
apparently said nothing about the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't ask him any questions about any alleged crimes he
had committed in the United States,'' Garcia said. ``We didn't want
to violate his civil rights. We just asked required, related
immigration questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The process took about an hour, during which time the suspect
had a chance to speak with family members, but he was unable to
return their hugs because of his handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Maturino and another sister wept. ``I couldn't tell if
it was relief, or sadness, or both,'' Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
   After INS agents confirmed the suspect's identity through
fingerprints, they turned him over to Texas Rangers, part of a task
force that also included FBI agents, U.S. marshals and various
other state and local police.
</P>
<P>
   Family members followed as Resendez-Ramirez was driven to an El
Paso court for arraignment. &QL;

COCA-COLA SALES AND STOCK DROP SHARPLY IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL
EUROPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Poland, France, Belgium, Britain, Greece, Russia, Britain)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola Co.'s major bottler in Central and Eastern Europe
reported on Tuesday an unexpectedly steep drop in first-half volume
sales, and its stock fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, attributed the 5 percent
decline in volume, measured in cases sold, to severe economic
problems in Russia, the Kosovo conflict, the company's recent
bottled-water recalls in Poland and bad publicity from Coca-Cola
beverage recalls in Belgium and France, which were handled by a
different bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Coca-Cola Beverages, traded on the London Stock
Exchange, fell 6 pence, or 4.4 percent, to 131 pence ($2.04). The
stock has fallen nearly 20 percent since it was first sold a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The news was the latest headache for Coca-Cola Beverages, which
was spun off from another bottler, Coca-Cola Amatil, in late 1997.
The Coca-Cola Co. owns 50.1 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although falling sales in Russia were not a surprise, the impact
of the recalls was greater than expected on the dozen or so other
countries where the bottler does business. The results revealed
that demand for Coca-Cola products in Europe suffered broadly from
consumer fear of contaminated soda, even in areas not included in
the recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the negative publicity that has been associated with
it,'' said Chelsea Allen, a spokeswoman for the bottler. ``It
affected the whole of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottler recalled 170,000 cases of its products in Poland on
July 1 after mold was found inside glass bottles used for Coke,
Fanta and other drinks. Another recall, of 180,000 half-liter
bottles, was ordered around the same time after Polish government
scientists detected coliform bacteria in Bonaqua Plus, a purified
water sold by Coke. The bottler said the bacteria resulted from
poor maintenance at a plant in Poland, which is scheduled to reopen
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first-half results were announced as merger talks continue
between Coca-Cola Beverages and Hellenic Bottling, an Athens-based
independent Coke bottler. The deal is expected to be completed by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen said the results would not affect the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left for Hellenic's executive director, Lucas
D. Komis, were not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hellenic has offered to pay 150 to 180 pence, or $2.34 to $2.81,
for all of Coca-Cola Beverages stock, either in a stock swap or
cash. The merger would create the second-largest bottler in the
Coca-Cola system, stretching from Ireland to Italy and Nigeria to
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts who follow the beverage industry have been
puzzled by the planned merger since it was announced. They have
questioned why management at Hellenic, a family-controlled,
profitable, publicly traded company in which Coke has never held an
equity stake, would suddenly decide it wanted to be in business
with the sprawling, money-losing Coca-Cola Beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hellenic is technically the buyer, under the terms of
the deal a management team from Coca-Cola Beverages would control
the newly formed company. The Levantis family, which currently owns
84.5 percent of Hellenic, would see their ownership shrink to 47
percent. The new company is likely to follow the strategy of Coke's
other major bottlers _ big capital expenses for things like
cold-drink equipment at the cost of profits for several years at
least, in contrast to the more judicious spending demonstrated by
Hellenic in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The price for the deal is also considered astonishing, made more
so by Coca-Cola Beverages' share price decline Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extreme price,'' said Adam Spielman, an analyst who
covers both companies for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the merger could be that Coca-Cola has a plan for
its bottlers _ in short, the bigger and more in step with
Coca-Cola's plans, the better, to strengthen sales of Coca-Cola
concentrate _ and bottlers have little choice. In Europe, they do
not have permanent franchise rights, as they do in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is that the Coke system has got to
consolidate, and Hellenic is going to consolidate with it,'' said
David Lang, a director at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, a London
investment bank. ``If Hellenic didn't invest going forward and
didn't manage its business in a way that satisfied Coca-Cola, then
there would be changes anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say that Coca-Cola Beverages desperately needs to
improve, and merging with a better-performing bottler might work.
Andrew J. Conway, a beverage analyst at Morgan Stanley, noted that
the bottler's return on invested capital is just 1.3 percent _ the
lowest of the major Coke and Pepsi bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unclear why the Levantis family and Hellenic
management have embraced the deal. Hellenic's share price has been
growing much faster than the Athens Stock Exchange for the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very curious deal, this,'' Spielman said. ``Hellenic
was very happy where it was. Coke wasn't happy.'' He added:
``Clearly, Hellenic management felt the deal was advantageous to
them in the long term. Or, to put it another way, not doing the
deal would be disadvantageous.''

SENATE PANEL ENDORSES SEATTLE JUDGE'S SELECTION TO 9TH CIRCUIT
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman's
nomination to become a federal judge was endorsed Tuesday by Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the process of filling vacancies on the federal
bench has slowed for a variety of political reasons, Pechman was
one of five relatively non-controversial nominees allowed to move
forward with a hearing before Hatch's committee. Hatch said he
would support approving each of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing provided a forum for Republicans and Democrats to
air complaints about the judicial selection process. Hatch, R-Utah,
who is running for president, blasted the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, for the alleged judicial activism of its judges. Hatch and
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., also lectured the nominees about the
need to make decisions more rapidly in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized Hatch for the Senate's
slow pace of considering judicial nominees this year.
</P>
<P>
   The consideration process has stalled in part because
Republicans hope to win the presidential election next year, and
with it the right to choose federal judges. Additionally, Hatch is
unhappy that President Clinton has not yet nominated to the bench a
Utah attorney disliked by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman's nomination, although trapped in the difficult and
intensely political Senate confirmation approval process, was
praised by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
who have an unusual agreement to jointly screen candidates for
judicial nominations. No opposition has emerged to Pechman's
nomination, and none of the senators questioning her raised any
obstacle to her approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes to you out of a relatively large court, with a large
number of judges, with a noted enough career so that she appears to
both our search committee and to the two senators of the state as
someone highly qualified, not only by experience and education, but
by temperament, for a position on the United States District
Court,'' Gorton said. (Pechman worked for three months in 1975 as a
law clerk in the state attorney general's office when Gorton was
the attorney general.)
</P>
<P>
   Murray called attention to Pechman's status as a survivor of
breast cancer and a peer mentor for other women suffering from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Pechman, through her commitment to her family, her
excellence in her work, and her involvement in her community, has
been a shining example for many breast cancer victims,'' Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman, 48, is a Seattle resident who has served on the King
County bench since 1988. She had worked as a prosecutor, as a
plaintiff's attorney and as a law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Pechman to a lifetime appointment on the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington on March 24.
She would replace District Court Judge William Dwyer, who wants to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Pechman pledged to work to expedite
the handling of large and complex cases, said she is willing to
reduce judgments that she thinks are excessive, and said ``it is
not the business of a district court judge to legislate, but it is
the business of a district court judge to interpret legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pechman said she would have no problem enforcing the death
penalty, and agreed that lengthy delays in the imposition of the
death penalty can be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch encouraged the judicial nominees to keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is having a whale of a difficult time with the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals ... because there are number of people
on that circuit court of appeals who disregard the law. ... They
just substitute their own ideas for what the law ought to be ...
and in the process they have really hurt liberal judges all across
the country,'' he said.

MERRILL POSTS 23 PERCENT INCREASE IN EARNINGS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's largest brokerage
firm, posted robust second quarter earnings Tuesday, even as the
financial powerhouse struggles with infighting and tension in its
upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a stock market that continued to produce
gravity-defying gains last quarter, Merrill reported earnings of
$673 million, or $1.57 a share, up 23 percent from the $549
million, or $1.31 a share, it earned in the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's earnings easily topped analysts' expectations of $1.46
a share, according to consensus estimates compiled by the First
Call Corp.. In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
shares of Merrill rose $1.375, or about 1.8 percent, to $79.25.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill's shares still trade well below their 52-week high
of $109.125, and should the stock market slow or the economy enter
a recession, Merrill's earnings could suffer. Merrill may be
vulnerable to a takeover later this year or next if its stock price
weakens or if it is unable to successfully execute its plans to
bolster its sales presence on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Merrill is very well positioned for the global trends
driving the industry today _ investment banking trends in Europe,
strong trends in the U.S. that continue and Asia's longer-term
prospects,'' said Richard Strauss, a securities industry analyst
with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.. ``But investors are also going to be
keeping a close eye on its Internet strategy, and in the near term
I think that expectation is just as important.''
</P>
<P>
   The sharp reversal in Merrill's fortunes in the last year has
produced a startling shift in how the once seemingly impregnable
firm is perceived by many of its competitors and Wall Street. The
firm's finances were hammered by last year's economic chaos
overseas, and it was slower than firms like the Charles Schwab
Corp. to embrace the enthusiasm for trading that is sweeping the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Merrill announced that Herbert M. Allison Jr., its
president, resigned after being told he would not run the firm one
day. Allison, a cool, detached figure who seemed oddly out of sync
in Merrill's gregarious, hard-driving culture, had been at odds
with Merrill's chief executive, David H. Komansky, for some time.
Differences within the firm about how to respond to the growth of
the Internet also added to managerial tensions.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market seemed to react mildly to Allison's
departure, there is still concern about the lack of a clear
successor to Komansky and how quickly the company will put its
house in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense around the Street that Merrill is adrift,''
said a senior executive at a rival firm. ``I still marvel at where
this company was two years ago and where they are today.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill counters that it is focused on achieving its financial
goals and has managers in place who are up to the task of running
the firm in an era of brutal competition and rapid change in the
financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate to have many talented executives in
senior management and great bench strength,'' said Paul W.
Critchlow, a Merrill spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some analysts Tuesday questioned how deep Merrill's
managerial bench truly is. Leading candidates to succeed Komansky
include John L. Steffens, a vice chairman who heads online efforts
and supervises the firm's army of retail brokers, and Jeffrey M.
Peek, who oversees asset management. Beyond that, some say, the
candidates are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Although attention has focused on Allison's shortcomings since
his resignation was announced, Komansky has presided over a string
of high-profile blunders or miscues in recent years. Those include
the aggressive marketing of complex financial products known as
derivatives to Orange County, Calif., which helped send the county
into bankruptcy; a big expansion into emerging markets, which
created financial headaches last year, and an unusually deep
involvement in the near collapse of the Long-Term Capital
Management hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although Merrill also has had difficulties with its $5 billion
acquisition of the British firm, Mercury Asset Management, which it
acquired last year, Merrill said Mercury's funds were performing
better and that it was ``absolutely happy'' with its returns on
that investment.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's earnings announcement Tuesday disclosed smart gains in
its overall asset-management business. Revenue from the business
was up a record 7 percent from last year, to $1.16 billion, while
total assets under management grew 5 percent, to $516 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were generally pleased with the results from asset
management and other key units as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading was a bit lighter than I expected and investment
banking a bit better,'' said Joan S. Solotar, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Over all, it was a solid quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the period, Merrill's net revenue, which includes interest
income less interest expense, rose 12 percent, to a record $5.4
billion. Commissions rose 8.8 percent, to $1.59 billion, and
trading revenue jumped 7.6 percent, to $1.06 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banking revenue totaled $908 million in the second
quarter, up 1.1 percent from last year's booming quarter. Merrill
said equity underwriting revenue was sharply higher from that of
last year's second quarter, and nearly double the levels recorded
in the first quarter of 1999. But underwriting fees in most debt
categories declined in the second quarter, reflecting concerns
about interest rates, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected Merrill to post solid results for
the third quarter. But uncertainty about the firm will probably
emerge starting in December, when Merrill is scheduled to introduce
new Internet-related products and trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about the fourth quarter, when online
trading and the retail products that come along with it will be
rolled out,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts shared Ms. Krawcheck's interest in how Merrill's
Internet strategy will be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an inherent conflict with their brokers, which may be
compounded by the fact that Launny Steffens will be running both
the retail and Internet sides of the business,'' Ms. Solotar said.
``I am hopeful management realizes it needs a cohesive Internet
strategy and has a window of five months to put it together.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You'll have to forgive the 1999 Women's World Cup
soccer champions. They're still pretty new at this celebrity thing.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a few months ago _ nay, a few weeks ago _ that these
20 smiling athletes could walk unrecognized on the street. They
haven't quite polished their canned answers to those cliched
questions yet. They're still having an awfully good time, and need
a pinch every once in a while to remind themselves it's real.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain _ she who posed nude but for a soccer ball and
cleats, she who whipped off her game jersey and knelt before the
world in a sports bra after knocking in the game-winning penalty
kick in the finals on Saturday _ had dutifully sat through a
half-hour of those ``how do you feel'' queries Tuesday afternoon
after a victory rally outside the Niketown store in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But then some guy with a microphone wondered what it was like to
see a little girl wearing a jersey with your name on the back, and
all of a sudden the fullback who has been nicknamed ``Hollywood''
was crying. Real tears.
</P>
<P>
   Another star might have hidden her face, got up, walked away.
Ms. Chastain sniffed a bit, wiped her eyes and stuck around for 15
more minutes of questions about how she feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too emotional a person to be sitting here,'' she said,
green eyes sparkling in the freshest of fresh faces. ``It's just
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people showed up at noon Tuesday to celebrate with the
new World Cup champions. Nike organizers said there were 3,500
people. It wasn't just cute little suburban girls with faces
painted red, white and blue. There were gray-haired grandmothers
and men in business suits. There was a 12-year-old boy wearing a
Tiffeny Milbrett No. 16 jersey. Even Donald J. Trump was there
(sure, he owns the building that houses Niketown, but he didn't
have to come outside).
</P>
<P>
   They clapped for all the backup players few people have ever
heard of, and when the women started firing dozens of souvenir
soccer balls into the crowd, they all had their hands up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd watch the Women's World Cup over the Super Bowl any day,''
said Patrick Greene, 26, a systems consultant for a midtown
company. ``I want to marry every single one of them. I'm trying to
find out who's single.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his height advantage over most of the teen-age soccer
fanatics, Greene, at 5 feet 10 inches, did not take home a soccer
ball. A Fox television reporter did, though. It was that kind of
moment, when even supposedly hardened New York journalists could
not keep the fan in them from coming out.
</P>
<P>
   What that meant, of course, was that the old fans, the die-hard
fans, could not get any face time. Meghan and Caitlyn Moroni of
Congers, N.Y., were just a little bit wistful for the old days _
all of maybe a year ago _ when they were the only ones to recognize
Kristine Lilly at a local sneaker store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost felt bad for her. She was just sitting there; nobody
was coming up to her,'' recalled Meghan, 15, who plays center
halfback on a premier club team in Rockland County. ``Now if that
happened, there'd be crowds there. We got to talk to her for like
15 minutes, alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Caitlyn, 17, who plays the same position as her younger sister,
but on a team for older girls, added: ``It wasn't really a big deal
then. Now I wish I could talk to her again.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Shookhoff, 14, came to the rally on crutches and had to
watch from inside Niketown as autographed soccer balls bounced
against the picture-window panes, out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Alex, who lives in Manhattan, tore ligaments in her knee during
a game in Westchester County on May 22. Just like Michelle Akers of
the U.S. team, who has had so many knee surgeries that she has
actually lost track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up five-nothing,'' Alex explained. ``There was like
three minutes left until the end of the game. I was running for a
ball. I hit this girl. I heard a crack.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she will be playing again in six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The question, though, is what will happen to this World Cup team
in six months, or six years. Does this herald a revolution for
soccer, for women's sports, or is it just an elongated 15 minutes
of fame?
</P>
<P>
   At the rally Tuesday, the managing editor of Sports Illustrated,
William Colson, presented Ms. Chastain with a framed blowup of the
current issue's cover, which he called ``the greatest picture of a
sports bra in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm took home a framed cover of Time magazine, featuring
herself. Throughout the crowd could be seen copies of the latest
Newsweek, headlined ``Girls Rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, though, Julie Foudy, a co-captain, had her own
video camera, capturing the cheering masses, recording her
teammates' glowing smiles, documenting their day in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was my duty and obligation to record the moment,''
she explained later. ``We've obviously got a lot of cameras pointed
at us. It's nice to have one pointed the other way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Ted Williams returned to Fenway for the 1999 All-Star
Game. Correctly introduced as ``the greatest hitter that ever
lived,'' Teddy Ballgame, now 80, rode into Fenway on a golf cart
driven by longtime Sox employee Al Forester.
</P>
<P>
   After his victory lap, Ted was taken to the mound, where he was
immediately surrounded by both All-Star squads, plus 31 of the top
100 ballplayers in baseball history. It was without question the
greatest assemblage of hardball talent ever gathered on the Fenway
diamond (with the possible exception of when Babe Ruth stood alone
on the Fenway hill).
</P>
<P>
   With the Citgo sign pulsating behind him, and the ancient
theatre shaking on its landfill foundation, Williams stood in front
of the mound, flanked by Mark McGwire and Tony Gwynn. Behind
homeplate, dressed for dinner, but wearing a catcher's mitt, was
Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   Strike.
</P>
<P>
   Bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   There were other great moments on All-Star Tuesday. New hero
Pedro Martinez punched out the side in the first inning and
finished with five strikeouts in two scoreless frames. Nomar
Garciaparra made his start at short, flied out twice, and was
ceremoniously replaced at the start of the fourth inning by Yankee
Derek Jeter. The American League pushed across a couple of runs in
the first and a parade of stars entertained until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But the best moment of the All-Star Game, indeed the best moment
of All-Star week, was the sight of Williams surrounded by players
who'd hit several thousand homers and thrown over a million pitches
at Fenway Park during this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my god,'' said a young woman in the stands. ``Ted Williams
threw a pitch to Carlton Fisk. I'm going home happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston pulled it off. The Hub gave the hardball world three days
of packed houses, postcard weather, and boffo baseball. In this
city where it's easier to fix an election than a pothole, the
All-Star festival played out almost perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four days McGwire hit a country mile of home runs,
Ken Griffey Jr. won the dinger derby, Jim Rice carried Cambridge
homeboy Matt Damon, Fanfest packed the Hynes, and Fenway was
repeatedly celebrated as the sport's Sistene Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston saved its best for game day when the Fenway lawn
became Cooperstown East and New England's greatest athlete returned
to light the torch for the final All-Star Game of this century.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 forever will be No. 1 in New England. He's a war hero, a
champion in the fight against children's cancer, a tunnel, and the
greatest hitter who ever lived. He's bigger than Bill Russell,
Bobby Orr, and Larry Bird, the other three heads on Boston sports
Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Williams come back for the much-hyped
All-Star celebration. Last night's game was the third All-Star Game
in Fenway's history and Williams had a hand in every one. In 1946,
he had the greatest single day in All-Star history, hitting two
homers and going 4 for 4 in a 12-0 rout of the Nationals. When the
AL and NL dueled again here in 1961, the recently retired Ted came
back to toss out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in Fenway much in recent years, but returned to
Boston last Thursday night for his All-Star adventure. Friday he
visited the Jimmy Fund Clinic and met Einar Gustafson, the
63-year-old man who was the original ``Jimmy'' when the charity was
formed in 1948. Ted went to Loudon, N.H., for a NASCAR race
Saturday and Sunday, then returned to Boston for the final two days
of the Starfest. He had breakfast with Kevin Costner Monday and
Tuesday morning entertained Damon.
</P>
<P>
   There'll never be another moment like when Williams was engulfed
by Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Bob Feller, Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson,
McGwire, Cal Ripken Jr. and Nomar. Just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's ovation was loud and long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the stadium was going down,'' said a smiling Pedro
Martinez. ``I don't think there will be another like him.''

WTO DEBATE ON NATION'S ACTIONS GOES BEYOND SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Canada will slap $125 million per year in
taxes on European goods. This is to compensate for the European
Union's exclusion of U.S. and Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable is that the action is not unilateral. It has been
given an OK by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most recent WTO agreement, all countries agreed to
base human-health restrictions on assessments of scientific risk.
The United States and Canada, whose ranchers treat cattle with
government-approved growth hormones, charged that Europe's ban on
their beef had never been scientifically assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Europe replied that it was following the precautionary
principle, which can be summed up as ``better safe than sorry.''
The United States replied that it's OK to take a precautionary
approach, but to elevate it to a principle ``cannot create a risk
assessment when there is none.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO appellate panel agreed. Its ruling still allows European
governments to set any standard of risk they want _ one in a
thousand, one in a million, one in ten million.
</P>
<P>
   But they have to consider whether the evidence meets the
standard. They can block a new product while they assess it. But to
ban it permanently they have to assess it, and base their
assessment on science.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a tough standard. ``It is not the same as scientific
certainty,'' said Keith Rockwell, the WTO's director of
information. The WTO decision (available at www.wto.org) does not
call for majority science. If some evidence exists that a given
hormone poses a risk _ and evidence apparently does exist on one of
them _ the Europeans can make the assessment and ban that hormone.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to ban all hormones on the ``better safe than
sorry'' principle.
</P>
<P>
   Twice I've sat through public panels discussing this case, and
twice Seattle trade consultant Bill Bryant of Bryant Christie Inc.
has asked WTO critics: If you throw out the requirement for
science, how can you tell which ``health'' measures are real?
</P>
<P>
   This question simply goes past some. It doesn't matter to
critics that Europe's ban might be a measure to protect European
beef packers. To them, a government's rules are that government's
business (and theirs, when they go to to lobby for new rules).
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant asked critics at Seattle University on May 26 how
they could define a health measure without science, one opponent
called out, ``Forget science!''
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant put his question to the Washington Council on
International Trade's panel last Friday, Lori Wallach of Ralph
Nader's group Public Citizen said there were other reasons than
science. There are religious reasons not to use certain products,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That Ralph Nader's advocate offered religion as an alternative
to science was a fascinating opening, but the moderator let it go.
Religion is a private matter in the United States. Left unsaid was
that it also cannot be used to ban products.
</P>
<P>
   This argument is about more than science. It is about whether
governments should be bound by any rules, and how they should be
enforced. It is about the idea of the WTO itself, which in the
words of David Hartridge, acting director, is ``a trading system
based on rules, open markets and the acceptance by governments of
freely negotiated limitations on their power.''
</P>
<P>
   At a speech in Geneva on July 5, Hartridge remarked on the
change between the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s, much of the
world rejected the WTO. Now, he said, ``There is no dispute about
the commitment to negotiate, or about the value of open markets and
rules-based trade.''
</P>
<P>
   No dispute from governments. The WTO now has 135 member
governments, and even Russia and China are knocking on the door to
get in.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Hartridge noted, the WTO ``has been subject for the
first time to outspoken and even violent hostility'' from citizens.
``We are told to expect larger demonstrations of skepticism and
hostility at Seattle,'' he said, of the WTO's meeting here in late
November.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. To get other people to give up their special
protections, you have to give up yours. As Washington Secretary of
State Ralph Munro noted a few weeks ago, ``We always wanted all our
ferry boats built in Washington. But if we're going to be a player
in world trade, we can't do that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the century now unfolding, Washington ferries might be built
in Mexico. Instead of corn syrup from Iowa, Coca-Cola might contain
cane sugar from the Philippines _ or Cuba. But Washington apples
will be offered in Kyoto, and beef fat from Kansas will eventually
line the arteries of Frenchmen.

SENATE PANEL ENDORSES SEATTLE JUDGE'S SELECTION TO 9TH CIRCUIT
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ King County Superior Court Judge Marsha Pechman's
nomination to become a federal judge was endorsed Tuesday by Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the process of filling vacancies on the federal
bench has slowed for a variety of political reasons, Pechman was
one of five relatively non-controversial nominees allowed to move
forward with a hearing before Hatch's committee. Hatch said he
would support approving each of the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing provided a forum for Republicans and Democrats to
air complaints about the judicial selection process. Hatch, R-Utah,
who is running for president, blasted the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals, for the alleged judicial activism of its judges. Hatch and
Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., also lectured the nominees about the
need to make decisions more rapidly in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized Hatch for the Senate's
slow pace of considering judicial nominees this year.
</P>
<P>
   The consideration process has stalled in part because
Republicans hope to win the presidential election next year, and
with it the right to choose federal judges. Additionally, Hatch is
unhappy that President Clinton has not yet nominated to the bench a
Utah attorney disliked by environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman's nomination, although trapped in the difficult and
intensely political Senate confirmation approval process, was
praised by Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
who have an unusual agreement to jointly screen candidates for
judicial nominations. No opposition has emerged to Pechman's
nomination, and none of the senators questioning her raised any
obstacle to her approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``She comes to you out of a relatively large court, with a large
number of judges, with a noted enough career so that she appears to
both our search committee and to the two senators of the state as
someone highly qualified, not only by experience and education, but
by temperament, for a position on the United States District
Court,'' Gorton said. (Pechman worked for three months in 1975 as a
law clerk in the state attorney general's office when Gorton was
the attorney general.)
</P>
<P>
   Murray called attention to Pechman's status as a survivor of
breast cancer and a peer mentor for other women suffering from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Pechman, through her commitment to her family, her
excellence in her work, and her involvement in her community, has
been a shining example for many breast cancer victims,'' Murray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pechman, 48, is a Seattle resident who has served on the King
County bench since 1988. She had worked as a prosecutor, as a
plaintiff's attorney and as a law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nominated Pechman to a lifetime appointment on the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington on March 24.
She would replace District Court Judge William Dwyer, who wants to
retire.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, Pechman pledged to work to expedite
the handling of large and complex cases, said she is willing to
reduce judgments that she thinks are excessive, and said ``it is
not the business of a district court judge to legislate, but it is
the business of a district court judge to interpret legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pechman said she would have no problem enforcing the death
penalty, and agreed that lengthy delays in the imposition of the
death penalty can be problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch encouraged the judicial nominees to keep their promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This committee is having a whale of a difficult time with the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals ... because there are number of people
on that circuit court of appeals who disregard the law. ... They
just substitute their own ideas for what the law ought to be ...
and in the process they have really hurt liberal judges all across
the country,'' he said.

TIGER WOODS ON TIMING AND THE BRITISH OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Tiger Woods arrived at Carnoustie by
helicopter Tuesday morning, and perhaps it was fitting.
</P>
<P>
   With three titles in his last four starts, Woods is the world's
No. 1-ranked golfer, the hottest player and the favorite at the
British Open, which begins Thursday. Shouldering great expectations
is nothing new for Woods. Playing terrific golf is nothing new for
him, either. But he has not won a major championship since the 1997
Masters, his first and only Grand Slam title, and Woods faces a
severe test at Carnoustie, a course with great history that is
recognized as one of the world's toughest.
</P>
<P>
   Woods builds his schedule around winning majors. So while he has
enjoyed his recent run, this week matters most to Woods because of
the course and the tournament, and because he is playing well
enough to win another major.
</P>
<P>
   It is a chance that he does not want to waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the championship everybody wants to win, because I
think it has the best field in the world,'' Woods said. ``I like it
best out of all the other majors, because the conditions change so
much. Last year, I remember hitting a driver in a practice round on
the first tee at Royal Birkdale, then hitting a 4-iron off the same
tee in the tournament. That's two completely different winds, and
that's the beauty of it. I like having to adapt my game to the
conditions, and they can change pretty rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has always loved the characteristics of links courses _
treeless and bunker-laden, with thick rough, natural terrain and
unpredictable winds that encourage lower ball flight and a wide
range of shots.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the course has the potential to result in
one of the most difficult majors because Carnoustie has been
lengthened and the fairways have been narrowed for the world's best
players. Predictions for the winning score have ranged from even
par to 10 over par.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after finishing third at last year's British Open and
improving his short-iron play over the last year, Woods believes he
is ready to win. He has been in Europe for more than a week,
spending last week in Ireland, fishing and golfing with Mark
O'Meara, Payne Stewart, David Duval, Stuart Appleby and Lee Janzen.
He has adjusted to the time change, and he has played in harsh
Scotland weather before.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, Woods will find out whether he peaked a few
weeks too soon, or at a perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to having your game peak at the right time is
scheduling,'' Woods said. ``Scheduling enough rest, enough practice
time, enough time to get away from the game. I never had to deal
with four major championships in one year at junior golf, amateur
golf. As a professional, you have to peak at four different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is difficult to do. The purses are getting higher, so you
can get caught up in playing too much. But when you get to a major
championship, you need to have a lot of energy. I believe what I've
done over the last couple of year has been successfully, and my
record is starting to show that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has three top 10 finishes in his last four majors,
including a third-place finish at last month's U.S. Open. Perhaps
the only thing that separated Woods and Stewart on the last day at
the U.S. Open was putting. Stewart made crucial putts on the final
few holes, while Woods did not. But instead of dwelling on that
disappointment, Woods said he had focused on giving himself another
chance to win a major _ quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I getting impatient?'' Woods asked. `No. You can't force
the situation. This year, it was Payne's turn to win the U.S. Open
by making those great putts. It all boils down to a little bit of
luck, too. You need a few good breaks at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Woods does this week, people will watch. At
today's news conference, the room was filled with reporters.
European golf fans, who do not often get to see Woods in person,
are eager to watch him attack Carnoustie. He has become a crowd
favorite in Europe, and he appreciates the fans' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most intelligent fans of the game,'' Woods said.
``They know when a shot to 30 feet is a great shot. In the States,
if you hit a ball to 30 feet, you don't get anything. If you hit a
ball to 10 feet, you don't get anything. Sometimes in the States
they just want to see backspin. You may suck it back into the
water, but they're going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hopes to give them more to appreciate this week. He has
won four times this season _ at the Buick Invitational, the
Memorial, the Deutsche Bank Open and the Motorola Western Open. But
winning this weekend would be far more special, and Woods is
clearly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing solid,'' Woods said. ``I'm very happy. I'm getting
my game back to where I like it.''  &QL;

THE SPOTLIGHT SHIFTS TO THE WNBA AND ITS STARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wide-eyed and giggling, Chamique Holdsclaw and
Shannon Johnson rummaged through packages of basketball cards after
an autograph session at the NBA Store Tuesday, hoping to find their
card in the stack. Holdsclaw found hers and looked over at Johnson,
who was still opening packages.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson opened three packages and did not see her card in any of
them. The two Women's National Basketball Association All-Stars
laughed, and Holdsclaw, the rookie from the Washington Mystics, had
joke material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not upset about it,'' said Johnson, the Orlando Miracle
guard and a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Stars. ``I'm one
of those sleepers, I guess you can call me. I'm one of those `down
low' players. I don't get into the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   But for about two hours Wednesday night, Johnson will be one of
22 players in the spotlight when the WNBA holds its first All-Star
Game at Madison Square Garden. All 18,645 seats have been sold. A
host of stars are expected, including members of the World Cup
champion U.S. soccer team. Whitney Houston will sing the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball players will streak down the court at the Garden,
the best in the world playing at a blurring pace. Wednesday night
won't merely be an affirmation of the talent of Holdsclaw or Sheryl
Swoopes, some of the most well-known players in this league. It is
also for the Shannon Johnsons. Each player has her own story, her
own tale of how she ascended to stardom. Their talents are as
diverse as their lives have been. They are single mothers, former
world-class volleyball players and aspiring singers. They have
worked at a car repossession business, the Internal Revenue Service
and J.C. Penney. They make the league minimum, the league maximum
and the league average. They go by Spoon, Yo, and Grandmama _ or
Yum Yum now that Jennifer Gillom has lost 20 pounds. These are the
WNBA All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the kids excited,'' said Liberty point guard
Teresa Weatherspoon, a starter for the East. ``If I want to run up
in the stands and pick one up to get her excited, I'll do it. It's
time to let the kid in me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night is for fun, although both squads say they will
do what it takes to win. The Western Conference is favored to win
because of its star-studded roster, which includes Swoopes, Cynthia
Cooper and Lisa Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we'll see,'' said Vicky Bullett of the Charlotte Sting.
``We'll just have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   To the players, the All-Star Game is a stamp on their careers.
For the Sacramento guard Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, being here
validates her return from a torn anterior cruciate ligament
suffered early last season. Bolton-Holifield, 32, was the first
star of the WNBA to suffer a serious injury, and she heard the
whispers that her career was over. When she returned this season,
Bolton-Holifield was coming off the bench, getting only 18 minutes
a game. Then, about two weeks into the season, her long-range
jumper started falling. She was inserted back into the starting
lineup and is now averaging 14.6 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means more to me than making the WNBA's first team in the
league's first year,'' she said. ``After being injured, people
started counting me out, saying, `It's over,' and `We'll see,' and
`Maybe you should accept that you won't be the player once were.' I
told myself that I'm not going to let man tell me what to do and
accept being 80 percent of what I once was. I was going to work
hard and see what God had in store for me. Look where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at where her West teammate Natalie Williams is now.
Williams, in her first season with the Utah Starzz, came to the
league from the defunct American Basketball League, where she was
the 1998 most valuable player. Williams played college basketball
and volleyball at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   As a volleyball player, Williams won two national championships
and recognition as player of the year. She was also a Kodak
all-American in basketball in 1993-94. She was later named the
Pac-10 Conference athlete of the decade. When she heard of the
ABL's start-up in 1996, she left the U.S. volleyball team, on which
she was vying for an Olympic spot, and picked the basketball up
again. She averaged 20 points and 11.7 rebounds a game before the
ABL folded last December.
</P>
<P>
   Before the league folded, her Portland Power team was looking
like a championship contender. Now Williams, who is averaging 19.8
points and 10 rebounds, is a relatively unknown star in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, a lot of people haven't seen what I can do,'' Williams
said. ``But they've heard. It's sad. A lot of people see me as a
rookie, but I was the ABL mvp.''
</P>
<P>
   Taj Williams, an Eastern Conference reserve forward from the
Orlando Miracle, may have to guard the bulky Williams when the
teams to go their benches Wednesday night. For the slender
Williams, guarding Williams won't be a hard job. Williams, a single
mother, knows all about jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked at the IRS, did part-time counseling, secretary,
market research, J.C. Penney customer service, TCBY yogurt and
assistant basketball coach,'' she said, explaining how she
supported her daughter Michele, 10, while in college and during the
summers after the professional basketball season in Europe was
over. ``The IRS was the most enjoyable because it was a new
challenge. I was testing new computer programs to see how this
computer was going to work when it tried to audit people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like challenges,'' Williams added. ``I don't like to do the
same thing every day. Of course I play basketball, obviously.''

ELECTRONIC TICKETS MARK BEGINNING OF PAPERLESS SKIES 
AIR FARE PRICING 
A UNITED CONNECTION  
BUILDING UP BERMUDA  
</HEADLINE>
 (yn) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic tickets may account for no more than about 10 percent
of all airline tickets worldwide, but they are beginning to make
enormous strides in the United States. In recent months, USAirways
and Northwest Airlines joined other major carriers whose passengers
travel more often on E-tickets than on paper tickets, while at the
same time E-ticketing is quickly catching on with many European and
Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that popularity is being driven by bargains and bonuses,
including the additional 1,000 frequent-flier miles that Northwest
is giving passengers who fly on E-tickets through Nov. 6 between
the United States and Canada and between the United States and five
Asian destinations.
</P>
<P>
   For the benefit of the dwindling number of passengers who still
have not flown with E-tickets, which have been around since the
early 1990s, they essentially amount to paperless travel. After
making a reservation through an agent or on line, customers need
only a confirmation number and itinerary, both of which can be
issued immediately over the telephone or through the airline's Web
site. At the airport, all that is needed is the confirmation
number, photograph ID and credit card where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of E-tickets is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers with E-tickets need not worry about lost or misplaced
tickets. They also do not need to have a ticket reissued when they
change itineraries. Airlines and travel agents save time and money
by not having to issue actual tickets. And travel managers can now
track forgotten, unused tickets, which previously might have been
billed to corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   That is why individual carriers and the International Air
Transport Association regard E-tickets as the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But E-tickets are not yet for everyone. Many passengers are
uncomfortable showing up at the airport gate with only a
confirmation number but no ticket. And the airline industry has not
yet devised a system that enables E-ticket holders to travel on
more than one carrier on the same itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Air Fare Pricing
</P>
<P>
   If Runzheimer International's predictions are correct, business
travel costs will rise 4 percent next year compared with a
predicted 4.8 percent in 1999. Although airlines are expected to
raise fares 10 percent, the actual increase will be closer to 3
percent, according to Runzheimer, the Wisconsin-based management
consulting firm, because of competitive pressures and increased
capacity because of the delivery of many new planes this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
   A United Connection
</P>
<P>
   United Air Lines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, will expand its
presence in the Caribbean on Nov. 1, as it begins a code-sharing
partnership with Gulfstream Airlines of Miami Springs, Fla. In
announcing the pact Tuesday, United said its nonstop flights to San
Juan from O'Hare International in Chicago, Dulles International in
Washington and Kennedy International in New York will be timed to
connect with Gulfstream flights to St. Kitts and St. Maarten, while
its flights from Washington to St. Thomas, scheduled to begin on
Oct. 31, will connect to Gulfstream's flights to St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   Building Up Bermuda
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to encourage cruise passengers to return or stay for
dinner while they are in Bermuda, musicians and hotel officials
have begun greeting passengers when they debark at the Hamilton,
St. George's and Dockyard ports. As part of what is called the
cruise welcome program, which will continue through October,
passengers selected at random will be invited to special functions
and to visit various hotels. Island officials are concerned by the
decline in overall tourism, which has been falling for more than a
decade. Bermuda's share of cruise passengers fell last year to 2.37
percent from 3.75 percent in 1988 and 4.57 percent in 1986.

IN HIGH SCHOOL BANDS, THE `GEEK' GIVES WAY TO THE COOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass., Wis., N.J. )   By DEBRA NUSSBAUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FAIRLESS HILLS, Pa. _ When the Pennsbury High School football
team finished its final home game of the season last November, no
one left the packed stands. The players and cheerleaders stood on
the sidelines. They stayed while the 180 members of the Pennsbury
marching band played music by Russian composers like Shostakovich
and Rachmaninoff. When it was over, there was wild applause from
everyone, including the team.
</P>
<P>
   These days, high school bands can be cool. They travel the
country, playing on national television, compete fiercely against
rival schools, add ever more complex formations and put on jazzy,
Broadway-style performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no putting people down in the band at all,'' said Marc
Mandell, a 17-year-old drum major who will be a senior this year
with Pennsbury's band here in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia.
``People say, `You're in the band, that's cool.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As students get ready to sweat through band camp in preparation
for another school year, nationwide statistics suggest that the
popularity of bands is on the rise. The number of high school band
directors is up 7 percent in six years, to 10,398 from 9,715 in the
1993-94 school year, according to the National Association for
Music Educators. Sales of sheet music to schools are increasing,
says Larry R. Linkin, president of the National Association of
Music Merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Some bands cannot accommodate all the students who want to join.
At Steinert High School in Hamilton Township, N.J., 100 girls tried
out for the band front, a kind of color guard that dances to the
band's Broadway-style program. Forty-five were turned away. So many
students have signed up for the concert band that they can no
longer practice in the band room but must play on the school's
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Blose, the band director, says his bands include football
players and cheerleaders. ``When I first started, 23 years ago,''
he said, ``you would never have a kid give up football to play in
the band.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are willing to juggle band and sports. Last year, Dan
Belton, a 15-year-old sophomore at Haddonfield Memorial High School
in New Jersey, went to soccer practice from 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and
band practice from 6 to 8. In the spring he played on the golf team
while playing drums in the band. He estimated that about a quarter
of the band's 50 members also play sports.
</P>
<P>
   While some marching bands, like Pennsbury's, stick to a military
style, others are striking out in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move has been toward a lot more choreography and trying to
produce the Broadway stage on the football field,'' Blose said.
``It's not merely a halftime show; it's developed into an art form
itself. Bands are creating illusions that are almost magical. There
are no boundaries on music numbers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Pennsbury school district, with 10,000 students,
Michael Grothman, the district's instrumental music coordinator and
former marching band director, has more than 1,440 students
involved in instrumental music through the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Musical enrollment throughout the district has been on the
rise the last four years,'' Grothman said. ``Parents realize the
value of students' participating. And you find all different
reasons from the students for being in the band, including `My
girlfriend' or `my boyfriend is in the band.' Band provides a place
in this huge complex here where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsbury marching band, which has had about 180 members the
last two years, will have more than 200 this fall, said its
director, Mark Morris, 30, who remembers that when he was in high
school, he and his friends were teased as ``the band geeks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 school year, the Pennsbury band went to Hawaii,
and last spring 20 of its members were taken by chauffeur to New
York to play on the ABC talk show ``The View.'' The limousines
dropped the students at school at the end of the day as the buses
were loading to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Moments like that help lift the status of the band. So do the
sounds they make.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students see the performance and sense the emotional
impact of the performance, whatever stereotypes they have are
diluted,'' said Paul Schlicher, whose son, Zach, plays the quints,
a 40-pound set of drums. ``You can't fail to be impressed and you
can't fail to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two nights of sign-up in June for the coming year's
marching band, Morris and Grothman stood before the students and
were candid about the type of commitment they required. A 10-page
manual for band members outlines everything from attendance policy
to hair length and the color of socks on performance days. If you
do not march in the Yardley Memorial Day Parade, do not expect to
get a band jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment is very thorough and very heavy,'' Morris told
an audience of students and parents. ``I expect you to behave just
a little bit better than if you were standing next to the
principal.''
</P>
<P>
   They will practice rain or shine, whether it is 95 degrees or
30. Such experiences, members and band directors say, build bonds.
</P>
<P>
   When 16-year-old Matthew Maloney joined the Pennsbury band as a
freshman, he, too, expected to be called a band geek. But he said:
``No one labels you like that. It's the prominence of this band,
the prestige of this band and all the trips we take. You're going
out and you're doing all this fun stuff. This band gets national
attention when it plays in the Thanksgiving Day Parade in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another attraction besides camaraderie and fun, he
said: ``The second most important factor is, will the colleges like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, college admissions officers say, the answer is
yes. ``When I was in high school, band was just above the
audio-visual club,'' said Keith White, associate director of
undergraduate admissions at the University of Wisconsin. Now, he
considers musical activities a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students who are most capable, most involved and the most
academically active are also the kids taking part in high school
band and music in general,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the applicants accepted are in the top 20
percent of their graduating class, White said, and out of that
group 80 percent are involved in some type of music in high school.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, high school band is one of a number of activities
that is looked on favorably if the student has made a long-term
commitment and has been successful, said Marlyn McGrath Lewis,
director of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for excellence no matter what a student chooses
to devote his or her time to,'' she said. ``More and more students
have musical performance as one of their extracurricular
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years in a school band where a student takes on a
leadership role is ``a good way to demonstrate you can carry
through on a commitment,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Students seems to have the feeling that band will help them down
the road. A few years ago, when Mr. Morris was director of a
fourth-grade band in the Pennsbury district, a student came up to
him and said that he would be playing trumpet through senior high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that his father went to Harvard,'' Mr. Morris said.
``His father had read that playing an instrument was important, so
he was going to play in the band and he was going to go to
Harvard.''

   BOSTON -- Shawn Green, the gifted young outfielder from the
Toronto Blue Jays, is the nephew of a Harvard professor, Marc
Kirschner, whom Green said is head of the cellular biology
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife is my mom's sister,'' Green said. ``His sons were my
closest cousins. We all grew up together. Two of them went to
Harvard, and another went to Northeastern.''

   Made for some pretty cerebral family reunions, no?

just loved watching tapes of him. He's the guru of hitting.

</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire, the former GM of the Los Angeles Dodgers, has taken
a great deal of heat for trading Pedro Martinez to the Expos for
second baseman Delino Deshields, the first of two trades GM Dan
Duquette made for Martinez, the first with Montreal, the second
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But another member of the organization has stepped up and
claimed some responsibility for the deal. Team doctor Frank Jobe,
the orthopedist famed for his advances in elbow and shoulder
operations, told Ross Newhan of the Los Angeles Times that he
influenced Claire to make the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe had performed surgery on Martinez's left (non-pitching)
shoulder, which he had separated while swinging a bat in the minor
leagues, and warned Claire that Martinez would be susceptible to
more shoulder problems. That, coupled with questions about
Martinez's stamina, led Jobe to endorse a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I said, `Get rid of him,''' Jobe said. ``I'd
never say that, but the circumstances kind of spoke for themselves.
He had a delicate stature to start with, and there were obviously
questions about his stamina. It's a judgment call, but you had to
kind of wonder, `Golly, is this kid going to break down?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a reliever with the Dodgers, is in his fifth season
without missing a start. Jobe, who performed surgery last summer to
repair Ramon Martinez's rotator cuff a year ago June 30, said he
believes Pedro's older brother will be back before the end of the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be slim and skinny,'' Jobe said of the brothers
Martinez, ``but they're tough people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martinez moved up a day &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams said Tuesday that it's likely he will move Pedro
Martinez up a day in the Sox rotation, at the pitcher's request.
The Sox had planned for Martinez to start here Monday night against
the Florida Marlins, which would have given the Sox ace five days'
rest, one more than usual. But Martinez said he preferred to take
his regular turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could happen,'' Williams said of Martinez going Sunday.
``We try to protect him as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach's corner &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams, added to the American League coaching staff by manager
Joe Torre, coached third, which came as something of a surprise to
him. He said in Atlanta last weekend that Torre would use his
regular base coaches, Don Zimmer and Willie Randolph. ``The people
in Boston would just love that, to see me coaching,'' Williams said
with a laugh. ``Do you think they'd have something to say about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   During batting practice, Williams hit ground balls, as is his
custom, to shortstops Nomar Garciaparra, Omar Vizquel and Derek
Jeter. Taking grounders with them was Williams's son, Shawn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, that's who &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Jeff Zimmerman figured that if he were to pitch in
the All-Star Game, Joe Average American would turn to Mrs. Joe
Average American and all their little Average American offspring
and ask, ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   No household name, he. But American League hitters are painfully
aware of the rookie Texas reliever, whom Joe Torre selected by
virtue of his 8-0 record, 0.86 ERA, and laughable .106 opponents's
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are several rags-to-riches stories on these teams, but
it might be hard to top the sage of an undrafted Canadian
(Carsland, Alberta, pop. 500, and ``no traffic lights'') pitcher
whose father put together a team he would drive 8-10 hours into the
States for the purpose of giving his boy a chance to play
competitive baseball; who faxed resumes to all 30 major league
teams, with Texas being the only respondent; and who is both the
first All-Star to come out of the wild-and-woolly Northern League
and the first major leaguer to come out of the French League,
something which, almost undoubtedly, no American fan even knew
existed.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of France, Zimmerman must have at least eaten well,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no money,'' he explained. ``I subsisted on baguettes and
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing stuff. Even more amazing has been his first-half
performance. ``He's nasty,'' said fellow Ranger and All-Star Ivan
Rodriguez. ``He's tough to catch. He throws very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws very hard and he has great late movement,'' added
the Indians' Kenny Lofton. ``That's a tough combination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the All-Star Game isn't even a dream come true,''
said Zimmerman. ``Where I came from, you would never have that
dream. The NHL, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driven batty &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar arrived at Logan Airport late Sunday night
missing an important piece of luggage: the carry bag containing his
and Manny Ramirez's bats. After waiting for his missing bats at the
Continental Airlines luggage carousel, Alomar figured his lumber
had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Boston, Hub of the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't my favorites, but I brought my lumber,'' Alomar
said. ``I saw them come up in the plane when I was sitting down in
first-class. When I went to get my bags, I didn't see them. Maybe
somebody stole them, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar said that he and Ramirez each packed two bats in a bat
carry bag that was marked with their numbers, 12 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was an easy target,'' Alomar said. ``I just hope they
enjoy my bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart Swain, the Indians' director of media relations, indicated
new lumber may be on the way, courtesy of the club's equipment
manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a bat bag, it's kind of obvious what it is,'' Swain said.
``The bats clang around inside and it says `Rawlings' on the
outside. So it pretty much screams out what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A job half-done &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he chose Red Sox manager Jimy Williams and White Sox
skipper Jerry Manuel to join him in the American League dugout as a
way of showing appreciation for their hard work this season. ``Jimy
and I go back a little ways,'' Torre said. ``We've had so many in
the St. Louis area, but I really respect what he's done. With Jerry
Manuel, I think the recognition goes to Bruce (Bochy, the NL
manager) and myself because we were in the World Series and
everybody pays attention to the Mike Hargroves and people like
that, but I just felt the managers who have to start dealing and
rebuilding and stuff like that, it's sometimes a thankless job and
you wind up on the short end of this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's done a great job in Chicago, I feel, and I just
wanted to have him come over here and enjoy this a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Man of his words &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox great Carlton Fisk, who was named AL honorary
captain, said that Juan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers made a
mistake by not participating in the All-Star Game. ``I, over my
career, haven't held my tongue in the proper places,'' Fisk said.
``I've always given my opinion, and my opinion on this: I think he
is totally out of line in refusing to come to the All-Star Game.
Refusing to be recognized as one of the greatest players playing
the game today. I don't know whether that's an attitude or
selfishness on his part, but it is, when you consider what kind of
player he is, what kind of statistics he has on the board at this
time and not allowing the rest of the league or the rest of the
world to see his talents. I think, down the line, he may regret
that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A thorn in Rose's side &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With nearly two dozen Hall of Famers sitting beside him, Bud
Selig said Tuesday that as long he's commissioner, Pete Rose can
pretty much forget about reinstatement to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the launch of voting for baseball's All-Century
team. While Rose is among the 100 players on the ballot, he wasn't
invited to the news conference, held prior to last night's All-Star
Game, and won't be asked to any ceremonies if he's among the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything I would do to change what Bart
Giamatti did,'' Selig said, referring to the former commissioner
who kicked Rose out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lifetime ban he signed with Giamatti in August
1989, Rose is ineligible for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, in Boston on a corporate appearance, declined comment when
Selig's statements were relayed through his business agent . . .
Although getting a ticket for the All-Star Game was nearly
impossible, fans came in record droves to the John Hancock All-Star
FanFest at the Hynes Convention Center in dowtown Boston. This
weekend, the event was sold out on back-to-back days, a FanFest
first.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nobody can vote for Pete Rose for the Baseball Hall of
Fame, but if you get an All-Century Team ballot, you can vote for
the career hits leader who has been suspended for betting on
baseball. You can also vote for Shoeless Joe Jackson, the Black Sox
outfielder who acknowledged accepting $5,000 to dump the 1919 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the debate about their indiscretions, both deserve
to be on the All-Century ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the 100 players from 100 years on the Mastercard
Major League Baseball All-Century ballot, Commissioner Bud Selig
explained that Rose and Jackson were included as ``great players;
it doesn't in any way alter their status,'' meaning Rose's
suspension by Commissioner Bart Giamatti and Jackson's lifetime ban
from Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. For this 25-man All-Century Team that will be
announced at the World Series, fans should not be asked to judge
Rose and Jackson on integrity, only on their baseball ability.
Which each had in abundance. Rose had a record 4,256 hits in a
record 3,562 games. Jackson's career batting average in the
dead-ball era was .356, third to Ty Cobb's .366 and Rogers
Hornsby's .358.
</P>
<P>
   But why wasn't Rose invited to join the 24 other candidates who
attended the All-Century Team announcement before Tuesday night's
All-Star Game at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``As part of his suspension ban that he voluntarily signed with
Bartlett Giamatti in 1989,'' Selig said, ``attendance at any
function like that was forbidden.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always been the belief here that Rose deserved a suspension
of one to three years, but not an indefinite suspension that keeps
him off the Hall of Fame ballot. His betting on baseball did not
equate with Jackson's involvement in dumping the 1919 World Series.
Therefore, Rose's punishment should not be the same.
</P>
<P>
   In making the distinction between enshrinement and endorsement,
Major League Baseball has the right to keep Rose and Jackson out of
Cooperstown, but not off its 100-year all-star ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who also played first base, second base and third base,
and Shoeless Joe are among the 34 outfielders on the ballot, but
you can vote for only nine, along with six pitchers, two catchers
and two at each of the infield positions. There's space for one
write-in selection. And for what it's worth, here are my 25
choices:
</P>
<P>
   -- First base, Lou Gehrig, Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   -- Second base, Rogers Hornsby, Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shortstop, Honus Wagner, Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   -- Third base, Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Catchers, Johnny Bench, Josh Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Outfielders, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, Ty Cobb, Joe DiMaggio,
Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Stan Musial, Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pitchers, Cy Young, Sandy Koufax, Christy Mathewson, Walter
Johnson, Bob Feller, Grover Cleveland Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   According to Selig, if it's necessary to correct obvious
oversights by the fans, a special panel will be authorized to add
up to five players to the team. With that in mind, my five would be
outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. and four pitchers _ Tom Seaver, Bob
Gibson, Satchel Paige and Bob ``Lefty'' Grove.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest to omit were Jimmie Foxx, Joe Morgan, Ernie Banks,
Eddie Mathews, Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella, Roberto Clemente, Frank
Robinson, Carl Hubbell, Juan Marichal and Warren Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots are available at major league ball parks, at
participating Kmart stores, on line through MLB's Web site
(www.majorleaguebaseball.com) and in special Mastercard advertising
inserts in Sports Illustrated and TV Guide. They must be in by
Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 names on the ballot were whittled down by a panel of
experts from a list of 128 compiled from the ``top 100'' players
selected by The Sporting News, ``Total Baseball'' and Ken Shouler's
``The Real 100 Best Baseball Players of All Time ... and Why?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McGwire, Ripken and Griffey, four other active
players are on the ballot _ Barry Bonds, Tony Gwynn, Rickey
Henderson and Roger Clemens _ but Sammy Sosa is not.
</P>
<P>
   Like the All-Star selections, the All-Century voting is expected
to turn into a popularity contest dominated by the most recent, if
not the current, players, but two names will make the fans stop and
think about the past and their past _ Pete Rose and Shoeless Joe
Jackson.

THIEF TELLS JUDGE HE STOLE PARROT `OUT OF LOVE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he was arrested in January and accused of
stealing a rare parrot from the Central Park Zoo, John Bryant
Davilla stuck his tongue out at reporters as he was led away by the
police and boasted, ``I wanted to make stew out of that bird!''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, a far more subdued
Davilla quietly pleaded guilty to third-degree criminal possession
of stolen property and offered his first public explanation for the
bizarre caper. Davilla, a 25-year-old film actor from South
Brooklyn, told a judge that he had stolen the nameless parrot ``out
of love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought truly loving people who were handicapped could care
for this animal,'' he said, ``and give it more love than people
gawking at it in a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Davilla's guilty plea brought to a curious close one of the
oddest thefts of 1998 in Manhattan. In halting tones Tuesday
morning, he admitted breaking into the Central Park Zoo at 1 a.m.
on Dec. 17 and snatching the 6-year-old female thick-billed parrot
_ an endangered species _ from her cage.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Acting Justice Carol Berkman why he had chosen to
steal that specific parrot, Davilla replied, ``It was a very
friendly bird.'' But prosecutors argued that the rare bird had been
chosen for her worth, an estimated $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davilla denied prosecutors' accusations that he had offered to
sell the bird to a pet store for $1,000 and, later, to a friend for
$500. Davilla said that he had gone to the pet store simply to find
out what kind of bird he had. He later offered to sell the parrot
to a friend, Edwin Juppi, when he realized that he ``couldn't give
it enough love'' himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Juppi, a bird owner who uses a wheelchair, recognized how rare
the bird was and called the police, prosecutors have said. The
parrot had been receiving antibiotics for a respiratory infection
when she was stolen. After she was returned to the zoo on Jan. 27,
veterinarians found that the bird had lost weight and was having
difficulty breathing.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, the parrot was taken to the Bronx Zoo's Wildlife
Center for emergency surgery, but she died on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Berkman said she would probably sentence Davilla, who
had faced up to seven years in prison, to five years' probation at
his sentencing, scheduled for Sept. 8. But she scoffed at his
explanation for the theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're telling me you did it for love,'' she said. ``But you
didn't know how much that could harm the animal. I guess you're not
that interested in animals.''

SUSPECTED KILLER IN EIGHT SLAYINGS SURRENDERS IN TEXAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Mexican fugitive suspected as a railway-riding
serial killer surrendered to a Texas Ranger on a remote bridge
along the El Paso border Tuesday, ending a fear-driven manhunt and
starting a lengthy legal drama in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, 39, gave himself up in a peaceful,
anti-climactic episode arranged by his relatives, who conceivably
may collect up to $125,000 in reward money, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realized there was no place to go, that it was just a
matter of time before he was going to be captured by American
authorities or Mexican authorities,'' Texas Department of Public
Safety spokesman Tom Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez slept on a DPS turbo-prop airplane Tuesday as
he was flown to Houston, where he faces a burglary charge in
connection with the Dec. 17 slaying of physician Claudia Benton at
her house in West University Place, an affluent enclave of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspect Resendez-Ramirez in at least eight gruesome,
seemingly random killings in Illinois, Kentucky and Texas. Each
took place near railroad tracks, which the suspect is suspected of
using to travel across the nation and to his native Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Murder charges have been filed against him in Kentucky and
Illinois, but not in Texas _ yet. Police took a sample of his blood
Tuesday evening, under court order, to see if his DNA matches
homicide evidence in the Benton case and others.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez _ a name the FBI said was an alias for his true
identity, Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis _ first became a suspect in
a series of slayings when his fingerprints were discovered on a
steering column broken from Benton's stolen Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA evidence could lead to the suspect's being charged with
capital murder in Harris County, which sends more criminals to
death row than any state other than Texas. Harris County, which
includes most of Houston, has 3.1 million people and is the largest
county in Texas. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Texas Ranger Andrew F. ``Drew'' Carter Jr., who took the
suspect into custody after negotiating for his surrender, joined
Houston police detectives in questioning Resendez-Ramirez for more
than two hours at the downtown Houston police headquarters Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter declined to offer specifics afterward, but another Ranger
said he believed that Resendez-Ramirez had made no confessions
during those interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was to be transferred Tuesday night to the Harris
County Jail in preparation for a 9 a.m. preliminary court hearing
Wednesday, before state District Judge Bill Harmon, on the burglary
charge. Prosecutors said they will ask the judge to deny bond,
forcing the suspect to remain in custody pending further charges.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the intense manhunt, which included
Resendez-Ramirez's placement on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list,
afforded a sigh of relief to law enforcement authorities and
relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission accomplished, for the moment,'' said Don K. Clark,
special agent in charge of the FBI office in Houston, where a
special task force processed tips about the suspect's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said authorities had not known Resendez-Ramirez's
whereabouts since a June 18 sighting in Kentucky. With the suspect
at large, many people living near railroad tracks in Houston and
across the country were on a terrified alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me this guy was still running loose and could kill
somebody else, because he didn't pick any victims, he just stumbled
onto somebody and murdered them. I was afraid he would go on and
on,'' said Norman N. Sirnic of Santa Maria, Calif., the 70-year-old
father of slain Weimar, Texas, minister Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic.
</P>
<P>
   In a case linked to Resendez-Ramirez, the minister and his wife,
Karen Sirnic, were found dead May 2 inside their home near railroad
tracks. Their pickup was found in San Antonio, as was Benton's Jeep
Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Fayette County resident Josephine Konvica was found slain June 4
at her home about three miles from the Sirnics'. A day later,
southeast Houston school teacher Noemi Dominguez was found in her
home near some tracks. She had been beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases were added to the string of killings blamed on the
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, who has served U.S. jail sentences and was
deported to Mexico several times since 1976, avoided capture
despite the FBI-led manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   In a towering embarrassment, the suspect was released into
Mexico early on June 2 after Border Patrol agents took him into
custody for illegally entering the United States. It was just
before Konvica and Dominguez were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Border Patrol lacked information that
Resendez-Ramirez was being sought, and treated him as a routine
illegal immigrant. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
those actions.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the Mexican national's surrender were planted
several weeks ago when Carter and a fellow Texas Ranger, Sgt. Brian
Taylor, visited Resendez-Ramirez's sister, Manuela Maturino, in
Albuquerque, N.M., officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino grew to trust the Rangers and worked toward the
suspect's surrender in consultation with her pastor and a second
brother, Florentino Maturino Recendis, in Mexico, according to
Rangers Senior Capt. Bruce Casteel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say that there were very personal, one-on-one
discussions with family members and myself with one goal in mind
... his surrender,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Maturino called Carter _ he was on a fishing trip
along the Texas Gulf coast _ and said a surrender could be arranged
if authorities would promise in writing that Resendez-Ramirez would
be kept safe in jail, that his relatives could visit him and that
he would get a psychological evaluation, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials agreed to those terms as routine for such a case, and
made no agreements involving leniency or exemption from the death
penalty, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government opposes the death penalty and has refused
in past cases to extradite suspects to the United States to face
capital-punishment prosecution. Mexican police were not involved
with the surrender, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter and Maturino drove to El Paso, Resendez-Ramirez
followed through by crossing the Zaragosa Bridge with his brother
at 10 a.m. CDT, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, accompanied by agents from the FBI and other agencies,
shook the suspect's hand, handcuffed him and drove him through the
Ysleta del Sur area, dominated by cotton fields and garment
factories on the El Paso outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was Carter's 32nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez _ slight and emotionless and wearing
metal-rimmed eye glasses, a striped shirt, dirty jeans and leather
work boots _ was taken before a judge in El Paso and warned of his
rights, which include consultation with officials of the Mexican
government.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's family may be eligible to receive the $125,000 in
reward money offered for information leading to his capture, DPS
spokesman Mike Cox said, ``and they've indicated that if they did,
they would use it for his defense.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI chief Clark said experts who compiled a psychological
profile of the suspect had concluded that a public plea for
surrender and the involvement of his family might lead to his
capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based on what profilers were telling us and it
worked,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family's motivation in part, was to bring some
type of normalcy back to their lives,'' he added. ``We were not
going to stop looking until this person was in custody, so their
lives would have been turned upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the fugitive's photograph was on thousands of fliers,
in newspapers and on television, making it very difficult for him
to move about without being recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really intent that there would not be a place in this
country where this person could freely move around. I would like to
believe that this pressure led to his decision,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark made his comments in the lobby of FBI headquarters in
northwest Houston where dozens of reporters and photographers were
jammed shoulder to shoulder. After Clark finished answering
questions, FBI employees perched on a walkway above the lobby gave
him a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   With the murder charges pending in Illinois and Kentucky,
Resendez-Ramirez will be prosecuted in Texas first because he was
captured in the state, Rangers Capt. Earl Pearson said. He was
brought to Houston because the only Texas warrant for his arrest is
in Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County prosecutors said the suspect's blood sample will
be rushed for DNA processing and will be available in three to four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. could not be reached for
comment about whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty if
Resendez-Ramirez is charged with capital murder here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine that we would not (seek the death penalty),
but we haven't made that decision yet,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Devon Anderson, who is assigned to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Benton case is the first for which the suspect would face a
Harris County murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   If enough evidence is found in that case to link Ramirez to it,
he could be charged with capital murder in Dominguez's killing as
well, Anderson said. But there is more evidence in the Benton
investigation that leads directly to Ramirez, so that case appears
stronger at this point.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, facts gathered during the Dominguez
investigation would be introduced in the punishment phase of a
capital murder trial for Benton's death, assuming Ramirez is
convicted. Evidence from cases in other states could also be used
by Harris County prosecutors to convince a jury that the suspect
deserves the death penalty because he would otherwise pose a
continuing threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon was expected to establish in Wednesday's hearing whether
Ramirez has enough money to hire a lawyer. If he does not,
officials say, the judge already has two court-appointed attorneys
waiting in the wings _ Allen Tanner and Rudy Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, a former prosecutor, would be the lead counsel, court
personnel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner told the Houston Chronicle Tuesday that he had no comment
on the case and that he had not spoken to law-enforcement officials
or Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon's court personnel said Tuesday that the judge has
indicated that he would allow cameras in the courtroom today for
Ramirez's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was moved from Harmon's court to a larger one on the
same floor that is occupied by state District Judge Elsa Alcala.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the northeast Texas community of Hughes Springs, police were
awaiting word on a palm print comparison that investigators hope
will link Resendez-Ramirez to a ninth slaying _ the October's
killing of 89-year-old Leafie Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Mason was found beaten to death with an antique iron in her
home. Police obtained no fingerprints at the scene, but recovered
the palm print and a strand of hair, thought to be that of the
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Randy Kennedy said the palm print was to be
compared in Houston with the suspect's palm print Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it matches and he's talking, I hope to talk to him the
following week,'' Kennedy said.

CITY ORDERED TO REMOVE FISH SYMBOL FROM OFFICIAL SEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Missouri has ordered the City of Republic to
remove a fish symbol, known as an ichthus, from its seal because
the symbol unconstitutionally depicts Christianity as the city's
official religion.
</P>
<P>
   Republic was given 30 days to remove the ichthus from the seal,
which was designed eight years ago and adorns the city's trucks,
flags, street signs, stationery and business cards. The
eight-member board of aldermen has scheduled a meeting next week to
decide whether to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, never
went to trial. In a summary judgment on July 9, Senior Judge
Russell Clark of U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Missouri wrote that depicting the ``Christian fish'' in an official
city logo violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment,
which governs the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Clark wrote, ``The portrayal of the fish
impermissibly excludes other religious beliefs or nonbeliefs and _
intended or not _ depicts Christianity as the religion recognized
and endorsed by the residents of Republic. The Republic city seal
pervasively invades the daily lives of non-Christians and sends a
message that they are outsiders. The Constitution forbids such a
result.''
</P>
<P>
   The little fish became a big cause celebre in Republic, a town
of about 6,000 people in southwestern Missouri, just west of
Springfield. A committee raised $35,000 to finance the legal battle
to support the fish, and ichthus signs sprang up on sidewalks,
churches and roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we stood up for it and fought for it,'' said Paula
Howell, co-chairman of the Support Republic Committee, which raised
the money, ``was because the logo was designed to show community
values and community morals, and it was never intended to promote
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark found that the fish symbol ``is exhibited extensively
throughout southwest Missouri to denote Christian-owned
businesses,'' and that ``even Republic's own citizens do not deny
that the fish on the city seal is a Christian symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the board of aldermen, the judge noted, two
residents said they moved to Republic because, as Christians, they
were attracted by the fish on the city seal. The seal is an oval
with quadrants that contain a map of Missouri, a family of four in
silhouette, an outstretched hand and the ichthus, formed by two
intersecting arcs.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's plaintiff in the case, Jean Webb, is a practitioner
of Wicca, or witchcraft. After writing an editorial in the local
newspaper opposing the city seal, Mrs. Webb said she received hate
mail and angry phone calls. She moved and has not spoken to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Republic was represented pro bono by the National Legal
Foundation, which calls itself a ``Christian public interest law
firm'' with headquarters in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fitschen, president of the foundation, said his group took
the case because ``what the framers of the Constitution intended to
prohibit was the establishment of religion, but they clearly
intended to allow encouragement, accommodation and acknowledgment
of religion, and we think that's what this is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark noted precedents in two other cities where courts held
that city seals that included crosses also violated the
establishment clause of the First Amendment. He also said that only
in Austin, Texas, where ``the city insignia was based upon `the
family coat of arms of Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas and
the person after whom the city is named,''' did courts approve a
city seal that includes a cross.

 &HT;    Railroad suspect in custody
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher and Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A national manhunt ended unexpectedly Tuesday
morning in El Paso when Rafael Resendez-Ramirez _ who has spent 23
days on the FBI's most wanted list _ walked across an international
bridge near El Paso and shook the hand of a Texas Ranger waiting to
arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Resendez-Ramirez, suspected in killings in three
states, had been flown to Houston and was in jail on a burglary
charge related to one of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive's decision to turn himself in stunned and puzzled
law enforcement officers, who have spent recent weeks searching for
Resendez-Ramirez in communities and rail yards across the country.
He has been charged in three slayings and has been linked to five
others. Three of those five are in Fayette County, just 70 miles
southeast of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business a very, very long time,'' Texas
Ranger Senior Capt. Bruce Casteel said when asked why
Resendez-Ramirez had returned voluntarily from his Mexico safe
haven and surrendered. ``And I'm struggling to answer that
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the surrender, Texas Ranger Drew Carter spent two days
discussing terms and other issues with Resendez-Ramirez's sister.
Resendez-Ramirez met Carter on the Ysleta Bridge over the Rio
Grande at 10 a.m. CDT, Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter told me that he extended his hand, they shook hands,
and he handcuffed him. He (Resendez-Ramirez) was very pleasant, not
aggressive,'' Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   The climax to an intense, nationwide hunt for Resendez-Ramirez
began when Carter, who was on a family fishing trip to the Gulf
Coast, received a call Sunday on his cell phone from the
fugitive'-- sister in Albuquerque, N.M. The sister, whose name
authorities have not released, told the ranger she needed to talk
to him, Casteel said. Carter took his family back to Houston and,
in company with an FBI agent and deputy U.S. marshal, headed for
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Casteel said, Resendez-Ramirez was somewhere in
Mexico, believed to be staying with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in New Mexico and over the next 36 hours, the law
officers discussed surrender terms with the sister, who was either
in direct contact with Resendez-Ramirez or communicating with him
through their brother.
</P>
<P>
   The only charge pending against Resendez-Ramirez in Texas is one
of burglary, related to the killing of a doctor in the Houston
suburb of West University Place, in Harris County. Monday night,
officials said, Harris County District Attorney Johnny Holmes sent
a fax to Albuquerque, giving assurance that Resendez-Ramirez would
be safe in that county's jail, that family members would be able to
visit him and that he would receive a psychological evaluation.
Asked if there were any guarantee that prosecutors would not pursue
the death penalty, Casteel said, ``None whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox said that
the guarantee from Holmes ``had a 72-hour life to it.'' That was
communicated to the fugitive in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that the original timetable called for a somewhat later
meeting on the bridge. A DPS plane was already en route Tuesday
morning from Houston to Albuquerque to pick up the law officers and
sister there and then fly to El Paso, Cox said, ``when for some
reason, Resendez-Ramirez got antsy.'' To speed things up, the
sister and officers drove to El Paso and the plane diverted to the
border city.
</P>
<P>
   Casteel, the Ranger commander, said that Rangers Carter and
Brian Taylor had gone to Albuquerque several weeks ago to talk to
the sister and that ``this initial contact resulted in the
development of good rapport between Carter and the sister. That
rapport, based on trust, has been very crucial in bringing about
the Ramirez surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that ``the crucial thing here is that she trusted
Ranger Carter. Ramirez supposedly said that he would not surrender
to anyone but a Texas Ranger, and we're very proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Resendez-Ramirez has been charged with murder in Kentucky
and Illinois, he has not yet been charged in any of the Texas
cases. Cox said one reason for that is that Mexican authorities in
the past have been reluctant to extradite to the United States
people charged with capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico does not have the death penalty. Kentucky, Illinois and
Texas do. Casteel said now that the man is in custody in this
country, he will likely will face ``probably five, possibly six''
murder charges in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Casteel said he did not know how long Resendez-Ramirez had been
in Mexico. Cox said that though authorities in that country had
been cooperative in the early stages of the search for the
fugitive, they were not involved in the surrender. In Mexico City,
a spokesman for the Attorney General's office had no comment on the
case, other than to say that Resendez-Ramirez has not been accused
of any crimes in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said there is ``a possibility'' that Resendez-Ramirez family
members will receive $125,000 reward money for helping to bring him
in. If they do, he said, his understanding was that they would use
it for his legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, 39, has a long criminal history in the United
States, beginning when he was first arrested for car theft in
Florida in 1979. He has used many different names and social
security numbers over the years and served short prison sentences
for burglary, carrying a weapon and trespassing on railroad
property, and claiming U.S. citizenship. The FBI said his birth
certificate gives his real name as Angel Leoncio Reyes Recendis.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for Resendez-Ramirez had become such a part of the
lives of the residents of Weimar, in Fayette County, that Most
Wanted flyers with his many mug shots still were taped to office
walls and store windows late Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But residents said Resendez-Ramirez's surrender means they may
be able to emerge from the shadow of death that he _ and someone
else _ left behind after moving through like a vicious cyclone,
upturning lives and shattering Weimar's small-town sense of
security.
</P>
<P>
   Three people _ two from Weimar and another who lived west of the
city _ are believed to have been among his eight victims. The Rev.
Norman Sirnic and his wife, Karen, were found May 2 bludgeoned with
a sledgehammer in the parsonage behind Weimar United Church of
Christ. And June 4, Josephine Konvicka, 73, was found, also
bludgeoned to death. Officials have said they found fingerprints
belonging to Resendez-Ramirez in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar Police Chief Bill Davidson said his officers want to
interview Resendez-Ramirez and get more physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot to do as far as the case is concerned,''
Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   After the slayings, police began checking every one of the 40
trains that moved through town, questioning anyone found on the
freight trains. Families put alarms and floodlights in their homes,
began locking doors and avoiding the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the slayings changed the city's image from that of
a quaint community to a place to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our big town celebration the second weekend in June and
we had our parade, and I had three other Chambers of Commerce call
and say they decided not to come this year,'' said Denise Delgado,
38, a secretary at the Weimar Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The chambers told her they feared for the safety of the children
who would ride the floats in the daytime parade. Only five of 300
T-shirts were sold at the celebration called ``Gedenke,'' meaning
``to remember'' in German. The event made $114, far below proceeds
of previous years, Delgado said. A church group of 37 people due to
tour the city in late June canceled, also citing fear for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be known for great sausage. Now we are known for
this,'' she said. ``It's not fair to our town, all this stuff that
is going on. It's not our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the negative image, Weimar collectively exhaled Tuesday
as news of the surrender filtered through the air waves and the
neighborhood grapevine. The stranglehold of fear visibly loosened.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, a young boy stopped Police Chief Livingston and
gave him a congratulatory handshake. ``We got him,'' Livingston
replied, shooting a wide grin while cradling a large binder with
Resendez-Ramirez's photo pasted on the front.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the violent deaths of their three friends will
keep the city of 2,052 from returning to normal. But this weekend
Los Tiburones del Norte will perform at Weimar Hall. In a few
weeks, the city will host the 1999 Babe Ruth Southwest Regional
baseball tournament _ no one has canceled _ and on Aug. 8, a fried
chicken and stew dinner will be served at the Harvest Feast.
</P>
<P>
   It's a start, Delgado said, but recovery ``is going to take a
long time.''
</P>

American-Statesman, Austin, Texas. Suzanne Gamboa and The

CONNIE BRISCOE HOPES BOOK WILL OPEN UP PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING OF
SLAVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For two to three years, Connie Briscoe created the
ultimate family heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   It's her latest novel, ``A Long Way From Home,'' the story of
three generations of women: her ancestors and slaves in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks don't have as many family heirlooms, but we have
stories to pass on,'' the writer said recently during an interview
in Seattle on a book promotion tour.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is an accomplished writer, one of a handful of
black women to make the New York Times best-seller list, her task
was difficult. Constructing the story of her ancestors' lives was
some of the most challenging and rewarding work of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really rejuvenating for me,'' Briscoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Her ancestors were children of a black slave and a white master,
they worked in the house rather than the field, several could read
and many of them operated with greater levels of freedom than most
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the typical stories about slaves most people
see,'' she said. ``People have certain images of slavery they want
you to remember and think is true.''
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, Briscoe hopes she can open up people's
understanding of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a story that hasn't been told or talked about that
much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe has frequently addressed the issues of black women in
such novels as ``Big Girls Don't Cry'' and ``Sisters &AMP; Lovers.''
This novel, however, is a departure as it is set in an earlier time
and is the first to include her family.
</P>
<P>
   Her skills as a writer helped her craft the narrative from the
point of view of her ancestors, slaves on President James Madison's
Montpelier estate in Virginia. The story covers their lives from
one generation at the end of Madison's life through the Civil War.
Through her work, she was able to discover which white master her
relatives were most likely to be descended from, dispelling the
family belief they were descendents of Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe herself lives in Virginia, the state where her relatives
lived as slaves and later fought for their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   She is a stunningly attractive woman, who uses an American Sign
Language interpreter during the interview because of a hearing
impairment. Her cool composure seems far removed from the heat and
pain of slavery in her novel. However, she asserted, the story of
her ancesters is an issue of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't go back and address these old wounds, we will
never get past our racial differences today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During her research, the modern-day currency of Civil War-era
racial issues became abundantly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking questions on a general level about slavery is
fine,''she said. ``But when you try to find a white father of a
slave, you start running into `I don't know,' `We can't help you'.
And you just have to be a little more pushy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two to three years of pushing, Briscoe wrote the book in
about six months. It was the longest period of time she has ever
spent on a novel. Her primary tools were family members, interviews
with researchers and historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   She believes that the non-traditional nature of her ancestors'
stories and the personal elements of her novel may interest readers
and ultimately broaden the vision some people have of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   She said the impact of her work on her life has taken an
unforeseen twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has responded really well,'' she said. ``But now my
father's family is begging me to do a project for them.''

WE'LL PLAY IN GAMES BY RIDING WITH DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The local suitors to the Olympic flame
divvied up the booty the other day, and great news _ we got table
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   We also may get dressage, modern pentathlon and the ever-popular
rhythmic gymnastics, which is just like real, Kerri Strug-type
gymnastics, except it involves, I think, hula hoops, beach balls
and Russian piano music.
</P>
<P>
   If that didn't stoke Olympic fever in you, nothing will,
comrade.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive my cattiness. My only hope here is to defuse any whiffs
of provincialism that might be emanating from your flared nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   It's much too early. The name of the bid group is Dallas 2012,
not Dallas 2001. The dream goes on.
</P>
<P>
   And all cattiness aside, there seems to be a place in it for
Fort Worth and Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   When the board of directors of the Dallas 2012 Olympic bid
committee convenes next week, the site will be the UT-Arlington
Robotics and Automation Research Institute in East Fort Worth. They
didn't accidentally consult the wrong Mapsco. Committee chairman
Tom Luce planned it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're proving to everybody that we're walking the
walk,'' Luce said yesterday. ``You just can't host an Olympic Games
and not get everybody involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce stressed that that was merely a ``preliminary draft'' of
possible Olympic venues that his group unveiled two weeks ago. Like
most drafts, it is subject to major revisions between now and the
deadline for submitting formal bids _ Dec. 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   No contracts have been signed. No ground has been broken. No one
has even exchanged winks or handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's a good starting point. And it's reason to squelch any
grandiose notions that Tarrant County residents may have had about
Dream Teams and future Michael Johnsons walking our streets.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly and humbly, we don't have the facilities that our
neighbor to the east will have. By 2012, Dallas will have the
American Airlines Center (maybe), Texas Stadium (or something
bigger), an expanded Dallas Convention Center, a spiffed-up Cotton
Bowl and the city's underestimated jewel, Fair Park.
</P>
<P>
   Other than facilities for the equestrian events and The Ballpark
in Arlington, for every possible Olympic site that Tarrant County
can offer, the Dallas side probably can do better.
</P>
<P>
   The other notable exception is Texas Motor Speedway, where
general manager Eddie Gossage still wants to get involved. People
on the Dallas 2012 board have casually mentioned the possibility of
leveling the speedway's garage area and turning the infield into a
giant soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a bad Jenny Jones makeover.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, we're being neither overwhelmed nor ignored as
the Dallas 2012 people charge intrepidly up Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally agree,'' said Donna Parker, executive vice president
of the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce. ``And I've got to give a lot
of credit to Tom Luce, whose dedication to the regional aspect of
this bid has been tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee, formally titled the Dallas 2012 Preliminary
Group, includes among its Tarrant County representatives Mayor
Kenneth Barr; former Mayor Bob Bolen; local philanthropist Ed Bass;
Don Carty of American Airlines; John Roach, formerly of Tandy;
former U.S. Congressman Pete Geren; Marvin Girouard of Pier One;
Gossage; Terry Stinson of Bell Helicopter TEXTRON; and Vernell
Sturns of Harris Methodist Health Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't exactly the Ten Dwarfs. Parker is convinced that
the group is committed to extending the Games beyond the confines
of downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done everything I can to show that we fully intend to
make this a regional effort,'' chairman Luce said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it would have taken a naive soul to imagine
mayors Barr, Elzie Odom of Arlington and Ron Kirk of Dallas
together on the same stage, all wearing T-shirts with the D-word on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they did, and now here they are, attending meetings in Fort
Worth together. Behind the visibility of the Dallas 2012 group, the
area was able to secure the U.S. Olympic Trials in wrestling and
triathlon for next year. A contingent from the national canoe and
kayak association toured and declared Lake Arlington an ideal place
for its whitewater trials.
</P>
<P>
   The name, no doubt, still makes some Fort Worth people cringe,
but the reality is that the Olympic bid needed a Dallas branding to
go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As the Chamber's Parker said, ``That's OK _ it gets our foot in
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this crazy dream, the door _ even the modern pentathlon
door _ is going to still feel Olympian.

U.S. TEAM'S POLITICAL STAND IS MIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last week, in their ``Wish List'' feature, editors
at Sports Illustrated expressed the hope ``that no one drags global
politics into Saturday's U.S.-China Women's World Cup final.''
</P>
<P>
   As with almost every American wish attached to the tournament,
this one came true _ and then some.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice. But is it good?
</P>
<P>
   The final game went off without a political hitch, without
public acknowledgment from the players that the U.S. and Chinese
governments are at odds, with scant press attention to that angle
beyond the obligatory wisecracks about the possibility Chinese
spies had stolen the U.S. game plan.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, within minutes of Brandi Chastain's winning penalty
kick, the opposing players were literally arm-in-arm at midfield,
creating a long line of alternately white and red shirts, and were
spinning the entire human olive branch until it had faced every
corner of the packed Rose Bowl stands in a more or less spontaneous
gesture of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Fans shouted their approval. Weren't any of them offended?
</P>
<P>
   I'm asking because, unless a drastic shift in international
politics went unreported amid the weekend's sports-bra mania, the
People's Republic of China is the closest thing the United States
has to a major enemy in the post-Soviet world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm as soft on Communism as the next Democrat, but come on.
China has been a repressive, murderous regime. China steals our
military secrets. China slips cash to our politicians. (If there
are politicians to be bought off, we'll take care of it ourselves,
thank you very much.)
</P>
<P>
   Not to be redundant, but China is a human-rights violator from
way back, its offenses including treatment of women that most of us
in the western world find appalling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here were our new sports heroes dancing shoulder to shoulder
with representatives of official China in a show of _ what?
</P>
<P>
   Was it good sportsmanship? Or a display of ignorance or apathy
by the 20- to 33-year-olds who make up the U.S. team?
</P>
<P>
   Along with the significance we've already wrung out of it, the
1999 Women's World Cup might have marked a generational shift in
the way Americans view international sports.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, victories in the athletic arena were cheered as
triumphs of the American way, not applauded for their role in
fostering understanding among peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Owens became a track legend not merely because he won four
gold medals, but because he did it under the pouting gaze of Adolph
Hitler, who meant to use the 1936 Games in Berlin to prove ``Aryan
superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Louis' fights against German heavyweight Max Schmeling had
extra meaning because they occurred in the buildup to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. basketball team's last-second defeat in the 1972
Olympic final pained us not simply because it was the result of bad
officiating but because it came against the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, memories of the U.S. hockey team's shocking gold medal
in 1980 are sweetened by the semifinal victory, which came against
the Soviet Union weeks after the Russians' invasion of Afghanistan
raised East-West military tensions. The final victory over friendly
Finland has become a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, Louis and Jim Craig didn't dance with the enemy, they
just went out and beat him.
</P>
<P>
   But Mia Hamm was 7 years old in 1980. Lorrie Fair was 1. We can
hardly expect them to remember the Miracle on Ice. Do they remember
the Soviet Union?
</P>
<P>
   Olympic boycotts and fan riots are one thing, unpleasant
intrusions of politics into sports. Acknowledging political
differences between competing nations can be something else,
leading to catharsis for fans on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   When England's Manchester United scored a last-minute victory
over Germany's Bayern Munich in the European Champions League final
in May, all of England celebrated, not because everybody loves Man
United, but because it beat (begin ital)Germany(end ital). Again.
</P>
<P>
   Sports didn't create the English bitterness toward the Germans.
Jesse Owens' host did that. Sports were the healthy means for
working off the tension.If the Women's World Cup opened American
eyes to the pleasures of international soccer, a generation that
wouldn't know Nikita Khrushchev from ``La Femme Nikita'' could
discover that political spice is among those pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Subtly, perhaps without realizing it, they already did last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When they celebrated the U.S. victory as a result of Title IX,
the 1972 federal mandate for gender equity in education, they
recognized that the championship was the work not just of 20 young
women but of American society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Bloc countries dominated women's sports by pumping their
girls full of steroids. We're doing it with democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this was, after all, a victory for the American way
makes it all the more rewarding, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   That's something to dance about. But with China? &QL;

 &HT;    Hospitalization is denied for suspect
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Rockdale County judge Tuesday turned down a request
to hospitalize Heritage High School shooting suspect Anthony
``T.J.'' Solomon for psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed door meeting with Juvenile Court Judge William
Schneider and Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read, lawyers for
the Rockdale teen, who is under a suicide watch, maintained that he
is severely depressed and needs more help than can be offered at
the Gwinnett Youth Detention Center, where he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider declined to discuss the meeting. Don Samuel, one of
Solomon's lawyers, said the judge agreed that the 15-year-old needs
psychiatric help but apparently was not convinced that the problems
warranted moving him.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense lawyers said the judge left open the
possibility that he might reconsider if psychological exams on
Solomon by the state and defense are more compelling. Ed Garland,
another of Solomon's attorneys, said Ed Regnier, a clinical
psychologist from Sarasota, Fla., is evaluating Solomon for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Read objected to the defense request because, he said, he did
not see anything ``from a legal standpoint'' that suggests Solomon
is mentally ill. He also said he had concerns about Solomon's
safety and the safety of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon is accused of shooting six of his Heritage High School
classmates as they waited for classes to begin May 20. None of the
injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Schneider set an Aug. 9 hearing to consider
whether Solomon should remain in Juvenile Court or be sent to
Rockdale County Superior Court to stand trial as an adult.

 WTO DEBATE ON NATION'S ACTIONS GOES BEYOND SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Canada will slap $125 million per year in
taxes on European goods. This is to compensate for the European
Union's exclusion of U.S. and Canadian beef.
</P>
<P>
   What's notable is that the action is not unilateral. It has been
given an OK by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most recent WTO agreement, all countries agreed to
base human-health restrictions on assessments of scientific risk.
The United States and Canada, whose ranchers treat cattle with
government-approved growth hormones, charged that Europe's ban on
their beef had never been scientifically assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Europe replied that it was following the precautionary
principle, which can be summed up as ``better safe than sorry.''
The United States replied that it's OK to take a precautionary
approach, but to elevate it to a principle ``cannot create a risk
assessment when there is none.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO appellate panel agreed. Its ruling still allows European
governments to set any standard of risk they want _ one in a
thousand, one in a million, one in ten million.
</P>
<P>
   But they have to consider whether the evidence meets the
standard. They can block a new product while they assess it. But to
ban it permanently they have to assess it, and base their
assessment on science.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a tough standard. ``It is not the same as scientific
certainty,'' said Keith Rockwell, the WTO's director of
information. The WTO decision (available at www.wto.org) does not
call for majority science. If some evidence exists that a given
hormone poses a risk _ and evidence apparently does exist on one of
them _ the Europeans can make the assessment and ban that hormone.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to ban all hormones on the ``better safe than
sorry'' principle.
</P>
<P>
   Twice I've sat through public panels discussing this case, and
twice Seattle trade consultant Bill Bryant of Bryant Christie Inc.
has asked WTO critics: If you throw out the requirement for
science, how can you tell which ``health'' measures are real?
</P>
<P>
   This question simply goes past some. It doesn't matter to
critics that Europe's ban might be a measure to protect European
beef packers. To them, a government's rules are that government's
business (and theirs, when they go to to lobby for new rules).
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant asked critics at Seattle University on May 26 how
they could define a health measure without science, one opponent
called out, ``Forget science!''
</P>
<P>
   When Bryant put his question to the Washington Council on
International Trade's panel last Friday, Lori Wallach of Ralph
Nader's group Public Citizen said there were other reasons than
science. There are religious reasons not to use certain products,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That Ralph Nader's advocate offered religion as an alternative
to science was a fascinating opening, but the moderator let it go.
Religion is a private matter in the United States. Left unsaid was
that it also cannot be used to ban products.
</P>
<P>
   This argument is about more than science. It is about whether
governments should be bound by any rules, and how they should be
enforced. It is about the idea of the WTO itself, which in the
words of David Hartridge, acting director, is ``a trading system
based on rules, open markets and the acceptance by governments of
freely negotiated limitations on their power.''
</P>
<P>
   At a speech in Geneva on July 5, Hartridge remarked on the
change between the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s, much of the
world rejected the WTO. Now, he said, ``There is no dispute about
the commitment to negotiate, or about the value of open markets and
rules-based trade.''
</P>
<P>
   No dispute from governments. The WTO now has 135 member
governments, and even Russia and China are knocking on the door to
get in.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Hartridge noted, the WTO ``has been subject for the
first time to outspoken and even violent hostility'' from citizens.
``We are told to expect larger demonstrations of skepticism and
hostility at Seattle,'' he said, of the WTO's meeting here in late
November.
</P>
<P>
   Of course. To get other people to give up their special
protections, you have to give up yours. As Washington Secretary of
State Ralph Munro noted a few weeks ago, ``We always wanted all our
ferry boats built in Washington. But if we're going to be a player
in world trade, we can't do that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the century now unfolding, Washington ferries might be built
in Mexico. Instead of corn syrup from Iowa, Coca-Cola might contain
cane sugar from the Philippines _ or Cuba. But Washington apples
will be offered in Kyoto, and beef fat from Kansas will eventually
line the arteries of Frenchmen.

ALL-STAR NOTEBOOK: WILLIAMS AND FENWAY STILL CLICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As soon as Ted Williams emerged along the center field
warning track as a passenger in a green golf cart Tuesday night,
the fans at Fenway Park rose as one noisy group and saluted perhaps
the finest hitter in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old Williams raised his white cap to the fans as the
cart crept along the periphery of the stadium. Slowly, very slowly,
Williams and the fans blew each other symbolic kisses.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams was delivered to the mound to toss out the
ceremonial first pitch for the final All-Star game at a fabled park
where he was such a hero and which will soon be replaced, an
emotional scene occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The current All-Stars and the players who were assembled on the
field as part of the all-century team converged on the middle of
the diamond to greet the former Red Sox great.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey Jr. and Cal Ripken Jr. surrounded
Williams, and then Tony Gwynn, who, like Williams, might be the
best hitter of his era, leaned in to shake Williams' hand.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who vigorously chewed gum and wore a blue shirt and
tan pants, was animated as he spoke with several players.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Williams continued chatting with current and former
stars for a few minutes, officials from Major League Baseball moved
in on the spontaneous showing so that the game would not be delayed
further.
</P>
<P>
   The public address announcer even asked the players to return to
their dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   Some would not depart. McGwire and Gwynn remained on the field
as Williams readied himself to throw the ceremonial pitch to
Carlton Fisk, another former Red Sox great.
</P>
<P>
   Williams waved at Fisk and then put his hand over his eyes to
peek in at Fisk. He used Gwynn to support his left side and then
lofted the ball from 40 feet away. It floated through the crisp,
black night and landed neatly in Fisk's glove, once again causing
the fans to embrace the player they loved and loathed during his
career with another loud and long ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Still on the Outside
</P>
<P>
   Though his view has never been in doubt, baseball commissioner
Bud Selig indicated publicly for the first time Tuesday that he
would not lift Pete Rose's lifetime ban.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who accepted the ban in 1989 from the commissioner at the
time, A. Bartlett Giamatti, as a result of betting on sports
events, has applied for reinstatement and Selig has taken a long
time to act on his request.
</P>
<P>
   The subject arose Tuesday during a news conference at which
Major League Baseball unveiled plans to have fans select an
all-century Team from a list of 100 players.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Joe Jackson, who was also banned for life as a result
of the Black Sox scandal in the 1919 World Series, were among the
list of 100, and Selig was asked how Major League Baseball could
justify having them included. Neither is eligible for the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fans choose them amongst their 30 players, they're
entitled to that,'' he said. ``That does not, in my judgment,
affect what Landis did or Bart Giamatti did, nor affect my
thinking, to be quite candid about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, after another question on the subject, Selig
added, ``I don't think there's anything new or if there's anything
new that I would do to change what Bart did.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Is Back in the Fold
</P>
<P>
   Fay Vincent, who resigned as commissioner under pressure from
owners in September 1992, was at the All-Star game in the
commissioner's box next to the American League dugout as his
successor's guest.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig's invitation and Vincent's presence represented the
most visible evidence that the two have reconciled. Selig had been
one of the primary movers behind Vincent's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bygones are bygones,'' Vincent said. ``It was very nice of Bud
to invite me. I appreciate it. I'm happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent has attended a few regular-season games since he left
office, but this was the first time he was at an All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Catch 22 of Sorts
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra was criticized by some reporters for playing
in Tuesday night's All-Star game, even though he did not play in
Boston's last nine games because of a strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who was voted a starting outfielder for
the National League, did not play because he was disabled with a
calf injury and felt it would be unfair for him to return in the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a big believer in doing things I feel are right,''
said Gwynn, who came to Fenway Park anyway and took batting
practice. ``I'm not worried about what people say. I was out for
three and a half weeks. Coming back in the All-Star game wouldn't
feel right to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Gwynn was asked if he would have felt differently if
the game was being played in San Diego, similar to Garciaparra's
situation, he said, ``Probably, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   First Things First
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn and the Padres will open the second half of the
season at Seattle's new Safeco Field, but Gwynn did not exactly act
as an ambassador for the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of you are going to fly to Seattle from here, I could
care less,'' Gwynn said. ``My biggest concern is going out there
and doing my job, not opening up a ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the Mound, Gibson Says
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gibson, whose 1.12 earned run average in 1968 helped prompt
baseball to lower the pitching mound from 15 inches to 10, said
Tuesday that he supported the idea of raising the mound again to
restore some balance to pitching and offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me whenever there's any legislation in baseball to
improve the game it always makes the pitcher a little less
effective,'' Gibson, the former St. Louis Cardinals star, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the mound back up. And I can see the
strike zone a little bigger up and down, not sideways.'' Then, he
added for effect, ``And I'd like for them to take the guys and give
them two strikes.''

MISSING WITNESS IN CHINESE ORGAN SELLING CASE REAPPEARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a key witness who had disappeared now offering
to testify, federal prosecutors have reopened their case against
two Chinese citizens charged with trafficking in human organs
harvested from executed Chinese prisoners, a lawyer involved in the
case said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver A. Smith, a lawyer for one of the two accused men, said
that Judge Deborah A. Batts of U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
who had dismissed federal conspiracy charges against Smith's client
in March, reinstated the case Tuesday. Marvin Smilon, a spokesman
for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District,
confirmed that the case had ``been reinstated,'' but would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The government witness, Paul Risenhoover, has been described by
defense lawyers as an American immigration counselor active in the
Chinese dissident movement. When the judge dismissed the case in
March, she described Risenhoover as a ``fraudulent opportunist''
who may have sought to entrap the two Chinese defendants, Cheng
Yong Wang and Xingqi Fu, for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In a 155-page opinion, the judge accused Risenhoover, who
studied in China and speaks Mandarin, of mistranslating a critical
passage in a transcript of a conversation taped by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. In what the judge called ``the most
egregious'' example of Risenhoover's ``unreliability,'' she quoted
an undercover FBI agent asking Wang whether unclaimed bodies of
Chinese prisoners were buried or were sold. Wang replied in
Mandarin Chinese that they were buried, not sold, the judge said.
But Risenhoover translated his comments as if Wang had indicated
that the bodies were sold.
</P>
<P>
   She dismissed the case because she said Risenhoover had refused
to return from abroad to appear at the trial, denying the
defendants their Constitutional right to cross-examine him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who represents Wang, said he had received a copy of a
brief letter that the judge had received from federal prosecutors
on Friday, saying that Risenhoover was available to testify.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday where Risenhoover has been or why he
decided to return to testify. Risenhoover could not be located for
comment Tuesday, and his lawyer, Carlyle R. Hatfield, did not
respond to telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
   The case received wide attention because it appeared to confirm
what Chinese dissidents and American officials have described as a
growing trade in kidneys and other organs harvested from executed
prisoners and sold in the United States for use in transplants. It
is illegal in the United States to deal in organs that have not
been voluntarily donated. The case also gained attention because
the government had relied, at least in part, on a private sting
operation run by a prominent human-rights advocate, Harry Wu.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hatfield said that Risenhoover denied any wrongdoing
and had refused to return to testify because his wife is Chinese
and he feared that Chinese officials might retaliate against her
family in China. He said, without elaboration, that Risenhoover's
actions were based on ``religious faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith described Wang, a former prosecutor on Hainan Island,
China, as being under virtual house arrest in New York with an
electronic ankle bracelet monitoring his movements. He wears the
bracelet in a compromise with federal prosecutors who wanted him
imprisoned while they appealed the dismissal of the case, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Cohen, a lawyer who represents Fu, a Chinese citizen
who operates a laundry in Queens, could not be reached for comment.

DAILY NEWS DISPUTE ON WAGES AWAITS JUDGE'S RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing a struggle with one of its most powerful
unions, The Daily News plans to ask a federal judge to vacate a
labor arbitrator's award of back wages to its drivers, the
newspaper's chief legal officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported erroneously Tuesday that Chief Judge
Thomas Griesa of U.S. District Court in Manhattan had upheld the
arbitrator's decision on Monday. In fact, the arbitrator had simply
submitted a document reaffirming his earlier decision to increase
the drivers' salaries and award the back wages dating to Jan. 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Krall, The News' executive vice president and chief legal
officer, said that the newspaper would ask Griesa this week to
vacate the award. If the judge does not, Krall said, the newspaper
will appeal to a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   If the award is upheld, it could eventually cost the newspaper
what union officials have estimated would be tens of millions of
dollars. Krall said that because of a ``me too'' clause, most of
the newspaper's other unions would be entitled to the same
increases granted to the drivers, who are represented by the
Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers have been seeking to increase their wages to bring
them in line with those of drivers at The New York Times. Without
an appeal, Krall said, the newspaper would have to put the new wage
increase into effect immediately. It also would have to begin
paying out portions of the retroactive wages as soon as next month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the award, the base salary of the drivers would
immediately be raised to $911.79 a week. Under the current
contract, the drivers earn $773.57 a week, a union lawyer said
Tuesday. The union represents more than 400 drivers who deliver The
Daily News in the city and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator's document reaffirmed the percentage amount of
the retroactive wage increases. The drivers' salaries would be
raised retroactively by 5.9 percent, effective Jan. 1, 1997; there
would be a 5.8 percent raise from Oct. 1, 1997, and a 5.2 percent
raise from Jan. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the arbitration case, The Daily News had proposed to pay
significantly smaller wage increases.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The organizers of the Sydney Olympics seem
to have devised a new event for the 2000 Summer Games: a U-turn
with back flip.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the organizing committee has provoked protests
from the United States and Japan, and plenty of grumbling locally,
because of stop-go decisions about sites and events at the Games,
which are scheduled to open Sept. 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy, which is now being negotiated toward a
possible compromise, concerns, of all things, high school marching
bands from the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The organizing committee invited these bands _ 10 from the
United States _ to perform along with Australian students for 10
minutes as part of a three-hour opening ceremony for the Games, an
event that will be attended by 110,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But this stirred a populist mixture of local pride and
Australian nationalism that led the committee to retreat and ``give
the American kids the boot,'' as a columnist in California put it.
The American and Japanese bands are now being offered lesser roles
away from the Olympic center stage, and their response is expected
shortly.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal was just the latest in a series of actions that
have provided Sydney Games officials with an almost constant
headache.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the choice of sites for the beach volleyball and
road cycling events attracted strong opposition from interests as
diverse as residents of Bondi Beach, a Sydney suburb, and
executives of a movie studio here owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox
conglomerate. The beach site survives for the moment, in the face
of claims of risks of environmental damage, but the cycling route
has been changed twice.
</P>
<P>
   But here and in parts of the United States, the uproar over the
marching bands is wider and louder than the volleyball and cycling
arguments and has increased criticism of the committee's secretive
style and see-saw decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not since the 1960s Broadway and Hollywood hit ``The
Music Man'' has there been such a fuss about school bands.
</P>
<P>
   Of the young musicians who suddenly find themselves ``Olympic
orphans,'' according to one Sydney headline, 800 are from Southern
California and 500 more are from Georgia. For the last nine months,
they have been practicing music and marches to perform alongside
200 Japanese and 500 Australian students with whom they were to
form a 2,000-strong group to play and parade at the start of the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   News that the young Americans would have a major entertainment
role at the opening ceremony, an event many Australians expected
would be reserved for local talent, was slow to emerge here.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies director, Ric Birch, an Australian citizen,
issued invitations last September, after winning committee approval
for an ``international'' ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Birch's American connections go back to 1984, when he helped
stage the Los Angeles Games pageant, which featured scores of grand
pianos. At the Barcelona Games in 1992, Birch was praised for
devising the lighting of the Olympic cauldron with a flaming arrow.
But his closing ceremony segment in Atlanta in 1996, involving
large inflated kangaroo models on bicycles, made many Australians
cringe.
</P>
<P>
   When Victor Grieve, director of the Golden Kangaroos, a Sydney
suburban band, learned last month that Birch's program next year
would highlight American high schoolers and their showy precision
marching, he complained that Birch had ``closed the door'' on
Australian band members, most of whom are older and emphasize music
more than spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Birch did not respond for a month so Grieve and others took
their claims to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Talk-radio hosts and their listeners seized on the story. One
caller declared that if the Americans marched, she would burn her
tickets in protest. Officials of the Musicians Union said he was
``seeking to impose American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters to editors claimed, ``This is the Australian Olympics.''
An Australian sports columnist, Peter Fitzsimmons, said
``warmed-over American schmaltz'' should not be part of Australia's
Olympic message.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Holloway, the chief executive of the organizing committee,
said he was ``mystified'' by ``the depth of feeling'' in the
community over the issue. Michael Knight, the Olympics minister, in
deciding to withdraw the invitation to the bands, said that the
organizing committee had been out of step with public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake,'' he said. ``There was overwhelming
community opposition to foreign musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The American counterattack was swift, particularly from
Californians who bombarded Sydney newspapers with e-mailed
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Register columnist Gordon Dillon, whose
readers include many families connected to the six bands that had
been invited from the area, declared Australians ``a bunch of
low-down, back-stabbing rats'' who had ``cravenly weaseled out'' of
their offer.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Narr, father of a band member in Placentia, Calif., wrote
to The Sydney Morning Herald that ``Australians should be ashamed''
and charged them with ``a mean nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney committee is rated highly by International Olympic
Committee officials for meeting construction and transportation
requirements, but it seems accident-prone in public relations and
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who will officially open
the Games, was even drawn into the controversy over the bands on
the eve of his visit to Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   Already riled by recent U.S. actions to strengthen tariffs and
quotas against imports of Australian lamb, Howard said barring the
American musicians from the opening ceremony was ``the right
decision'' because many young Australians were able to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Six marching band leaders from California, led by Roy Anthony of
San Diego, argued against that decision in Sydney last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians offered six minor Olympic appearances for the
American and Japanese bands, such as the opening soccer match to be
played in Canberra, the national capital. Anthony said the offers
are being considered. ``We are still in discussions here. We can't
decide until we contact our schools and students.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John Moore, a member of the Australian organizing
committee arrived in California on Monday to meet with band members
and their parents and try to sell them on a revised performing
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting was set for Tuesday evening at El Dorado High School
in Placentia, with the hope that somehow, some way there might be
some harmony at the conclusion of this saga.

BRENDA HUGHES MOORE, 56, BISHOP'S WIFE AND RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts
consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired
bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New
York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan and
Stonington, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in
North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and
the University of Perugia.
</P>
<P>
   She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a
Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special
assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national
exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the
cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in
the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of
Foreign Policy and author of ``The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married
Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World
Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.
</P>
<P>
   The year after Eagle's death in 1974, she married Moore, who had
officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been
widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an
arts appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 she and Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for
the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore is survived by two sisters,
Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.

CLINTON SEEKS DISCLOSURE ON PENSION PLAN CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Del., Texas)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposed Tuesday that companies that
change from an old-fashioned pension plan to a much-disputed new
type of plan popular with large employers be required to tell their
workers roughly how much retirement money they stand to lose from
the switch.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes in response to harsh criticism of so-called
cash-balance pension plans by many employees and consumer groups.
These plans often save companies millions of dollars a year, but
they can reduce the money older workers receive in retirement by
one-third or more. Moreover, many employees have complained they do
not have enough information to figure out how they will be affected
by the conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional defined-benefit pensions, where workers earn
the bulk of their retirement pay late in their careers, with
cash-balance plans employees can accrue retirement benefits evenly
over their careers and can often take plan balances with them if
they switch jobs. While that can be helpful to younger workers, the
conversions can sometimes cost older workers hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of companies have converted to cash-balance plans and,
according to Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a human resources consulting
firm in Bethesda, Md., 16 of the nation's 100 largest companies now
have such plans, and six others have a hybrid pension plan; none
had these options a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   It appears likely that Congress will pass legislation requiring
improved disclosure to employees when companies convert to
cash-balance plans. But lobbyists and others involved on both sides
of the issue said it is not clear what form the final legislation
will take. Among the proposals are the administration's plan, and a
``right to know'' bill sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, William
Roth, R-Del., is considering introducing cash-balance disclosure
language as part of a tax bill, and the chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, has included
language in his tax bill requiring that employees be given
``sufficient information'' to understand the effect of conversions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal would require employers to provide
specific examples of how the change would affect different groups
of workers, comparing the old and new plans. It would also require
that employees be told if a ``wear-away'' period was included, in
which some employees stop earning pension benefits for a time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They formed a scrum around Ted Williams at the center
of the Fenway Park diamond last night, the greatest collection of
baseball stars _ past, present, and future _ ever assembled in a
single setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Famers in suits, which included Hammerin' Hank, the
Say Hey Kid, and Yaz, and the All-Stars in full uniform blended
into an emotional tableau of applause, hugs, and tears around the
golf cart transporting Williams, the 80-year-old Red Sox icon who
before our eyes is being transformed from Teddy Ballgame into
Father Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to imagine, in the wake of such a dramatic
prelude, that anyone playing in the 70th All-Star Game could make
this stage his own. But as one fan in the sellout crowd of 34,187
in Fenway Park shouted from the grandstand, ``This is your house,
Pedro,'' Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez once again staked his claim on
Yawkey Way's most precious property.
</P>
<P>
   In a pitching performance that rivaled one of the All-Star
Game's most legendary moments _ Carl Hubbell of the Giants striking
out Hall of Famers Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons,
and Joe Cronin in succession 65 years ago _ Martinez struck out the
side in the first inning, then struck out two more batters in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's victims were Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, and Sammy
Sosa in the first inning, Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell in the
second. Sosa is the biggest star in Martinez's native Dominican
Republic, and a close second here to McGwire, whose Home Run Derby
performance Monday night will remain a part of Fenway lore.
</P>
<P>
   But the bats of the game's biggest sluggers were turned to
sawdust by Martinez, who allowed one base-runner to reach, Matt
Williams, who got on board on Robbie Alomar's error, and was erased
when Bagwell whiffed, ending Martinez's stint.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez became the first pitcher in All-Star history to strike
out the game's first three batters, and tied an American League
All-Star record, shared by the Monster, Dick Radatz, and Billy
Pierce of the White Sox, for most strikeouts in a game, five.
</P>
<P>
   The AL led the NL, 4-1, after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorchester's Donna Summer was finishing her elegant rendition
of the national anthem, four F-14s thundered past, seemingly
skimming across the tops of the Fenway light stanchions.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, a clear, 67-degree midsummer's delight, the
complaints about the noise would be few, although surely there was
some minor grumbling that Martinez only worked the first two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The National League broke through in the third against
Martinez's replacement, David Cone of the Yankees, but not before
Cone struck out the first batter he faced, Mets catcher Mike
Piazza, the sixth NL strikeout victim of the night.
</P>
<P>
   First-time All-Star Jeromy Burnitz, the Milwaukee Brewers'
slugger, lined a double to right, and after Jay Bell looked at a
third strike for the second out, the Reds' Larkin grounded a single
up the middle, Burnitz scoring to make it 2-1. Walker was retired
on a comebacker to the mound, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   American League manager Joe Torre had said before the game that
he was thinking of sending Garciaparra onto the field for the start
of the third inning, then sending Derek Jeter of the Yankees out to
replace the Red Sox shortstop before play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   That way, Torre said, Garciaparra would receive a final sendoff
from the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I do that,'' Torre said, ``my own guy (Jeter) won't get
booed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Torre put off doing so, allowing Garciaparra to lead off the
bottom of the third against the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, the
majors' strikeout leader with 200.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who lined to right against National League starter
Curt Schilling in the first, swung at Johnson's first pitch and
lifted a high fly to shallow center, where the Cubs' Sosa gathered
it in.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on cue, Jeter emerged from the American League dugout and
met Garciaparra just in front of second base. The two shook hands
in front of second base, then embraced, and then with his usual
stiff-legged gait, Garciaparra trotted off the field to sustained
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The AL gave Martinez a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first, as
three of the four Cleveland Indians in the starting lineup, plus
Iron Cal Ripken, combined to jump-start the AL team.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Kenny Lofton, taking advantage of Schilling's tardy
arrival at first base, beat out an infield hit to McGwire at first
base. Two outs later, Lofton stole second and Manny Ramirez of the
Indians drew a full-count walk. Jim Thome, the Indians' first
baseman, lined a 1-and-0 single to center, scoring Lofton with the
game's first run, and Ripken hit Schilling's next pitch to right
field, scoring Ramirez to make it 2-0.

U.S. TEAM SPRINTING TO SEVILLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DUNAWAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent world records in the men's 100 meters by an American, and
marks in the mile and decathlon by foreign athletes, have refocused
attention on the track and field team the United States will send
to next month's 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain. It is
as strong, deep and versatile as any in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the United States is strongest in the sprints, where
Marion Jones, Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene are favored to win
four or five individual gold medals among them.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who will be trying to win five gold medals in next year's
Olympics, will go for four Aug. 20 to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Jones should be a strong favorite in the 100 meters and an
odds-on choice in the 200, and if the coaches select her to run in
the 4-by-400-meter relay, she could pick up another gold medal
there. But in the long jump Jones is only one of a half-dozen or so
women clustered around the 23-foot mark. No one is dominant, and
any of them could win, including Jones' two American teammates,
Dawn Burrell, who beat Jones in the U.S. championships in Eugene,
Ore., last month, and Shana Williams, who finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene's world record of 9.79 in the men's 100 meters,
combined with his taking-care-of-business work ethic, will make him
hard to beat in the men's dashes. His training partner, Ato Boldon
of Trinidad, and the Namibian Frankie Fredericks should offer a
strong challenge in both the 100 and 200.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, forced to withdraw from the U.S. championships
in the 200 meters because of a slight injury, is eligible only for
the 400 meters in Seville, where he will be the defending world
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Johnson has demonstrated that the injury was minor by
running the 400 in 43.92 seconds, the fastest time in the world
this year. In April, Johnson said he was not interested in trying
the 200-400 double in Seville, although he hoped to repeat his
historic 1996 Olympic double in Sydney, Australia, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Both men's and women's American relay teams will be fast enough
to win. But American relay teams have a history of dropped batons,
passes out of the zone and other mishaps, especially in the
4-by-100, where there is no margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about to come to an end,'' Greene said last week.
</P>
<P>
   American men will also be favored to win the shot-put and the
110-meter hurdles. John Godina won the U.S. title with a put of 72
feet 3 inches, the longest throw since July 1977. He will be going
for his third straight world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Americans will be overmatched, however, in the decathlon and the
men's middle distances, especially after recent world-record
performances by Hicham el-Guerrouj of Morocco in the mile (3:43.13)
and Tomas Dvorak in the decathlon (8,994 points). The American Dan
O'Brien, the previous decathlon record-holder, has withdrawn from
the worlds with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. team also has gold-medal possibilities in several
other events. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Men's pole vault, where Jeff Hartwig set an American record of
19-9 in late June at the U.S. championships.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men's high jump, with Charles Austin, 1996 Olympic high-jump
champion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men's discus, with Godina and the former Syracuse star Anthony
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men's 400-meter hurdles, where Angelo Taylor and Joey Woody
provide a 1-2 punch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's 100-meter hurdles, where Gail Devers _ after a year
off to overcome various injuries _ returned to competition with a
strong victory at the U.S. championships. As a two-time Olympic
100-meter champion, she is also a threat in that event if Jones
makes any mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women's pole vault, where the American record-holder Stacy
Dragila could upset the world-record holder Emma George of
Australia.
</P>

 &HT;    New Cuban exodus may be on Florida's horizon
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Eighteen months ago, Pope John Paul II
stood in a square in the eastern Cuban city of Camaguey and
implored Cubans to stay and fight for change rather than boarding
boats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1999, with their hopes of change dwindling,
Cubans are once again taking to the sea in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 1,260 Cubans have made the perilous journey
across the Florida Straits and landed safely in South Florida _
already more than in any year since the dramatic 1994 exodus of
more than 33,000 rafters.
</P>
<P>
   And so far this year, 951 others have been intercepted at sea
and returned to the island.
</P>
<P>
   This current wave has been characterized by an increasing sense
of urgency and desperation, as refugees have waved machetes at
Coast Guardsmen, threatened to set themselves afire at sea and
staged mad dashes through the South Florida surf to claim asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, one woman drowned while attempting to elude capture.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, about 200 protesters lined a street leading to
the Coral Gables home of sugar producer Alfonso Fanjul, who was
hosting a dinner for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who stood behind a pink coffin, a reminder of
the death of the Cuban woman who drowned, complained that Clinton
is cooperating too much with Cuban President Fidel Castro and about
how the Coast Guard is treating refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The latest surge of refugees flocking to the United States can
be explained by increased repression and a worsening economic
outlook in Cuba since that promise-filled visit by the pope early
last year, diplomats and Cuba observers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lull after the pope's visit that gave people some
hope, some breathing room,'' a Western diplomat in Havana said.
``That began to change about September when the Cuban government
began ratcheting up its control.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit came as the socialist government _ ruled for 40
years by Castro _ appeared to be allowing more free expression and
permitting Cubans to open small mom and pop businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from September to February, the Castro government took a
series of steps to tighten state control over almost every aspect
of life on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals who moonlighted as taxi drivers to earn precious
U.S. dollars suddenly faced stiff fines for competing with
state-owned taxi companies.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who rented rooms to tourists or opened small
restaurants found new taxes made the enterprise unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Police enforcing new laws against economic crimes began
routinely setting up roadblocks outside major cities to check the
identity and possessions of the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Police presence in Havana, already heavy, was reinforced with
hundreds of new officers wearing black berets and carrying
walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar sellers, prostitutes and hustlers who once strolled
Havana's boulevards with impunity were swept from the streets,
taking away what had become part of the city's ambiance as well as
a major source of money for Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic hardships were bad enough, but life was becoming
a lot less fun,'' the diplomat said. ``The average Cuban can't walk
three blocks without getting stopped by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's prisons swelled by several thousand, mostly young people
arrested for crimes ``often related to the situation of poverty and
unemployment,'' the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National
Reconciliation reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which is not recognized by the Cuban government,
cited its own unofficial sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less tourism, less money in the street,'' said Daniel
Hernandez, 32, a West Palm Beach photographer who returned from
Cuba last week after visiting his family. ``Desperation is growing
block by block.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's occasional moves to allow Cubans to venture
into private enterprise have been inefficient and often
nonsensical, said Mariela Ferretti, a spokeswoman for the
Cuban-American National Foundation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the job categories were amusing,'' Ferretti said.
``They included doll repair and dog grooming. Who in Cuba can groom
their dog when they can't afford to groom themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Ferretti said Castro's government won't allow any meaningful
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message has been made clear to them that they have no hope
for options,'' she said. ``And when people cannot vote, they vote
with their feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The current discontent in Cuba is not unlike the conditions that
helped give rise to previous waves of emigration, but diplomats say
they see no indications that Castro might open his ports and allow
a mass exodus this time around.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of Cuban refugees follows old and new patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is related to the condition of the seas, which are
more calm and always bring more refugees in the summer months.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the exodus in 1994, Cubans are no longer coming in
inner-tube rafts. The vessels now arriving are mostly seaworthy,
powered by sails or motors.
</P>
<P>
   The homemade rafts proved useful in 1994 because they could
venture far enough off the Cuban coast to draw the attention of
friendly Coast Guard and Navy ships patrolling the waters between
Florida and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But later in 1994, the United States reached an agreement with
the Cuban government that changed the rules. Cubans intercepted by
U.S. authorities were routinely returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The repatriation led to an increase in smuggling and a change in
tactics by Cubans seeking political asylum in the United States.
Cubans quickly learned the principle nuance of the new U.S. policy
_ that the trip would be wasted unless they set foot on U.S. soil,
where they were permitted to stay while they applied for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The wet-foot, dry-foot policy explains why Cubans attempt to
evade Coast Guard vessels.
</P>
<P>
   If captured in the water, they are shipped back to Cuba. A dry
foot almost certainly means a life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be sure that not only Hialeah knows about that, but
Havana knows about that as well,'' said Dan Geoghegan, a spokesman
for the Border Patrol in Miami.

 &HT;    Murder charged in ValuJet crash
 &HT;    (EDS: TIMELINE AT BOTTOM OF STORY.)
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ State prosecutors Tuesday charged an air maintenance
company with murder for every one of the 110 people who died when
ValuJet Flight 592 slammed into the Everglades three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities also charged SabreTech, Inc. and three
former employees with criminally mishandling the combustible oxygen
generators that investigators say burst into flames and doomed the
DC-9 minutes after it left Miami International Airport on May 11,
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The federal charges and 220 state counts _ 110 for manslaughter
and 110 for felony murder _ are believed to be the first stemming
from an air crash in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ``SabreTech is ultimately responsible for these deaths,''
Miami-Dade State Attorney Kathleen Fernandez Rundle said. ``This
crash was completely preventable. It was not an accident, like many
other crashes are. It was a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Richard Kessler, who lost his wife, attorney
Kathleen Kessler, in the crash, welcomed the action, but said,
``There's no closure or anything like that. It doesn't happen. It's
a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Families for all but 10 of the 110 victims have settled their
civil cases, said Aaron Podhurst, a Miami-based attorney for 25
victims.
</P>
<P>
   SabreTech lawyer Kenneth Quinn called the charges ``outrageous''
and said the firm, which lost $37 million after the crash and is
now out of business, was being made the scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No useful purpose is served by going after a company that has
been driven out of business, or employees who have learned the most
painful lessons of their lives,'' said Quinn, a former Federal
Aviation Administration lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A felony murder is a death, intentional or otherwise, resulting
from commission of a felony _ in this case the illegal transporting
of hazardous waste, with which the state also charged SabreTech.
Because no individuals are named in the state case, no one can go
to prison, but the company can be fined for as much as $10,000 for
each count it is convicted of, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-count federal indictment charges Maintenance Vice
President Daniel Gonzalez and mechanics Eugene Florence and Mauro
Valenzuela. Acting U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis said lawyers were
arranging Tuesday for the three to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   They are charged with conspiring to place a destructive device
on an airplane; making false statements about the removal of the
generators; improperly training employees; and improperly removing,
loading, packaging and transporting hazardous materials. If
convicted of the federal charges, the company faces up to $6
million in fines and restitution and the employees face up to 55
years in prison, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn criticized the government for not going after ValuJet,
which actually loaded the canisters onto the plane and which
investigators said contributed to the crash by hiring SabreTech
because it was a low-cost firm and then not keeping an eye on it.
He also pointed to the FAA, which investigators said shared the
blame through lax oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not able to prove any individual (at ValuJet) was
responsible for the deaths,'' Fernandez Rundle said. She also said
that at one point ValuJet reminded SabreTech that canisters must be
properly monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ValuJet flight virtually vanished into the swamp
along with 110 lives, there was enough evidence for National
Transportation Safety Board investigators to conclude that
SabreTech workers improperly labeled canisters as empty before
taking them to the ramp where ValuJet workers loaded them on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical canisters, normally packed in insulation and spaced
in airline cabin ceilings, generate heat of more than 500 degrees.
The five crates were swathed in plastic bubble wrap, stacked atop
rubber tires and stored in a cargo compartment with no smoke
detector.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB said a firing pin on a canister became dislodged during
loading or takeoff and became hot enough, in six minutes, to cause
a tire to explode. The flames them disabled the electrical system
and spread so quickly that the crew was powerless to land the plane
safely. Cockpit tape transcripts showed passengers shouting ``Fire!
Fire! Fire!'' in the flight's last moments and a videotaped test
done later on similar canisters showed them generating heat that
approached 3,000 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB found SabreTech mechanics worked 12-hour shifts, seven
days a week; mechanics with no experience handled oxygen
generators; and workers responsible for signing off on inspections
of DC-9s had not been through DC-9 systems training.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez Rundle on Tuesday alleged what she called a systematic
chain of ``cumulative errors, omissions and sometimes deliberate
acts'' between January and May 1996 that included SabreTech workers
falsely documenting that the canisters had been fitted with safety
caps _ caps that cost only 3 cents apiece, are easily fitted and
could have prevented the fire that brought the plane down.
</P>
<P>
   At one point at Tuesday's news conference, Fernandez Rundle
showed Lee Sawyer of Miami, who lost her parents, the cap and had
her fit it onto one of the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should give you some answers,'' Fernandez Rundle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' Sawyer said. ``Someone needs to be
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   ValuJet merged in 1997 with Orlando-based discount carrier
AirWays Corp to form AirTran, which said Tuesday it has cooperated
with investigators since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully confident the government will bring to justice
those it believes are responsible,'' AirTran Chairman Joe Leonard
said in a statement. ``We will continue to cooperate with those who
seek the truth in this matter and will not, as have others, use the
media to deflect blame and avoid responsibility.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Mexican fugitive suspected of killing eight people
in three states, avoiding capture by hopping freight trains,
surrendered peacefully today in El Paso, after members of his
family negotiated his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the suspect, Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, a 39-year-old
drifter from Mexico, walked across a bridge from Ciudad Juarez,
Mexico, to turn himself in, he had become the most-wanted fugitive
in two countries, a man the authorities here say could be
responsible for many more killings than those for which he has been
sought.
</P>
<P>
   The search for him involved thousands of investigators around
the country and in Mexico, who despite an endless supply of tips,
were often thrown off the trail by an elusive suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was a simple telephone call from his sister,
Manuela Matorino Karkiewicz, who lives in Albuquerque, N.M., to a
Texas ranger. She told the ranger, Andrew Carter, ``We need to
talk,'' said Mike Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought her brother was ready to surrender,'' said Cox,
who would not reveal the sister's name.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Robinson, pastor of Hope Chapel Foursquare, Mrs.
Karkiewicz's church, said the ranger ``was very protective of the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Resendez-Ramirez would surrender even though he faced
the death penalty if convicted, Bruce Casteel, commander of the
Texas Rangers, said, ``I've been in this business a very long time,
and I'm struggling to answer that myself right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the pastor, said Mrs. Karkiewicz had initially
contacted him in June. Of Resendez-Ramirez's surrender, he said,
``It was a direct answer to prayer. We prayed for a very peaceful
and calm ending.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors, meanwhile, agreed to allow Resendez-Ramirez
to have family members visit him in jail and to have a
psychological examination.
</P>
<P>
   For months leading to the surrender, news of Resendez-Ramirez's
alleged exploits terrified people living and working near railroad
tracks, especially in Texas, where five of the eight victims were
found over the last six months. Gun sales in many railroad
communities in Texas rose sharply as the police warned the suspect
could kill again.
</P>
<P>
   When he struck, said the authorities who knew him as ``the
railroad killer,'' the anonymity of freight yards and rails
provided a safe backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state investigators, who have collaborated on one of
the biggest manhunts in recent years, say the proximity to
railyards of the five deaths in Texas, plus one other, two years
ago in Kentucky, has been one of the most obvious similarities in
building the cases.
</P>
<P>
   But other evidence also convinced investigators that the murders
were committed by the same person, including the means by which the
victims were killed _ savage beating with blunt objects _ and
fingerprints and other evidence that the authorities say tie the
killings to the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   And the authorities say he could be responsible for many other
deaths. Don Clark, an agent with the FBI in Houston, told reporters
on Tuesday afternoon that since Resendez-Ramirez's surrender ``50
to 60 other police departments have requested information to see if
he is connected to unsolved murders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used every tool possible to make this come about,'' Clark
added of the capture of Resendez-Ramirez, who was added to the
FBI's 10 Most Wanted List on June 21. ``But we're not finished in
this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The big break in the case came through the telephone call on
Sunday night to the Texas Rangers, which is the state police, from
Mrs. Karkiewicz, said Tela Mange, a spokeswoman for the Houston
Department of Public Safety. ``She said he wanted to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   That conversation led to others between Ranger Carter and Mrs.
Karkiewicz as well as with other relatives of Resendez-Ramirez's in
the United States. Ms. Mange said that a written agreement was
drafted that outlined terms of a surrender, and the family accepted
late Monday night or early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities stressed on Tuesday that they made no promises
to Resendez-Ramirez that he would avoid execution by surrendering.
Since the death penalty was declared constitutional in 1976, Texas
has put more inmates to death, 180, than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the possibilities,'' Robinson said of the family.
``This is very painful for them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement in place, Resendez-Ramirez walked across the
bridge into El Paso early on Tuesday morning to give himself up.
Later, the authorities flew him here, where he was placed in the
Harris County jail in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had opportunity to leave last night, and didn't,'' said
Robinson about talks with Resendez-Ramireza on Monday night when he
was apparently with a brother in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez looked tired and wan as he appeared before a
state magistrate in El Paso on a pending burglary charge from the
Houston area. He wore a wrinkled blue-stripped shirt, tattered blue
jeans and aviator-style glasses.
</P>
<P>
   He looked no different, although perhaps a little more tired, as
he emerged from a twin-engine state plane that flew him into
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He was questioned by law-enforcement officials at the Houston
police department on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he is expected to face murder charges stemming from the
five killings in Texas that investigators say he is linked to.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently facing two murder charges in Illinois in
connection with the June 15 shotgun slayings of an elderly man and
his daughter. Another murder charge is pending in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, the search for Resendez-Ramirez exasperated
federal authorities in the United States. Border Patrol agents
picked him up on June 2 and released him into Mexico. They
apparently did not know that the FBI was searching for him and that
the Houston police had told the Immigration and Naturalization
Service that he was wanted for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after he was released, a 73-year-old woman from Fayette
County, Texas, Josephine Konvicka, was found beaten to death in her
home. A day later, Noemi Dominguez, 26, a Houston teacher, was
found beaten to death in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her car was found in Del Rio, a Texas border town, with
fingerprints that the authorities say could be Resendez-Ramirez's.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Resendez-Ramirez had remained a
mysterious figure. Even his true identity was uncertain since
investigators say he has used more than 30 aliases. Born in the
Mexican city of Puebla, he first entered the United States
illegally in 1976, when he was arrested in Brownsville by INS
agents. For the next 23 years, Resendez-Ramirez led the life of a
transient, illegally jumping freight cars from Mexico into the
United States. He bounced in and out of federal prisons and local
jails on minor non-violent offenses.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his non-violent history, investigators say they have
linked him through physical evidence to the five Texas killings as
well as the slayings in Illinois and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But the big break came Sunday. Cox, the spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety, said that Carter had first visited
Mrs. Karkiewicz, an aide at a physical rehabilitation center, about
two or three weeks ago at her home in Albuquerque and had remained
in regular telephone contact with her. At the same time, Mrs.
Karkiewicz apparently had contacted another brother in Mexico who
knew the whereabouts of the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of receiving the cellular call on his fishing trip,
Carter flew to Albuquerque with an FBI agent and a U.S. marshal to
meet with Mrs. Karkiewicz. By Monday, an agreement had been drafted
by the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston that
offered the suspect and his family three things: a pledge of safety
in the Harris County jail, the promise of regular visits from his
family and a full psychological examination.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark was noncommital when asked if Mrs. Karkiewicz would
receive the $125,000 reward offered in the case, other officials
said it appeared that she would.

SHERLEY ANNE WILLIAMS, 54, NOVELIST, POET AND PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., R.I.) (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sherley Anne Williams, a daughter of migrant workers who became
an award-winning novelist, poet and playwright as well as a
professor at the University of California, died on July 6 at a
hospital in San Diego. She was 54 and lived in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, Kate Callen, a university spokeswoman,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams fused her experiences in the dusty cotton fields
and fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley with historical
research to articulate the African-American experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when she was already a celebrated poet, she ventured
successfully into fiction with the historical novel ``Dessa Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   A story of relationships, particularly the one between a
privileged Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave sentenced to
die after the birth of her baby, the work was praised by David
Bradley in The New York Times as ``artistically brilliant,
emotionally affecting and totally unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams' language, infused with rhythm and image,
transcended the boundaries of genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Ms. Williams shows that she can write a novel better
than a lot of novelists, nowhere does she cut herself off from her
poetic roots,'' wrote Bradley, citing a passage in which the
character Dessa recalls her lover, Kaine:
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaine, his voice high and clear as running water over a
settled stream bed, swooping to her through her. ... He walked the
lane between the indifferently rowed cabins like he owned them,
striding from shade into half-light as if he could halt the setting
sun. ... Talk as beautiful as his touch. ... Kaine's eyes had been
the color of lemon tea and honey. Even now against closed eyelids,
she could see them.''
</P>
<P>
   At her death, Ms. Williams was working on a sequel to ``Dessa
Rose'' and on a novel set in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Her first book of verse, ``The Peacock Poems,'' was nominated
for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   She won an Emmy Award for a television performance of poems from
her second book of verse, ``Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' which was
another National Book Award nominee. Her one-woman drama, ``Letters
From a New England Negro,'' was performed at the National Black
Theater Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater
Festival in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working Cotton,'' a 1992 children's tale, won an American
Library Association Caldecott Award and a Coretta Scott King Book
Award, and was listed among the best books of 1992 by Parents
magazine. Ms. Williams had recently published a second children's
book, ``Girls Together.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Bakersfield, Calif., she grew up in Fresno, where her
family worked as migrant workers. Her father died when she was 8,
her mother when she was 16. After that she survived by picking
crops in the same fields where her parents had toiled. Her
upbringing, she later said, ``was the most deprived, provincial
kind of existence you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Though an impassioned reader, Ms. Williams had been discouraged
from that activity by her mother, who felt she might be introduced
to ambitions she would have no possibility of fulfilling. But in
the eighth grade, a science teacher saw promise and urged her to
enroll in college preparatory courses. In high school, she realized
a love of language and was encouraged to apply to college.
</P>
<P>
   The change was unsettling, she later recounted. ``To go from
having no prospects at all to having seemingly limitless
opportunity ... well, in my case, I feel I just wasn't prepared for
seemingly limitless opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Fresno State University, she discovered the
work of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown, who she claimed were
her earliest influences. ``I was just captivated by their language,
their speech and their character because I always liked the way
black people talk,'' she said. ``So I wanted to work that in
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing a master's degree in American literature at
Brown University, she joined the literature department at the
University of California at San Diego in 1973 and remained there
until shortly before her death.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, John Malcolm Stewart of Lancaster,
Calif.; a sister, Ruby Birdson, and three grandchildren.

LATEST WAVE OF NEW BALLPARKS BLENDS HIGH TECH, RETRO LOOK 
WITH NEW-BALLPARK PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the big-league ballparks in use today were built in one
of two eras.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, which roughly covered the 1960s and 1970s,
ballparks were mostly multipurpose concrete ovals, often outfitted
with artificial turf and sometimes topped with domes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, which began with the opening of Baltimore's
Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 1992, the theme was
turn-back-the-clock, as architects tried to give new stadiums the
feel of yesteryear with brick exteriors, irregular field dimensions
and manual scoreboards.
</P>
<P>
   A third era, now being ushered in with the opening of five new
ballparks in less than a year, continues to reject the
aesthetically unpleasant stadium designs of the '60s and '70s,
while improving on the economic and artistic successes of '90s
ballparks built in Baltimore, Cleveland, Denver and Arlington. That
third era begins tomorrow in Seattle when the Mariners face the San
Diego Padres at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadiums, in Seattle, Milwaukee, San Francisco, Detroit
and Houston will all strive for the historic look, even though
three of the five will have movable roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the new stadiums, the one with the best chance to be
special might be Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark will not be the biggest, not the most expensive,
not the most luxurious,'' Giants owner Peter Magowan said, ``just
the best. Small and cozy. Urban. Brick and steel. \RWith\S a
grass-field \Rand\S a short right-field porch where sluggers like
Barry Bonds can send home runs right into San Francisco Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   While it will carry a corporate name and offer the usual
revenue-producing amenities of the day _ luxury boxes, club seats,
more and more varied concessions _ PacBell might be the most
unusual of the new stadiums, and not just because long balls can
sail into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The $306 million stadium is being privately financed, the first
major-league park not to use public funds since Dodger Stadium,
which opened in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The other open-air stadium to make its debut next year is
Comerica Park in Detroit, which will replace one of baseball's
oldest venues, Tiger Stadium. Renderings of the downtown ballpark
depict a facility similar in interior appearance to Camden Yards
and Cleveland's Jacobs Field. Comerica also has an outfield view of
downtown, a sea of green seats, a smallish seating capacity (a
little more than 40,000) and a brick, stone and steel exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities to other ballparks are not surprising since one
of Comerica Park's architects is HOK Sport, which designed several
other 1990s stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The covered ballparks going up in Houston and in Milwaukee also
borrow from existing stadiums, but improve on domed facilities in
Toronto and St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest improvements is that even when covered,
Miller Park and Enron Field will allow fans a view of the outdoors.
That's the result of having glass-paneled walls above the top row
of upper-level seats, stretching to the point where the roof meets
the seating bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Enron Field will be an improvement over the Astrodome because of
its downtown location, its grass field (which wasn't possible with
a fixed roof), its brick facade and its smaller seating capacity,
which, at 42,000, will allow for greater intimacy than was possible
at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Camden Yards does, Enron Field will make use of existing
historic structures in the surrounding neighborhood: A renovated
Union Station will be part of the new park, along with housing
offices, retail and restaurant space.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Park will be adjacent to County Stadium, away from
downtown in a park-like setting that will encourage the pregame
tailgating that is a tradition in Milwaukee. Like Enron Field,
Miller Park will be an ``airy'' retractable-roof facility, with a
brick exterior reminiscent of The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Park's most unique feature, however, will be its
fan-shaped roof, which is supposed to open or close in about 10
minutes and afford fans a more open stadium feel.
</P>
<P>
   One feature consistent in all the new parks is premium seating,
which guarantees revenue beyond ticket sales. Miller Park, for
example, will have 70 suites and 3,100 club seats, whereas County
Stadium had neither. Comerica Park will have 3,000 club seats and
2,000 suite seats; Tiger Stadium had no modern premium seating.
</P>
<P>
   So, while ballpark designs have changed, the reason for building
new ballparks _ economics _ hasn't.

ENRON FIELD WILL BRING BACK TEXAS-SIZE SCOREBOARD 
WITH NEW-BALLPARK PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   The Astrodome made history when it opened in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros intend to keep that history alive when they move into
their new ballpark next year by emulating one of the Astrodome's
most beloved features.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the Dome or the AstroTurf; the Astros are going with a
retractable roof and real grass at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   But Enron Field will have a huge scoreboard, and those who
remember the old Astrodome remember how much a part of tradition
that is in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A series of boards and video displays will stretch from the
right-field foul line to dead center field, 200 feet long and 50
feet high. The main video screen will be 26 feet by 46 feet, one of
the largest in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our best to keep some tradition alive in the new
ballpark,'' Astros senior vice president Bob McClaren said. ``We
wanted to keep the Astros history of having big scoreboards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had the biggest around when they moved into the
Astrodome. It also was revolutionary, the first animated scoreboard
ever, costing $2 million and containing 1,220 miles of wiring.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimmy Wynn, Doug Rader or Rusty Staub smacked a home run,
the scoreboard showed the Astrodome top being blown off with a
tremendous explosion. A huge baseball appeared with the words
``HOME RUN'' on it, more explosions, followed by cowboys riding on
the screen with their guns ablazing and then two giant steers
waving the American and Texas flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would round up the steers and then the show would
end with more fireworks exploding in a multicolor display. The
whole production took 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard served other functions as well. When the Astros
were upset with Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, the scoreboard operator
made him the answer to the night's trivia question: Who is the most
unpopular man in the world? The other choices were Frankenstein and
Pete Rozelle.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard was the forerunner of JumboTron, DiamondVision
and all the other high-tech gadgetry that would come later.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Astrodome will be left behind. In all other
respects, Enron Field will be on the cutting edge of technology
with all the usual amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a world-class facility befitting Houston and
allowing us to maintain competitiveness in baseball's current
environment,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   The $251 million park is being built on the site of Union
Station, a historic train depot that opened in 1911 and closed in
1974. The station is being restored, and the Astros estimate 60
percent of their fans will enter through there.
</P>
<P>
   The park also is a baseball-only facility, as opposed to the
Astrodome, which was multipurpose. The Houston Oilers played there,
and their owner, Bud Adams, was the one who demanded the animated
scoreboard be torn down in 1988 so he could add 10,000 seats to the
place. Nine years later, he took his team to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Astros' lease, they have the right to use Enron
Field for all lawful purposes, excluding the operation of sexually
oriented businesses, an industrial site or waste-disposal site.
Provisions also have been made for the place to be used for the
Olympics if they ever come to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Astros don't have to worry about being forced
on the road for a month while their home-field plays host to the
Republican National Convention, as the Astrodome did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros still will be able to play in air-conditioned comfort
when the roof is closed, but without the fans losing their view of
downtown Houston. Fifty thousand square feet of glass will stand
between the roof and the left-field wall, allowing for both
aesthetic beauty and air-conditioned comfort.
</P>
<P>
   All that and the giant scoreboard, too.

PAC-BELL PARK IN SAN FRANCISCO HAS NICE RING, BEFITTING THE CITY'S
STATURE 
WITH NEW-BALLPARK PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ben Grieve walks to the plate, and 41,000 fans
give him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   That's been a common occurrence at Pac-Bell Park, ever since
Grieve became a free agent after the 2003 season and left the Las
Vegas Athletics to sign with the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He has owned the city ever since. Now, midway through the 2020
season, history beckons. Knuckleballer Kerry Wood stands on the
mound, and Grieve needs just one more. One more home run and Hank
Aaron is erased from the record book forever.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipation is over the baseball. Some collectors are
offering as much as $10 million _ one-fifth of Grieve's salary _
for the record-breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Wood floats a knuckleball, and Grieve whips the bat around. A
loud crack echoes through the ballpark and the ball sails high and
deep to right, high above the 25-foot wall, over the promenade
behind it and _ ker-plunk! _ right into San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Then ...
</P>
<P>
   Then what?
</P>
<P>
   One guy gets the baseball and five others drown in the attempt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' said Shana Daum, public-affairs officer for
the San Francisco Giants. ``That's not our jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the first questions that arises when Daum takes
you on a tour of Pac-Bell Park, the Giants' new palace scheduled to
open by April 4, 2000. The 25-foot right-field wall is 307 feet
from home plate. There's a promenade behind it and ``knotholes'' in
the wall where people actually can get a glimpse of the game for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Then _ as advertised _ comes the cold, dark waters of San
Francisco Bay. The Giants' favorite sales pitch about their new
place is really true: There will be home runs hit into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   So you can't help but wonder what happens when souvenir-hungry
fans start diving in after home-run balls. After all, there are
fans who dive into alligator-infested waters in Florida during
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember Father Guido Sarducci, from Saturday Night
Live?'' Daum asked. ``He's a big Giants fan, and he lives in Marin
County \Racross the Golden Gate Bridge\S. He's offered us to train
dogs to jump in the water and retrieve the baseballs.''
</P>
<P>
   She is serious.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a part of why the Giants' new ballpark could easily end
up as the best in baseball. Pac-Bell fits the three most important
factors of any real-estate transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Location. Location. Location.
</P>
<P>
   The brick-and-steel park is built right on the San Francisco
waterfront, a 15-minute walk or two-minute trolley car ride from
downtown. Ferries from all over the Bay Area will dock just beyond
right field. Million-dollar yachts use the marina beyond left
field. The neighborhood _ formerly a warehouse and pier district _
is undergoing massive renovations: condos, restaurants, the works.
</P>
<P>
   Pac-Bell also will have the usual amenities that come with
ballparks these days, including luxury suites, children's play
areas and chic cafes. Plus, the Giants insist windbreaks will keep
it from being cold and miserable, as 3Com Park is.
</P>
<P>
   But the views are like none in any other park.
</P>
<P>
   If you go, don't worry about trying to get a seat on the lower
level. Those seats will be sold out. Just ask for upper deck, down
the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have a good view of the field, a spectacular view of the
Bay Bridge, San Francisco Bay and the Oakland hills beyond, and
you'll be able to see Father Guido's dogs taking the plunge below.
</P>
<P>
   The most beautiful city in the country should finally have a
ballpark befitting its grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The second most beautiful city in the country didn't seem to
fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt Seattle's Safeco Field will be a fine place to
play and a vast improvement over the Kingdome. Just to watch
baseball in sunshine on a gentle Seattle afternon will make it a
worthwhile facility. For $517 million, it should be.
</P>
<P>
   But ....
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is a spectacular city, located between Puget Sound and
Lake Washington, and surrounded by magnificent vistas of Mount
Ranier, the Cascades and the Olympic Mountains. Evergreen trees
abound, and the city has many superb neighborhoods built on hills
or next to small lakes, bays and canals.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field is not. It sits just south of downtown in a valley.
The nearest waterfront is several blocks away, a major shipping
area devoid of entertainment and eating places.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Pioneer Square is close, and billionaire Paul Allen has
renovated the nearby train station. But all of that and any views
will be blocked by the new football stadium/parking garage being
built in place of the Kingdome beyond the left-field fence. The
retractable roof hangs ominously over right field.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to the University of Washington football stadium,
built on the banks of Lake Washington. The east end is open,
affording a terrific view of the lake and the Cascade Mountains
beyond. The most fashionable way to attend the game is by boat.
It's considered one of the best college football stadiums in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly Seattle. Safeco Field is not. It's just a really
nice, really expensive ballpark, and Father Guido's dogs can't do
anything about it.

MILWAUKEE'S NEW PARK COMBINES MODERN TECHNOLOGY, OLD-TIME LOOK 
WITH NEW-BALLPARK PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Miller Park is one of four big-league parks
scheduled to debut next season, and only one of three movable-roof
stadiums to open in less than a year, along with those in Houston
and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Milwaukee Brewers officials say they have the best of the
lot. They say their ballpark meets the needs of Wisconsin sports
fans while blending modern technology with the old-time ballpark
look that has become the vogue design of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think we're the first of the next generation of
covered ballparks,'' said Scott Jenkins, the club's vice president
of stadium operations. ``I hope we're sort of a Camden Yards with a
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   That might seem unrealistic, given that the much-acclaimed
Baltimore Orioles' home field is set downtown, which Miller Park is
not, and isn't burdened with the visual weight of a retractable
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is something to what Jenkins says. Miller Park will
have the only fan-shaped convertible roof in North America, and
that should allow for a more streamlined appearance as well as an
openness that is lacking in older domed ballparks, said Bryan
Trubey, design principal for HKS Architects, the Dallas-based firm
that designed Miller Park.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the outdoor feel of Miller Park is the wall of
glass between the top row of upper-deck seats and the roof. This
will provide fans sitting at the top of the stadium with views to
the outside when the roof is closed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a portion of the exterior outfield wall can be
opened even when it rains, temperature permitting.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where football fans are willing to endure subfreezing
temperatures to watch the Packers at Lambeau Field in Green Bay,
the idea of a covered facility might seem odd. But a sampling of
Brewers fans at a recent game found that most feel baseball
shouldn't be played in the cold or the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think adverse weather in any way helps a baseball
game,'' said Harley Wright, who travels about 130 miles from
Stevens Point, Wis. for Brewers games.
</P>
<P>
   Club officials point out that because Milwaukee is one of the
major leagues' smaller metropolitan areas, the Brewers have to draw
fans from a greater distance to fill a stadium. Fans traveling
farther need the certainty that a game will be played if they
travel, so a dome is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee's not a community of 3 \Rmillion\S or 4 million
people, so we have to draw from hours away,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Park is being built just beyond the outfield wall of
County Stadium, which will be razed for parking at the end of this
season. The Brewers are taking care to preserve the best of the
County Stadium experience, however.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Brewers have the best tailgating scene in the
major leagues, and that will continue thanks to Miller Park's
``Park within a park'' design, which will take advantage of nearby
amenities such as the Menomonee River.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in-game promotions popular with Milwaukeeans, including
mascot Bernie Brewer's slide into a stein of suds after Brewers
home runs, will continue. So will the between-innings sausage race,
a live variation on the animated dot race popular at stadiums such
as The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Park will also feature about 200 ``Uecker Seats,'' $1
day-of-the-game seats in the upper deck with obstructed views.
</P>
<P>
   That's a nod to Brewers announcer Bob Uecker, who became famous,
in part, for a beer commercial in which he informed an umpire that,
``He missed the tag.'' In the commercial, Uecker's seat was about a
mile from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that except for the retractable roof, Miller Park
reminds him somewhat of The Ballpark in Arlington, with its brick
exterior and park setting. That's not surprising because Miller
Park architect HKS also had a hand in designing The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Club officials hope Miller Park will help the Brewers compete
financially against better-funded franchises, and the revenue from
increased ticket sales and premium seating should do just that.
</P>
<P>
   But some fans say the Brewers will have to start winning if they
want people to keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come for the first year to satisfy their curiosity,''
said Cam Lundquist, 39, of Stevens Point. ``But the novelty of the
new park will wear off in a year if they don't win.''

 &HT;    Clinton vows to stop huge GOP tax cut
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ Defying Republicans who are determined to use the
nation's extra cash for a huge tax cut, President Clinton vowed to
force the GOP to use most of the money to protect Social Security
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put first things first,'' Clinton said repeatedly to
the cheering members of the Communication Workers of America, who
are having their annual convention here. ``We can still have a
good-sized tax cut, but not as large as the one the Republicans
propose.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, speaking to the GOP leadership in Congress, Clinton said,
``I am asking Republican leaders, in the interest of saving
Medicare, to reconsider the size of their tax-cut plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Jockeying for political advantage with the election 16 months
away, Democrats are attempting to portray themselves as the party
most concerned about spending enough money to keep Social Security
and Medicare from going broke.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they can accomplish the same thing and still
reduce taxes for businesses and families.
</P>
<P>
   With a robust economy, political leaders suddenly find
themselves with a potential $2.9 trillion in budget surpluses over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that $1.9 trillion must be kept with Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling is over the other $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was threatening to veto any huge tax cuts, House
GOP leaders offered a plan Monday to cut taxes by $864 billion by
approving a 10 percent income tax reduction over 10 years, cutting
capital gains taxes and eliminating estate taxes and the ``marriage
penalty'' on income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about is a defining difference between the
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ``We believe the
people can spend their money more wisely than the bureaucrats in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   After the president's speech, sugar producer Alfonso Fanjul of
Coral Gables hosted a $25,000-per-couple dinner for Clinton, which
was intended to raise up to $1 million for the cash-starved Florida
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida expected to be a major player in next year's
presidential campaign and having a tough race for the U.S. Senate
seat being vacated by Republican Connie Mack, the party is hoping
to have $2.5 million in the bank by the end of year to help
Democratic candidates.

AARON LAPIN, 85, REDDI-WIP CREATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo.)   (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aaron Lapin, a St. Louis businessman best known for putting
whipped cream in a spray can, a product he named Reddi-wip, died
last Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Lapin, who was known as Bunny _ in French, lapin
means rabbit _ was a clothing salesman. But he switched to the food
business in the early 1940s, selling Sta-Whip, a wartime substitute
for whipping cream made mostly from light cream and vegetable fat.
For bakers and other commercial customers who wanted to whip
Sta-Whip, he also offered what he called a Fount-Wip, a crude
aerating gun.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, when Crown Cork and Seal Co. introduced the first
seamless, lined and lithographed aerosol canister _ the Spra-tainer
_ Lapin became one of the canister's first customers.
</P>
<P>
   He put his product in the aerosol cans under the brand name
Reddi-wip, initially selling it through milkmen in St. Louis.
Distribution quickly expanded throughout the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, Lapin was worth millions. In 1951, The St.
Louis Post-Dispatch called him ``Bunny Lapin, Whipped Cream King.''
Aerosol Age, a trade publication, wrote, ``He bought Cadillacs two
at a time and lived in Gloria Swanson's furnished mansion in
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Reddi-wip, with its iconic red-and-white label, designed in
1954, became a product celebrity and made Lapin famous, too.
</P>
<P>
   Reddi-wip earned him a mention in Time magazine last year as one
of the century's most influential inventors. Now, one out of every
two cans of aerosol topping eaten in the United States each year is
Reddi-wip.
</P>
<P>
   Besides packaging Reddi-wip, Lapin's company, Clayton Corp.,
also made and sold its own valves. It was one of the first
companies to put shaving cream into an aerosol can _ Reddi-Shave.
But Lapin decided not to market the product because he did not want
to compete against other shaving cream makers who might buy his
valves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Lapin lost control of the company and his post as
president. He also sold his interest in Reddi-wip and started
another company, Bunlap Corp.; Reddi-wip is now manufactured by
Beatrice Foods Inc. in Waukesha, Wis., a subsidiary of Conagra.
</P>
<P>
   The aerosol food products marketed by Bunlap _ Touch and Shake,
a milkshake, and Touch and Spread, a food spread that was, in
essence, cinnamon-flavored margarine _ did not take off as
Reddi-wip had, and Lapin lost several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, he reacquired Clayton Corp. and focused on
manufacturing and selling various types of valves. The company,
through its Convenience Products unit in St. Louis, currently uses
its own valve technology for products like Touch and Foam, a
home-insulating foam.
</P>
<P>
   Lapin was born in St. Louis on Jan. 5, 1914. He earned his
bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri at Columbia and
attended the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Carol; a son, Byron Lapin of St.
Louis; a daughter, Linda Levine of Los Angeles; two brothers,
Zeverly Lapin of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Gene Lapin of St.
Louis, and a granddaughter.

 &HT;    In 2000, tickets won't be so scarce
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Braves officially presented themselves as host of
the 2000 All-Star Game in a Tuesday morning breakfast. What became
clear is that Major League Baseball is looking forward to having a
site where tickets might actually be available.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the All-Star Game has been held in Colorado and
Cleveland, where season-ticket bases are over 40,000, and then
Fenway Park, so small (33,871) that tickets were never put up for
public sale. After granting first priority to Braves season-ticket
holders (26,000) and 10,000-plus going to Major League Baseball's
disposal, 50,062-seat Turner Field offers a larger share of tickets
to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think with that ticket base, you'd have some kind of
public availability,'' said MLB public relations manager Pat
Courtney.
</P>
<P>
   The experience won't come cheaply. Tickets at Fenway this week
went for $150 for box seats, $100 for reserves and $75 for the
grandstand. Those prices are expected to hold for 2000. Braves
season-ticket holders will receive All-Star ticket information with
next year's order forms, with public sale expected in April.

 &HT;    American league bests National 4-1
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They played one from the heart Tuesday night. The
American League beat the Nationals again, 4-1 in the 70th All-Star
Game, winning for the third consecutive year and the ninth time in
the past 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Fenway Park, Ted Williams, Pedro Martinez and one of the
longest collective baseball memories in any league made the game
more than it set out to be. Cleveland's Jim Thome and Baltimore's
Cal Ripken each scored and drove in runs but 44,187 went home
remembering a night more than a score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a few (All-Star Games) but what happened with
Boston?'' asked Martinez, who set a record by striking out the side
in the first. ``What's here? Do the people eat baseball and drink
baseball? It's unbelievable. I don't really have the words to
explain how good it feels to just be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The night opened on an emotional edge, starting with a pre-game
ceremony involving 31 members of the select 100 greatest players
walking in from center field and surrounding the infield. Ted
Williams, still the emotional mayor of Boston, road a cart to the
mound, threw out of the first pitch to Red Sox great Carlton Fisk
and no one wanted to leave the field. The game started more than 20
minutes late while players from both sides mobbed Williams at the
mound while the Splendid Splinter dabbhis eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He left the field waving his cap to a heart-felt ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that,'' said Williams, slowed by the effects of a 1991
stroke. ``Hell, I haven't had a base hit in 30 years and I'm a
better hitter now than I've ever been in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the game after three innings, Colorado right
fielder tore up a piece of turf to bring back to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the grounds crew doesn't get too made, because I tore
this piece of grass out of right field. I'm taking it home and I'm
going to have it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Kevin Millwood worked a scoreless sixth. After
allowing a single to Baltimore's ageless Harold Baines, he put the
side down in order on a fielder's choice from Brad Ausmus, a
grounder back to the mound by Jose Offerman and a strike out
against Bernie Williams, whiffing on a full-count changeup.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Brian Jordan, entering the game in the fifth as a
center fielder, walked off Texas's Jeff Zimmerman in his first
plate appearance in the seventh but was thrown out by Detroit's
Brad Ausmus attempting to steal second two pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   Down 4-1 after four, twice the National League had excellent
chances early on but left five men on in the fourth and fifth
innings. Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz rolled out to first with the
bases loaded to end the fourth and when two men reached scoring
position in the fifth, Baltimore's Mike Mussina struck out Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire back-to-back, McGwire going down swinging on
three straight pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield, the NL's leading game-winner with 14, made a
mess of the fourth inning, walking Jim Thome and then hitting Cal
Ripken before Rafael Palmeiro's RBI single pumped the lead to 3-1.
The inning might have ended when Roberto Alomar sent a potential
double play-ball to third but Matt Williams failed with a backhand
stab, the error bringing in Ripken for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz, an unlikely starter for the injured Tony Gwynn, made
the NL's first offensive impact, looping a soft double over first
base off New York's David Cone in the third. Barry Larkin, with
just one hit in 11 All-Star at-bats covering nine games, singled up
the middle with two outs to bring in Burnitz to close it to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever criticism the Cleveland organization received for
ballot box-stuffing, the Indians immediately began deflecting in
the first inning. Kenny Lofton, the first of four Indian starters,
beat Curt Schilling to first on a grounder to first baseman Mark
McGwire and then stole second three batters later, with teammate
Manny Ramirez at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Schilling missed with a 3-2 fastball to walk Ramirez,
Cleveland's Jim Thome sent a two-out single up the middle to bring
around Lofton for a 1-0 lead. Schilling next yielded an RBI single
to Cal Ripken to put the AL up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Pedro Martinez, with the Fenway crowd roaring
with every strike, became the first pitcher in All-Star history to
strike out the side in the first inning. Lead-off hitter Larkin
went down swinging at a fastball, Larry Walker took a called third
strike on a changeup and Sammy Sosa appeared outmatched by
Martinez's fastball in a third swinging strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez followed up with by fanning Mark McGwire to open the
second and, after Matt Williams reached on second baseman Roberto
Alomar's error, Martinez gunned down Jeff Bagwell before Williams
was out attempting to steal in an inning-ending double play. His
five strikeout performance tied the AL All-Star record.
