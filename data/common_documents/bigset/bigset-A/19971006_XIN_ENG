<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan to Reopen Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan have agreed
to hold talks in Tokyo on Wednesday for a revision of a bilateral
fishery agreement, a Foreign Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was made last Saturday at a meeting between
Ryu Kwang-sok, director-general for Asian and Pacific affairs of
the ministry, and his Japanese counterpart Koreshige Anami.
</P>
<P>
The two also hoped to conclude the fishery talks as soon as
possible, said the official.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Japan failed to narrow difference over the
revision of the 1965 bilateral fisheries accord at the
mid-September meeting in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The bottleneck of the negotiations is the issues related to the
Tokto islets (Takeshima islets in Japanese), on which Japan
proposed joint management of the seas around the islets but South
Korea said it was unacceptable.

<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian State Supreme
Security Court today sentenced three Islamic militants to ten
years in prison, and the fourth to a 3-year prison term, the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The four were accused of association with the out-lawed Islamic
Group in Aswan, about 900 kilometers south of Cairo, according to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
They were also convicted of murder and illegal possession of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
The court said the four convicts had "systematically adopted
the terrorist tactics of murder, bloodshed and sectarian sedition
as a means to disrupt security and stability in the country with
the purpose of overthrowing the existing ruling regime."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Group, the largest militant fundamentalist group in
Egypt, is fighting a violent war against the government to install
a rigid Islamic rule. A total of 1,244 people have been killed
since the campaign began in March 1992.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Defense Minister Vardiko
Nadibaidze today said the large-scale military exercises now being
performed by the Georgian army do not threaten Abkhazia's
security, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference in Tbilisi, capital
of Georgia, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
All of Georgia's 40,000 armed forces were raised to full alert
at the initial stage of the exercises, while more than 10,000
servicemen moved to the Senaki district in Western Georgia, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The exercises authorized by President Eduard Shevardnadz
started at the beginning of the week and involve all of Georgia's
arms-bearing government organs, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers and Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia had
protested against the military exercises which are held in the
direct vicinity of the neutral zone with Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed disagreement with the protest saying
that the only training ground where Georgia can hold exercises of
this scope is located near Senaki and the exercises do not border
on the neutral zone.

<HEADLINE> Ill-Health Causes Low Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Prevalence of ill-health among
workers and growing insecurity of employment have been identified
as factors undermining productivity in the southern African
region.
</P>
<P>
In a report on productivity in the southern African region
issued here today, noted economist of Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions Godfrey Kanyenze said ill health among working people had
reached unacceptable high levels.
</P>
<P>
"The unacceptable levels of ill health among working people
due to poor working and living conditions should be recognized as
undermining productivity," said Kanyenze.
</P>
<P>
He said human resource was critical to any country's
development and should be prioritized.
</P>
<P>
Some people have blamed the raging HIV/AIDS scourge on the
high rate of absenteeism in most work places.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10 percent of Zimbabwe's population is said to be
carriers of the aids-causing HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, given the growing recognition that insecurity of
employment undermines productivity, enhancement of employment
security should be recognized as a contributor to productivity
gains," said the economist.
</P>
<P>
He said the education system in southern Africa should be
responsive to the needs of individual economies.
</P>
<P>
"Adult literacy should be part and parcel of a human resource
development strategy,'' said Kanyenze.

<HEADLINE> UK to Tighten Controls After Nuclear Sub Parts Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MoD) has pledged to tighten up its procedures after some
components ordered for the country's Trident nuclear submarine
have gone missing.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of key parts for Britain's 12 billion pound (about 19
billion US dollar) Trident nuclear submarine have vanished on its
way to Britain, according to a report in today's Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the lost parts, which did not contain any
nuclear material, left the manufacturers in the United States and
went missing when the consignments reached the Trident base in
Faslane, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, a spokesman of the MoD said that it
does not know where the components have gone, but it does not
think fraud or terrorism are involved.
</P>
<P>
"The Trident system deals with around 70,000 receipts a year.
These losses represent less than 0.1 percent of the total," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "Since our investigation, we have tightened up our
procedures when ordering our vast amount of equipment."

ISLAMABAD, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A program for the development
of small and medium towns will be included in the 9th Five Year
Plan (1998-2003) of Pakistan, which is under preparation, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of the World Habitat Day, which
is being observed on October 6, Minister of State for Environment
and Local Government Makhdoom Syed Ahmed Mahmood said that
Pakistan faces many challenges of urbanization.
</P>
<P>
These challenges included provision of shelter and services for
the inhabitants of its cities, towns and villages, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the quality of urban environment and productivity
was not satisfactory in Pakistan, but the government was
determined to bring about a perceptible change in this area.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's World Habitat Day is "Future Cities".
The minister said that it offers urban residents around the global
an opportunity to reflect on the problems and challenges facing
their own cities.
</P>
<P>
It is also an opportunity for people living in cities to
reflect on how these problems can be overcome to make their cities
cleaner and sustainable, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Violence Resumes in South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed in
four separate attacks overnight when violence resumed in the
Richmond area of the Kwazulu-Natal province, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Richmond area had seen frequent clashes between supporters
of the African National Congress (ANC) and the Zulu-based Inkatha
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of violence came at a time when peace seemed to
be returning to the area after months of turmoil, said South
African National Defense Force spokesman in the area Frans
Schreuder.
</P>
<P>
He said a report of the first attack was received at about 9
p.m. (1900 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
When security forces arrived on the scene they found one dead
body and rounds of spent cartridges. Five men were arrested and
questioned about the attack.
</P>
<P>
"While we were still busy questioning them, more reports came
in of shots being fired. We went to investigate and found five
more bodies in different areas in the Richmond area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cartridges from AK47s and R4 rifles and 9-mm-caliber pistols
were found on the various scenes of shootings.
</P>
<P>
Schreuder was unable to say whether the incidents were linked,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to say. They could all be linked to one group
of attackers or there could be several. We will have to
investigate further," Schreuder was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It has not yet been officially confirmed but Shreuder's
initial reports indicate that victims of the incidents were all
local ANC supporters, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The Richmond area saw large-scale violence earlier this year
until the arrest of former ANC strongman Sifiso Nkanbinde on 18
charges of murder. The arrest without bail of the powerful leader
and other suspects in the Richmond area led to a period of
relative peace.

<HEADLINE> Iran Concerned Over US Aircraft Carrier's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed its grave
concern over the deployment of USS Nimitz aircraft carrier in the
Persian Gulf, terming the U.S. naval fleet as a threat to regional
security, according to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Navy Commander Admiral Abbas Mohtaj was quoted as saying the
presence of foreign powers, mainly the United States, in the
region is illegitimate and threatens the security of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival of tens of U.S. warships in the sensitive region
of the Persian Gulf is regarded as a major cause of tension and
insecurity at this part of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of alien forces is aimed at heightening tension
and selling millions of U.S. dollars worth of arms to the Arab
countries in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi noted that the growing friendly atmosphere between Iran
and the regional states has made the redeployment of the
U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf seen as an act in desperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the dispatch of the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the
Persian Gulf is an attempt to misportray the Persian Gulf as
trouble spot.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are dissatisfied with the growing confidence and
friendship between Iran and its neighboring Muslim states in the
region and see the current atmosphere as harmful to their
illegitimate interests in the Persian Gulf," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran believes in strengthening relations
and friendship with its neighboring states and that the peace and
stability in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf is directly
linked with the interests of all states in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States said Friday that it dispatched the aircraft
carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf in the wake of Iranian
incursions into a U.S. -enforced "no-fly zone" in Southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iranian warplanes bombed camps of Iranian opposition group
Mujahedeen Khalq (people's holy warriors) organization in southern
Iraq on September 29.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces deployed in the region currently include five
Tomahawk-capable destroyers, three frigates and two
minesweepers. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in the Gulf country of
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The battle group on route to the Persian Gulf comprises the
aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, with about 80 tactical aircrafts on
board, along with two cruisers, one destroyer, one frigate, an
attack submarine and support ship.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Israeli Knesset
(parliament) members have requested a parliamentary debate on the
attack of Hamas leader in Amman last week, Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The 30 Knesset members, most of them from the opposition, have
signed today the request for convening a Knesset special session
next Monday to discuss the alleged Israeli involvement in the
attack of Hamas leader Khaled Masham in Amman, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Mashal was attacked on September 25 in Amman by two "tourists"
holding forged Canadian passports. So far there is no confirmation
on who should be responsible for this attack, but there are strong
implications that the Israeli security service "Mossad" was behind
the attack.
</P>
<P>
After today's cabinet meeting, the Israeli government said in
a statement that right now it refrains from commenting on
this attack.
</P>
<P>
This means that the Israeli government has at last admitted
its responsibility for the attack, Israeli state TV Channel 1 said
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, former Prime Minister and Knesset member from
the opposition Labor Party, today criticized the Benjamin
Netanyahu government's involvement in the attack, saying such
action could only harm Israel's friendly ties with Jordan and
cause political unstability in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties today also asked Netanyahu to resign to
shoulder the entire responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the use of its passports by foreign agents to
be unacceptable, Canada has already recalled its ambassador to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry today expressed its regret again over
Canada's decision, hoping the friendly relations between the two
countries should not be damaged by this incident.

MOSCOW, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The Progress M-36 cargo ship was
successfully launched by a Soyuz-U rocket-booster from the
Baikonur space center today at 19:08 Moscow time, according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>

Spectrum module, which became depressurized after a collision of
the Mir station and the Progress M-34 cargo ship on June 25, is
also on board the Progress M-36 cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the ship carries gifts of the Itar-Tass news
agency -- T-shirts with the Itar-Tass emblem and a letter. The
ship is expected to be docked to Mir on October 7 in an automatic
regime. The day before the docking the M-35 cargo ship will

<HEADLINE> Palestinian: Success of Negotiations Hinges on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 5 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations, Palestine's delegate to the Arab League Mohamed
Sobeih said today the United States holds the key to the success
of the renewed talks.
</P>
<P>
Holding Washington responsible for the second round of talks
which will start tomorrow, Sobeih said that the outcome depends
basically on the U.S. pressure on Israel to settle outstanding
problems pertaining to security and settlement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross reportedly will hold talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat tomorrow and with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the preparation of trilateral
meeting between Palestinian chief negotiator Abu Mazen, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Ross.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih, quoted by Egyptian Middle East News Agency, specified
two main conditions that will make Ross' mission in the region
successful.
</P>
<P>
First, the U.S. administration should be decisive with Israel
as regards implementing international resolutions and the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements signed. It should also maintain the
credibility as a witness to the signed agreements, Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Israeli leadership should be serious in realizing
peace and ending the "series of violence and war against Arabs in
Palestine and attempts to export terrorism abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih said Arafat held contacts with the U.S. officials a few
days ago and was assured that Washington's stance is unchanged
regarding the settlement issue which obstructs peace."
</P>
<P>
On September 29, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
after meeting with Mazen and Levy, announced in New York that the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiation will resume on October 6 in
Jerusalem and in Ramallah, West Bank with the participation of
Ross. Then the negotiations will be shifted to the U.S. on October
13.
</P>
<P>
The main topics for the coming negotiations are the security
cooperation, the definition of the time-out of Jewish
settlements, Israeli troop redeployment and ways for final-status
talks.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Urges Slow Changes of Banking Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) Alan Greenspan pressed today for an overhaul of U.S.
federal banking laws but said that such change must be gradual to
protect the economy.
</P>
<P>
In remarks prepared for delivery at the annual convention of
the American Bankers Association in Boston, he called on "caution
and humility" in approaching banking reform.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of telecommunications and computer technology
has "lowered the costs, reduced the risks, and broadened the scope
of financial services," he said. "As a result, competitive
pressures in the financial services industry are probably greater
than ever before."
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan warned, "If we dramatically change the rules now
about banking and commerce... we may well end up doing more harm
than good." "And, as with all rule changes by government, we are
likely to find it impossible to correct our errors promptly, if at
all."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed chairman favors the dismantling of Depression Era
laws that bar banks from owning nonbanking corporations and
separate banking from insurance and stock underwriting.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. banking industry has long advocated such action so it
can better compete with other financial industries and with
foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Congress has been struggling with a sweeping measure
approved earlier this year by the House Banking Committee. The
measure would allow banks to merge not only with brokerages,
insurers and other financial firms but also with commercial
companies.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. banks already underwrite and deal in securities and
sell insurance and those with the resources and skill are
authorized to virtually match foreign bank competition abroad.

ADDIS ABABA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Association

The inability of physically handicapped people to move from

thereby worsening their problem, the association said.

<HEADLINE> France Considers US More Accommodating Over Total Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States wishes to choose
a "more quiet way" in settling its dispute with France over the 2
billion U.S. dollar deal signed last Sunday between the French oil
group Total and Iran, said a senior French official today.
</P>
<P>
French Delegate Minister for European Affairs Pierre Moscovici
said today in Luxembourg that European Union (EU) countries have
shown solidarity in the face of U.S. pressure over the Total deal.
</P>
<P>
The European commissioner in charge of trade relations, Leon
Brittan, today briefed officials of the 15 EU countries on the
on-going talks between Brussels and Washington on the U.S.
extra-territorial laws of the Helms-Burton Act and the D'Amato
Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the two acts, the United States bans all countries in the
world from dealing in large sums in the oil and hydrocarbon fields
with Iran and Libya, or having business with Cuba's state-owned
enterprises confiscated by the Cuban government from Cubans now
living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Brittan told us that the American position is above all
accommodating that there was an anxiety to smooth the
differences," said Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. daily Washington Post reported that the Clinton
administration has decided to hold off on sanctions against Total
to avert a trade war with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Rather than imposing sanctions on Total for signing a 2 billion
dollar contract to develop a natural gas field with Iran, the U.S.
government is seeking an agreement with the EU in which Washington
would scrap the threat of sanctions in exchange for increased
pressure on Iran to curb terrorism, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Blames Netanyahu for Peace Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today put the blame on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for failure to advance the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Mideast peace process had made great strides until the
Likud government of Netanyahu came to power and announced that it
could not endorse the results of the agreements that its
predecessor, the Labor government had reached with the
Palestinians," Mubarak told the Egyptian Armed Forces Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and the Palestinians could not accept such a thing
because it would mean that one of these days we would have to
accept their rejection of the peace treaty Israel signed with
Egypt," he said in an interview granted to the Arabic paper today
on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the 1973 October War
victory against Israel. The interview was carried by the
Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been blocked for six
months over the Jewish state's building of settlements in the
occupied Arab lands. But the two sides agreed last week in New
York to restart formal talks this month
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed that only a just peace will bring stability
to all nations in the region, while the establishment of Jewish
settlement and the imposition of a status quo will never realize
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
"The only guarantee for security is to sustain the negotiating
process and make progress on the road to peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reports on Egypt's growing military power and
its refusal to sign the chemical weapons non-proliferation
treaty, Mubarak said that Egypt will always be targeted because
of its central role.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed these claims as part of a political game of
exchanging pressure cards.
</P>
<P>
"These cards do not frighten me and we ourselves have our own
pressure cards that we can use when appropriate," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the late President Anwar Sadat,
Egyptian troops crossed the Suez Canal in October 1973 to recover
territory including the Sinai Peninsula lost in the "Six-Day War"
of June 1967 when Israel quickly defeated neighboring Arab states
including Egypt.
</P>
<P>
After 18 days of fighting, a cease-fire was arranged. In 1974
and 1975, the United States brokered disengagement agreements
between the two sides whereby Israel evacuated territory in Sinai
and Israeli and Egyptian forces were separated by a buffer zone
under the control of U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, the first
between an Arab country and the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Vocational Training Helpful to Employment: Eurostat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union hailed today
vocational training as the key to finding and keeping jobs by the
young in the European labor market.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg-based Eurostat, the statistics arm of the 15-nation
union, today published a joint report, the first ever
comprehensive collection of such information, from the union,
Eurostat and the European Center for the Development of Vocational
Training, which described education and vocational training as the
principal key to individual and collective development.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat figures showed that unemployment of 20- to
29-year-olds with additional vocational education and training is
less than half that of those with only basic education, or 11.5
percent compared with 23.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Surveys also found that 5.2 percent of those with only
compulsory education lost their jobs in 1995 whereas only 3.1
percent of those with additional vocational training lost theirs
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Almost one third of young Europeans between the ages of 15 and
19 are engaged in initial vocational training, according to the
joint report which aims at providing essential data in support of
the EU employment strategy.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, that is serving the six-month rotating presidency
of the 15-nation union, takes employment as a major issue to
tackle under its leadership.
</P>
<P>
European Union-wide, unemployment hovered at 10.5 percent for
quite some time while Germany, France, Italy and Spain all posted
double-digit unemployment.

<P>
"Hong Kong naturally has earned big rewards. Just as China
would not be where it is today without Hong Kong, so without the
opportunities offered by China, Hong Kong would not look like it
does," Worker said in his speech titled "a New Zealand View
Through the Window of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"For New Zealand, Hong Kong has emerged as a top rank export
market. Globally, it is our sixth largest export market," after
Australia, Japan, the United States, Britain and the Republic of
Korea, and just ahead of China's mainland and Taiwan region,
Worker said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is New Zealand's fourth largest market for
elaborately transformed manufactured products, incorporating high
amounts of New Zealand value-added.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sixth largest supplier of foreign direct investment,
our eighth largest source of overseas visitors and our third
largest contributor of new migrants since the mid-80s," Worker
noted.
</P>
<P>
The biggest community of New Zealanders in Asia is based here
in Hong Kong, about 4,000 people. The New Zealand-Hong Kong
Business Association has the largest active membership of any New
Zealand offshore business association.
</P>
<P>
"My country therefore has a lot at stake in Hong Kong and its
future success," Worker said, adding "It is important to us as a
very special part of China."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand believes that China soon will be one of the most
important economies in the world and Hong Kong will continue to be
a very important factor in the continuing strengthening of New
Zealand's business relationship with China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are enthusiastic and optimistic about Hong Kong's
opportunities, and about New Zealand's opportunities in and
through Hong Kong," he declared.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington to Hold Talks on Dumping Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said today it will
hold another round of talks with the United States over
Washington's anti-dumping duty on its color TVs and computer
memory chips.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said
they are ready to take the dispute to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) if the U.S. fails to revoke its tariffs in the talks in
Geneva on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to agree on the penalties at their
first meeting in August.
</P>
<P>
South Korea filed a complaint on August with the WTO's dispute
settlement body after the United States decided in July to
preserve anti-dumping sanctions against South Korea's 16-megabyte
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, which can enhance
computers' performance in running various programs.
</P>
<P>
Washington has imposed the penalties since 1993, accusing South
Korea of illegally lowering prices to expand market share in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said in July's ruling that the
penalties on South Korean computer chips must be kept because of
possible dumping by South Korean companies in the future -- a
decision that South Korea says has violated WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Computer memory chips are South Korea's key export items. South
Korea and Japan each provide 40 percent of the world's supply of
DRAM chips.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also has filed in July a similar complaint with
the WTO against U.S. anti-dumping duty on its color TVs.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials said their country has not dumped their
color TVs in the U.S. market since 1984 and even suspended their
shipments completely during the past seven years.

<P>
DAMASCUS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Zuhair
Masharqa has reaffirmed that Syria is seeking to achieve
a fair and overall peace based on the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid
agreement and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Masharqa made the remarks in an article published today by
Syrian newspaper Al-Baath, mouth peace of the ruling party, to
celebrate the 24th anniversary of the Arab-Israeli 1973 war.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Madrid conference was convened six years ago,
Israel has not been serious about the peace process," Masharqa
said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president underlined the necessity of Israel's
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories up to the June 4,
1967 boundaries.
</P>

He also called for restoring the usurped national rights and
providing peace and security for all parties in accordance with
the Madrid formula and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been insisting that the Syrian-Israeli peace
negotiations should resume from where they halted in May, 1996,
but the Israeli government has said that the negotiations should
start anew without any preconditions.

<HEADLINE> 10 War Crimes Suspects Surrender to UN Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ten Bosnian Croat war crimes
suspects today surrendered themselves to The Hague-based
International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for
trial.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, including the most wanted, Dario Kordic, have
arrived in the Netherlands after agreeing to hand themselves over
for trial to the U.N. war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to turn themselves in after the United Nations
tribunal guaranteed them a quick and fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Kordic was quoted as saying before leaving Croatia that the
group was departing "with a clear conscience before God and the
Croatian people in order to prove its innocence."
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said that the surrender of war crimes suspects was an important
step that demonstrated that the international community is
determined to see that justice and the rule of law prevail in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I renew my call to all the parties to implement fully their
obligations under the (Dayton) peace agreement and to extend their
complete cooperation to the ICTY in the investigation and
prosecution of war crimes," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
War crimes suspects have been a thorny issue for the NATO-led
multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR). Discussions were
underway whether and how to round up indicted war criminals for
trials so as to help establish a security environment in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
There are also indicted war criminals among Bosnian Serbs who
were blamed for most of the ethnic cleansing during the four-year
civil war in the former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> HK Staying the Course, U.S. Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is staying the
course in terms of remaining a free and open society during the
first 100 post-handover days, which sets a fine tune for the
future, visiting U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to say that, in speaking with Hong Kong's
leadership, it appears that Hong Kong is staying the course in
terms of remaining a free and open society," Daley told a luncheon
hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the
largest American chamber outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, we closely scrutinize the first 100 days
of any new administration. Many say that the first 100 days set
the tone for the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will mark its first 100 days since the handover later
this week, on October 8.
</P>
<P>
Daley is on his first official visit to the Island of Lights
and he will be traveling to Beijing for the 11th session of the
U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade which he
co-chairs with his Chinese counterpart, Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
He met with Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa,
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan and Secretary for Trade and
Industry Denise Yue this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I said (to them) it is of the utmost importance for our
bilateral relationship that Hong Kong continues to be Hong Kong.
It must remain a free and open society and a stable economy."
</P>
<P>
Daley summarized U.S. presence in the city, noting that some
1,100 U.S. businesses are represented here and more than 400 of
them maintain regional headquarters; more than 50,000 U.S.
citizens live here, a number that has doubled in five years; and
U.S. investment here continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. interests in Hong Kong have always been strong... We look
forward to Hong Kong's continued success as a Special
Administrative Region of China with a high degree of autonomy."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary spoke highly of Hong Kong's exemplary
anti-corruption record, saying the Independent Commission Against
Corruption is of world renown.
</P>
<P>
But concerns are there too, he noted. First is intellectual
property rights and second is export controls, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Strikes Pact With London Club on Soviet Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the London Club of
creditor banks signed an agreement here today on rescheduling the
debts inherited by Russia from the former Soviet Union, the
Interfax news service reported.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement allows Russia, which took on all
Soviet foreign debts after the disintegration of the former Soviet
Union in 1991, to pay off some 33 billion U.S. dollars within 25
years.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russia's Vneshekonombank, which has
represented Russia during marathon debt talks with the London Club
since December 1992, will issue interest-bearing bonds to be
issued on the Luxembourg stock exchange. The bonds will be
circulated both in and outside Russia.
</P>
<P>
On December 2, 1997, the creditors will be repaid for the first
time in five years when they obtain part of the owed interest
equivalent to more than 3 billion dollars, and receive bonds worth
the unpaid part of the interest, the report said.

<HEADLINE> France Raps "Suspension" of UNHCR Activities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- France today criticized the
"suspension" by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) of the activities by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) in the DRC as "a setback for human rights."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
France deplores the decision by Kinshasa to drive the staff out of
the UNHCR as well as its intention to pressure other humanitarian
organizations to leave the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the North Kivu region remains difficult and
confusing and knows still violent inter-ethnic confrontations. The
presence of humanitarian organizations contributes to alleviating
the sufferings of the civil population," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that the newest decision by Kinshasa took place after
the DRC authorities asked the U.N. to withdraw an investigation
team on the massacre of Hutu refugees in the eastern DRC.
</P>
<P>
DRC Interior Minister Mwenze Kongola said Sunday in Kinshasa
that his government decided to "suspend" the activities of the
UNHCR in the North and South Kivu regions of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He accused the UNHCR of "inciting Rwandan refugees who had
returned to their country to return" to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He also asked other humanitarian organizations "whose
activities are no longer useful" to quit the country.

KUWAIT CITY, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel arrived in Kuwait today for a two-day official visit aimed
at expanding economic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Demirel was greeted at the international airport by Kuwaiti
Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, acting Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and other
high-ranking Kuwaiti officials.
</P>
<P>
This was Demirel's second visit to Kuwait since 1991. His last
visit came in 1993 when he was Turkish prime minister.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Demirel is expected to hold talks with the
Kuwaiti Emir on further boosting the bilateral ties. The two
countries are expected to sign an agreement on the prevention of
double taxation and a cultural exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Turkey supported Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War which liberated
Kuwait from the seven-month Iraqi occupation and adopted a firm
position toward the Iraqi invasion. Since then the two countries
exchanged many official visits.
</P>
<P>
The two states signed a memorandum of understanding on
exchanging expertise in the agricultural field and setting up
joint agricultural ventures in 1993.
</P>
<P>
They have also been bound by an agreement for the promotion and
protection of investment since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries was 200 million
U.S. dollars in 1996 with Turkish exports to Kuwait standing at
130 million dollars and Kuwait exports to Turkey at 70 million
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The international shipping
conference, Maritime Cyprus 1997, opened here today with the
participation of more than 1,000 delegates from over 30
countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, acting President of the
Republic of Cyprus, House President Spyros Kyprianou said Cyprus
is an important shipping center and would continue to develop as
such through cooperation of state and private initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"The international standards which we wish to ensure for our
shipping will be further strengthened by the legal framework of
the European Union, of which Cyprus aspires to become a full
member soon," Kyprianou added.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Minister of Communications and works Leontios
Ierodiakonou also stressed at the meeting that the Cypriot
government is committed to enhancing the quality of ships flying
the Cyprus flag and is deeply concerned about safety and the
protection of environment.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that Turkey has unilaterally
introduced restrictive measures against Cyprus ships. "This is a
dangerous precedent and affects international trade and
transport", the minister warned.
</P>
<P>
He said that every effort should be made to persuade Turkey to
abandon this unacceptable behaviour.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines Decides to Increase Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua)-- Indian Airlines (IA) today
decided to increase its fares from October 15 to obtain additional
revenue to offset the rising input costs in various areas of
operations, an IA spokesman said here.
</P>
<P>
While the fare hike on short haul sectors up to 700 kilometers
will be 14 percent, the increase on long haul routes above 700
kilometers will be 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase fares was approved by the common Board
of Directors of IA and Air India (AI).
</P>
<P>
"The increase in fares is only to offset the increases in the
cost of operations during 1996-97 and most of the input costs were
beyond the control of the airlines," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the country's Railway Ministry
today decided not to raise passenger fares as reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
But the cost of coal freight will go up by 4 percent while
freight charges on food grains, pulses and sugar will jump by 5
percent following partial withdrawal of freight exemption on
certain essential commodities of mass consumption.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Opposition Insists on Resignation of Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's major opposition
party -- the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) --
today reiterated its call for resignation of the incumbent
government.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a press conference by Nambaryn Enhbayar,
chairman of the MPRP and the MPRP parliamentarian group in the
Great Hural (Mongolian parliament).
</P>
<P>
The MPRP parliamentarians had submitted a draft proposal to the
Great Hural on Saturday, urging the incumbent government led by
the Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU) to resign.
</P>
<P>
Enhbayar criticized the ruling MDU, which comprises the
Mongolian National Democratic Party and the Mongolian Social
Democratic Party, for implementing radical reform policies, which
led to the economic deterioration and the drop of people's living
standards.
</P>
<P>
He also denounced the allegedly rampant nepotism in the
appointment and removal of government officials.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are 50 MDU members and 25 MPRP members in the
76-member Great Hural. Under Mongolia's law, the Great Hural must
hold a special meeting to discuss resignation of government if it
is requested to do so by at least one fourth of the
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Enhbayar said that 23 MPRP parliamentarians had signed the
draft proposal of resignation of the government, except two
visiting abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, the Great Hural should discuss the proposal
within 14 days and put it to vote by secret ballot, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Then the incumbent government must be dismissed if the proposal
wins a simple majority votes, he added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls for Greenhouse Gas Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government today put
forth a proposal for industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by an average of 5 percent from 1990 level during the
year of 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow every industrial country to set its
own target on the basis of one of the three indexes -- greenhouse
gas emissions related to gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990,
per-capita gas emissions in 1990, and population growth between
1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
This would put Japan's target at about 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With this proposal as the basis for discussion, we will make
efforts to see a fair and attainable international agreement
early," a Japanese top government spokesman said, referring to the
United Nations (UN) conference on climate change to be hosted by
Japan in Kyoto from December 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls for the right for industrial nations to
trade emissions quotas with other countries under certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries will not be asked to undertake greenhouse
gas emissions cut obligation at the Kyoto Conference, but Japan is
ready to strengthen its financial and technology cooperation with
developing countries to help them make progress in the field, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gases, which include carbon dioxide, methane and
nitrous oxide, are blamed for global warming.
</P>
<P>
Japan will try to win approval for its proposal for the Kyoto
meeting at the next round of preparatory talks in Bonn beginning
October 22.

<HEADLINE> China Minister Sees Bright Future for Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister for Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi today presented a bright
picture of the future of China's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"China's trade volume is expected to reach 400 billion
U.S. dollars in the year 2000, which means the country will
provide the world with a market as big as 700 billion dollars in
the next four years," she said here in a keynote speech to the
opening ceremony of the 28th General Assembly of the World Trade
Centers Association, a non-governmental organization for the
promotion of world trade.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that during the 19 years following the
introduction of the reform and opening-up policy, China's foreign
trade has been expanding at an average 16.5 percent per annum,
higher than the annual economic growth which stands at roughly 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth in foreign trade is also eight percentage points
higher than the expansion of global trade as a whole, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has made great achievements in using foreign
investment and in other fields of economic cooperation, she said.
</P>
<P>
"But China, as a developing country with a huge population of
1.2 billion, still has an imbalanced economic development, with 58
million of its people living in poverty. Therefore it still has a
long way to go in its economic development."
</P>
<P>
"According to China's Ninth Five-Year Plan and an outline of
long-term objectives for 2010, China will maintain an economic
growth of 8-9 percent in the next few years and 7 percent in the
first decade of next century," she said.
</P>
<P>
China can not achieve development without the world and vice
versa, she said. China welcomes friends in other countries to
invest in it and participate in fair competition on Chinese market
and furthermore, it attaches great importance to economic and
technological cooperation with all other countries and regions in
the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China worked out a blueprint for the future development
of China, which will open even wider to the rest of the world, Wu
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's announcement just a few days ago to
further lower its tariff level to 17 percent, the minister said
that so far China has not only reduced its tariff by 60 percent
since 1993, but also made a commitment to the world to bring down
its tariff level to the average of developing countries by the end
of the century.
</P>
<P>
This fully demonstrates China's determination and confidence in
participating in international competition and cooperation, Wu
said, adding that China will adopt much more preferential policies
for high-tech equipment and advanced technology entering China.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Iran of Plotting Attack in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has accused Iran of sending
intelligence agents to carry out an attack on the office of World
Health Organization (WHO) in Baghdad, Iraqi News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
INA said in a report that interrogation of the arrested during
the attack revealed that the four assailants were sent by Iran's
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Four gunmen raided the WHO's headquarters here on Saturday
throwing grenades and firing bullets, destroying one vehicle and
damaging two others in the compound, said Eric Falt, a spokesman
of the WHO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the building occurred when there were no staffers,
without injuring a person, said Falt. The Iraqi army arrested one
of the gunmen, but the three others escaped, he added, quoted by
INA.
</P>
<P>
According to INA, the arrested attacker, belonging to an
Iranian community used to reside in Iraq, was deported in
1983. INA said he "infiltrated the Iraqi territory to serve the
Iranian intelligence purposes."
</P>
<P>
Interrogation is under way in order for him to "expose the aim
of this cowardly attack," INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq have been bitter enemies who fought an eight year
war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The WHO headquarters in Baghdad is responsible for distributing
food and medicine in northern and southern Iraq under the
oil-for-food program signed between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator in Baghdad, Denis Halliday,
condemned the attack which is the first ever at a U.N. building in
Iraq, said INA.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Iraqi government's responsibility to protect U.N.
personnel and property against any harm," said the Halliday,
demanding for a meeting with senior Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under harsh U.N. economic sanctions since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil every six months since
December 1996 to buy food and medicine Iraq urgently needs under
close U.N. supervision.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Biochemist Wins 1997 Nobel Medicine Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 6 (Xinhua)-- U.S. biochemist Stanley B.
Prusiner today was awarded the 1997 Nobel Medicine Prize for his
discovery of prion -- a disease-causing agent like bacteria or
viruses, said the Nobel Assembly at the Sweden's Karolinska
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The assembly said that Prusiner's discovery would help key
insights into dementia-related diseases and help the world
understand more about Alzheimer's and Mad Cow Disease.
</P>
<P>
"Prusiner's discovery provides important insights that may
furnish the basis to understand the biological mechanisms
underlying other types of dementia-related diseases, for example
Alzheimer's disease, and establishes a foundation for drug
development and new types of medical treatment strategies," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Prions exist normally as innocuous cellular proteins, however,
they possess an innate capacity to convert their structures into
highly stable conformations that ultimately result in the
formation of harmful particles, which can cause disease and death
of humans and animals. The assembly said Prusiner has solved the
riddle of the prison's prosperities.
</P>
<P>
Some prion diseases such as Mad Cow disease and Alzheimer's are
attaining general attention around the world.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Prusiner, born in 1942, is now professor of neurology,
of virology in residence and of biochemistry at the California
University in San Francisco. He began his research work in 1972
after one of his patients died of dementia resulting from
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Develops World's Fastest 4M SRAM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Electronics
Co. LTD. announced today its completion of developing an
asynchronous 4M "fast" SRAM (static random-access memory), which
operates more quickly than any other high-capacity SRAM available.
</P>
<P>
Produced through the complementary metal oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) processing, the new device can process data in just 10
nanoseconds (one nanosecond is one-billionth of a second), which
reduces manufacturing time and unit costs. As a result, price
competitive power is enhanced, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Conventional SRAMs operate on 10 milliamperes of standby
current, while the new Samsung "fast" SRAM requires only 1
milliampere, greatly reducing the possibility of power consumption.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other new functions like the Support Data
Retention Application can prevent noise generated on the circuit
periphery. Thus, fewer errors are made during data transmission -
generally caused by momentary drops in electrical signal voltage
due to noise.

China island province of Hainan, has kept the title of China's
cleanest city for seven years, thanks to its efforts in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the city environmental protection department said
that despite its burgeoning economy, the city authorities have
always attached the utmost importance to preserving a good
environment since the establishment of Hainan province in 1990,
which is also China's largest special economy zone.
</P>
<P>
Back in 1992 when the local economy, especially real estates,
was most brisk, the city authorities designated 71.3 ha of land
along the coast where the land price is the highest for the
building of a park.
</P>
<P>
Other parks were also built elsewhere in the city, while trees
have been planted along 136 streets and avenues with a total
length of 1,330 km. At present the city's vegetation has reached
39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Disposal of waste water is another thorny problem in keeping a
good environment. Haikou has started building a modern disposal
project with a capacity of treating 300,000 tons of waste water a
day. The overall cost of the project is estimated at 500 million
yuan (about 60 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven years, Haikou has spent a total of 1.2
billion yuan (about 144 million US dollars) in building
flood-control and drainage facilities, a sum 40 times that spent
during the 38 years before the establishment of Hainan province.
</P>
<P>
The city has also closed a number of inefficient and heavily
polluting plants, and spread the use of pipeline and liquified
gas, making the city virtually free of smog.

WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans seized on videotapes showing President Bill
Clinton greeting donors at coffees before the 1996 election as
evidence that Attorney General Janet Reno acted too hastily last
week when she cleared him of several allegations of campaign
finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
The White House has insisted that the coffees were not
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
-- The debate over what to do about global warming has shifted
to the question of how restricting emissions of heat-trapping
greenhouse gases might affect the economy. Climate change, in all
its complexity, will be under the spotlight today at a conference
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton will make the first extensive use of his
new line-item veto authority today by striking funding for 30 to
50 projects -- worth nearly 300 million U.S. dollars -- from a 9.2
billion dollars military construction bill that he signed last
week, White House officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
-- After 144 days away from his family and planet, astronaut
Michael Foale's return from Mir was delayed tonight because of
thick clouds that presented a safe landing by space shuttle
Atlantis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Calls for Support to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister for Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi today called on developed
countries to support developing countries with their development.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the
World Trade Centers Association (WTCA)'s 28th General Assembly
here today, Wu said that the international society, especially
developed countries, should carry out their duty to increase
technological and financial aid to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that developed countries should do their part to
create good external environments for the development of
developing countries and for resolving special difficulties,
especially poverty reduction, of the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that the WTCA plays a significant role in the field of
cooperation and development, and China pays much attention to the
function of the WTCA.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the WTCA and all its members will surely be
able to strengthen inter-relations in economic and trade exchange,
further promote common development and bring the sound cooperative
relationship into the 21st century," she said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the economic and trade relations between China's
interior and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Wu
reassured participants of the Assembly that economic and trade
exchanges between the two areas will remain in line with
international economic and trade regulations and practices.
</P>
<P>
She said the central government will continue to promote the
level of economic and trade exchanges between the two areas,
protect and consolidate the SAR's status as an international
financial, trade, shipping and information center.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Magnificent Glacier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A new glacier, which sits at the
southernmost latitude of any glacier is China, was recently
discovered in southwest China's Yunnan Province at an elevation of
only 2,700 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The glacier is located in Deqen County at 28 degrees north
latitude.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the Mingyoungqia Glacier, which stretches some
eight km. and is 30 meters thick, has been formed by ice and snow
avalanches from the snow-capped Meili Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The face of the glacier tongues extends to some 2,600 meters
above sea level, with sun refraction adding a greenish cast to ice
channels and small blocks dotting the sparkling crystal clear ice
mass.
</P>
<P>
Primeval forests line both sides of the glacier, and walnut and
fruit trees grow within 200 meters of the ice. Local farmers also
note that cabbages, cucumbers, onions and various other vegetables
can easily be grown in the area.
</P>
<P>
The scenery around the glacier reminds people of "Shangri-la"
American author James Hilton described in his work entitled "Lost
Horizon". Kagbo Peak, the highest peak on Meili Mountain,
resembled the pyramidal mentioned in Hilton's novel.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 villagers living near the glacier live in virtual
isolation surrounded by the mountains and the Lancang River. The
villagers lead a life far from the turmoil of the world.
</P>
<P>
Another aspect similar to Hilton's novel rests with the fact
that numerous air crashes have been reported in the vicinity of
the glacier.
</P>
<P>
The brick and tile ruins of a church, reportedly built some 600
years ago by a British missionary, are found in close proximity to
the glacier, and tiles can still be found.
</P>
<P>
The glacier is rapidly becoming a new tourist attraction
despite the lack of highway access. Visitors ride horses to the
nearby village where they can enjoy Tibetan food.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ice Mortars Discovered in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nine "stone cauldrons"
in Fengning county in north China's Hebei
province have turned out to be rare ice mortars formed more than
one million years ago.
</P>
<P>
They were formed by melting water at the bottom of a glacier,
which swirls and carries stone, abrading the granite structure
to form a spiral-shaped pit, or ice mortar.
</P>
<P>
These ice mortars were discovered in early August by three
professors from the
Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences on Mount Lhama in Fengning
county, who said this is strong evidence of the existance of
glaciers perhaps as big as the ice sheet of Antarctica or
Greenland.
</P>
<P>
Other ice mortars in the world are thought to have been formed
at a much later period. Ordinary ice mortars are generally found
at the foot of a mountain, but the Fengning mortars were on a
ridge. They are 1 to 3 meters in diameter and 0.3 to 1.5 meters
deep. Some scientists think they may be the first mortars in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is important for research on global climates,
environmental evolution, and climatic variation, as well as for
the study of the origin of human beings and other sciences.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Formulate Malaria Control Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government
decided to formulate a national malaria control policy, reported
local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The policy will ensure availability of adequate resources to
all government facilities, the paper said, adding that it will
also enable proper management of people with malaria.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the policy, the public will be
educated on preventive measures, which include recognizing
malaria, treating it and raising awareness about dangerous
practices of self medication and failure to comply with
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The policy, the paper said, will stress district based
activities to allow malaria control to be integrated into primary
health care within the framework of the decentralization of
health services.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is still the number one killer disease in most
districts in Uganda. It is responsible for 25 percent of
out-patient visits, 14 percent of hospital in-patient deaths and 20
percent of hospital admission in government facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Ministry of Health spends over 27 million U.S.
Dollars annually for treatment of sanitation-related diseases
including malaria.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the situation of prevalence of malaria has
worsened due to the collapse of health and other social services
to handle it.
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement of malaria cases both by the patients themselves
and by the health care providers has also led to drug resistance.

governor of a US state and welcoming him on his first China tour

China and has a very good basis for bilateral economic and trade
contacts and mutual friendship.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Rejects Japan's Greenhouse Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia found itself more
isolated internationally today as Prime Minister John Howard
rejected Japan's proposed greenhouse gas emission plan.
</P>
<P>
Australia would not sign an international climate change treaty
which was unfair and failed to take into account the country's
reliance on fossil fuels, Howard said tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers in
Melbourne, Howard rejected Japan's proposal for industrialized
countries to cut by 5 percent by 2012 the 1990 levels of
greenhouse gas emissions, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, unveiled in Tokyo today, is well below the
European Union's push for a blanket 15-percent cut in emissions
from the 1990 levels by 2010 for developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who has been lobbying heavily for support for
Australia's position from his counterparts of the United States
and Japan during the past several months, admitted that Australia
faces a tough task selling its plan for greenhouse gas emission
targets, which would be settled at a major climate change summit
in Japan in December.
</P>
<P>
The United States has yet to announce its greenhouse reduction
plan.
</P>
<P>
Howard's comments were also echoed today by Environment
Minister Robert Hill, who remains cautiously optimistic that
Australia would continue to negotiate to achieve a "good outcome."
</P>
<P>
Australia has argued that the outcome should include developing
countries and that targets should take into account each country's
different economic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"If it was a figure that would simply result in tens of
thousands, or perhaps by some of the figures hundreds of thousands
of job losses to Australia, then we obviously wouldn't be party to
such an agreement," Hill said on a national radio today.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Japanese proposal would force Australia to
reduce its emissions by 2 to 3 percent from the 1990 levels, which
he said "would have a devastating effect on the Australian
economy."

<HEADLINE> Israel-Jordan Ties Suffer Damages: Ex-ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The botched attack in Jordan
on a Hamas leader by suspected Israeli secret agents has dealt a
serious blow to Israeli-Jordanian relations, said Shimon Shamir,
former Israeli ambassador to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jerusalem Post newspaper, Shamir said the
failed operation would expose Jordanian government to accusations
from opponents and restrict it from cooperating with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, two suspected agents of Israel's intelligence
service Mossad carrying forged Canadian passports, attacked Hamas
leader Khalid Mashiel and injected a toxic substance into his
left ear in Amman. The assailants were detained by Jordanian
police.
</P>
<P>
Shamir blamed the bad timing of the incident as Jordan's
parliamentary elections are only one month away and "the
Jordanian government is now in a serious situation of competition
with the Islamist opposition."
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest domestic issue at the moment," said
Shamir, who is considered a leading expert on Middle East affairs
in general and Jordanian-Israeli relations in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Islamists are "mounting a great challenge to the
legitimacy of the parliament and Jordan's political system," and
they "would have used the matter to undermine the peace accord by
accusing Israel of continuing to act in a high-handed manner in
Jordan itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The damage would have been enormous," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
To minimize the fallout and help repair the damage to
Israeli-Jordanian relations, Shamir said "what should be done now
within the parameters of the Israeli domestic political system is
that first the Israeli policy must demonstrate that when it makes
a mistake it has a machinery for correcting it."
</P>
<P>
"The first action should be to establish who is responsible
and draw the necessary conclusions from that. This would show
the outside world that we are human and make mistakes and may
misunderstand things, but we have a mechanism to repair it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Once we have demonstrated that, we should start the long and
difficult work of damage control and rebuilding confidence," he
said. "This cannot be achieved in one day and I'm afraid will be
long process," he added.

<HEADLINE> Veld Fire Destroys Grazing Land, Kills Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 hectares
of grazing land and hundreds of head of livestock have been
destroyed by a four-day veld fire which spread to 16 farms in the
Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association reported today that the
fire, believed to have been started by lightning on Thursday, was
still burning in some areas on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Local police and the army set up a joint operations command to
help fight the flames.
</P>
<P>
The fire had caused considerable damage to domestic stock and
the environment, a local police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Police Senior Superintendent Dries Trollip, who was monitoring
the situation, said about 150 sheep had been killed in the
Cradock area alone.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers slept in the bush, afraid that the fire, which
was spreading rapidly by strong winds, might spread to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Roland Kroon, chairman of a farmers' association, said the
fire, if uncurbed, may bring about big trouble for the local
farmers, most of whom are wool farmers.

<HEADLINE> China Construction Bank Expands Settlement Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank has
seen its settlement business forge ahead rapidly as a result of
the nationwide electronic hook-up of its settlement systems a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The bank has transferred more than three trillion yuan-worth of
money through its electronic settlement system among its more than
8,000 branch banks and representative offices nationwide between
October 1996 and last September. This translates into a daily
average of more than 13 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
It also became the 57th settlement bank for the International
Air Transportation Association (IATA), with more than 126 of its
branch banks conducting settlement for the association and
involving a total of 40 international airlines from more than 20
countries. Its settlement volume for the association reaches
billions of yuan a day.
</P>
<P>
The bank also won the bid to become the settlement bank of the
China Commodities Trading Center last May, which experts said was
a big step forward for the bank's settlement business.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank has also conducted settlement deals
for numerous large enterprise groups and some securities
companies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Not to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today that he is not stepping down as prime
minister amid what he says is a definite attempt by the foreign
media and fund managers to "get rid" of him.
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely an attempt by certain foreign media and
fund managers to get rid of me," he told reporters upon his return
from a 12-day tour of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the foreign media were being controlled by
people with vested interest, adding that the rumors of his
resignation were cooked up and he believed that the rumors would
persist because this was the aim of the currency traders.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir denied that his statements against currency
manipulators had caused Malaysia's ringgit to fall further.
</P>
<P>
He said that other countries, whose leaders did not say
anything, also saw their currencies fall even further.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia alone did not suffer from the currency and
stock market crisis but its ASEAN counterparts such as Indonesia,
the Philippines and Thailand, were also severely affected.
</P>
<P>
Following speculative attacks against ASEAN currencies starting
with the Thai baht, three other currencies -- the ringgit,
Indonesia's rupiah and the Philippines' peso -- also depreciated
significantly against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
There were foreign elements out to destroy Malaysia's economy
as well as that of the ASEAN region, he said, adding foreign
elements were jealous of ASEAN's dynamic economic growth which was
why they were probably be "full of glee" now that these economies
were going through crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no justification for these economies to
be attacked when other countries were in far worse economic
situations.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that such manipulative attacks "are not a passing
thing. It is a serious thing."
</P>
<P>
On allegations that his statements had pressured the ringgit
further down, he said that in the first place when the currency
crisis broke out, he abstained from saying anything, but then, the
ringgit kept on falling due to the continued manipulative attacks,
that was why he had to speak up.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit depreciated about 34 percent in the past two
months. The local unit closed today at 3.3650/50 against the U.S.
dollar in comparison with 2.5200 in early July.
</P>
<P>
Giving an assurance that the current economic problems facing
Malaysia will be overcome, Mahathir called on Malaysians to pull
themselves together to come out of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ways and means would be devised to tackle the current
weaknesses in the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that it was ironic that while Malaysia's
fundamentals were good such as its low inflation rate, its
currency was battered while currencies of other countries, whose
fundamentals were weak and inflation rates were over a thousand
percent, did not depreciate at all.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir welcomed Japan's pledge to help ASEAN countries tackle
current account deficit woes.
</P>
<P>
Japan has offered measures to raise its imports from ASEAN
countries by ensuring the region's trade transactions with
Japanese firms.
</P>
<P>
Japan is expected to provide details of its pledge to help
ASEAN at the forthcoming ASEAN Economic Ministers' Meeting (AEM)
to be held here next week.
</P>
<P>
During his Latin America tour, Mahathir, accompanied by an
official delegation including Works Minister S. Samy Vellu and a
high-powered business group, visited Cuba, Chile, Uruguay and
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The tour has been described as "successful".

<HEADLINE> Entry of Jeep Cherokee Stiffens Car Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The recent launch in Kenya of
Jeep Cherokee has stiffened competition in an already tight car
market, The East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The four-wheel-drive jeep manufactured by the Chrysler
Corporation entered the Kenyan market with an aim to squzee into
a narrow but growing niche at the top end of the market, the weekly paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the luxury vehicle in Kenya signals a
significant interests in the East Africa market by the third
largest American auto-maker. Prior to Chryler, another two U.S.
motor manufacturers
General Motors and Ford re-entered the east African nation early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures from the Kenya motor industry indicate a
growing demand for luxury four-wheel-drive cars, increasing from
510 assorted models in 1994 to 837 up to August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Leading sales in August were: Land Rover Discovery (238
units), Isuzu Trooper (80 units), Mitsubishi Pajero (52 units),
range Rover (18 units) and Nissan Patrol (10 units).
</P>
<P>
More than 100 units of Jeep Cherokee were imported for the
trial runs in mid-September and 20 had already been sold, the
paper said, adding that Chrysler had planned to open a
full-fledged franchise in Kenya next year after the present sales
trials.
</P>
<P>
The new jeep, marketed internationally as the king of the off
road, will be followed by the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep
Wrangler models.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a sales manager as predicting that
established dealers would have an edge in the sales battle owing
to their countrywide service network.
</P>
<P>
The manager pointed out that "a buyer mainly goes for a model
that can be serviced at his convenience in any part of the
country without having to come back to Nairobi."
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 3,659 car units have been sold this year
with luxury four-wheelers representing 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK Remains Good Place for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is still a good
place to do business after the handover while its status as a
global trading center is becoming even more important thanks to
its increasing economic integration with China's interior, a
local business organization said today.
</P>
<P>
Active members from the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce
briefed representatives attending the 28th World Trade Centers
Association's General Assembly here on the latest development of
Hong Kong's trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
"People in Hong Kong have confidence in the future," Paul
Cheng, former chairman of the chamber, said. "We have all freedom
we want" after July 1.
</P>
<P>
He reassured the international audience that on establishing
regional headquarters, Hong Kong beats Tokyo and Singapore, her
two closest competitors in the Asia-Pacific region, thanks to her
rule of law, fine infrastructure, level playing field and language
capacity.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that foreign investors interested in entering
China's interior work through Hong Kong companies as local
companies have abundant experience in doing business in the
interior.
</P>
<P>
His points of view were echoed by Denis Lee, managing director
of Kingscore Industrial Ltd., a small business, and Ms Lily
Chiang, executive director of Chen Hsong Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will continue to be a good place to invest or do
business," Lee said. By establishing offices in Hong Kong,
overseas company will also be well placed to tap the vast market
of China's interior, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's interior has become a highly influential factor in Hong
Kong's economic growth, Lee noted. Now the Chinese interior is the
largest trading partner of Hong Kong while Hong Kong is the
largest external investor in China's interior, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For three months till now as a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China, it is business as usual for Hong Kong," he told
the international trading and commerce sector.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's forecast for growth of 1997 and through to 2000
is between 5-6 percent, suggesting the economy is moving smoothly
through the transition period and into the new decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lily Chiang, in her speech focusing on local manufacturing
sector, described the relationship between China's interior and
Hong Kong as a "lip and teeth" one.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, Hong Kong entrepreneurs have been
relocating their business in South China and even northern parts
of the interior, taking advantage of lower land and labor costs
there, she said.
</P>
<P>
Chiang forecast the next century to be "a century of China",
and stated that Hong Kong is a window of China and its importance
to China is unquestionable.
</P>
<P>
With a more proactive approach of the SAR government in
industrial development as well as the expected benefit from the
economic integration between China's interior and Hong Kong, the
golden opportunity of doing business in Hong Kong has been
upgraded to the diamond opportunity.
</P>
<P>
For those who have yet to enter the market of the Chinese
interior, the young entrepreneur gave her advice that Hong Kong be
 used as a springboard.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Official Outlines Achievements of government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Administrative Secretary
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Anson Chan,
today outlined major achievements of the local government in the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
She also praised the work of all the government staff in the
transition period and stressed that efforts made by the government
had provided conditions for the smooth return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here this afternoon, Chan briefed
reporters on her "Progress Report," or named "The 1997 Policy
Address," which details achievements of outstanding undertakings
made by the government's 19 departments.
</P>
<P>
The 263-page report was issued and became available to the
public immediately after the news conference.
</P>
<P>
"In the past year, we have worked on a total of 830 pledges,"
Chan said. "The government is well on target in meeting 783 of
these commitments, or 94 percent of the total."
</P>
<P>
According to her:
</P>
<P>
-- The government has already completed in full the
implementation of 363 commitments;
</P>
<P>
-- It continues to honor 137 commitments which are ongoing,
achieving substantial progress in areas such as social welfare,
health, education, housing and protection of the environment;
</P>
<P>
-- It is on schedule in implementing further 248 commitments;
</P>
<P>
-- It is actively reviewing 17 commitments where the programs
may have to be adjusted to take account of the changing needs of
the community, the need for further discussion with the
legislature, the need to take account of public consultation or
because of revisions to past policies.
</P>
<P>
However, "we have encountered some slippage but expect to meet
our overall targets on 18 commitments," and "there are also 47
undertakings, or 6 percent of the total, we are behind schedule,"
she noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our report identifies clearly those undertakings which are
behind schedule and explains the reasons for the shortfalls or
delays," Chan said. "We will take all possible measures to catch
up with the original targets."
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that the SAR government is "an open and
accountable government," noting that it will set out its
objectives and programs and report on their progress annually
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, Tung Chee Hwa, will
deliver his inaugural policy speech Wednesday, in which he is
expected to announce tasks and priorities for the SAR government
in the following year, Chan told reporters.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and the United
States agreed here today to closer cooperation on strategic
commodities trade controls, the American Consulate General
announced.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley and Hong Kong

Denise Yue held discussions this morning, according to a press
release from the consulate general.
</P>
<P>
A Minute of Discussions reaffirms the U.S. supportive policy
with Hong Kong on trade in strategic commodities, which gives Hong
Kong broad access to U.S. goods and technologies, and provides for
regular meetings on strategic commodities trade controls.
</P>
<P>
It calls for broadened sharing of information on these controls
and related enforcement matters.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Daley said, "I am pleased with Hong Kong's efforts in
maintaining effective controls and continued cooperation on trade
in strategic commodities. This Minute of Discussions underscores
Hong Kong's commitment to maintain the integrity of its controls.
It supports our policy of continuing to give Hong Kong broad
access to U.S. goods and technology."

Welcoming the U.S. continued supportive policy toward Hong Kong
over trade in strategic commodities, Secretary Yue said, "It is in
Hong Kong's own economic and commercial interests to maintain
effective controls over trade in strategic commodities."

<P>
"Only by doing so can we ensure our free access to
sophisticated goods and technologies which are essential for Hong
Kong's economic development," she said.
</P>
<P>

standards of controls and enforce our laws fully. We look forward

<HEADLINE> Britain Lifts Ban on Nigerian Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom Civil Aviation
Authorities has unconditionally lifted the ban it has imposed on
Nigerian-registered aircrafts from flying into its airspace,
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Andy Stern, the General Manager of the British Airways, West
Africa, was quoted as saying in Lagos Sunday that British
Department of Transport informed the decision to the Nigerian
side some time ago, through a letter to the British High
Commission in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Air Commander Ita Udo-Imeh,
however, on September 25 denied of being aware of the decision,
adding that if there was such a development, his ministry would
be the first to break the news.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, officials of the British Airways
are daily making inquiries on the normalization of flights
between the countries.
</P>
<P>
"We await his (the minister's) response and remain keen to
start flying again with our traditional good value for money,
fares and high quality services," said Andy Stern.
</P>
<P>
The British ban on Nigerian airplanes, which was imposed on
May 15 for safety reasons, was immediately revenged by a similar
ban from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
But even before that, Nigeria's national carrier, the Nigeria
Airways has been banned from flying to London since February,
because of alleged frauds in its airplane insurance.

BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen met here this afternoon with Gary Locke,
Governor of the state of Washington of the US, and the first
Chinese-American governor of a US state.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he appreciated Locke's efforts to promote the Sino-US
relations and to enhance bilateral economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that as China has huge markets and the US has
advanced technology, both sides should continue to expand
bilateral economic and trade relations.

He said he believed Chinese President Jiang Zemin's upcoming
visit to the US later this month would certainly push bilateral
relations to a new level.
</P>

Increasing contacts between the people of the two countries is
conducive to the advancement of bilateral relations, Qian said,
adding he hoped that Chinese provinces and US states would forge
more direct and cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Locke said he is ready to continue to promote the US-China
relations, in particular the exchanges and cooperation between
Washington state and Chinese businesses.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Down Due to Labor Day Holiday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar was lower
late today, with trading quiet due to the Labor Day public holiday
in the country.
</P>
<P>
At close of trading, the Australian dollar was suspended at
72.77 U.S. cents, down from 72.86 U.S. cents locally late Friday.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank foreign exchange senior trader John Wheatley
said it had been a very quiet day for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The ANZ job ads coming out showing fair growth seemed to spark
a bit of a rally, but it was very short lived and there was very
little volume going through," Wheatley said.
</P>
<P>
The Australia &AMP; New Zealand Banking Corp. Ltd., said the number
of job advertisements rose a seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent in
September from August.
</P>
<P>
"I think the market is just waiting for some fresh news," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The official cash rate currently stands at 5.0 percent,
following five 50-basis points cuts since July last year, with the
last occurring on July 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Markets have largely factored in a sixth cut by the end of the
year, with most punters betting the Reserve Bank of Australia will
make its move in November.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 88.71 yen at close, little changed
 from 88.74 here Friday, and at 1.2795 marks, down from 1.2828.

<HEADLINE> Construction of New Yangtze Bridge Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Work on the second highway
bridge across the Yangtze River in Nanjing started here today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony this morning, Chen Huanyou, secretary
of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), unveiled a signboard bearing the bridge's name
inscribed by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Amid pounding of drums and cheers of jubilant crowds, a steel
coffer sank into the Yangtze river, the longest in China.
</P>
<P>
The new bridge, 11 km downstream of the existing Nanjing
Bridge, spans the third largest island in the Yangtze. It is
composed of Nancha and Beicha bridges and a 16-km-long road, and
has a total length of 21.197 km.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is scheduled for completion on July 2001, at a total
cost of 3.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Nancha Bridge is a 2,958-meter-long cable-stayed bridge
with the main span sprawling 628 meters. It is believed to be the
third longest bridge in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Beicha Bridge has a pre-stressed concrete structure with a
length of 2,212 meters. It will have six lanes with a width of 32
meters and be equipped with up-to-date monitoring and lighting
systems.
</P>
<P>
As a hub of transportation on the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze, Nanjing is currently equipped with four national
roads and a trunk line.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the new bridge will alleviate the traffic jams on
existing Nanjing Bridge and promote economic growth not only in
Jiangsu but also in Anhui, Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, a
local government official said.

<HEADLINE> Fires Scorch 96,700 Hectares of Forest in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Fires had scorched 96,700
hectares of forest in Indonesia by September 30, a senior official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Forestry Djamaloedin Soeryohadikoesoemo told
reporters at the Information Ministry that out of the scorched
forest 70,200 hectares are production forest.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indonesian government has been working hard to
distinguish the forest fires which started in Sumatra and
Kalimantan islands in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Djamaloedin and several ministers from the Agriculture
Ministry, Public Works Ministry, Communication Ministry and
Environment Ministry introduced government measures taken to cope
with the fires and haze caused by the fires. They said the
situation now is better than last month as rain has come in some
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and some experts said the El Nino phenomenon was
the main cause of the forest fires, which have brought heavy
economic losses and severe health effect to people in the country
and neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, President Soeharto apologized again to neighboring
countries affected by haze and smoke caused by Indonesian forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
The country pledged to continue exploring every avenue to fight
the fires, Soeharto said at the ceremony of the Armed Forces 52nd
anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
He ordered armed forces members at all levels to step up
efforts to deal with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government officially apologized last month to
its Southeast Asian neighbors for the choking haze.
</P>
<P>
Thick smoke from fires raging across 300,000 hectares of forest
has been hanging over Malaysia and Singapore during the past two
months. At one stage the smoke also reached the Philippines and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 30,000 people in Sumatra and Kalimantan, plus
tens of thousands in Malaysia and Singapore, have reportedly been
suffering from respiratory illnesses and eye irritations.
</P>
<P>
"Haze has interrupted sea, land and air transportation. It has
caused price hikes of daily needs in some parts of the country and
food scarcity in remote areas," said Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Introduce Commodity Insurance for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's newly-elected Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai said that a commodity insurance policy will
be introduced to make sure that farmers will not suffer from
market price fluctuations, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khai made the remarks while talking with the leadership of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development last Friday after
the first cabinet meeting of the new government.
</P>
<P>
It is one of several measures the prime minister outlined to
boost an industry that has recently been Vietnam's main foreign
currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Khai told the senior ministry leaders that more policies will
be formulated to encourage farmers to expand production and
improve their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said he is concerned over the emerging signs of production
stagnation in the sector and the ministry should work harder to
find outlets for Vietnam's increasing farm output.
</P>
<P>
Only the improved living standard of farmers will ultimately be
regarded as an indicator of real economic growth, said Khai.

YICHANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A 3.5-km-long canal, also
known as the "man-made Yangtze River," officially opened for
navigational service this morning at the Three Gorges Dam area on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The canal was specially built for construction of a gigantic dam
and generator workshops situated between two parallel cofferdams.
The canal is capable of accommodating ships of 3,000 dwt
(dead weight tonnages).
</P>
<P>
Construction began on May 8, 1993, on the man-made canal, which
was put into operation on May 1 this year. The canal is believed
to outsize the Suez and Panama canals in both width and water
levels.
</P>
<P>
The man-made river course, where the second locking of the
Yangtze will be conducted when construction of the big dam and
generator rooms is completed, will be in service until October
2002.

NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Oman, one of the major
exporters of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has offered to sell
India up to two million tons of LNG a year, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
A new proposal by Oman to sell LNG to India came up during the
second India-Oman Joint Commission meeting in Dubai and Indian
Minister of State for Commerce B.B. Ramaiah is in Oman leading the

"We consider LNG as the future oil for India and we will be
depending on LNG in a big way to meet our energy needs," Executive
Director of Indian Oil Corporation A.M. Uplenchwar said.
</P>

India would use LNG to feed a number of coastal power plants. A
few private sector companies were currently importing LNG on a
limited scale and the import of LNG can be effected only through
big outfits, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Levy Discusses Passport Issue With Canadian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has telephoned his Canadian counterpart Lloyd Axworthy
on forged Canadian passports held by two suspected Israeli secret
agents in a failed assassination attempt in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jerusalem Post newspaper today, to two foreign
ministers focused on the question of how forged Canadian
passports ended up in the hands of the two attackers.
</P>
<P>
The suspected agents of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad
disguised themselves as tourists carrying Canadian passports and
attacked Hamas political leader Khalid Mashiel in Jordan on
September 25. The two are now in Jordanian police custody.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the use of its passports by foreign agents to be
unacceptable, the enraged Canadian government recalled its
ambassador to Israel on Friday for consultations and said it was
considering further actions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry noted that Sunday's conversation took
place in a "good atmosphere" but gave no further details.
Meanwhile, officials of the ministry also held talks with Canadian
diplomats in Tel Aviv in an attempt to straighten out the affair.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Axworthy stressed his country's reputation in the
Middle East remains intact despite the incident, saying that he
had very extensive discussions with a number of Middle East
foreign ministers and clarified Canadian situation so there would
be no misunderstanding in the region about Canadian involvement.
</P>
<P>
Norman Spector, a former Canadian ambassador to Israel and now
president and publisher of the Jerusalem Post newspaper, said that
while the incident poses "a serious issue" for Canadian-Israeli
relations, "ultimately, we'll get over it."
</P>
<P>
However he admitted this "could take some time." he said
Israeli government should "seriously question the use of these
(Canadian) passports, and also the use of passports belonging to
dual citizens, some of whom are working in Jewish organizations,
in order to avoid such incident."
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials would "make it pretty clear (to the
Israelis) that they don't want such incidents to happen again," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Approves Yassin's Return to Gaza: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel has approved the
return of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual leader of
the militant Islamic group Hamas, to Gaza today accompanied by
Jordanian King Hussein, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Israeli officials conditioned the return of Yassin on
the release of two Israeli secret agents detained by Jordanian
police in a botched assassination attempt on Hamas leader in
Jordan Khalid Mashiel.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was released to Jordan last week after serving nine
years of a life sentence in Israeli jail, reportedly in exchange
for the exit from Jordan of three Israeli backup agents in the
murder mission.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas founder is expected to fly to Gaza aboard King
Hussein's helicopter via Ramallah, where he is to meet and pick up
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
Arafat has visited Yassin in an Amman hospital days ago.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Gaza have decorated the streets and storefronts
in order to award the Hamas founder a hero's welcome. The ceremony
organized by the PNA and Hamas will be held in the Gaza Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The release of Yassin was reportedly part of a secret deal reached
between King Hussein and Israeli government. But the king denied
there was such a deal.
</P>
<P>
The two agents of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad
carrying forged Canadian passports were arrested on September 25
by Jordanian police for attacking Mashiel in front of his
office with an injection of poison. Mashiel was hospitalized for
respiratory problems caused by the toxic and is recovering.
</P>
<P>
The incident has marred relations between Israel and both
Jordan and Canada, which has recalled its ambassador in protest.
</P>
<P>
It also sparked a political uproar cross Israel's political
spectrum as the opposition camp is demanding Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's resignation for his "arrogance, inexperience
and obtuseness" in making the decision to order the Mossad attack
against Mashiel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Radio quoted Israeli officials as saying
that the two Israelis were expected to return home soon.
Commenting on the Hamas demand for releasing more Hamas
detainees, the officials said that Israel intended only to free
some Palestinian prisoners who were not involved in killing
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's release was hailed by Hamas as a major victory by the
militant organization in its relentless fight to destroy Israel
and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli analysts said that the gala ceremony to be held for
Yassin by Hamas and the PNA indicated the delicate relations
between the two sides, which have been rocky for most of the time.
</P>
<P>
Menahem Klerner, a political scientist of the Bar-Illan
University, said that both Hamas and Arafat are trying to reap the
benefits from Yassin's return. The PNA's decision to welcome
Yassin's return was "part of Arafat's carrot-and-stick doctrine"
in dealing with the Hamas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas' continued suicide bombing campaign, the latest being
the attacks in central Jerusalem's two open markets that killed 25
people, has caused extensive damages to the peace process. The
PNA, under increasing Israeli and American pressure, is launching
a crackdown on Hamas activists after failing to woo the
organization into the peace camp.
</P>
<P>
Yassin founded the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in 1987,
but he was arrested in 1988 in Gaza for ordering terror attacks
against Israel and sentenced into life sentence the year after.
</P>
<P>
His health has been deteriorating in recent years, and now he
is wheel chair-bound after being paralyzed in his arms and legs
and suffering from both breathing and hearing problems.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sufferes Economic Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has suffered economic decline
this year, according to the 1997 report on least developed countries
(LDC) issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The United States government publication, Washington Line, quoted
the report as saying that other countries undergoing economic
regression are Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of congo, Guinea,
Haiti, liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Niger, Principe and Sao Tome,
Sudan and Togo.
</P>
<P>
The economies of these countries are said to have become increasingly
remote with markedly worsend social conditions from the mainstrean
global economy.
</P>
<P>
"These countries are not suffering from a temporary cyclical
economic downturn, but from the degradation of state and social
institutions," says the Washington Line quoting Nakha Sarr, UNCTAD
special coordinator for Africa and LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD called for an increased focus on how LDC countries can
take advantage of the Uruguay round trade agreement to increase supply
capacity and improve access to developed countries markets.
</P>
<P>
Sarr said the immediate impact of the Uruguay agreement on most
LDCs has been rather negative.
</P>
<P>
Pricing policies, research, technology, extension services,
marketing and other such concerns should be closely addressed by the
LDCs to ensure agriculture, which accounts for over one third of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most of these nations, continues to be
the leading factor in the economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Then the LDCs can record faster economic growth," Sarr said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Government Urged to Cut Public Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A top Lebanese banker has urged
the government to take measures to cut down the huge public
deficit by controlling expenditures in public departments.
</P>
<P>
Unless the government takes immediate actions to settle the
deficit, the country's economic, social and monetary stability
would be gravely undermined, warned Francois Bassil, president of
Lebanese Bank Association.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Beirut Times today, Bassil sounded
the alarm at a lecture on Lebanese economic and political future
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the public deficit, estimatedly accounting for 57
percent of the total expenditure, would take many years to
reduce. "The government must apply severe austerity measures in
all ministries and public departments," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bassil accused that some domestic companies,
commissioned by the government to implement development projects,
are receiving kickbacks from foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
"These unjustified kickbacks are eventually paid for from the
pockets of the citizens and the government's treasury," he said,
adding that it would also ruin the reputation of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to scrutinize all foreign and local
contracting and consulting companies that were vying for a cut in
the multi-billion dollar projects.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say if some cabinet ministers are involved
in this money scam, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso, Shares Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso and share
prices fell sharply today due to a tight liquidity supply, higher
interest rates and rumors of more local companies defaulting on
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The peso weakened to 34.926 pesos to one U.S. dollar at the
local dealing system, from last Friday's record low of 34.494
pesos. Since early July, the currency has been devaluated by 31.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between the peso and the greenback quickly
fell to 34.926 peso per dollar and remained static through
mid-afternoon in extremely light trading.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the central bank's move to raise the
overnight borrowing rate from 12 percent to 14 percent, a plan to
impose a one percent volatility limit, and more firms' application
for delaying the payment of their loans marred the investors'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local bourses plunged as a result of the
currency concerns and soaring interest rates. Interbank overnight
lending rate in the country rose to 105 percent from last Friday's
90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share composite index tumbled 68.43 points, or 3.4
percent, to 1,961.24, breaking the psychological 2,000-point
level.
</P>
<P>
To curb the free fall of the peso and the plunge of the shares,
the Bankers Association of the Philippines is holding a meeting to
decide whether to impose the one-percent volatility limit.
</P>
<P>
The move means if the dollar gains more than one percent
against the peso, trading on the currency exchange will be halted
temporarily.

Boueiz has said that he believed Washington will have to apply
more pressure on Israel for it to make peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper The Daily Star reported today that Boueiz made
the remark Sunday night upon returning from Now York where he
attended the 52nd annual session of the United Nations General
Assembly and held talks with a number of his Arab counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said the United States had given Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu a year of freedom to choose his own path
toward peace, which came out to have plunged the peace process
into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Mideast peacemaking began last March when
Netanyahu decided to build a housing project for 30,000 Jewish
settlers in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
The "peace process ball is now in the American court," Boueiz
said, adding the question now faced was how the defiant Israeli
position would be reconciled with American position.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz thought U.S. policy in the Middle East under Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright as being aimed at reactivating all
tracks in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"However, Netanyahu's present position is a threat to this new
trend," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that judging from Netanyahu's latest
declaration to continue with the settlements, it is apparent that
Israeli government's policy is not receptive to the process.

JERUSALEM -- A bomb scare in a Tel Aviv bus over Sunday night
proved to be a false alarm, Israel Radio quoted police as saying
Monday.

<P>
Israel radio interrupted its normal broadcast Sunday night to
report that a bomb had exploded on the No. 5 bus in northern Tel
Aviv. Police spokeswoman Linda Munuhin said the bomb was suspected
to be planted by an Arab, who aroused the attention of the driver
and fled after the driver began questioning his identity.

four Serb TV transmitters, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported Sunday.

Krajisnik suggested that the SFOR withdraw from the stations to

linked together so that another two Serb radio and TV stations --
Banjaluka and Pale -- could simultaneously broadcast programs.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Claims Major Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan anti-Taliban forces
have claimed that they had made further gains around the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces have confirmed the loss of several important
areas around Mazar-e-sharif. The fighting now is raging close to
Hairatan port in east of Mazar-e-Sharif, the only major sector
controlled by the Taliban, reports reaching here today from Kabul
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that heavy battle was going on around Hairatan
port with both sides using rockets, heavy artillery and other
weapons for the control of the strategic area which links
Afghanistan to neighboring Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of anti-Taliban alliance fighters were seen in action
 Sunday in their bid to recapture Hairatan port and plug all
possibilities for Taliban's future advance towards Mazar-e-Sharif,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials conceded Sunday that their troops had
retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif Airport but denied the reports they
had been routed from all the major areas both to the west and east
of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"We have pulled out of the airport voluntarily but our troops
are within the outskirts of Mazar-e-Sharif," one Taliban
representative was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, one report quoted spokesman for the anti-Taliban
alliance named Dr. Talib as claiming that they have controlled the
areas both to the east and west of the northern city.
</P>
<P>
He said that their troops had recaptured all important areas
from the Taliban and the fighting was now intensifying around the
Hairatan junction and the port as well.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Needs 38.5 Million Dollars Annually for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia needs 50 billion Kwacha
(38.5 million U.S. Dollars) every year to rehabilitate and
reconstruct the country's dilapidated road network, Zambia Daily
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Kelly Walubita, Minister of Communications
and Transport, as saying in a recently released publication
titled Road Sector Investment Program that
the roads in the country were in the last part of their design
life.
</P>
<P>
The program is a 10-year plan for soliciting donor funds to
supplement local resources. Under the 10-year investment program
which has been launched starting with Lusaka roads, Zambia will
offer regular maintenance to roads.
</P>
<P>
The initial five years of the repair exercise requires about
385 million Dollars, part of which will be raised from road users
through various ways including fuel levy.
</P>
<P>
Walubita attributed the deteriorating state to lack of funding
and proper management of the road network which has made the
routine and periodic road maintenance be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Most of the roads in Zambia have not been attended to for over
30 years despite the fact that every road needs to be resealed
every five years. The current poor state of the roads has been
caused to a great extent by lack of regular maintenance.
</P>
<P>
At present, local resources have fallen short of meeting the
required funds to cater for the backlog of deferred maintenance
and the desired levels of road rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the World Bank has given Zambia a loan of
about 91 billion Kwacha (70 million U.S. Dollars) to finance the
initial road repairs in the capital as part of the country-wide
exercise under the Roadsip.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Protect Interest of Retrenchees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambian workers to
be retrenched will get their packages on time as the government
has taken measures to reduce the sufferings of the affected
people, Finance Minister Ronalt Penza has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in Livingstone, southern Zambia on Sunday
that the government has changed the culture of throwing people on
streets, according to "Zambia Daily Mail" today.
</P>
<P>
"Retrenched workers will have to get their packages within a
short time after being laid off to reduce sufferings people have
been going through. The government has realized that and changed
the approach and that is why we are here planning for the
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Penza, who is in Livingstone to have opened the permanent
secretaries workshop on planning and budgeting, also referred to
many other issues including merging of ministries.
</P>
<P>
Asked about which ministries in particular are under his focus
for consideration to merge, he mentioned ministries of education,
science and technology, ministries of community development and
social welfare and youth and sport.
</P>
<P>
He said a better way forward has to be mooted to cut down on
wide resources allocation to target priorities in these ministries.
</P>
<P>
"If we ourselves shy away from biting the bullet in terms of
far reaching structural reforms to make the public sector more
responsive to the needs of the nation in the new millennium, we
cannot justify continuing to tell the private sector to
restructure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Penza said hard decisions must focus on reducing low priority
expenditures and it must involve merging ministries to avoid
duplication and unnecessary costs, reducing the cost of foreign
missions.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Attracts $21 Million Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi Stock Exchange
(NSE) has attracted net foreign investment of 21.4 million U.S.
Dollars since the beginning of this year, The East African
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper said that the equities market in Nairobi had
maintained foreign investor participation although the debt
market had suffered from panic selling following the stand-off
between the Kenyan government and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, foreign investors have re-discounted
bonds worth 72 million Dollars with a net capital inflow standing
at 2.3 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPI) accounted for 37.6
percent of the total market turnover in two months of July and
August.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that even in July, when the impact of the
IMF-Kenya stand-off was greatest, FPIs accounted for 39.8 percent
of the monthly turnover.
</P>
<P>
The FPIs have propelled the NSE turnover to record levels this
year, said the paper, adding that the turnover had hit 78.2
million Dollars mark last month and should easily surpass the 94
million Dollars mark by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, total market turnover recorded 61.2 million Dollars
which was itself an 18 percent increase over the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that as one of the leading stock
exchanges in Africa, Kenya must have benefited from the pool of
investment funds set aside for African markets.

-- One million Americans -- almost all male and white -- gathered
last Saturday in Washington, at the call of the conservative
Christian troup ``Promise Keeper,'' for an immense collective pray,
vowing to save the moral values of America and calling for
reconciliation between white people and black people as well as the
protection of family.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Sunday justified its attempt to assassinate in Amman
the leader of the Palestinian Hamas group, Khaled Meshal, by
accusing him of being responsible for the murder of innocent Israeli
civilians. The assassination attempt, carried out by two Mossad
agents carrying false Canadian passports, turned out to be a fiasco.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview dedicated to the trial of former governor of
Gironde under Vichy collaboration regime Maurice Papon, Daniel
Cordier, the former secretary of France's resistance leader Jean
Moulin, severely condemned the chief of the collaboration regime,
Marshal Philippe Petain, holding him responsible for all the crimes
committed by the collaborationists during Nazi occupation. He also
said that the trial of Papon, which will begin on Wednesday at a
court in Bordeaux, is ``almost incomprehensible'' because France had
spared the man who held the supreme responsibility -- Petain.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexico came closer to
assuring itself a World Cup qualifying berth Sunday with a
lopsided 5-0 victory over El Salvador in Concacaf division
qualifying play.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's victory places Mexico at the top of the Concacaf
division with 14 of the 16 points needed to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Mexico opened the scoring at the 30th minute through Benjamin
Galindo.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Garcia Aspe upped the score to 2-0 five minutes later
and Galindo followed up on a penalty shot at the 38th minute to
bring the score to 3-0 at the half.
</P>
<P>
It was a rough day for Salvadoran goalkeeper Misael Alfaro,
with Mexico's Roberto Alves ``Zague'' scoring on a driving shot at
48 minutes and Luis Garcia at 81. However, Alfaro was able to
block a Mexican penalty kick early in the game.
</P>
<P>
Mexico now tops the Concacaf with six games played, and needs
only a tie during its next match, an October 12 meeting with
Canada in Edmonton, Alberta to qualify.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica is second at 12 points on eight games played. The
United States, in third place, has 10 points on seven games. El
Salvador has gained 9 points in eight matches, Costa Rica eight

<HEADLINE> More Urban Students Interested In Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Students in China's Zhejiang
Province have shown new interest in farming and are choosing
universities with agriculture majors.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Agriculture University, one of the best of its kind in
the coastal province, enrolled a record 2,667 students this year,
according to the Provincial Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Most of its 731 new undergraduates are from key high schools in
the province, and 36.3 percent are urban residents, according to
university officials.
</P>
<P>
Chinese university graduates can automatically become urban
residents and many rural young people regard higher education as
the only means of freeing themselves from the burden of farming.
</P>
<P>
Today's young people however view agriculture as a flourishing
industry, and the study of biotechnology and advanced agricultural
technology has become fashionable among some high school students.
</P>
<P>
"Modern agriculture has never relied on traditional tools such
as hoes and rakes. So I must try hard to learn advanced technology
at the agricultural university," said one student who has done
very well in the entrance exam.

<HEADLINE> TB South Africa's Number One Killer: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Tuberculosis (TB) is South
Africa's number one killer, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, TB killed more South Africans that AIDS, malaria,
measles and murder combined, an annual report of South Africa
Survey said.
</P>
<P>
More than 158,000 people had TB, some 27 percent of whom were
also HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
The Western Cape Province had the highest TB rate, about 1.5
times higher than the national average. However, only 12 percent
of the TB sufferers in that province were HIV-positive, compared
with 45 percent in Kwazulu-Natal, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that TB has mounted a comeback worldwide.
Although TB is usually curable, it led to deaths owing to poor
health care conditions and lack of financial means in third world
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Fear gripped residents in
Cotabato city, the southern Philippines, after two grenade
throwing incidents occurred early today and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A hand grenade was found at the gate of a bus company this
morning and was defused by bomb disposal experts, reports reaching

</P>
<P>
The reports said the grenade, wrapped in a plastic, was
discovered by a bus dispatcher who at first mistook it for
garbage.
</P>
<P>
Probers said that the incident has something to do with
extortion activities. At least seven bombing incidents against the
firm have been reported in the past few years.

A day earlier in the same city, a grenade was thrown at a
residence and destroyed a portion of the roof of the house. No one
was reported hurt in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Probers allayed the fear of city residents, saying the
incidents rooted from two separate motives and would not trigger a
barrage of violence in the city.

nearly 80 percent of the vehicles entering or exiting China pass
through the ports of entry in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone
in Guangdong Province, next to Hongkong.
</P>
<P>
Before the special economic zone was founded in 1980, there
were only two small ports of entry, but the city now has 12 land,
air, and sea outlets used by both local and overseas passengers
and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The border crossing at Luohu and the cargo outlet at Huanggang
are the largest in China, and Yantian Port has become one of the
ten largest sea ports, while Shenzhen Airport is the country's
fourth largest.
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, China's central government and the
Guangdong provincial and Shenzhen city governments have spent over
two billion yuan (240 million US dollars) on these outlets along
the province's 260-kilometer coastline and the 27.5-km border with
Hongkong.

<HEADLINE> Feed Producer Cutting Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hope Group, A major feed
producer in southwest China's Sichuan province, recently cut the
prices of its products in the Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu
and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the group's effort to cut the price of its
products in three provinces and municipalities each month. It
started in March, and in the first half of the year, cumulative
price cuts amounted to 30 million yuan. Hope's market share in
East China, where more than a quarter of its subsidiaries are
located, has risen 2 percentage points, with sales of 80,000 tons
of feed.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50,000 households involved in pig raising
in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang that use Hope feed, and thanks
to the price reduction, they now spend 87 yuan less on average to
raise a pig.
</P>
<P>
President Liu Yongxing of the Hope Group said the price cut is
meant to establish an image of Hope feed as a product with more
desirable price and quality that competes with imported products.
</P>
<P>
The reduction also plays an important role in limiting the
price of meat and meat products, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Hope had annual sales worth 4.5 billion yuan last year. It has
6 percent of the nation's feed market.

<P>
CHENGDU, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
province has closed 1,633 small factories that caused serious
pollution since August of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial government official, that is 99
percent of the province's small factories, many of which consumed
large amounts of resources and caused pollution.

<P>
The factories include paper mills and leather, dye, and coking
factories. More than a dozen medium-sized and small rivers in the
province have cleared up after the factories were shut.
</P>
<P>
Closing them means a reduction of the 92 million tons of
industrial waste water, 6.5 billion cubic meters of waste gas, and
1.4 million tons of waste residue annually.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the provincial environmental protection
departments are doing constant checks on factories to see that
they don't start up operations again.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Garment Display Draws More Spot Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded Bangladesh
Apparel and Textile Exposition 1997 received spot orders valued
35.52 million U.S. dollars, 15 percent higher than last year's 30
million dollars, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that some 450 representatives of foreign buyers
and buying houses visited the exhibition, the annual textile
extravaganza arranged by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (BGMEA) since 1989 to showcase this
country's apparels.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, orders worth about 100 million dollars are expected
in next three months as a result of the three-day exhibition, said
the industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The BGMEA members, however, billed the announcement by
opposition leader Khaleda Zia keeping the ready-made garment
industry out of the purview of half-day strikes as the greatest
gain from the fair.
</P>
<P>
At the closing function Saturday, Bangladesh Nationalist Party
Chairperson Khaleda also said her party, in consultation with
other opposition parties, would actively consider relieving the
export industry of all types of political programs.
</P>
<P>
Mostafa Golam Quddus, president of the BGMEA, said the
entrepreneurs in the garment sector applauded the announcement of
the former prime minister, and wished such unique breakthrough
from negative politics a success.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a beginning towards a sound political environment.
It's a great achievement for the country's ready-made garment
sector, for our next generation," he told a press conference
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The BGMEA chief revealed that foreign buyers welcomed the
opposition decision and were planning to place big orders for the
next season.
</P>
<P>
Given the political stability in the country, the garment
sector would be able to fetch 5 billion dollars in export income,
up from 3.1 billion in the 196-97 fiscal, he claimed.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Remains at Low Level in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' inflation rate
in September moved up to 5.3 percent from August's 4.5 percent,
according to statistics released by the National Statistic Office
(NSC) today.
</P>
<P>
Measured on a year-on-year base, the inflation rate in the
country still averaged below five percent, much lower than last
year's average of 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSC attributed the slight increase in September's inflation
to the hike of food prices. The inflation rate for food alone rose
to two percent from 0.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
In Metro Manila, the inflation rate rose to 6.8 percent from
5.8 percent while other regions also registered higher inflation
rates than last month.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the government's statistics did not
reflect the real changes in the consumer prices, citing that the
sharp fall of the peso in the regional currency woes has pushed up
the prices of basic commodities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government said the lower inflation and the strong
performance of exports meant that the country's economic
fundamentals are still very sound despite the current currency
turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Peasant Becomes "Edison" Of East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Cao Jiangang, a former peasant in
Ningbo, a city on the east coast of China, has been honored as the
"Edison of Ningbo" by American experts for his 1,800 inventions.
</P>
<P>
Cao attended a seminar on dynamic engineering in early 1997 and
surprised 50 professors and senior engineers with his research
report. Although he is only an assistant engineer, he has solved a
lot of difficult problems that have puzzled academics for years.
</P>
<P>
Cao, 37, started farming when he graduated from junior middle
school in 1975. But, in 1982, when China's reforms were still in
their initial stage, he set up an instrument and meter plant with
6,000 yuan in savings, an enormous amount at that time. By the
1990s, he had set up a high-tech corporation in Ningbo, a port
city in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, Cao has developed 1,800 kinds of new
products, many of which are in extensive use in high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
One of them, an instrument for blood analysis, proved to be
more efficient than computer-controlled equipment imported from
the US, and was praised by an American businessman who invited Cao
to the US and was ready to give him 100,000 US dollars for moving
to the US. Cao declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
Cao's inventions have been applied to various areas and some
are ordered by many major Chinese enterprises like Baoshan Iron
and Steel Complex, Yanshan Petrochemical Corp. and the Daqing
Oilfield.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv Bomb Scare Proves False Alarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A bomb scare in a Tel Aviv bus
overnight proved to be a false alarm, Israel Radio quoted police
as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio interrupted its normal broadcast Sunday night to
report that a bomb had exploded on the No. 5 bus in northern Tel
Aviv. Police spokeswoman Linda Munuhin said the bomb was suspected
to be planted by an Arab, who aroused the attention of the driver
and fled after the driver began questioning his identity.
</P>
<P>
The driver reportedly heard an explosion after passengers were
evacuated from the bus. But Tel Aviv police, who rushed to the
scene of the "attack," found no trace of either a bomb or a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
"There was no attack. There was no bomb," said another police
spokeswoman Nitza Friedman. "The driver said a fellow with a 'dark
complexion' had aroused his suspicion and when questioned the
passenger quickly left the bus."
</P>
<P>
On the driver's account of an explosion from the trash bin of
the bus, police determined that he might have stepped on a paper
bag and mistook the cracking sound as an explosion.
</P>
<P>
The bomb scare showed the increasing fear among Israeli public
of more terror attacks following the recent wave of suicide
bombings in Jerusalem's two open markets, in which 25 people were
killed and over 300 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been on high alert and beefed up
security in public places. In the past, crowded buses used to be
the main targets of Islamic suicide attackers who intended to
cause as many casualties as possible.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Exports Continue to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' merchandise
export revenue in the first eight months of this year posed a 22.8
percent increase compared with the corresponding period of 1996,
the National Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
"Revenue earned from merchandise exports posted a 22.8 percent
increase as January to August 1997 receipts reached 16.023 billion
U.S. dollars, exceeding the 13.050 billion dollars in 1996 by
2.973 billion dollars," said the office in a statement issued
here.
</P>
<P>
The office said that value of exports for August alone grew
27.2 percent to 2.256 billion dollars, an increase of 482 million
dollars from the 1.774 billion dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the previous month, exports gained 9.1 percent
(in August) from 2.067 billion dollars," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that August's exports revenue from electronics and
components, accounting for 43.9 percent of the total, rose 48.5
percent to 989.45 million dollars from 666.49 million dollars a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of the Philippine peso and the recent recovery
of the world electronics market could be attributed to the fast
export expansion in the country, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Since July 11, the peso fell over 30 percent against the
dollar. The de facto devaluation of the currency made the
country's export products more competitive on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands remain
the country's major trade partners.

<HEADLINE> Coffee and Tea Export Prices Fluctuate in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Coffee and tea prices
increased slightly in the world market while those for cotton
dropped because of the dry weather pattern, said the latest issue
of the monthly Economic Review Report of the Bank of Tanzania
(BOT).
</P>
<P>
While prices for robusta remained unchanged compared with
July's figures of 1.7 US Dollars per kilogram, prices for other
types of coffee including arabica witnessed an upward trend reaching
4.3 US Dollars per kilogram compared with 4.1 US Dollars per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Tea prices increased to an average of about two US Dollars
from 1.9 US Dollars per kilogram as was reported in July.
</P>
<P>
The BOT report attributed the increase in coffee prices to the
fear that the dry weather pattern could harm the world coffee
crop. As for the tea prices, it attributed the increase to floods
in Bangladesh, which threatened the short term supplies of the
crop, that setting of the price surge.
</P>
<P>
Cotton prices dropped slightly to an average of 1.7 US Dollars
per kilogram from 1.8 US Dollars recorded in July while sisal
prices remained relatively stable at around 770 US Dollars per
ton, the BOT monthly report said.

COLOMBO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Tamil mainstream

<HEADLINE> Thai Auto Parts Makers Urged to Produce Accessories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Board
of Investment (BOI) of Thailand has urged Thai auto parts makers
to expand their production from original equipment to general
accessories to weather the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Making accessories will widen their markets, as sales of
original equipment are limited to orders from major assemblers,
said Chakramon Phasukvanich, deputy secretary-general of BOI.
</P>
<P>
Because of the economic slump, car assemblers in the country
have reduced production by as much as 50 percent and Nissan has
temporarily suspended its production of pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has about 200 companies making original equipment for
major car brands. Some parts makers have cut production to half or
one-third of capacity.
</P>
<P>
Auto parts makers in Thailand are protected by the requirement
for local assemblers to use their products and therefore have made
no improvements in quality in the past two years, Chakramon was
quoted today by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
If exports cannot be increased, several parts makers are at
risk of closure before the end of the year, Chakramon said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not believe that the present economic slowdown
would affect Thailand's goal of becoming the hub of the automobile
industry in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, exports of Thai-made
automobile products, including assembled cars, engines, parts,
motorcycles and kits, were up 145.8 percent from the same period
of last year.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper summoned a meeting of military commanders for
Monday after 28 policemen, soldiers and judicial officials were
killed over the weekend in attacks by rebels and gunmen.
</P>
<P>
The 28 people were killed in two ambushes in eastern Meta
province in 24 hours, but efforts have so far failed to find who
were responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the president's office did not say what measures
military commanders would discuss at the meeting but ruled out the
possibility of declaring a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the president has given precise orders to
his defense minister and the director of the national police to
take all measures necessary to pursue and capture the attackers.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the paramilitary force would be held
responsible for the first attack in which 11 judicial officials,
soldiers and policemen died Friday near the town of San Carlos de
Guaroa. But Carlos Castano, leader of Colombia's largest
paramilitary force, denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
In the second attack, 200 members of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) blew up two police trucks and fired
machine guns and grenades near the town of San Juan de Arama
Saturday, killing 17 policemen.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- India's Capital New Delhi is
becoming a hot transit point for drugs going from South Asia to
the lucrative markets in Europe and America, the Hindustan Times
said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, one-sixth of the total amount of drugs
coming to New Delhi come from the "Golden Crescent" comprising
India, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1995, 942 kg, and in 1996, 629
kg of the total heroin that was recovered in New Delhi had come
from the +Golden Crescent". Nearly 5 kg of heroin comes to Delhi
everyday from Pakistan and Afghanistan. At least 30 kg of smack
also come to the capital regularly.
</P>
<P>
Women are being increasingly used to transport drugs as they
generally don't arouse suspicion. In 1996, of the total 827 drug
smugglers arrested, 47 were women. 22 women drug smugglers were
arrested in the first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The police have stepped up checks and raids to curb the
increasing trend of drug smuggling via Delhi.

<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai ruling parties have agreed
that the planned cabinet reshuffle will take place after October
15, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached Sunday night after three hours of
consultation between all the senior figures of the coalition
parties including Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the consultation, Chavalit asked key members of the six
coalition parties to give breathing space for his government to
address economic problems, especially the plan to rehabilitate 58
suspended finance companies. The rehabilitation plan is scheduled
to be announced on October 15.
</P>
<P>
According to an informed source, Chavalit regarded the
rehabilitation plan as his top priority and has wanted it to be
addressed before the cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabbaransi, Chart Pattana party's deputy leader, was
quoted as saying that his party had agreed to the prime minister's
request not to press for a cabinet reshuffle until the 15th of
this month when International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials will
evaluate how well Thailand has abided by its measures.
</P>
<P>
A source said that the evaluation was necessary to determine if
the second and third installments of the IMF-sponsored aid package
would be extended to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has secured 172 billion U.S. dollars in standby credit
from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Chart Pattana has pressed Chavalit for a large-scale reshuffle
and insisted that this has to be done immediately otherwise the
government cannot win public confidence essential for solving the
economic crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Increasing numbers of people in
Beijing are going on outings on the weekend or holidays, according
to the Municipal Tourism Bureau, which says that per family travel
expenditures in the Chinese capital were 81.95 yuan (about 10 US
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
One recent Saturday morning, a man named Wang, and his wife and
son, got on the No.1 Special Tourism Bus at Qianmen in downtown
Beijing headed for the Great Wall at Badaling, 100 kilometers
north of the city.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we only joined tours organized by our work
unit. But now there are special tourist buses so we can go on our
own." In 1996, Beijing had 76.83 million Chinese tourists, 25.42
million of whom were from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To meet the growing needs of this business, in early 1996 the
municipal transportation authorities opened 18 special bus routes
to 68 major tourist attractions on the outskirts of the city to
provide more convenient service for people in Beijing and from
other parts of the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
The number of people traveling to remote counties and districts
like Yanqing, Miyun, Changping, Mentougou, and Fangshan have risen
this year, with hotel occupancy rates in these areas now
approaching 100 percent.

<HEADLINE> North China Leader In Foreign Investment Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
province used 950 million US dollars in the first half of the
year, a 37 percent increase over a year ago, and making it one of
north country's leaders in the use of overseas investment
</P>
<P>
This fairly recent development is a reversal of the previous
situation in coastal areas. Last year, it had 3.52 billion US
dollars worth of contractual investment, an increase that ranked
first among coastal provinces and municipalities. In 1991 however,
it was at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Locals attribute this to an improved investment environment. In
the past five years, Hebei spent more than 15 billion yuan
building 6,682 km of new highways.
</P>
<P>
Two expressways, one to Beijing and another to Taiyuan, the
capital of Shanxi Province, and an airport were opened to
traffic. The province had a long history of sea access but no
harbors. Last year, it put seven berths into operation at Jingtang
harbor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italian Communists to Offer Government New Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's leftist leader Fausto
Bertinotti said today that he would urge the government to adopt a
new economic program when he meets Prime Minister Romano Prodi
Monday for talks over the government's much debated 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
"We will propose the introduction of a discriminating,
progressive program which would mark a change of direction
compared to the budget bill presented by the government," the
leader of the Communist Refoundation Party told the ANSA news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The government had said that a deficit-slashing 1998 budget is
crucial to Italy's chances of participating in the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) at its very launch in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But Bertinotti said that his party perceives a just Europe as
one that was compatible with "a free and improved health service
and the defense of pensions."
</P>
<P>
The dispute could lead to the fall of the government, as
Prodi's Olive Tree coalition would lose its majority without the
support of Refoundation deputies in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, Prodi has refused to withdraw the bill and on several
occasions said that if the present governing majority collapses,
he would not try to form a new one. He is due to address
parliament Tuesday on the state of his majority.
</P>
<P>
Bertinotti said that his party would offer a one-year pact to
help fix the terms of the budget and outline a general economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
He said such a pact was needed in order to restore stability to
Italian politics and to avoid further disruption and disagreement.
</P>
<P>
He rejected government MPs' accusation that the communists want
to trip the country up just before it reaches the EMU finishing
line by taking harsh belt-tightening measures.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Monday meeting, Bertinotti said the chances of
an agreement being made is slim. "To reach this accord, the
government must abandon the grotesque claim that Refoundation
wants to undo all the progress that has been made so far this
year," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Out of China's 1.2 billion
people, more than 8,000 have lived for more than a century,

<P>
Statistics show that China has 120 million people above the age
of 60, and more than 20 million above 70, and eight million above

<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Beijing police have arrested
five people, one of whom is a Liberian, and charged them with
defrauding people by using fake US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Forfee Marvie, a Liberian citizen, and four other persons said
that they deceived passers-by into buying the fake dollars,
according to the municipal public security sources. They passed
themselves off as relatives of a Liberian national bank governor,
claiming that in order to get a large amount of US dollars out of
Liberia, which was alleged to be unstable politically, they had
put black ink on the money, and potential buyers were told that
the black could be easily removed after it was treated with a
special fluid.
</P>
<P>
But, the so-called dollars were simply pieces of black paper
and the special fluid was just a mixture of water and vitamin C,
the police said after investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
Beijing police warned residents to be careful of being fooled
by swindlers of this kind.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Government to Set Up Industry Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Government has
decided to set up a 45.45-million-U.S.-dollar special fund only
for industrial financing, the independent United News Agency (UNB)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide a half of the money for the
Industrial Development Fund while the Bangladesh Bank, the central
bank of the country, will funnel a same amount into the exclusive
fund in order to stimulate industrialization, the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign banks will provide loans to
industrial projects, mainly in the manufacturing sector, while the
Industrial Fund channel the matching funds, the UNB added.
</P>
<P>
As 50 percent of the total loans will be provided from the
Fund, the UNB continued, the total amount to be invested under the
special scheme will be bout 90.90 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the government because the business
community recently alleged that the long-term loans for setting up
industries became scarce for them and the liquidity shortage in
the banks threatened the country's industrialization process, the
news agency explained.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Government has also decided to take up a special
program for industrial financing and decided in principle to float
an industrial bond to raise at least 113 million dollars to
provide long-term industrial loans.

COLOMBO, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels have

In a special release from its London headquarters, the LTTE

<HEADLINE> Airlines in Thailand to Follow Thai Airways' Fare Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign airlines operating in
Thailand are expected to increase their air fares soon after the
Thai Airways International(THAI) increased its fares for most
international routes by 3 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Airline operators say that they are now absorbing cost increase
of 40 percent arising from the depreciation of the baht, adding
that a 3 to 5 percent price rise would be nothing compared to the
baht's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1, THAI has increased its fares by 5 percent for
first and business class tickets on flights serving the United
States and for all classes on Japanese routes. fares of all
classes to and from Australia, New Zealand and Europe have risen
by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, however, airlines managers are concerned
that the new prices will cause a further drop in demand, as
outbound travel already decreased because the Thai people have
less money to spend.
</P>
<P>
Travel agents predict that costs of package tours will also
increase because of higher air fares.
</P>
<P>
Under the Thai government's policy of buying Thai and touring
Thailand, outbound travelers have decreased considerably and, as a
result, many small travel agents have closed down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, airport tax is expected to double, from 250 baht to
500 baht (6.85 U.S. dollars to 13.7 dollars), early next year.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Troops Urged to Leave Serb TV Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, Serb member
of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia, made two proposals to
ease the tension caused by the NATO-led Stabilization Force's
(SFOR) seizure of four Serb TV transmitters.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were raised when Krajisnik met in Pale, Bosnia,
with Robert Gelbard, a special envoy of U.S. President Bill
Clinton, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported today.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik suggested that the SFOR withdraw from the stations to
ensure a normal situation and press freedom in the Republic of
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the TV transmitters be technically linked
together so that another two Serb radio and TV stations --
Banjaluka and Pale -- could simultaneously broadcast programs.
</P>
<P>
The Serb official voiced his support for the strike started by
Srpska radio and TV workers.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred SFOR troops occupied the four TV transmitters
in the Republic of Srpska last week in an effort to silence
propaganda hostile to the Dayton treaty signed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The SFOR's action was believed to be another signal of NATO's
get-tough policy on Serb factions who did not comply with the
treaty.

protection.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yingjie, the director of the zone's Administrative
Committee, attributes the development to good local environmental
conditions, the large number of professionals with a higher
education who are in the zone's private sector, and to
preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Good Autumn Harvest Almost Assured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's autumn grain crops are
growing better than predicted during the summer drought, "China
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first frost, an influential factor after summer drought,
came at a normal time (after September 20). It did not do great
harm to grain crops, the paper quoted Zhao Hanjie, chief of the
Agricultural information Division under the Ministry of
Agriculture as saying.
</P>
<P>
By now, a good grain harvest for this autumn is almost
assured. And until then, field management, including stepped-up
irrigation of dry farms, will further help secure better crops,
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Since official figures will not be available until after the
harvest, he declined to say whether the expected output is higher
or lower than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Since July, vast areas of north China and the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River have been hit by drought.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, 9.3 million ha of crops were still
suffering from drought, among which nearly half were said to be
seriously threatened, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Autumn grain production generally accounts for about three
fourths of the country's annual output, and the rest comes from
the summer harvest.
</P>
<P>
This year, a good summer harvest was reported in July with a
record output of nearly 124 million tons of grain, up 10.7 million
tons from that of last summer, and other official statistics
earlier this month showed an increase of nearly two million tons
of early rice.
</P>
<P>
"In all this year's total grain production is favourable," Zhao
said, adding, there will be an increased output of rice in the
south but a decreased output of maize in the north.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China's Rural Economy Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The rural economy in northeast
China's Liaoning province has emerged as one of the most important
means of economic growth, with industrial output of township
enterprises accounting for 40 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the province's rural output value has
increased four-fold and farmers' net income averaged 2,150 yuan
(259 US dollars) in 1996, 2.4 times that of 1991. In the process
one million farmers have said good-bye to poverty.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest industrial base, Liaoning has gradually
overcome a shortage of agricultural products. Its grain output
totaled 16.6 million tons in 1996, 8.4 percent more than 1991.
</P>
<P>
Total output of vegetables, fruits, meat, egg, and fish in 1996
was above 20 million tons, twice the figure for 1992. A great
quantity of non-staple food is transported to Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces, as well as to Russia, the Republic of
Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Farmers pay more attention to nutrition and the quality of food
now and more rural families can afford better electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of the rural economy in the province can be
attributed partly to the efforts made by the local governments at
different levels. Over the past five years, they have spent more
than eight billion yuan (nearly one billion US dollars) on
agricultural development and got 1.6 billion yuan in loans from
the local financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 120,000 hectares of mid-yield and low-yield
fields have been improved, and a better flood control and
drought-protection system has been built.

<HEADLINE> Rusedski Wins ATP Swiss Indoors Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski, a new rising power
with all-round skills, thrashed Mark Philippoussis in straight
sets to win the million-dollar Swiss Indoors ATP Tour title in
Basel, Switzerland, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The 6-3, 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (7/3) win could push the Briton to
No. 4 in the ATP Tour rankings when they are published on Monday
-- and put him in line for the ATP World Championships in Hanover.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Rusedski, who started the match ranked 10th in
the world had a tough time to win the final.
</P>
<P>
"I think I played very well in the first set and he missed a
couple of volleys that let me in," the Canadian-born Briton said
after his second straight win over the Australian this year
following his Wimbledon triumph.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stay in the top five and try to get to the world
championships in Hanover," he added.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis had prevented the first all-British final since
the Open era dawned in 1968 by beating Britain's Tim Henman in
Saturday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Australian lost to Germany's Nicolas Kiefer of Germany in
the Toulouse tournament final in France last week.
</P>
<P>
The win was worth 138,000 dollars to Rusedksi, who reached the
quarter-finals at Wimbledon this year before losing to Frenchman
Cedric Pioline and then became the first Briton to make the top
10 by reaching the US Open final at Flushing Meadow.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 5 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Party
leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar announced here today that he is ready
to take part in a political and military united front against the
Taliban in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The visiting former Afghan prime minister added "Taliban has
effectively taken advantage of the discord amongst the Jihadi
groups. We need to resolve our differences and form a united
front."
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar said "the war would not have a victor. The big
powers should know that no individual or country can install a
puppet government in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He said that over 1 million dead, 2 million disabled and 8
million refugees are caused by the war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Taliban "won't be able to rule the country" despite its
victories in battle fields, he was quoted by Iranian official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated on his group's proposed plan for establishment
of peace in the country which hinges on demilitarization of Kabul
and the simultaneous formation of a non-coalition government in
the country.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against foreign interference in the Afghan
internal affairs and called on Iran to convince Pakistan to
stop supporting the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar is now visiting Tehran for apparent demand of Iran's
military and financial support for his group. But details on
schedule of his visit were not made public in a customary practice.

German marks (about 35 million U.S. dollars) under its 1997 aid
program, German Ambassador to Jordan Peter Mende said.
</P>
<P>
The increase would mainly benefit water and agricultural
projects in the southern Jordan Valley, semi-official Jordan Times
Sunday quoted Mende as saying at a banquet at German embassy in
Amman Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Germany also canceled 40 million marks (about 23 million
dollars) of Jordan's debts owed to Germany, said the German
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The German government endorsed this year's financial assistance
for Jordan, despite the constraints on the fiscal budget, which
reduced the total amount of German assistance to other countries
by 10 percent, Mende said.
</P>
<P>
The original aid from Germany for Jordan this year is 102
million marks (about 58 million dollars), according to Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Algeria Saturday exchanged documents paving
the way for the establishment of a direct maritime route between
Aqaba and Algerian ports, Sunday's semi-official Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
This marks the implementation of a protocol concluded during a
visit to Jordan in mid-September by Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Dalabih, director general of the Jordan Ports
Corporation, told a press conference at an inauguration ceremony
aboard the Algerian vessel ``Qasr Al Shallaleh`` that the direct
route would stimulate trade and open the door for further
import-export exchanges by private sectors in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Al Arabi Kharouni, charge d`affaires at the Algerian Embassy
in Jordan, said that the opening of the line aimed to further
strengthen Jordanian-Algerian economic and trade links and to
serve the national interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian companies involved in the maritime transport were
showing increased interest in the direct route, because it would
remove barriers obstructing bilateral trade, said Kharouni.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Created to Treat Multiple-Sclerosis </HEADLINE>

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 5 (Xinhua) -- A new drug to treat the
neurological disease Multiple-Sclerosis has been developed in
Israel to effectively reduce the disease's severity, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The drug, named Rebif and created by Professor Michel Ravel of
the Weizman Institute, is the second of its kind developed here
for treating Multiple-Sclerosis, a neurological disease that
strikes over a million people around the world, the English daily
the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although Rebif can not cure the disease completely, it could
reduce its severity and frequency of relapsing remitting attacks
by 30 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Clinical trial results on Rebif have been presented on Tuesday
at the 122nd Annual Meeting of the American Neurological
Association in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted in 22 medical centers in nine other
cities other than Jerusalem. It was the largest study of its kind
ever to investigate a treatment for relapsing-remmiting
Multiple-Sclerosis, a form of the neurological disease that recurs
and causes an accumulation of problems.
</P>
<P>
The new drug is the fourth in the arsenal of neurologists for
treating Multiple-Sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
Rebif will be available in liquid pre-filed syringes for
injections under the skin three times a week.
