UCLA FRESHMAN CATCHES ON FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Freshman receiver Jon Dubravac's surprising
three-month climb may culminate with a spot on the Bruins' depth
chart.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver native, Dubravac spent the summer in Westwood, working
with strength coach Kevin Yoxall, playing catch with quarterback
Cade McNown and learning the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   The results are apparent: Dubravac is one of the few freshmen
ready for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here over the summer helped me 100-fold,'' he said. ``It
was the opportunity to run around and get a feel for the offense
and the routes and what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Mullen High in Denver, Dubravac was one of UCLA's
least-publicized recruits. He had scholarship offers from 20
schools, including Michigan, Northwestern and Washington. But with
five returning receivers, the Bruins expected Dubravac to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they can't keep him off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good possibility he'll play as a freshman,'' coach
Bob Toledo said. ``We're very impressed with his athletic ability
and he has less drops than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubravac is the third-string split end, behind Brad Melsby and
Brian Poli-Dixon. He may spend time as the backup slot (third)
receiver, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important to me to play (this season),'' he
said. ``There's a big difference between redshirting to get a feel
for what's going on, and the opportunity to do it. If you can play
immediately, it gets you on the fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt status: Injuries and performance may dictate otherwise,
but it appears at least five of the 24 true freshmen will play.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback DeShaun Foster, nose guard Ken Kocher and linebacker
Robert Thomas are expected to contribute immediately. A sprained
ankle has slowed Kocher's progress, and Thomas is playing with a
heavily wrapped broken hand that hinders his tackling.
</P>
<P>
   Dubravac and cornerback Julius Williams are improving rapidly
and may play. Heralded cornerback Lovell Houston, another Denver
native, has not practiced because of a strained quad and probably
will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Either guard Mike Saffer or offensive tackle Blake Worley will
play, but not both, Toledo said. A shoulder injury has limited
Saffer's practice time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Paying respects: Fred Andrews, an offensive tackle for UCLA in
1952, died Saturday in Bakersfield of an apparent heart attack. He
was 65. Services will be held Thursday at 1:30 p.m. in Church of
the Recessional at Forest Lawn in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Walendy update: Starting fullback Craig Walendy (allergic
reaction to bug bites) probably will not be ready in time for Texas
on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost past that point,'' Toledo said. ``It would be a
bonus if he's there, but we're not planning on him.''

RELEASE STILL BOTHERS FIELDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Cecil Fielder has found a new home with the Indians,
but he's still ``puzzled'' about his release from the Anaheim
Angels. After all, he says, it's not often the leading RBI man on a
first-place team gets released in August. Fielder had 17 homers and
68 RBI for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't come up with something,'' he said. ``I can
only go on what they told me. (Dave) Hollins has a salary for next
year, they wanted to bring the kid (Troy Glaus) up and move Hollins
to first base. That came out of (manager Terry Collins') mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did what they had to do. The only thing that (ticked) me
off was saying I wasn't doing this or that in certain situations,
or I can't run the bases. That's baseball, they knew what they were
getting when they signed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder has struggled with the Indians. He was 1 for 17 until
getting a two-hit game Sunday. Now, he's batting .167 (4 for 24)
with the Indians with no RBI and eight strikeouts. He said the time
off before signing with Cleveland hurt him. Fielder was designated
for assignment by the Angels on Aug. 5 and signed with Cleveland
Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost almost two weeks then had to get up and get going
again. It was rough,'' he said. ``The whole month of August was a
wash.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of seats: The Angels are in a pennant race. They know it,
but it seems their fans either don't know or don't care.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three home games of the season, Sept. 21-23 vs.
second-place Texas, the Angels have sold between 18,000 and 23,000
seats. The three games prior to the Texas series, Sept. 18-20 vs.
Seattle, the team has sold 28,000-39,000 seats. Why?
</P>
<P>
   The series vs. Seattle is 1) on the weekend, 2) includes a
fireworks show and 3) includes fan appreciation day.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions: The Angels clubhouse got a little more crowded
Tuesday, as the club added pitchers Mike Holtz and Jason Dickson,
and infielders Justin Baughman and Chris Pritchett from triple-A
Vancouver. Catcher Charlie O'Brien, pitcher Steve Sparks and
outfielder Reggie Williams jumped from Double-A Midland.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks and Williams never actually left the Angels but were
temporarily taken off the roster to make room for Ken Hill and
Gregg Jefferies. O'Brien was acquired in a trade July 30 from the
White Sox but hadn't been able to play because of a broken thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jarrod Washburn, who went 5-2 with a 4.38 ERA in 10
starts for the Angels earlier this season, is expected to be called
up soon. The Angels want him to get another start for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Rosters may be expanded to as many as 40 players. The Angels
have 32.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, a left-handed reliever, had been sent to Vancouver on
Aug. 3 to regain a feel for his curveball. He says he has found it,
as well as an appreciation for the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last day in Vancouver there was this naked guy running
across the field,'' Holtz said. ``Then he went back in the stands
and sat down in his seat and watched the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not: O'Brien won't say his thumb is completely healed,
only that he can play with it. He played five games for Midland to
get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been a whole lot of fun,'' said O'Brien, who hit
.262 with four homers and 18 RBI for the White Sox. ``Especially
when this team is fighting for a pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's biggest asset is his ability to call a game and handle
pitchers. O'Brien is expected to get his first start with the
Angels on Friday against the Royals in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Fan support: The crowd at Jacobs Field Tuesday night was 43,184,
their 281st consecutive sellout. With tonight's game, the Indians
will surpass three million in attendance for the third consecutive
season.

IMPETUS FOR MARKET SWING PROVING ANYBODY'S GUESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- With U.S. stocks regaining much of the ground
lost the day before, pundits were back on the airwaves and news
wires trying to explain where the market is headed and why.
</P>
<P>
   But for a growing number of analysts, economists and armchair
investors, the simple truth is they haven't got a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty little secret on Wall Street is that nobody knows,''
said William Sterling, head of global equities for Credit Suisse
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew that Wall Street would react to Monday's sell-offs
by pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 288 points, the
second-highest point gain in the market's history. And certainly no
consensus could be reached Monday afternoon to explain that day's
512-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times said a run on
mutual funds by small investors had forced fund companies to sell
stocks Monday. Other also-weighty sources said the opposite, that
it was mostly institutional investors such as hedge and pension
funds that were to blame. With 20/20 hindsight, it appears the
latter was closer to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But given the abundance of theories on what's driving the
current market turbulence -- from Russian politics, to Asian
currencies, to a Monica Lewinsky-distracted federal government --
such inconsistency is perhaps to be expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk on the street is that this (turbulence) is all about
Russia, but for the life of me, I can't figure out what these
Internet stocks, for one, have to do with Russia,'' said Tim
Loughran, an equity researcher at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Loughran and others say the normal news-and-reaction model that
in the past has helped move markets up or down has flown out the
window in recent months. The day after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor,
for example, the Dow dropped 4.4 percent, Loughran said. ``Think
about how much the market has changed in the last week and then do
a search for news items. Did anything really happen? The answer is
no.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of bewilderment appears to be creeping into investment
houses as well. Tuesday, Merrill Lynch's chairman and president
sent a joint memo to employees warning that ``selling in the
equities markets has reached an emotional stage.''
</P>
<P>
   While offering few predictions, there are those in the
quasi-academic world of economic think tanks and consultancy
offices who claim to have some insight into what's occurring. But
unlike traditional pundits, who often oversimplify complex economic
phenomena for a mass audience, these people say their theories are
simply too complicated for most people to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Brock, president of Menlo Park-based Strategic Economic
Decisions Inc., said a theory developed by Stanford University
researchers that he is now promoting to institutional and
government clients explains recent downward lurches in Asian
currencies that older economic models failed to anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   The theory, which draws on the ``economics of uncertainty'' and
``neutral correlation phenomenon,'' provides what Brock describes
as ``the decisive breakthrough in our ability to understand market
volatility of the kind we're witnessing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very act of speaking about it publicly, Brock said, can
affect the theory's dynamics. ``So for anyone arrogant enough to
get on TV and pretend they know what's happening, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ``What is important is not the pundits, but key
policy-makers like Bill Clinton and (Deputy Treasury Secretary)
Lawrence Summers. They do understand this, or should, and use this
information to guide policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, given the seemingly indiscriminate swings
the market is taking, some analysts say it might be best to simply
turn off the TV and accept that stocks are in for a bumpy ride in
the coming months. Indeed, volatility might be the only given for
the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hunch is that for awhile, the next several months at least,
we'll be in a trading range of 7,300 to 8,300 points (for the Dow
Jones industrial average), and go back and forth, and back and
forth,'' said Peter Anderson, chief investment officer at
Minneapolis-based American Express Financial Advisors. ``I think
most of the declines are behind us, but I'm not going to be shocked
if we moved somewhat lower still.''

MacKENZIE OUT FOR SEASON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC tailback Malaefou MacKenzie will miss the
remainder of the season after being diagnosed with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie, a sophomore, will redshirt this season and have three
years of eligibility remaining. He is scheduled to undergo surgery
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? That's football,'' MacKenzie said. ``All
things happen for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie injured his knee on an awkward play in the third
quarter against Purdue, when his foot got stuck in the turf during
a 2-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weight went one way and my knee went the other,'' MacKenzie
said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie gained 28 yards in seven carries against Purdue. He
gained 332 yards last season, including 104 against Nevada-Las
Vegas, when he became just the third true freshman to start at
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more than a football player,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ``He is a real leader. His leadership, his work ethic and how
he threw himself into learning the offense were outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett compared the injury to the one safety Grant Pearsall
suffered, which caused him to redshirt last season.
</P>
<P>
   With MacKenzie out, Hackett said Petros Papadakis would become
the No.2 tailback behind starter Chad Morton. Jabari Jackson and
Frank Strong will back up Papadakis.
</P>
<P>
   Strong, perhaps the most impressive back in training camp, seems
to have dropped down slightly because he is a true freshman _ at
least according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank hasn't done anything before,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither had Carson Palmer, so Hackett could likely
revise the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback update: Hackett stressed again that Mike Van
Raaphorst is the starter and Palmer will remain the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I don't want to do is not develop a young
quarterback because I'm so hung up on (who) the starting
quarterback (is),'' Hackett said. ``What Mike went through at
Washington last season (a 27-0 loss), I don't want to put Carson
through that. Mike recovered well, and some never recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas rests: Hackett said freshman quarterback Jason Thomas
will stay off his injured ankle for 10 days, without any practice
or running, to see if the scar tissue surrounding his left ankle
can heal. If not, Hackett said Thomas might undergo arthroscopic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That means Quincy Woods is back at No. 3 quarterback, although
Woods practiced only at wide receiver Tuesday.

RANGERS' PITCHING SLAMMED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Danny Patterson sat quietly with a pained look on his
face. Smashing his foot against the side of his locker only
emphasized the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious I just don't have the stuff I had before the
surgery,'' Patterson said. ``It's there one day and gone the next
10. ... Nothing is working.''
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett dressed and bolted the clubhouse quickly, an exit
almost as fast as his first-inning performance in a 12-8 defeat
against the Detroit Tigers last night. He left behind teammates
sitting glumly in the visitors' clubhouse of Tiger Stadium, many of
them wondering if the Rangers will have enough pitching to catch
the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels lost last night, 7-6, against Cleveland, leaving the
Rangers still trailing by 2 1/2 games in the American League West
race. But that didn't alleviate many people's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough time right now,'' outfielder Juan Gonzalez said.
``If you don't have pitching, everything is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it would take to get a winning streak going, first
baseman Will Clark said, ``It isn't hard to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't get pitching last night. Instead, Burkett
gave up four runs in the first inning to kiss away a 3-0 lead, and
the bullpen was torched for seven runs in the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson took the brunt of the carnage, giving up a grand slam
to shortstop Deivi Cruz in the seventh and two more home runs to
Juan Encarnacion and Damion Easley in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who underwent off-season surgery to repair a rotator
cuff, has allowed 11 home runs in 53 1/3 innings this year. He
allowed just three in 71 innings last year, including none in the
first 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's location,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Maybe it's
velocity, but the radar guns say it's the same speed as last year
before he got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager was as frustrated as his reliever. He had no
illuminating explanations other than stating the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is you can't win giving up 12 runs, no matter how
much offense you have,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' offense gave Burkett three runs to work with,
including a two-run homer by Clark. But the lead disappeared
quickly. Burkett, pitching on three days' rest, faced nine batters
and seven reached base on five hits and two walks, one intentional.
He was pulled with two outs, the shortest outing of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was right down the middle,'' catcher Ivan Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine and newcomer Tony Fossas, who struck out three of the
four batters he faced, kept the Rangers close, and they pulled even
at 5-5 in the seventh on two Detroit errors.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stay that way long. It was disaster by committee. Tim
Crabtree gave up a double to Luis Gonzalez and a single to Gabe
Alvarez. Eric Gunderson walked Paul Bako. Cruz broke the tie by
crushing an 0-1 pitch over the left-field fence for his first
career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   The two home runs in the eighth made it 20 in the past 32 games
allowed by Rangers relievers. They also have a combined 5.56
earned-run average in their past 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do have the fifth-fewest relief appearances by a
team in the American League, which makes Oates believe they are not
tired from early-season overuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' Oates said.
``Nobody has come to me and said they were tired. If they are,
we're in deep trouble because we haven't overused anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Explanations were hard to come by last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the major-league level, you can't outscore people every
night,'' Oates said. ``You've got to get people out. At the
beginning and the end, we didn't pitch well.''

RED SOX BULLPEN FALTERS; SEATTLE'S DELIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Short of forcing Ken Griffey to play blindfolded, Lou
Piniella to manage without his cap, or Jay Buhner to use Rogaine,
the Red Sox could not have had the Seattle Mariners at a greater
disadvantage Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game came down to a battle of bullpens, which for the
Mariners is tantamount to telling their bus driver (no relation to
Heathcliff Slocumb) to leave the motor running.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the Red Sox bullpen, which was ranked No. 1 in the
American League, turned sloppy at the first scent of September,
giving up five runs in the seventh and eighth innings in a 7-3 loss
to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   While a crowd of 28,150 at Fenway Park was reduced to amusing
itself with college cheers practiced by this year's crop of
incoming freshmen, the Sox bullpen disintegrated with four hits,
three walks, a wild pitch, and a costly throwing error by Derek
Lowe, who had inherited a 3-2 lead from Pete Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff walk to Buhner and a line single by Russ Davis
off third baseman John Valentin's glove, Lowe threw away Dan
Wilson's bunt in the two-run seventh. It was his fourth error of
the season and the 16th committed by a Red Sox pitcher _ a figure
exceeded only by the Mariners (23) and Dodgers (17).
</P>
<P>
   Making the error all the more frustrating was that the
6-foot-6-inch Lowe, who has joked about his lack of athleticism but
was an all-state basketball player in high school, has been working
overtime on his fielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out there a half an hour yesterday and a half an hour
today,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``We must have gone over
the same play he saw tonight about 15 or 20 times. He's slow
reacting to balls hit at him. We're trying to make him quicker when
he steps off the mound and quicker on making his throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have him out there every day until he gets it right.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sinkerball pitcher who either generates ground balls or
finds another line of work, Lowe recognizes that his glove is more
than just an ornament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be able to field my position,'' he said. ``Field
bunts, cover first. You're going to be handling the ball so much as
a ground-ball pitcher, you have to be able to field or it's going
to hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as harmful was the eighth inning, another artistic disaster
in which newly recalled David West walked Griffey on four straight
pitches, uncorked a wild pitch to Edgar Martinez, and allowed an
RBI single to David Segui. With Segui taking second on a rare
overthrow by center fielder Darren Lewis, the Mariners went on to
score twice more on Davis's bloop single and Wilson's double off
Carlos Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two leadoff walks, the bunt play, the little things hurt us
tonight,'' Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the maligned Mariners pen, the league's most adept at
coughing up leads, protected this one with 2 2/3 innings of
scoreless work from Jose Paniagua and Mike Timlin, Paniagua's test
of fire coming when he coaxed a pop fly from Nomar Garciaparra with
the bases loaded to end the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture for the Sox, the damage was contained, as
their closest contender for a wild-card spot, the Texas Rangers,
also ran into late-inning blues and fell, 12-8, to the Detroit
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Sox' margin at eight over the Rangers and nine
over the Blue Jays, who have won five straight to make a faint
appearance on the radar screen. A four-game set in Toronto is just
ahead for the Sox, beginning Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The big picture was of little consequence to Schourek, who has
known nothing but losing since coming to the Red Sox but was in
line for his first win when he left with a 3-2 lead after six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek weathered a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the first that
yielded just one run and a 441-foot homer by Buhner in the second
that clocked the light stanchion well above the Coke bottles,
dropped into the screen, then bounded onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners hit a couple of more deep balls off Schourek that
not only remained under radar range but were caught, one by a
leaping Lewis in front of the center-field wall in the fourth. But
they managed just two more hits off Schourek, singles by David Bell
in the third and Griffey, who went the other way against the shift,
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of satisfaction for a job well done?
</P>
<P>
   ``A small one,'' Schourek said. ``Obviously, it's another outing
I've made that we've lost. I don't think we've won yet when I've
been on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. It's five times and counting.

MARLINS EXEC INTERVIEWS FOR GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Hughes, the Florida Marlins director of
player personnel, closed out the first round of interviews for the
Los Angeles Dodgers' GM position by meeting with the club on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were seven candidates for the job, which is
expected to be filled by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will conduct follow-up interviews next week while
the club is on the road in Arizona and San Diego. Fox's baseball
people Chase Carey and Peter Chernin will be involved in the second
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president Bob Graziano and club chairman Peter O'Malley
were the point men in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins' GM Dave Dombrowski, considered the front-runner, will
be part of the second round, as will Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Yankees GM Bob Watson, the only African-American
candidate, also will be back. National League president Leonard
Coleman has spoken on behalf of Watson, who also is being
considered by the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The final candidate is Baltimore assistant Kevin Malone. He was
the former general manager with Montreal after Dan Duquette went to
Boston at the end of the 1993 season. Duquette replaced Dombrowski,
who left the Expos to join the expansion Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The three who did not make the cut _ Hughes, Atlanta's Dean
Taylor and the Mets' Omar Minaya _ were well regarded, but did not
have GM experience.
</P>
<P>
   One trivia note: Minaya, who interviewed Sunday, was the
long-time Latin America coordinator for the Texas Rangers and
signed Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa for $3,500 in 1986 out of the
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Antonio Osuna, who learned Monday he needs
season-ending surgery, will have the procedure Tuesday at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna's absence was not the only reason minor league callup Mike
Judd pitched two innings in Monday's 8-3 loss to the New York
Mets.Left-handed reliever Mark Guthrie is expected to miss a week
after complaining of soreness in his pitching elbow. Guthrie,
second to Scott Radinsky (58) in appearances with 52, hasn't
pitched in a week.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous four outings, Guthrie allowed nine hits and five
runs in 51/3 innings. Guthrie is earning $1.6 million in the final
season of a multi-year contract and is not expected back.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back: O'Malley appears to be mending fences in what is
expected to be his final year with the club. Fired manager Bill
Russell was a guest in his box Monday and Russell now is headed to
Taiwan to represent the Dodgers in clinics with a local
professional team. Russell and the Dodgers' three fired coaches _
Reggie Smith, Mark Cresse and Goose Gregson _ will be part of the
annual November fantasy camp in Vero Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's father dies: Marvin Sheffield, the father of Dodgers
right-fielder Gary Sheffield, died Tuesday in Tampa, Fla., of
throat cancer. He was 50. Sheffield, who learned earlier in the day
that he will miss the rest of the season with a severely sprained
left ankle, flew to Florida on Tuesday night. Sheffield will be
wearing a removable cast for the next four to six weeks.

`LOVE BOAT'S' JULIE OPENS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There they were Tuesday. Doc, Isaac, Captain
Steubing, Vickie and the woman who made cruise director the career
of choice for girls of the 1970s, Julie.
</P>
<P>
   Real and in the flesh, the crew of the 1970s hit TV show ``The
Love Boat'' came together for a reunion at Ray Art studios in
Canoga Park that was really a chance for the UPN network to
publicize its show, ``The Love Boat: The Next Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of the new season is a reunion of the old cast
with the new, set for broadcast Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   So there they were standing on the bottom stair leading into the
pool area of the Pacific Princess. Right up close. And Julie was
wearing one of her wonderful pale blue gowns with spaghetti straps.
Just like she did in the late '70s and early '80s, when teen-age
girls thought life could be no better than that of the cruise
director on the Pacific Princess.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Princess, where love was ``exciting and new'' every
week. Where every week the crew invited you to ``come aboard, we've
been expecting you.''
</P>
<P>
   Life couldn't get any better for a teen-age girl baby-sitting
three kids for a buck an hour and a pizza if the parents were rich.
``Love Boat'' was the high point of Saturday night. Julie was the
picture of glamour and career. She put cruise director on the
career map of girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you wised up,'' said Lauren Tewes, the actress who
played Julie.
</P>
<P>
   Tewes took a few minutes to sit down and talk about life after
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's been 20 years, Tewes looks the same. Short blond
hair, pretty blue eyes. Same sweet, quiet girl. Still uncomfortable
in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Tewes' life hasn't been all that simple.
</P>
<P>
   After a well-publicized battle with cocaine in the '70s, Tewes
made her way to Seattle, where she married actor Bob Nader and
began a career as a stage actress.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tewes said, she is turning her efforts toward gaining
public awareness for Lou Gehrig's disease, which has no known cure.
</P>
<P>
   Tewes said after the filming of the reunion show, she will
return to Seattle and her ailing husband.
</P>
<P>
   And hopefully she'll find a way to set her course for adventure,
her mind on a new happiness.

`TITANIC' VIDEOS SAIL OFF SHELVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The fans can't get enough.
</P>
<P>
   That's the early conclusion after the video version of
box-office megahit ``Titanic'' went on sale at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Kelly Haynie, manager at a Blockbuster
outlet in Northridge that offered a ``Bon Voyage'' party with gifts
and coupons. ``I was expecting no more than 15 or 20 people, and we
had more like 150. People started to line up at 10:30 (p.m.).''
</P>
<P>
   Many stores stayed open until 2 a.m., then encountered more
buyers when they reopened. Haynie said her store was selling 10
copies an hour and had already asked the studio to restock the
inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Video's Tarzana outlet drew about 40 customers between
midnight and 1 a.m., then reopened at 8 a.m. -- two hours earlier
than normal. ``It's amazing that people were here in the middle of
the night when they could get the video today,'' store manager Nick
McCauley said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even stores that didn't participate in the midnight madness drew
impressively. Workers at Circuit City stores in Northridge and Van
Nuys each found several dozen customers in line when the doors
opened Tuesday morning, possibly drawn by the $16.99 discount price
for the two-tape set.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures indicate ``Titanic'' -- with a worldwide box
office topping $1.8 billion -- should become the top live-action
video ever in the U.S. market, topping the 17 million units sold of
``Jurassic Park'' and ``Independence Day.'' Paramount Studios
shipped more than 20 million copies; Video Store magazine, citing
an unnamed distributor, reported recently that the total topped 23
million.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster announced it had presold 1 million copies at $24.99,
while Best Buy sold 50,000 copies between midnight and 2 a.m., when
its stores closed. To stock its 289 stores, Best Buy bought enough
copies to fill 25 53-foot-long trucks, said spokeswoman Laurie
Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people lining up as early as 9:15 last night, and some
of our stores had several hundred people,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount spokeswoman Dorrit Ragosine reported no problems with
stores breaking the 12:01 a.m. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been completely enthusiastic,'' she said. ``It's
been a complete home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry tracker Barbara McNamara of Alexander &AMP; Associates said
the video will post strong sales for several weeks before dropping
off, then could see a resurgence as the holiday shopping season
approaches.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Comets are WNBA champions _ again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the littlest one was there Tuesday night to lead them to an
80-71 victory over the Phoenix Mercury in the third and deciding
game of the 1998 WNBA Championship Series at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   There's no discounting the contributions of Cynthia Cooper, who
for the second time was chosen the championship Most Valuable
Player. She had 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes, quiet most of the night, rose when it counted
most. Swoopes had 16 points and in the final seven minutes came up
with a huge blocked shot, an assist and a fast-break layup within
the span of 32 seconds to help seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson was there with 18 points, six rebounds and a pair
of 3-pointers that helped subdue the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Kim Perrot, more than any Comet, who had the
consistent effect for 40 minutes that made Phoenix coach Cheryl
Miller's guarantee of a championship win over the Comets back in
July nothing more than hot air that drifted into the desert night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Perrot's had two bad games,'' said Coach of the Year Van
Chancellor, ``and to come back like this is unbelievable. The `Big
Three' (Cooper, Swoopes and Thompson) are going to get all the
publicity. But poor little ol' Kim, she was right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her to get me just one rebound. She went out there and
got three (among) those giants there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-factor through most of the first two games of the
best-of-three series, Perrot shook the rust off her game Tuesday
and contributed 13 points, five rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   With the Comets, who built a 10-point lead in the first half,
ahead 73-67 with 2:21 left, Perrot on three consecutive missed
field-goal attempts by the Mercury knifed through to grab the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We most definitely had to turn it up a notch (on defense),''
Perrot said, ``but there was never a moment of doubt. We've been
through that all year. We got together as a team and said, `Hey,
they're going to make some runs. All we had to do was hold on. We
held on and came up with some key rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Comets, their 27-3 record attracting
expectations that helped make the 1998 playoffs pressure-packed
from beginning to end, survived their toughest of challenges this
season.
</P>
<P>
   True to their promise of the day before, the Comets roared out
of the gates at the start and mounted a 10-point lead in the first
half, only to have it melt under a heavy Mercury siege at the start
of the final period.
</P>
<P>
   And with 16:51 remaining, a fast-break layup by forward Umeki
Webb, one of many by Phoenix, had the Comets trailing 41-39 for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   But true to another pre-game vow, the defending champions
weren't going to allow anything to stand in their way of a second
crown. They had been galvanized by a 74-69 win in overtime Saturday
during which they trailed by 12 points with 7:24 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   They were duty-bound Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best games I've ever seen, and I'm so
proud that we won our second championship in a row,'' Chancellor
said. ``Thank God for great players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is good. And they're playing good right now. I don't
want to play them again. This is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I've been resurrected, so to speak. The good Lord won
one for me Saturday night. The players won one for me today, so I'm
a lucky guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Comets down 47-45, Perrot had two free throws and
followed that with a 3-pointer off an assist from Swoopes (one of
six) as the Comets took the lead for good 50-47.
</P>
<P>
   Twice over the next seven minutes, the Mercury rallied behind
Michelle Griffiths (game-high 24 points) and pulled to within a
point. But on each occasion, someone in Comets white was there with
an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Leading only 60-59 following a Griffiths layup that came off a
Perrot turnover, Perrot gained redemption by returning the favor on
the other end.
</P>
<P>
   When Bridget Pettis tossed in a bucket to cut the Comets' lead
to 62-61, Swoopes, fouled by Brandy Reed, nailed a pair of free
throws to build the lead back to 64-61.
</P>
<P>
   During the timeout that followed, Chancellor had instructions
for his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole timeout at that time was,'' he said, ```We've got to
find somebody who can guard somebody.' We made a defensive
adjustment. We were allowing them to go down the middle. So we told
them to push the Mercury to the sidelines, cut a few passing lanes,
step it up defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that's where we won the game, with a gallant,
valiant defensive effort by Kim Perrot.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of Cooper, Swoopes and Janeth Arcain might have been
added. Cooper, who had 13 of her 23 points in the first half,
forced reserve Toni Foster into a turnover. On the other end,
Arcain took a pass from Swoopes and converted for a 66-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On Phoenix's next possession, Swoopes blocked Reed's shot.
Swoopes would complete the series by taking a pass from Thompson
and making a fast-break layup that put the Comets ahead 68-61.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mercury wasn't done. First, Jennifer Gillom (20 points)
cut the advantage to 69-65. Then, after Thompson's follow shot made
it 71-65, Griffiths converted in transition to trim it back to
71-67.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last hurrah for the Mercury, which finished second
to the Comets in the Western Conference race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was,'' Miller said, ``they made their shots. That's
what you want to do in a championship game, make the shots, make
the ones that count. And they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of that stretch when the Mercury briefly led in the second half,
then again found itself playing catch-up, Miller said: ``We traded
baskets for a while. But when there were key shots to be made, they
did that; they were able to get into transition and make some easy
baskets that way. We made some good plays down the stretch, trying
to get to the rim, trying to get some calls (from the officials).
That didn't happen. That's just the way the ballgame went.''
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes after Griffiths' basket trimmed the lead to four
points for the final time, Swoopes made four straight free throws
to put the Comets ahead 77-67.
</P>
<P>
   The workers at Compaq Center perched in the rafters, then busied
themselves preparing the blizzard of red-white-and-blue confetti
that fell throughout most of the postgame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheryl made some big-time free throws,'' Chancellor said,
``some big-time shots, big-time rebounds. She's a big-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That blocked shot, she ran over one of our players to get to
it. That's the second game in a row she's done something like that.
She's a player.''

   The Comets led 25-15 in the first half following a 3-pointer by
Thompson. The Comets were ahead 32-26 at intermission. But with
five points from Gillom stoking a 15-7 run, the Mercury came back

   ``We went through a lot of ups and downs this season,'' Cooper

sacrifices as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special. I didn't think before that this championship
would feel as special as the first one, but when that buzzer
sounded, I felt so many emotions.

   ``It just makes all of it worth it. I would definitely say this
one was sweeter.''

APPEALS COURT DENIES NEW YORK CITY'S BID TO BAR HARLEM RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, inserts throughout) (sw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Complying with a federal court order, city officials
and organizers of the rally billed as the Million Youth March
briefly put aside weeks of vitriol on Tuesday night to hammer out
conditions for the event, which will take place on Saturday as
organizers had hoped but in a much smaller swath of Harlem and for
a much shorter time.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came hours after a federal appeals court ruled
that the rally could take place in Harlem on Saturday, despite
efforts by the city to block it. But the court ruling significantly
curbed the scope of the event, reducing the proposed duration to 4
hours from 12 and the number of blocks to 6 from 29.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by a divided three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, balanced the free-speech
rights of the event's organizers against the concerns of city
officials, who said they feared that it could be too large to
manage, particularly when the city's police force will be taxed by
other Labor Day weekend events.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed victory on Tuesday night, after
representatives of the organizers met with city lawyers to hammer
out final conditions. They agreed that the rally would take place
from noon to 4 p.m. on Malcolm X Boulevard, from 118th Street to
124th Street. Organizers also agreed that there would be no
entertainment or music and no vending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only wanted a few things, and by God's grace, we have
everything we wanted,'' Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the rally's lead
organizer, told reporters after the meeting. Asked about his
original requests for 12 hours and 29 blocks for the rally,
Muhammad described them as negotiating tactics. ``Sir, in
negotiating for the Million Youth March, we set up the parameters
broadly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the potential for disturbances on Saturday, Muhammad
said, ``If the policemen are courteous and kind and respectful to
us, then we must return that respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that Mayor Giuliani's police will riot on
this day,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said Muhammad's
declaration of victory was merely ``a spin they have to put on
it.'' He portrayed the court-imposed limits as a triumph for the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the court's ruling was the acknowledgment by lawyers
for the organizers that they expect only 50,000 people, which is
significantly lower than previous estimates of 150,000 to three
million.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers, attributed the drop to the
``climate of terror'' that he said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
created by consistently referring to the event as a ``hate march.''
Muhammad has promoted the rally as an expression of strength and
unity by young black people, but he has peppered his comments with
the sort of antiwhite and anti-Semitic remarks for which he has
repeatedly been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which supported the plans for the rally, said the
court's decision to let it go on was ``a win for the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   The court decision signaled the latest and perhaps final clash
between the city and Muhammad over his plans for a rally in Harlem,
one that he said would attract entertainers, gang members
interested in ending lives of violence, and thousands of young
black people from around the country. But specifics have been few,
and he has had to compete with a larger rally, the Million Youth
Movement, also taking place this weekend, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly denounced the rally and all those who
might participate. His comments have prompted several leaders in
Harlem to criticize him as insensitive, and provided Muhammad with
an opportunity to spice his familiar rhetoric with suggestions that
invited gang members might fail to contain themselves if the police
try to stop the event.
</P>
<P>
   The city's efforts to block the event, and to offer an
alternative time and place _ Randalls Island on Sept. 19 _ were
undercut last week when Judge Lewis Kaplan, of Federal District
Court in Manhattan, ruled that the city's denial of a rally permit
for the Labor Day weekend was unconstitutional and based on
arbitrary interpretations of city regulations.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that the city had enough police officers ``to
deal with whatever problems of congestion, emergency action,
overcrowding and fire risk may arise'' during a 12-hour rally that
would stretch 29 blocks along Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the appeals court majority, Judges Jon Newman and
Fred Parker, upheld the lower court's decision to issue an
injunction allowing the event to take place in Harlem on Sept. 5.
But they argued that the ``invalidity of a permit regulation cannot
automatically entitle a plaintiff to hold its event precisely as it
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two judges found fault with Kaplan's assessment
of the city's ability to respond to the rally, saying that the
lower court's decision ``exceeded the scope of its allowable
discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Cardamone joined his colleagues in agreeing that
the organizers had a right to hold the rally, but in his written
decision, disagreed with the modifications. The smaller scope of
the rally, he said, could have the counterproductive results of
increasing congestion and ``the risk of confrontation.''

   &UR; RUSSIA SUMMIT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service moved the following package of
stories relating to the summit meeting in Moscow and the political
and economic turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SUMMIT (Moscow) _ President Clinton delivered a sober
lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people Tuesday about the
hard realities of capitalism and the price of international support
for relief from Russia's current financial crisis. In meetings with
President Boris N. Yeltsin and the temporary caretakers of Russia's
paralyzed political and economic institutions, and in a speech to
students at a Moscow university, Clinton warned that there is no
easy escape from the financial catastrophe that has closed banks,
left millions of workers unpaid and caused the collapse of the
government. By John M. Broder. (1stLd)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ While anxiety over Russia's deepening
economic crisis spread, acting Prime Minister Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that he would form an acting government
without waiting for parliamentary approval. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-RESCUE (Undated) _ Plan A, a $23.6 billion program
courtesy of the IMF, failed in less than four weeks. Plan B, a
devaluation and debt moratorium cobbled together by young Russian
reformers, collapsed within days. Neither prevented investors from
fleeing or citizens from turning every ruble they have into
dollars. So what options are left for restoring financial
stability? By Slyvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SCENE (Moscow) _ As Muscovites defied a cold rain to
methodically pick grocery shelves clean of goods they expect will
soon disappear, President Clinton stood Tuesday morning in the oval
office _ Boris Yeltsin's marble-and-bronze, oval-shaped study in
the Kremlin _ and pushed the heel of his hand onto the top of a
fat, round loaf of Russian bread. Each time the bread bounced back.
``Amazing,'' Clinton told Yeltsin. ``Kind of like you.'' So he
hopes. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ARMS (Moscow) _ During the frigid days of the Cold War,
American satellites watched for the fiery launching of Soviet
missiles, a sign that the United States might soon be under nuclear
attack. Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States
has found a new use for its warning systems. It plans to employ
them to alert the Russians about missile launches around the world.
On Wednesday, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin plan
to sign a new accord under which the former antagonists will
instantly share data about the launch of ballistic missiles and
space boosters. By Michael R. Gordon. (1stLd)

VALDES PITCHES DODGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A month off meant everything to Ismael Valdes. Two
days did not help Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes pitched seven scoreless innings Tuesday night in his
first start since July 27, but Shaw continued to struggle in the
Los Angeles Dodgers' 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who blew four save opportunities during a six-day stretch,
allowed a mammoth home run to Bobby Estalella on the first pitch of
the ninth inning but retired the final three hitters to preserve
the victory for Valdes before 28,199 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (10-9), sidelined since July 27 with a strained left side
muscle, was activated before the game, but did not appear bothered
by the layoff.
</P>
<P>
   He limited the Phillies to five hits and two walks in seven
innings. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt comfortable. I had no pain in my injury at all,''
Valdes said. ``But I started to have some blisters in the fourth
inning. I just wanted to go pitch by pitch and inning by inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Dodgers, who just dropped three of four to the
Mets, have an abundance of starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Glenn Hoffman has elected to use a six-man rotation. He
moved Carlos Perez into tonight's game against the Phillies and
dropped Darren Dreifort to Friday's series opener against the San
Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody deserves to be taken out right now,'' Hoffman said.
``(Dave) Mlicki and (Brian) Bohanon have been great. And now
Ismael. It's a strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, however, remains a trouble spot, as does the entire
bullpen. After allowing big late-inning homers to Andres Galarraga,
Andruw Jones and Edgardo Alfonzo in the past 10 days, Shaw gave up
a 447-foot drive to Estalella that cut the Dodgers' lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But he held on to record his 39th save overall and 16th with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Charles Johnson's two-run homer in the seventh, the
Dodgers might not have closed out the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The club already is without set-up man Antonio Osuna, who
learned Monday that he needs season-ending surgery to remove bone
chips in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And left-hander Mark Guthrie is expected to miss a week with a
tender elbow. He hasn't pitched since Thursday against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies and Dodgers entered August with a chance at the
wild card. But Philadelphia went 11-20 and the Dodgers 11-18 during
the past month and both dropped from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the two teams were left to play out the string.
</P>
<P>
   While Valdes was breezing through the Phillies order, the
Dodgers didn't get their first hit off starter Paul Byrd (2-2)
until the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros doubled off the wall in left-center with one out,
moved to third on an infield single by Bobby Bonilla and scored
when Phillies shortstop Desi Reliford misplayed Matt Luke's
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who failed to crack Atlanta's vaunted starting rotation a
few years back, has pitched well since he was promoted two weeks
ago from Triple-A. He had complete-game victories in his first two
starts before getting roughed up by San Diego on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It remained 1-0 until the seventh when Jerry Spradlin took over
for Byrd. With one out, Mark Grudzielanek hit a sharp one-hopper
off Spradlin's pitching hand for an infield hit and Johnson
followed with his 17th homer.

   &UR; MARKET TURMOIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service moved the following package of
stories on the day after the market suffered the second-largest
point drop in the Dow ever.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ The stock market Tuesday regained more than
half of the value it lost on Monday as trading volume set a record.
Traders and stock-market analysts said that big institutions, like
pension funds and insurance companies, took the lead in Tuesday's
buying, picking through big and small stocks that had been leveled
by Monday's selloff. By Edward Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-ASSESS (Undated) _ The smoke from the stock market
shootout of the last five trading days finally began to clear
Tuesday. As the Dow Jones industrial average rallied to close up
288.36 points, or 3.8 percent, investors began to ask: Where do we
go from here? By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-RUSSIA (Undated) _ More financial firms report losses
from Russia. By Peter Truell.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-IMF (Washington) _ The deepening worldwide economic
crisis has widened the gulf dividing Republicans over whether to
approve new financing for the International Monetary Fund. Congress
appeared certain to increase IMF financing when lawmakers left on a
monthlong recess in August. But as the Senate resumes business this
week, and the House due back next week, the new financing is now
teetering on the brink with each day's gloomy financial news. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-BUYBACKS (Undated) _ Are companies announcing stock
buybacks? By Melody Petersen.

   MARKET-SHORT (New York) _ How short-sellers fared in the
volatile market. By Reed Abelson.

   MARKET-VOLATILITY (Chicago) _ Trading in options and futures and
what that is doing to market volatility over all. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   CT-MARKET-MOOD (Greenwich, Conn.) _ The mood in Connecticut's
Fairfield County, whose suburban fortunes are closely tied to Wall
Street. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-VENEZUELA (Caracas) _ With investment holdings flying out
of this country, market analysts around the world widely agree that
Venezuela's economy has been crippled by an overvalued currency,
government inteference in monetary policy, and irresponsible
spending that relies too heavily on oil revenues. Many Venezuelans,
however, beg to disagree. Their political mood seems to be swinging
in precisely the opposite direction. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MARKET-LIFESTYLE (New York) _ A brief look at whether New
Yorkers, who are more dependent than others on the stock market's
fortunes, are beginning to rethink spending.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-FED (Washington) _ When faced with a Latin America that
could no longer pay its debts during the summer of 1982, the
Federal Reserve put aside its tight-money policy and cut interest
rates. When faced with a stomach-churning stock market drop in
October 1987, the Fed acted quickly to pump more money into the
financial system. Does that mean the central bank will now feel
compelled to bring rates down? Don't count on it. By Richard W.
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-MARGINS (Undated) _ Are brokerage firms, especially
Internet firms, experiencing capital problems? By Saul Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-RESPONSE (Washington) _ Can there be, and should there
be, a coordinated international response to the widening
international economic crisis? The Clinton administration tried to
protect the American economy from the crisis in Asia with a series
of firewalls, but the Russian crisis broke through. Now the
strategy seems to be changing. The favored option of the moment
seems to be reducing interest rates both here and abroad. By David
E. Sanger.

ANGELS LOSE IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Anaheim Angels have played well enough to make
their own breaks lately, but Tuesday night the breaks went to the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Indians won it 7-6 on Mark Whiten's one-out RBI
single in the bottom of the ninth before a sellout crowd of 43,184
at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The winning rally was set up on a chopper by Manny Ramirez off
pitcher Rich DeLucia's glove for a single and continued when David
Justice hit a liner that appeared to go right through first baseman
Darin Erstad's glove into right field.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ramirez dived back into first on the play, right fielder
Garret Anderson had a chance to throw Ramirez out at second, but
his throw was wide.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson failed in an attempt to bunt the runners over, but
it didn't matter. Whiten singled to left field on a 1-2 pitch from
Omar Olivares to win it. Indians reliever Steve Reed (2-2) got the
win over DeLucia (2-5).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels have won five of nine on the trip
to maintain their 2{-game lead over Texas. But they also know
there's a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the month of September,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``You talk about the postseason, this is where pennants are
won and lost. You play five months to get here, and you can lose it
in five days. Obviously, this is when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they learned anything from '95, it's how to play in this
month.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire game seemed to be like the ninth inning for the
Angels. Whiten's chopper up the middle in the second inning should
have been a double play, but it deflected off pitcher Chuck
Finley's glove and went into left field for an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Indians' Omar Vizquel hit a grounder to third
with the bases loaded and one out. Third baseman Troy Glaus would
have had a play at the plate, but he bobbled it and could only get
the out at third, allowing a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the fifth inning, center fielder Jim Edmonds overran a
ground-ball single by Ramirez. Edmonds took his eye off the ball
when he looked up to see Joey Cora, who was running hard to second
and had Edmonds thinking he might go to third. It went for a
two-base error and another Indians run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Edmonds said. ``The grass is cut two different
ways and (the ball) moves. I probably shouldn't have charged the
ball as hard as I did, I didn't need to. It went right under my
glove and probably cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those nights,'' Collins said. ``That's why
you've got to catch it. It's another example why defense is so
important. Maybe Roger Clemens can pitch without any defense, but I
don't know if anybody else can.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley couldn't Tuesday, but he wouldn't blame anybody but
himself. He gave up five runs and nine hits in 41/3 innings, his
shortest outing since being knocked out of the game by a line drive
in Kansas City on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the time of year to have a couple of bad starts,''
Finley said, referring to Tuesday's game and his previous start
last week against the Yankees. ``But you also have to look at the
fact they need me just as badly the next start. So you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from deficits of 3-0 and 5-3 to take a 6-5
lead on Gregg Jefferies' two-out, two-run bloop single in the
sixth. However, the bullpen couldn't hold the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holtz, who had been sent to the minors Aug. 3 to rediscover
his curveball and was recalled Tuesday, came in to face Justice
with runners on first and second and nobody out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-2 pitch, Justice threw his bat at a breaking ball out of
the strike zone but got enough of it to bloop it into shallow right
field for a game-tying, RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the pitch where I wanted to put it,'' Holtz said. ``I
was mentally and totally ready. I was geared up all game for a
situation like that. I made my pitch, and nine times out of 10 I
get him out.''

   SEATTLE _ Randy Johnson. Joey Cora. George Karl. Nate McMillan.
Sam Perkins. Chris Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The local casualty rate in the pro-sports-hero dodge is
unusually high in 1998, and four months remain.
</P>
<P>
   At least, the Seahawks appear to have reloaded. The Sonics? They
may never play again.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners?
</P>
<P>
   Well, pay attention this week. Nearly all the replacements will
be here by about Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Giomar Guevara. David Bell. Carlos Guillen. Mac Suzuki. Brett
Hinchcliffe. Freddy Garcia. David Holdridge.
</P>
<P>
   Your 1999 Mariners. More or less.
</P>
<P>
   You gotta learn these guys.
</P>
<P>
   For the first September in the last four, there's no scoreboard
watching. No jolt from a stretch drive rent-a-vet. No anticipation
of an Angels' choke, or a Rangers' wilt.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is a September the way it was for the first 18
years; the way it's been for baseball's two dozen also-ran clubs.
</P>
<P>
   A kiddy parade.
</P>
<P>
   A difference for the Mariners is the club has three major groups
to impress in the final month: Potential ticket buyers for an
expensive new ballpark; Ken Griffey Jr., and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   All three need to see that the Mariners' beleaguered, bashful
tycoons, the Shytys, are not trying to sneak a fire sale past their
partners in the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike what happened in Cleveland and Denver, where new parks
arrived with upswings in team fortunes, the Mariners risk being in
a deep swoon by the time the new yard opens July 15.
</P>
<P>
   That will make the blue skies/green grass honeymoon exceedingly
short and do little to inspire Griffey and Rodriguez, whose
contracts expire in 2000, to lock up early with long-term
extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to acquire immediate help in exchange for Johnson
was the final signal from the bosses that the 1998 season was being
written off.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trade of Cora was not nearly as hopeless, and actually
portends modest hope, since serviceable talent was received in
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A market for a 33-year-old second baseman who often misplaces
first base was believed non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners get lucky, Bell will be a near-equivalent to
Doug Strange in 1995, a solid utility bench guy who can play
multiple positions and pinch-hit decently. If they don't get lucky,
they haven't lost anything, which is more than can be said about
almost every other development this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entering the season, we thought we had a club that would stay
in the hunt for a division title, but it didn't work out,'' Woody
Woodward, the VP for baseball operations, said Tuesday. ``In
looking ahead, we had to make changes at a few positions. We've
moved Joey to a playoff club and gave him a chance to succeed,
while using the opening to take a look at a number of our young
infielders.''
</P>
<P>
   One among Bell, Guevara and Guillen will be Cora's replacement.
If third baseman Russ Davis continues to be Dr. Strangeglove, one
of the young guys will replace him. Among position players, that's
the likely limit of change.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they can induce first baseman David Segui to extend
his Seattle stay, the Mariners aren't going to add vets to the
regular lineup. Neither are they likely to seek an ace to replace
Johnson, nor a top closer, although a free-agent pursuit of a cheap
No. 4 or No. 5 starter is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership made intentions clear in July when it became known the
1999 player payroll would be little different than this year's $53
million. Mariner president Chuck Armstrong was quoted as saying his
charge next year was to achieve ``positive cash flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was said about winning, or a World Series, or staying up
with other teams with new stadiums. Increased revenues from the new
park will go not to new free agents, but to raises for current
players and to the owners' checking accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward did indicate that further bailouts on expensive veteran
contracts was probably over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel there are certain veterans who are very productive
and are important to the club's future,'' he said. The guess on the
higher-priced names on that list includes Segui, Edgar Martinez,
Jay Buhner and Dan Wilson, plus pitchers Jeff Fassero, Jamie Moyer
and Billy Swift.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because they are cheap and available, the farm-system
kids called up for Tuesday's roster expansion to 40 players will be
the fillers for the Mariners' numerous holes.
</P>
<P>
   None of them are close to sure-fire, but given the success the
club had this year in the journeyman free-agent pool that produced
Tony Fossas, Pat Listach and Glenallen Hill, the Mariners are as
well off to try to coax their own camels through the eye of a
needle instead of someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   So now that the pressure is off to love these guys, here's the
first submission for the 1999 club slogan: ``We Might Get Lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it won't make the Yankees stop dead. But it's hard to tap
your feet and hum to ``Positive Cash Flow.''

PANIAGUA'S PERFORMANCE PLEASES M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Mariner manager Lou Piniella talked about
right-handed reliever Jose Paniagua Tuesday night,
what-might-have-been crept into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had been here all year,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua might not be the entire remedy for a bullpen turnaround
the M's need next season, but his value continues to increase. It
reached another level at Fenway Park when he bailed starter Jamie
Moyer out of a seventh-inning bind, and then worked a scoreless
eighth inning as Seattle handed the Boston Red Sox a 7-3 loss
before 28,150 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has found a new home,'' Mariner pitching coach Stan
Williams said. ``He's done a great job for us everytime he has
pitched. His pitches have good location and he keeps them down.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Jay Buhner blasted a towering 441-foot home run
off the light standard in left field _ above the Green Monster and
three huge coke bottles _ and David Bell had a productive game as
the leadoff batter, Paniagua was instrumental in Seattle winning at
Fenway for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, closing in on the American League wild-card playoff
spot, fell behind 4-2 in the seventh when the Mariners scored two
runs off reliever Derek Lowe, whose throwing error on Dan Wilson's
sacrifice bunt scored Buhner. Bell delivered the go-ahead run with
a grounder to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams surprisingly conceded the go-ahead
run. He undoubtedly expected his team to pull out another
come-from-behind win. They've done it 41 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   The M's were beaten twice this season at Fenway because of
ninth-inning collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua retired John Valentin on a pop-up to first baseman
David Segui and walked Mo Vaughn on a full-count pitch to load the
bases, but retired Nomar Garciaparra on a fly ball to Buhner in
shallow right field.
</P>
<P>
   Although the walk to Vaughn put the potential run in scoring
position, Stan Williams said he liked Paniagua's approach to facing
the dangerous Red Sox first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenged him, and that's what you want to see,'' Williams
said. ``Even on the full-count pitch, he never gave in. He didn't
walk Mo because he was pitching around him. He walked him pitching
aggressively and there is nothing wrong with that. I like the kid's
makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners added three insurance runs in the eighth inning.
Wilson, returning to the lineup after missing nearly six weeks with
torn ligaments in his left ankle, contributed a run-scoring double
in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't miss a beat,'' Piniella said. ``We tested him with
some pitches in the dirt, but he held up well.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua has made eight relief appearances, allowing one earned
run in 91/3 innings, stranding five of the seven runners he
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Mike Timlin pitched the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked Darren Lewis leading off, many Mariner fans
watching at home probably had flashbacks to April 10. The Mariners
took a 7-3 lead into the ninth inning but didn't retire a batter as
Boston scored seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing two straight balls to Valentin, Timlin got a
visit from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan told me I was rushing and I wasn't getting on top of the
ball,'' Timlin said. ``I slowed it down after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin bounced into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first game we've won here (this season),''
Piniella said. ``We let a couple get away that we should have won.
But, we got almost seven innings from Jamie, excellent relief from
Paniagua and Timlin and won a ballgame.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WITH their she-peat complete, I have a request. Might the Comets
play the Quest?
</P>
<P>
   Houston's twice WNBA champions vs. Columbus' twice American
Basketball League champions is the only way to settle the issue of
``Who's No. 1?'' in the world of women's hoops. But because it
never will happen, of course, such a Super Bowl of ladyball, we're
simply going to have to make a judgment call here.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided to vote for the Comets. How about you?
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA's second season ended Tuesday night the same as its
first one had, with the Comets up there soaring among the stars,
looking down upon the hoi polloi. Having risen, Phoenix-like, from
the brink of defeat in overtime against Phoenix on Saturday after a
Game 1 loss, they claimed a second title _ 80-71 _ that was at once
far easier and infinitely harder than the historic first one.
</P>
<P>
   Three in a row, and I suppose we'll have to start calling them a
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   This team, blessed with two superstars and a season's worth of
experience playing together behind it, was clearly better than last
year's. You can't be a whole lot cleaner than 31-4, even if you are
the Bulls. But internal pressures over the course of the longer
season created challenges that coach Van Chancellor never had to
confront with everyone joy-riding through the giddy inaugural run.
</P>
<P>
   In '97, with most of the Comets returning from overseas exile,
the women were delighted just to be back in front of friends,
family and cheery English-speaking fans who didn't fling sharp
objects at them on the court. But in '98, reality set in.
Inevitably, egos and jealousies collided. Soap-opera scripts
evolved. Feelings got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Comets became the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Right down to the Clutch City script and, ultimately, the
back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, we must give coach Van the Man a promotion. With two
rings and one stomach bloated with antacids, he's now the WNBA's
emperor, not a mere Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were dead in the water Saturday,'' he said. ``But
the good Lord won one for me Saturday, and the players won one for
me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor offered considerable assistance. He X'd and O'd
rings around the Mercury's Cheryl Miller, who dresses like a
gangster and exhorts like a preacher but doesn't bring much to the
table when the heat is on and short-notice strategic decisions must
be made.
</P>
<P>
   She failed as a coach and as a prognosticator. Guess that ``bad
boy'' (championship) of hers won't be going back to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had no answers for the Comets' late charge in Game 2,
when the mercurial Mercury couldn't cling to a 12-point lead with
seven minutes left. And her brain froze up again down the stretch
in Game 3, after an early second-half spurt twice provided
two-point leads, the latter with 13:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   Later, her jaws wouldn't work, either. Apparently, she had flat
trash-talked herself out, judging by the plethora of sullen
one-word responses to reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Miller's defense, she was up against a superior
opponent _ and a superior player. Collectively, the Mercury had no
answer for Cynthia Cooper, the repeat Most Valuable Player who
contributed a typical monster night, scoring 23 points and
assisting six times. Coop's sublime game is a cut above the rest
despite her 35 years. We in Houston have been blessed by her
presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheryl Swoopes, a lass of 27, showed signs late that the
Comets will indeed be her team soon, as was originally ordained by
the WNBA's talent-seeding procedures. Although pregnancy and the
birth of her son, Jordan, limited her role to bit-part status last
season _ she rode the bench in the second half of last summer's
championship game _ she lately has begun to resemble the Madam
Legend she made herself at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   With the Comets up only 62-59 and less than eight minutes to go,
she swished two of her nine free throws, then dished a beautiful
assist through a tangle of bodies to Janeth Arcain underneath.
Finally, she administered a brutal facial to Brandy Reed, after
which she outran the Mercury to the other end, taking a feed from
Kim Perrot for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sheryl swooped to conquer. The Mercury was pretty much
toast there.
</P>
<P>
   The sold-out Compaq Center screamed its approval and never did
settle down thereafter, erupting as riotously at the close as any
Rockets crowd has. Given the labor stalemate threatening the coming
NBA season, that might have been the last gasp of hooping and
hollering we'll witness in the building for a while.
</P>
<P>
   So who's got next? Perhaps the Comets, if the boys and their
bosses can't make peace.

HUSKIES' NEW PUNTER HAS APPOINTMENT IN TEMPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He will punt for the University of Washington on
Saturday night in Tempe, Ariz., in front of 72,000 boisterous fans
and 11 Arizona State special-teams mercenaries who will figure he
can't handle a rush.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from his first college football game, and Ryan
Fleming knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' he said. ``I'm so excited, I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Fleming, 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, can't tell you much
about his first college game. He wasn't even there. He was sitting
in the school library, brooding, at St. Olaf's College in
Northfield, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, an Irish Catholic out of Seattle Prep, had offered up
his 3.8 grade point average and 1,300 SAT score to Notre Dame, and
been rejected. So he settled on St. Olaf's, a Lutheran school
outside the Twin Cities, in a state peopled by relatives from both
sides of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Son of the UW department chairman in biostatistics, Fleming had
been a soccer player who burned out, finally joining the Seattle
Prep football team as a senior. He had a modest season punting for
a good team, averaging only 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He tried out for the St. Olaf's football team and soon found
himself outkicking the No. 1 punter, a transfer from a Division 1-A
school. Then the time came for the bus trip to Luther College in
Decorah, Iowa, and Fleming was left home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out it was by accident,'' he recalls. ``They left my
name off the (travel) list.''
</P>
<P>
   With a radio plug in his ear, Fleming sat there that Saturday in
1996, trying to study but unable, mad at the injustice that
grounded him. His time would come, though. Three games into the
season, he became the No. 1 punter and averaged a league-record
42.2 yards on a 2-8 team that played Augsburg and Carleton and
Gustavus Adolphus in the quaint, NCAA Division III Minnesota
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Half a continent away, Tom and Joli Fleming had season tickets
at the University of Washington. They were witnessing what a lot of
people have noticed about Husky punting. It comes and goes, mostly
goes. In no season in the 1990s has Washington averaged as much as
40 yards, even in the glory years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the season ended, I thought about checking out
Washington,'' Fleming said. ``I thought I should just give it a
try. If I came here and didn't like it, I could always come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Huskies were skeptical, but desperation begets
open minds. As UW coach Jim Lambright puts it, ``You're not ready
to throw your hands up and jump and cheer because you've got
somebody that's gonna save your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington liked Fleming's flexibility and thought it might have
something. Fleming competed evenly in the spring with scholarship
punter Sean O'Laughlin, who since last season was married and had a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fleming) tested out better than Sean, ran better, which
showed more commitment,'' Lambright said. ``Everything you were
weighing gave the pluses back to Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how Fleming might handle a low snap or a
thunder rush from a Sun Devil who might leak free. But Lambright is
convinced the Huskies at least will learn one thing from St.
Olaf's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make sure,'' Lambright smiled, ``that he's on the
plane.''

ATLANTA _ You measure milk by the quart, gas by the gallon, steel
by the ton.
</P>
<P>
   And in the National League, you measure everything and everybody
against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker did after
last year's playoff wipeout and concluded that his team couldn't.
Measure up, that is. Not against the Braves. At least, not without
elevator shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious way to get a lift up there with the big boys would
have been to engage in an arms race. Spend the big money, go for
the big names, and try to assemble enough strength in the biceps
department so that in a return postseason engagement with Atlanta,
the Astros no longer would have to feel as helpless as Pee Wee
Herman in an arm-wrestling match with Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight in the rubber game of the playoff preview, the Braves
finally get a taste of their own medicine when the Grand One takes
the mound against Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an equally valid reason for the Braves to feel
just the slightest bit concerned about another meeting with the
Astros in the postseason, it is because Hunsicker correctly
concluded that it would not have been prudent to try to fight fire
with fire against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using barrels of Drayton McLane Jr.'s cash to bring
in pitching talent, Hunsicker chose to bolster the offense, and it
is the most solid, potent every-day lineup in club history, as much
as Johnson, that makes the Astros a threat to play deep into
October.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's 6-4 loss notwithstanding, this now is an Astros
team to be feared and not only on the nights when Johnson pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After using a six-single rally in the ninth inning that chased
John Smoltz and produced their 41st come-from-behind win Monday,
the Astros spotted the Braves a couple of homers by Chipper Jones
and Javy Lopez for a 4-1 lead and did battle back to tie the game
at 4-all against Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we fell behind the second time, I still thought we
had a chance,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``And we did hit a lot
of balls hard in the late innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, ask the Braves if they feel confident that they can
outscore this Astros team 16-5 in a cavalier three-game sweep. Ask
them if they expect the killer breeze from a combined .054 batting
average by Craig Biggio, Derek Bell and Jeff Bagwell to be all
they'll feel this time around from Houston bats.
</P>
<P>
   Not with Moises Alou playing like the National League MVP and
not with an overall Astros lineup that is deeper than an honors
philosophy class.
</P>
<P>
   In this year of Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the homer, don't
forget that it is the Astros who lead the NL in runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most most glaring weakness a year ago was being too
dependent on Jeff Bagwell to drive in runs,'' Hunsicker said.
``Sure, we could always use pitching. Everybody always can. But it
was more prudent, I think, for our club to spend our money on
getting another RBI man in the middle of our lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to be willing to acknowledge, in our position as
a mid-market club, is that you're always going to be an underdog to
a team with deep resources like Atlanta. While I believe that
pitching is the cornerstone to most championship teams, we're just
never going to be able to stack up talent in that area like the
Braves. They can keep throwing money out there, good after bad, if
that's what it takes. That's just a fact of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fact is that these Astros would not be this deep, this
solid across the board if they had re-signed free-agent starter
Darryl Kile. For though the deal to bring in Alou was made two
months before Kile's decision to run for the hills of Colorado,
keeping him likely would have meant giving up key parts of the team
in order to keep the budget in balance.
</P>
<P>
   It still says here the Astros' bid to re-sign Kile was a
public-relations ploy to keep the locals happy. Their true
intentions all along were to come up just short in the bidding, let
him go and spend the money in a wiser fashion, on players who could
help every day. It was a shrewd move and the right one. Now look
where it has gotten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tie up 40 percent of your salary in pitching, you might
not have an offense strong enough to do the job,'' Hunsicker said.
``If your pitchers can't match up game-for-game with the Braves _
and they're the best, the yardstick _ then you still lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, by solidifying our offense, we've given ourselves a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The season series is 4-4. Total runs are 27-26.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Randy Johnson. That's the Braves, a year later, holding
their breath.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Pitching matchups of this caliber usually are reserved
for opening day or the playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This certainly isn't April, but it might feel a little bit like
October tonight when Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux do battle at
Turner Field. On paper, it's an attraction more cuddly than the
Beanie Babies the Braves are giving away.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some confusion regarding the authenticity of some
Beanie Babies, but there's no doubt about Johnson vs. Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   This is the genuine article.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is quite simply the best pitcher of his generation,
having won four Cy Young Awards and anchoring perhaps the best
starting rotation in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might very well be the most dominant lefthanded pitcher
ever to take the mound. He intimidates hitters with his 6-10 frame,
menacing stare and fastball that reaches 98 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   At approximately 6:40 p.m. CDT, the job of being a big-league
hitter will be about as desirable as that of a crash-test dummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be awesome,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``You're talking about two of the best when you talk about
Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux. When I used to watch Randy on TV, I
just thought he was a chucker (a hard thrower), but he has an
excellent idea of how to pitch, just like Maddux. They're both
great pitchers. It's going to be fun for the fans and players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are very familiar with Maddux, who is 17-8 with a
2.12 earned run average against them in his career. However, most
of the Braves will be facing the Big Unit for the first time.
Johnson's last start against the Braves was May 7, 1989 _ 20 days
before the Montreal Expos traded him to the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just another major-league pitcher that we have to try to
go out there and beat,'' Braves center fielder Andruw Jones said.
``We just have to see what he's got. We can't get scared by the
name `Big Unit.' We just have to wait for our pitches and hit
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easier said than done, and Johnson has the numbers to
prove it. Since joining the Astros in a July 31 trade, Johnson is
5-1 with a 1.17 ERA. He has allowed only 31 hits in 46 innings
while striking out 61 batters, including 16 in his last outing.
</P>
<P>
   It's reasonable to assume some of Johnson's success could be
attributed to the fact he's facing a lot of hitters who never have
looked down the barrel of his rifle-like left arm. Then again,
Johnson hasn't seen most of his new opponents, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who it's an advantage for,'' Jones said. ``I
guess we'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Those looking ahead to the postseason already are
second-guessing Astros manager Larry Dierker for allowing Johnson
to face the Braves tonight, the theory being it would give them a
chance to get a feel for him in anticipation of a possible playoff
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Randy wasn't pitching here,'' Biggio said. ``I think it
would be better if they didn't get to see him. But on the other
hand, Randy's stuff is nasty enough that you could see it as many
times as you wanted, and you still might not be able to do anything
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dierker: ``I never gave it thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox is glad he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather see the guy,'' Cox said. ``I don't think it's the
most important thing in the world, but at least you'll know how
he's throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two games of the Astros-Braves series attracted an
average of 32,526 fans to Turner Field, but the marquee pitching
matchup and the Beanie Babies giveaway will help tonight's crowd
easily surpass that figure. Braves officials are expecting a crowd
in excess of 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy was a big deal in the American League, and he's a big
deal over here, too,'' Cox said. ``People want to see him, and I
want to see him, too.''
</P>

PADRES TOP METS, 9-8

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Mike Piazza could not save the New York Mets from
falling out of the National League wild-card lead for the first
time since Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza ripped a three-run homer on Tuesday night off Dan Miceli,
who had gone 20 straight outings without allowing a run, capping a
furious seven-run rally in the seventh inning that wiped out a
five-run Padres lead.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope of keeping pace with the Cubs vanished when Turk
Wendell allowed a game-tying two-run home run to Steve Finley with
no one out in the seventh, and then Dennis Cook forced in the
go-ahead run by walking Quilvio Veras on a full count with the
bases loaded and one out, giving San Diego a wild 9-8 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Piazza's heroics _ and those of role players such as
Matt Franco, Jay Payton and Jorge Fabregas _ in the end, the Mets
(76-62) had fought all the way back for naught. And, after
splitting the first eight games of this nine-game West Coast swing,
they still have one more to play here before they can head home for
a much-needed day off.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had not entered of September with a legitimate shot at
the post-season since 1990. Not until Tuesday, that is. But after
Greg Vaughn blasted his 46th and 47th home runs of the season off
Hideo Nomo just as Tony Gwynn came off the disabled list to go 3
for 3 with a pair of runs batted in, the Mets were in danger of
dropping behind the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Mets, who had sleep-walked through the first six
innings against a 29-year-old rookie named Stan Spencer, who was
making just his second major league start, erupted in the seventh
against Spencer and Miceli to erase a 6-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo followed his best outing as a Met with a dismal
performance, while the Mets' hitters were equally ineffective
against Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer held the Mets hitless for four and one-third innings
before Lenny Harris singled. Spencer then allowed a solo homer to
Edgardo Alfonzo with one out in the sixth and another to Brian
McRae leading off the seventh. The homer was McRae's career-high
20th of the season to go with his 20 stolen bases. After Harris
followed with a double to deep right center, Spencer was done for
the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, who replaced John Olerud, singled Harris home from third
on a two-out, 1-2 count off reliever Dan Miceli to pull the Mets
within 6-3. The fun was just beginning. Payton, on the first pitch
of his first major league at-bat, singled to left to move Harris to
second. Alfonzo walked to load the bases. And up stepped Fabregas
to pinch-hit for Mel Rojas, in what had been Olerud's spot.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it looked as if Mets Manager Bobby Valentine had
given up on the game too soon by making a triple switch on defense
with his team trailing by 6-1 heading into the sixth. But Valentine
has faith in his role players. And Fabregas, like Franco had before
him, would reward that faith.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 1-2, in the count, he grounded a two-run single into right
to make the score 6-5. With runners on first and second, up stepped
Piazza, who has been carrying the Mets for almost a month now.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza had come into the game hitting .273 with runners in
scoring position as a Met. According to the Elias Sports Bureau,
Piazza was hitting only .224 with men in scoring position through
Aug. 16. Since then, he had been 9 for 21 (.429) with 2 homers and
14 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Piazza drilled a 2-1 pitch from Miceli into the seats
in right center field for his 27th homer of the year and a
short-lived 8-6 New York lead.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's homer ruined what had been a sparkling outing by
Spencer. In all, the 29-year-old right-hander was charged with
three runs and five hits in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had made it easy on Spencer by knocking Nomo around
for five runs on five hits in the right-hander's four-inning stint.
Nomo was coming off a complete-game, three-hit victory in San
Francisco six days ago. But he walked the first batter he faced,
Veras, a portent of bad things.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Gwynn, who had missed San Diego's last 18 games with
an inflamed left Achilles' tendon and was playing for the first
time since Aug. 12. When Gwynn went on the disabled list, he was on
a 19-for-37 tear, which had lifted his average from .303 to .323.
And on the first pitch the eight-time National League batting
champion saw from Nomo, Gwynn doubled to right off Harris' glove
for a 1-0 Padres lead.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Vaughn _ whose stellar season has been lost in
the race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to break Roger Maris'
single-season home run mark _ drilled a 1-2 offering 439 feet to
left field for a two-run homer and a 3-0 lead. It was his 47th of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo responded by walking the next two batters he faced, before
somehow escaping the inning without further damage. But Vaughn led
off the third with his second homer of the night, a 393-foot shot
to left. And then Chris Gomez led off the fourth with a double, was
sacrificed to second and scored on a Veras sacrifice fly. It was
5-0 San Diego, and Nomo's evening was just about finished.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Astros rookie pitcher Scott Elarton learned another
major-league lesson Tuesday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``First loss I just don't want to get used to it,'' Elarton said
following a 6-4 setback to the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The blame didn't fall completely on Elarton, who allowed the
Braves' go-ahead run in the sixth after the Astros had rallied from
a 4-1 deficit to tie the game. Sean Bergman lasted only four
innings, surrendering four runs on seven hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get that far behind (Atlanta) and hope to beat
them,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``But we did get back to
tie it. Even after we got back behind, I thought we hit the ball
well and put some pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, Elarton (1-1) sandwiched walks to
Andruw Jones and Curtis Pride around a Michael Tucker popout. Ozzie
Guillen broke the 4-4 tie with an RBI single just over the head of
second baseman Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go through some struggles. It's really the first
time I've struggled since I got here,'' said Elarton, called up
from Class AAA in June for two starts before earning a permanent
spot on the club in the bullpen. ``Eventually, it's going to
happen. I'll work through it, and next time out I'll get back to
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make the perfect pitch (to Jones), maybe too nasty.
I usually don't walk a whole lot of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio gave the Astros an early lead with a leadoff home run off
Braves starter Denny Neagle (14-11), his fourth to begin a game
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The game remained 1-0 until Bergman ran into trouble in the
fourth. After allowing several hard-hit balls earlier, he served up
a pair of home runs four batters apart. Chipper Jones led off the
inning with his 32nd home run of the season to tie the game at 1.
Andres Galarraga walked, Ryan Klesko singled, and Javy Lopez
smashed a three-run homer to left field _ his 32nd of the season _
to put the Braves ahead 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros and Braves have split the first two games of this
series and stand 4-4 for the season. If there's a silver lining for
the Astros in facing Greg Maddux tonight, it's that Eddie Perez
will catch for the Braves in place of Lopez, who has terrorized the
Astros this year and has seven home runs and 13 RBIs in his last
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who continues to struggle after going 1-2 in five
starts last month, has allowed nine runs and 15 hits in his last 9
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in trouble most of the night,'' Bergman said. ``I got
some double-play balls to get out (of some jams) early. The fourth
inning I made a couple of bad pitches that hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as things appeared on the surface, the resilient Astros,
who scored three times in the ninth to win Monday's series opener,
staged yet another improbable rally against Neagle. In the fifth,
Bill Spiers tripled Biggio home and scored on Derek Bell's
groundout. In the sixth, Ricky Gutierrez tripled and scored the
tying run on Carl Everett's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind in the bottom of the sixth, the Astros
squandered a golden opportunity in the top of the seventh after
Bell reached on an error and Moises Alou walked. With one out and
Odaliz Perez on the mound, Dierker inserted pinch hitter Mitch
Meluskey, who grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he opted not to use Sean Berry as a pinch hitter at
the time, instead saving him in anticipation the Braves would bring
in John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Rocker would come in late in the game,'' Dierker
said. ``Mitch walked 85 times and hit .350 down there (at New
Orleans). He's a tremendous on-base hitter. And here's a guy
(Perez) in his first big-league game, and he's already wild. I
thought there was a chance he might walk him.''

TOO NICE, TOO PERFECT TO COME TRUE AGAIN  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the history of major league baseball, no pitcher
has ever pitched two perfect games, so who could have thought on
Tuesday night that David Wells would pitch his second one in three
and a half months? The Oakland A's, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about it in the dugout, no doubt about that,''
Jason Giambi, the Oakland first baseman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi is the reason Wells lost his chance for a historic second
perfect game. After the New York Yankees' guileful left-hander
retired the first 20 batters he faced, Giambi poked an 0-2
curveball to center field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Blowers would lead off the next inning with another single,
but it was Giambi's hit that burst Wells's magical balloon and
ended his quest for history.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this Yankees season is all about: history. Every
step they have taken this season either makes history or puts them
closer to making more history. Securing their 99th victory with a
7-0 decision over the Athletics, the Yankees on Wednesday night can
reach No. 100 sooner than any team has in major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of even more history lies beyond that victory.
But all of the victories the Yankees could amass this season would
not have matched the pitching of two perfect games by one pitcher.
In fact, two perfect games by the same pitcher might have exceeded
the remarkable feat of two hitters breaking the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Wells had pitched to only 27 members of the
Minnesota Twins at the Stadium on May 17, the Athletics feared they
could join the Twins in the ignominy of not putting a man on base
against the same pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had great stuff, unbelievable stuff,'' Giambi said.
``Everything and anything was working. He was pitching me in with
fastballs and throwing me curveballs that had a late break. His
fastball was running in hard. It was the best stuff I've ever seen
him have definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   But after he threw strikes to Giambi with his first two pitches
with two out in the seventh inning, Wells threw a curveball up in
the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit if off the end of my bat,'' Giambi said. ``I just
happened to get good placement. When I started running down the
baseline, I saw where I hit it, the placement on it. I knew it was
up the middle enough that it would get through.''
</P>
<P>
   What did he think as he saw it fall in for a hit? ``Thank God,''
he said, letting out the same kind of sigh he probably released
when the ball hit the ground in center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics were relieved that they did not become Wells'
second perfect victims, but they did not appreciate the pitch calls
of the plate umpire, Jim McKean. In fact, their catcher, A.J.
Hinch, and their manager, Art Howe, got themselves thrown out of
the game in the sixth inning by expressing their opinions of what
they felt was McKean's expanded strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Howe especially believed McKean might help Wells get the perfect
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I voiced my displeasure,'' Howe said. ``I had
numerous complaints about the size of the strike zone the first
half of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager referred to the strike zone as ``very generous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer's so good he doesn't need help,'' Howe said. ``But I
don't want to detract from his performance. It was outstanding. He
pitched a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinch, who said he has good relations with umpires because he is
behind the plate with them all the time, said he didn't intend to
get himself ejected after he took a third strike, making him one of
seven batters who went down that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation was built around frustration,'' Hinch
said. ``You've got 40-plus thousand people standing up cheering.
Wells is pitching a perfect game. I've battled him. I was deep in
the count. I had just fouled off a tough pitch. I felt the ball was
inside. There was a lot of frustration out of a lot of avenues. I
just snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   He also snapped his bat, slamming it against the ground and
winding up with a broken weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean for it to break,'' Hinch said. ``I slammed it
down maybe a little harder than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The catcher said he didn't remember McKean having such a big
strike zone, then added: ``But I don't know that we've faced a
pitcher like Wells that continually threw in there every time. If
the umpire's going to give you any liberty at all, he put it in
there nine out of 10 times. Who do you blame, the umpire or David
Wells?''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson, who has a long history of disputing umpires'
strike calls against him, took called third strikes his first two
times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a hitter, you feel you know what a strike is and
what isn't a strike,'' Henderson said. ``He was calling a different
ball game. He was giving him a lot of pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Henderson saying McKean was helping Wells pitch a perfect
game? ``It helps,'' he said, ``but Wells is a great pitcher. You
can't take anything away from him. All he can do is throw the ball
in the location where he hits the spot. Then it's up to the umpire
to make the call. He was just doing what he thought was right. He
got the strike and stayed there. He kept painting that same spot,
the ball inside, the ball outside. The umpire was with him so he
kept putting it where he was calling a strike. He didn't have to
put the ball over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wells had been forced to put the ball over the plate,
Henderson said, it might have been a different game. But he
nevertheless credited Wells with a fine performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the advantage, but I also felt he didn't need the
advantage,'' the veteran leadoff hitter said. He's such a great
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Wells succeeded in retiring another seven batters without
allowing a hit or a base runner, he would have become an immortal
pitcher.

RAIL PACKAGE OFFERS ITINERARY CHOICES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The basic two-day Rocky
Mountaineer rail package works this way:
</P>
<P>
   Early morning departures are scheduled, roughly on alternate
days (with no Saturday departures), in each direction: eastbound
from Vancouver, British Columbia; westbound from Calgary and
Jasper, Alberta. All passengers travel between Vancouver and
Kamloops, British Columbia; the train is split between Kamloops and
the Alberta destinations. The only stops en route are for crew
changes; passengers must remain aboard.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of the passengers choose the Vancouver-Banff
itinerary (585 miles). About 25 percent continue from Banff to
Calgary (another 82 miles) or travel between Vancouver and Jasper
(550 total miles).
</P>
<P>
   Overnight accommodations in a Kamloops hotel or motel _ with bus
transfers _ are included in the basic fare.
</P>
<P>
   While not inexpensive, the excursion is more affordable than
ever for Americans, thanks to the current favorable exchange rate
between the U.S. and Canadian dollars ($1 equals about $1.50). Two
service levels and price structures are offered:
</P>
<P>
   _ Easily the most popular is the line's Signature Service.
Assigned seats are provided in standard, single-level but spacious
cars that carry about 50 passengers each with one attendant. Each
car has picture windows and a small platform. A selection of cold
breakfasts and lunches are served both days airline-style at seats
(but the comfort level equals or surpasses most airlines'
first-class sections).
</P>
<P>
   One-way Signature Service costs through September, based on
double-occupancy and including four meals and the Kamloops lodging,
are $468 U.S. per person between Vancouver and Banff or Jasper and
$516 U.S. Vancouver-Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers can cut significantly into that cost by converting and
paying in Canadian funds; the Vancouver-Banff fare, for instance,
is $585 Canadian, which equates to about $390 U.S.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rocky Mountaineer's Goldfleaf dome-car service _ available
between Vancouver and Banff or Calgary but not to Jasper _ offers a
top-of-the-line experience. Views are more expansive from the upper
level. And with one dome car situated at the rear of the train
between Kamloops and Banff, its outdoor platform becomes a popular
gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   Four attendants, three dining personnel and a Dome manager cater
to Goldleaf passengers. Hot meals are served in the lower-level
dining room, and an elevator is available for passengers unable to
negotiate steep spiral staircases.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast options include Alberta steak and eggs, eggs Benedict
and a heaping Mountaineer platter that features smoked salmon,
fresh fruit, Belgian waffles, sausage, eggs and potatoes. Gourmet
luncheon entrees are preceded by soup or salad. Calgary-bound
passengers are provided dinner just before arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Goldleaf passengers also are given dinner vouchers (valued at
about $20) to use at their Kamloops hotel. Unlike Signature
Service, whose participants are allowed only carry-on luggage in
Kamloops, luggage is trucked and placed in hotel rooms prior to
check-in.
</P>
<P>
   Snacks and all nonalcoholic beverages are complimentary in both
categories; wine, beer and cocktails can be purchased. (Goldleaf
passengers are offered complimentary wine at lunch.)
</P>
<P>
   Goldleaf Service double-occupancy costs through September are
$868 U.S. between Vancouver and Banff and $948 U.S. between
Vancouver and Calgary. By paying instead in Canadian currency
($1,085 and $1,185, respectively), those costs can be reduced _ at
current exchange rates _ by about $150 U.S.
</P>
<P>
   One-way fares in both categories are about $80 lower for October
departures, and discounts are available for round-trip journeys.
Because only one hotel is involved, single supplements cost only
about $50.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers share a smoking car (the only place on the train
where smoking is permitted). Special-interest groups can reserve
cars outfitted to host weddings, corporate receptions, lecture
tours, seminars and other events.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen departures in each direction are scheduled in
September. The final 1999 departure is Oct. 15 from Vancouver. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Before or after the train journey, Rocky Mountaineer Railtours
also offers a wide range of group or independent tours by bus,
minivan, car or motorhome. Some combine all three train segments
with land packages in British Columbia and Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Tours range in length from three to 11 nights. Costs vary widely
depending on the scope and hotel categories chosen: September
prices start at $836 U.S. ($1,045 Canadian) for a three-night,
four-day excursion that includes one night each in Vancouver,
Kamloops and Banff; prices start at $2,128 U.S. ($2,660 Canadian)
for an 11-night, 12-day circle trip that allows three nights each
in Banff, Jasper and Vancouver.

EXPERIENCE CANADIAN SPLENDOR FROM A TRAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Their colorful names merely hint
at the splendor of each panoramic vista on display from the upper
level of the Rocky Mountaineer's glass-enclosed dome carriage:
</P>
<P>
   Hell's Gate. Suicide Rapids. Rainbow Canyon. Jaws of Death
Gorge. Salmon Arm. Kicking Horse River. Three Sisters Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ready to look to the left in one mile,'' an attendant
encourages as the train twists through the Canadian wilderness.
``At eye level, we'll pass a huge osprey nest atop a telephone
pole. Mama probably will be out in search of food. But look
closely, and you'll see a baby in the nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and don't forget to keep watching for those fuzzy little
things. You never know when we'll come upon a bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Care for cheese, crackers and a glass of wine to tide you over
until lunch is served in the dining room downstairs?'' another
attendant is asking at your seat. She goes on to explain that
today's midday repast, in this ``Goldleaf Service'' dome car, will
require a choice from among six entrees, including fresh British
Columbia salmon and roasted Alberta Angus beef striploin.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. First, a brief history lesson:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, at Monte Creek, or Ducks Station, as it was known at the
time, Billy Miner _ the greatest train robber ever _ made his
biggest mistake.'' The first attendant again has the audience at
rapt attention. ``Billy robbed the wrong train. Got only $15 and
some liver pills. He was captured for an $11,500 dead-or-alive
reward and sent to prison in Kamloops.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel experience doesn't get much better than this. At
least not for those who appreciate gorgeous scenery, wondrous
wildlife, caring service, stellar cuisine, rich tradition and a
tinge of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Only passengers addicted to a midday nap likely will be
disappointed by this Rocky Mountaineer Railtours two-day excursion,
which operates from early May to mid-October (with tentative plans
for additional Christmas-season trips) in either direction between
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Banff or Calgary, Alberta _ or
between Vancouver and Jasper, Alberta, on a partially different
route.
</P>
<P>
   Close your eyes, even for an instant, and risk missing the
majesty of a waterfall as it cascades seemingly forever down a
mountainside; the spunk of expert rafters who tumble almost
out-of-control over boulder-strewn rapids swirling just beyond the
train windows; or the how-dare-you-invade-my-natural-habitat,
point-blank stare of an elk or moose or bighorn sheep languishing
near the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   On carriages in two price categories _ the white-gloved Goldleaf
Service and more economical Signature Service _ an open-air viewing
platform, varying in size, enhances unrestricted viewing and
photography angles.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 optional land packages also are available. Among
temptations beyond the train departure and arrival cities:
enchanting Victoria, the year-round Whistler resort and the
Okanagan Valley wine-growing region in British Columbia; and Banff,
Lake Louise and the Columbia Icefield in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocky Mountaineer has revitalized passenger train travel
through some of North America's most spectacular countryside _ on
tracks that offer testimony to the courage, perseverance and
brilliance of 19th-century railroad pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The stories from that era, all given new meaning during this
fascinating journey, are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers relive:
</P>
<P>
   _ The foresight of Canadian Pacific Railways president William
Van Horne who, in spearheading development of a rail line through
uncharted territories almost 120 years ago (and plotting the first
CP hotels as convenient rest stops along the route), declared, ``If
we can't export the scenery, we'll import the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The sacrifice made by hundreds of laborers, including many
Chinese, who perished while bringing the project to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pride in driving the last spike of the Canadian Pacific at
Craigellachie, British Columbia, marking completion of Canada's
first transcontinental railway on Nov. 7, 1885, and in completing
the rival Canadian Northern (now Canadian National) route 30 years
later. (Today, the Rocky Mountaineer uses tracks owned by both
companies.)
</P>
<P>
   Almost as remarkable is that prior to this decade, few
modern-day travelers had the opportunity to visually appreciate
these engineering masterpieces. Or a landscape of steep and narrow
canyons, roaring rivers, crystal-clear lakes, valleys blanketed by
wildflowers and _ even in late-summer _ snow-capped mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1988, scheduled passenger trains inexplicably covered most
of the region only at night. For two subsequent years,
government-owned VIA Rail experimented with daylight service; then,
proposals were accepted toward turning the project over to private
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The first privately operated Rocky Mountaineer rolled out of
Vancouver on May 27, 1990. Its annual growth rate is now 25 percent
to 30 percent, according to a company spokesman, but don't fret
about getting a seat at the last moment: As bookings increase,
train carriages are added; on Sept. 12, 1996, a Canadian record was
established when 37 cars carried 1,100 passengers, and
blue-and-white Rocky Mountaineer engines routinely pull 20-25
carriages in midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Only a portion of the route _ between Kamloops and Calgary or
Jasper _ actually winds through the Rockies. But except for about
two hours departing (or approaching) Vancouver, scenic wonders
abound. A 16-page guide placed at each seat includes maps,
anecdotes and highlight listings that correspond to mileposts
situated beside the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the journey between Vancouver and Kamloops winds along
the walls of the Fraser and Thompson river canyons. During late
summer, bright red salmon are observed making their way eastward to
the Adams River spawning grounds. For about 10 miles, the train
proceeds through Rainbow Canyon, so named because minerals in the
rocks reflect a rainbow of colors and give the rocks a painted
look.
</P>
<P>
   At Hell's Gate, about 120 miles from Vancouver, more than 200
gallons of water per minute surge through a 110-foot-wide gorge.
Just as magnetizing is the Jaws of Death Gorge 30 miles to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Even more riveting is the Kamloops-Banff segment, during which
the eastbound Rocky Mountaineer follows lovely Shuswap Lake, passes
through Sicamous _ dubbed the ``houseboat capital'' of Canada _ and
Craigellachie, then climbs into the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Train attendants provide background on many landmarks, including
Salmon Arm, a popular retirement center 60 miles east of Kamloops
and so named because spawning salmon once were so abundant that
settlers pitch-forked them from the river to use for fertilizer on
their fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Salmon Bay Nature Enhancement Reserve is home to more
than 150 species of birds and waterfowl. But a trip earlier this
month brought a sobering perspective: On this particular day,
forest fires were ravaging the area, forcing the evacuation of
thousands of residents. Train passengers, temporarily restricted to
indoor viewing to avoid smoke inhalation, watched as seaplanes
scooped into the lake and took on water to douse the flames.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 miles to the east, the train slows to a crawl _
``Kodak speed,'' an attendant describes the pace _ over Stoney
Creek Bridge, an architectural marvel that spans 484 feet and
hovers 325 feet above the creek bed.
</P>
<P>
   Also mesmerizing is the 30-mile journey _ including seven river
crossings _ through Kicking Horse Canyon, another challenge for
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the Continental Divide in the heart of the Rockies,
the Spiral Tunnels intrigue, too. The Lower Spiral, tunneled
through Mount Ogden, turns 230 degrees, covers 2,922 feet and
emerges 56 feet higher than its entrance. The Upper Spiral, through
Cathedral Mountain, turns 250 degrees, covers 3,255 feet and
emerges 50 feet higher than its entrance.
</P>
<P>
   No tunnel vision is allowed, though: not on one of the world's
most scenic train rides.

 &HT;    Ten games that could decide the national championship
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNESSEE AT SYRACUSE
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5 at Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the best place for new Tennessee quarterback Tee
Martin to get his first start. It will get very loud and the
Syracuse defense will come after him. The Orangemen beat the last
SEC team (Florida) that dared visit the Carrier Dome. If Martin can
survive this trip with his confidence intact, he'll be ready when
Florida comes to Knoxville on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO STATE AT WEST VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5 at Morgantown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   A dangerous game for the Buckeyes, who are ranked No. 1 in both
of the major preseason polls. Ohio State is loaded again with 16
returning starters and great depth. But West Virginia has 17
starters returning, including running back Amos Zereoue, a Heisman
Trophy darkhorse. Fans and media are billing this as the biggest
home game ever at West Virginia. Ohio State's national championship
train could get derailed before it gets out of the station.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON AT ARIZONA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5 at Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   If Arizona State survives its opener against the Huskies, the
Sun Devils could run the table to the Pac-10 championship and earn
a spot in the Fiesta Bowl. That game, conveniently, will be played
on Arizona State's home field in Tempe. It will be the first game
back for Arizona State quarterback Ryan Kealy, a freshman
All-American in 1997, since he suffered a late knee injury last
season.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA AT TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 19 at Knoxville
</P>
<P>
   As always, the winner of this one has the edge in the SEC East
and remains in the hunt for the national title. Tennessee likes its
chances at home even without Peyton Manning. Florida, which tunes
up with The Citadel and NE Louisiana, should have all its
quarterback problems ironed out by then. The Vols have not beaten
the Gators since 1992. It will be a prime time (8 p.m.) showdown on
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   LSU AT FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 10 at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Florida went into Baton Rouge ranked No. 1 and left
beaten and embarrassed 28-21 by an inspired LSU team. That loss,
plus the one to Georgia in Jacksonville, ultimately cost the Gators
a shot at their fifth straight SEC title. Now Florida gets the
Tigers in the Swamp in what could be a preview of the SEC
Championship game in December. Two years ago LSU came to
Gainesville and was trounced 56-13.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON AT NEBRASKA
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 26 at Lincoln, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were the last visiting team to win in Lincoln and
this will be the first big test for new coach Frank Solich. A year
ago Nebraska traveled to Seattle and trounced Washington on the way
to the national championship. If Brock Huard stays healthy, this
time could be different for the Huskies. But don't bet on it.
Nebraska has won 42 straight home games since Washington last
visited.
</P>
<P>
   NEBRASKA AT KANSAS STATE
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 14 at Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   If both teams stay undefeated, this will be the biggest football
game ever played at Kansas State. Both could be ranked in the top
five and a ton will be on the line. Nebraska has won 29 straight
games over the Wildcats and handed K-State its only loss in 1997, a
56-26 thumping. The Wildcats have 18 starters returning and
Nebraska is breaking in a new coach. If Kansas State doesn't beat
the Huskers this year, it never will.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA AT FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21 at Tallahassee
</P>
<P>
   The Gators knocked Florida State out of a chance for the
national championship by upsetting the Seminoles last year in
Gainesville. Bobby Bowden still hasn't gotten over it and his
Seminoles will be out for revenge. It will not be a game for the
faint of heart. Two years ago Florida State beat the Gators in
Tallahassee in a very physical game. The winner of this one will be
sore, but probably headed to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN AT OHIO STATE
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 21 at Columbus, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   If both of these teams are still undefeated, the tension factor
in the Ohio State camp will be off the charts. The Buckeyes of John
Cooper have been one of the nation's top programs in the '90s
except for one glaring weakness: They are 1-8-1 in their last 10
meetings with Michigan. With the Buckeyes so high on everyone's
list, Ohio State fans just can't have their heart broken one more
time by the Maize and Blue. Or can they?
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA STATE AT ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 27 at Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Arizona State still had an outside shot at an
Alliance bowl when it was stunned at home by the Wildcats 28-16 in
the regular-season finale. This time the Pac-10 championship and
even a spot in the national championship game could be on the line
for the Sun Devils. Arizona returns 15 starters and has won four of
its last five meetings with Arizona State. Wildcats coach Dick
Tomey is in the last year of his contract and may need to win this
one to keep his job.

 &HT;    ACC: FSU dominates, AGAIN
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After watching Florida State toy with the Atlantic Coast
Conference for the last six years, respected Virginia defensive
coordinator Rick Lantz is convinced it's not only overwhelming
physical talent that has made the Seminoles such a dominating force
in the league, as well as the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of Virginia's goal-line stand that resulted in a
1995 upset of the Seminoles _ to date their only conference loss
against 47 wins _ Lantz pointed to his own team's lapses as an
example of what the rest of the ACC must avoid if anyone hopes to
contend with Florida State consistently. After a big win at home
over Georgia Tech in November, the complacent Cavaliers got upset
at N.C. State and squandered a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a letdown,'' Lantz said. ``Our concentration that week
of practice was not on getting ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before, Florida State calmly handled the hype of a game
at North Carolina, the first involving two ACC schools ranked in
the top five, and by a 20-3 score flattened the listless Tar Heels,
who have made the most strides in emulating Florida State's
athleticism. The matchup circled by ACC watchers nearly a year
before quickly turned into another methodical destruction in a
league that seems as far from being competitive at the top as when
FSU joined in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's talent is unquestioned again, as the Seminoles
are aiming to make another run at the national championship. But
after earnestly recruiting bigger and stronger athletes, their
rivals are seeing that cultivating a hard mental edge _ one sharp
enough to pull off a major upset at the very least _ may prove to
be just as difficult and important a hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap has closed physically, but Florida State has learned
how to win big games everywhere it plays,'' Lantz said. ``You have
to learn how to go into hostile stadiums and win. That's why they
win a lot of games the rest of us would have a hard time winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, using that talent to wear down the gamest opponents
is a supreme advantage. The Seminoles didn't put away Clemson until
the fourth quarter at Death Valley last year, finally getting a
90-yard punt return for a touchdown from the explosive Peter
Warrick, who blazed past weary Tiger defenders, setting in motion a
35-28 victory. The victory erased doubts that the Seminoles weren't
up to snuff and sent Clemson into a psychological swoon that took
most of the season to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we felt we should have won that game,'' Clemson
coach Tommy West said. ``There are teams in our league who have a
lot of good front-line players. But they've (Florida State) got
backups who could be frontline players. You lose a game by seven
points the way we did and it takes a lot out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's George O'Leary felt the same thing in Tallahassee
later in the year in a valiant first-half showing that couldn't
hold up over 60 minutes. Warrick's circus catch for a touchdown
near halftime broke a scoreless tie as well as the Yellow Jackets,
who suffered a 38-0 drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is closing, but it's really about an attitude you have
to have about winning,'' O'Leary said. ``Do your kids believe they
can beat them?''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight year, the Seminoles must replace six
defensive starters, including ACC player of the year Andre
Wadsworth. Also gone are All-ACC quarterback Thad Busby,
All-America receiver E.G. Green and offensive lineman Tra Thomas, a
first-round NFL draft choice. Incredibly, they should be even
better and perhaps as fast a team as coach Bobby Bowden has ever
fielded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we lose in our league would be better for the league,
but not necessarily for Bobby Bowden,'' he said. ``Last year, North
Carolina was the best team we played. And Virginia always has given
us a great game. They've showed it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether Virginia's upset will become a museum piece or the
blueprint for genuine ACC parity won't be clear for perhaps a very
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's improving, but there's always Florida
State,'' Duke coach Fred Goldsmith said. ``People in our conference
were closer to beating them than Miami was last year. But we don't
sit around and talk about closing the gap. Y'all are the ones doing
that.''

 &HT;    COLLEGE FOOTBALL PREVIEW: New coalition guarantees title game
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good friend of mine, we'll call him Tom, can always find a
cloud behind every silver lining. Give Tom a $40,000 Mercedes and
he'll complain if the cigarette lighter doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   It's people like Tom who are complaining about the new Bowl
Championship Series, the latest version of the dearly departed Bowl
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series _ made up of the Fiesta, Sugar,
Rose, and Orange bowls _ will guarantee that the two top-rated
teams in the country will meet in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4 for the
national championship. You might not agree on who those two teams
are, but the winner of that game will be the national champion.
After the Fiesta Bowl, you won't have to wait for the polls to be
released at O-Dark-Thirty the next morning to know who the champion
is.
</P>
<P>
   Tom doesn't like the Bowl Championship Series because he still
wants a playoff in Division I football. Get over it!
</P>
<P>
   A playoff is a good sports-bar conversation. But the reality is
that we're about five years and several billion dollars away from
even having a serious discussion about a playoff. Let's solve this
Y2K thing before we worry about a college football playoff, OK?
</P>
<P>
   He also complains about the new Bowl Championship Series formula
to determine the two teams which will play in the national
championship game. Instead of relying solely on the polls, which
are simply the opinions of the voters, the Bowl Championship Series
formula also will factor in strength of schedule and other
components to make the selection less subjective.
</P>
<P>
   You may not like or appreciate the process, but on Jan. 4 two
teams will play for all the marbles in Tempe, Ariz. And you will
like that.
</P>
<P>
   A few other things to ponder before the games begin:
</P>
<P>
   Milestones
</P>
<P>
   _ Penn State coach Joe Paterno needs only two victories to
become only the fourth Division I-A coach to win 300 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas running back Ricky Williams is 1,928 yards short of
breaking Tony Dorsett's all-time Division I-A rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   _ This will be the first season since 1941 that Grambling takes
the field without Eddie Robinson as its head coach. Doug Williams,
a former Grambling quarterback and Super Bowl MVP, takes over.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time since 1972, Nebraska will not have Tom
Osborne on the sidelines. Osborne retired with 255 wins in 25 years
and captured three national championships in his final four years.
Frank Solich is the new guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ This will be the WAC's last year as a 16-team conference.
Eight teams (Colorado State, Utah, BYU, Air Force, New Mexico,
UNLV, Wyoming, San Diego State) will break off in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On the hot seat
</P>
<P>
   These guys will spend time looking over their shoulder:
</P>
<P>
   _ Brad Scott is essentially starting over in his fifth season at
South Carolina. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike DuBose will still be the coach at Alabama next year
whatever happens in 1998. But after going 4-7 in his rookie season,
the heat is really on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tommy West got a contract extension but is still hearing from
Clemson fans who want to compete for the ACC championship again.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the Heisman
</P>
<P>
   Williams gets an early boost _ we'll call it the ``Peyton
Manning Bump''_ by coming back. He will be the strong preseason
favorite, but here, in no particular order, are the others who will
contend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Daunte Culpepper, QB, Central Florida: Scared Nebraska to
death last year at Nebraska. Might be the most talented player in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kevin Faulk, RB, LSU: With Cecil Collins gone, Faulk will have
to carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Couch, QB, Kentucky: Will put up some gaudy numbers again
but needs to cut down on his interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cade McNown, QB, UCLA: I'm not big on left-coast QBs, but this
guy is tough.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Bishop, QB, Kansas State: Going back to his JUCO days,
Bishop is 35-1 as a college quarterback.

 &HT;    College coaching strategies
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIM DONNAN,
</P>
<P>
   HEAD COACH,
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DOUBLE SPLIT''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Donnan believes that one way to handle excessive defensive
pressure is with multiple formations that keep the other team
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to give them enough stuff outside of your base
offense so that they aren't comfortable running their base
defense,'' Donnan says. ``By moving your people around, you hope to
slow them down and eventually get some mismatches.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's ability to mix up his formations and keep a nationally
ranked defense off balance played a major role in Georgia's 37-17
upset of No. 6 Florida last November in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   On this play, which is usually run near the goal line, Georgia
goes to the line of scrimmage in a basic formation with two tight
ends. Before the ball is snapped, both tight ends split wide,
forcing the cornerbacks to cover them man-to-man. Also before the
ball is snapped, the flanker goes in motion from the left side to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   On the snap, the tight end on the right side goes right at the
cornerback and breaks his route inside and to the left. If the
cornerback goes with the tight end, the flanker should be open in
the end zone. If the corner goes with the flanker, he'll be taken
out of the play and the tailback should be open out in the flat
with only a linebacker to beat for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you try to show them something complicated and then
run something easy,'' Donnan says. ``You can't be predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE SPURRIER,
</P>
<P>
   HEAD COACH,
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FADE''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, LSU brought its version of the high-pressure
defense to Florida's Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Coach Steve Spurrier
and quarterback Danny Wuerffel were ready.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's cornerbacks tried to pressure Florida's receivers with
tight coverage while bringing maximum pressure on Wuerffel.
Spurrier responded with his favorite play against pressure: ``The
Fade.''
</P>
<P>
   The play is simple but the execution must be precise. On the
snap, the two Florida receivers run straight toward the
cornerbacks, make slight outside turns, then go racing down the
sidelines. The quarterback takes only a three-step drop and throws
the ball even before his chosen receiver has gotten any separation
from his defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing the defensive coaches hate to see is the ball
getting out of there,'' Spurrier says. ``So we believe in getting
the ball up in the air and giving our receivers a chance to make a
play.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Florida led 42-6. In the second half, LSU's
shell-shocked defense began using six defensive backs, and the
Gators responded by running the football. When it was over, Florida
had 635 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier took particular joy in that one. Earlier in the week,
LSU defensive coordinator Carl Reese had gone on ESPN and
diagrammed how his high-pressure defense would work against the
Gators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess we won't have too many opposing coaches giving chalk
talks any more,'' Spurrier said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   BILL OLIVER,
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   COORDINATOR,
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   ``A DEFENSIVE BACK'S DREAM''
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas morning 1992, Bill Oliver sat in his office
hatching a plan. In just seven days, his Alabama defense would go
up against No. 1 Miami and quarterback Gino Torretta in the Sugar
Bowl. The national championship was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver decided to try to confuse Torretta with a series of
unusual formations that included as many as seven defensive backs.
Many times it appeared that the Crimson Tide had 11 defensive
players on the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to never let him get comfortable,'' Oliver says.
``We wanted him to be guessing on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen times during the game Oliver showed Torretta a
formation with seven defensive backs. One of those plays determined
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 20-6, Torretta had his team in a shotgun formation.
Alabama pulled all 11 of its players to within a yard of the line
of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Torretta changed his protection, preparing for an all-out blitz.
But on the snap, eight Alabama defenders backed into pass coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Torretta threw into the teeth of the coverage. George Teague
intercepted and returned the ball 31 yards for a touchdown. Alabama
went on to win the game 34-13 and the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who became Auburn's defensive coordinator in 1995, used
some of the same principles to confuse Peyton Manning at times in
last season's SEC championship game against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Manning looked confused at times but was able to make enough
plays for the Vols to win 30-29.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY STOOPS,
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE
</P>
<P>
   COORDINATOR,
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   ``BLITZ OR BAIL OUT?''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Bobby Stoops faced a problem. His Kansas
State defense was giving up too many yards, despite what he thought
was a good collection of athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great corners and safeties and pretty good guys at
linebackers,'' Stoops says. ``But people seemed to be doing what
they wanted to against us.''
</P>
<P>
   So Stoops decided to take advantage of his team's athleticism at
defensive back and linebacker to put greater pressure on the
quarterback and the line of scrimmage. Stoops brought his
linebackers closer to the line of scrimmage, even to the point of
putting one over the tight end. The cornerbacks would play tight on
the receivers, and the strong safety also would get closer to the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to stop the run by putting one more man up there
than they can possibly block,'' Stoops says. ``If everybody does
their job, they shouldn't be able to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was an additional wrinkle. From that formation,
Stoops' defense was in position to bring a maximum blitz on the
quarterback every play. Sometimes, they would blitz. Sometimes,
they would fake it and drop into pass coverage, what coaches call
``bailing out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep the quarterback guessing,'' Stoops says.
</P>
<P>
   The concept worked. By 1995, Kansas State led the nation in
total defense. In 1996, Stoops was hired as defensive coordinator
at Florida.

 &HT;    COLLEGE DREAM TEAM: South boasts a bevy of precious players
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their private moments, coaches dream of what it would be like
to have the perfect player at every position _ one who meets or
exceeds all of the physical and mental standards to excel, without
flaw or weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coaches are particularly guilty of it. As college
defenses have become faster and more sophisticated over the past 15
years, coaches have been searching for athletes with just the right
qualities to make those defenses work. Once in a great while, just
the right athlete comes along. When that happens, it is coaching
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky to have coached some great ones,'' said
Auburn's Bill Oliver, recognized as one of football's leading
defensive gurus. ``And when I had a great one, I thanked the Lord
for it every night. It's amazing how smart those guys can make you
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches interviewed had some very specific ideas about what
kind of athletes are best-suited to play the various defensive
positions. If they could design the perfect athletes, they would be
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   CORNERBACK
</P>
<P>
   With the evolution of faster defenses, which puts more pressure
on the secondary, it has become one of the glamour positions in
college football. The best cornerbacks, according to the coaches,
range in height from 5-11 to 6-2 and rarely weigh more than 190
pounds. They don't have to have blazing speed, but they must have
quickness in both their hands and feet. They also must have good
hand-eye coordination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that guys who were great basketball or baseball
players in high school make the best corners,'' said Bobby Stoops,
Florida's defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   For most coaches, the best pure corner in recent memory is
Florida State's Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver takes issue. He turned Antonio Langham into an
All-American in 1992 and 1993 when he was defensive coordinator at
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Antonio, you could set up your defense and literally take
half the field away,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Both made the coaches' All-Southern Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, the safety was a quasi-linebacker who was
counted on for run support and very limited pass coverage. As
offenses have become more sophisticated and are spreading the field
with as many as four wide receivers, the big, slow safety went the
way of the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is too fast now, so we had to take those old safeties
and make linebackers out of them,'' said Carl Torbush, head coach
and former defensive coordinator at North Carolina. ``Today, a
safety doesn't have to be as fast or as good a cover guy as a
corner. But he better be close, or you'll get burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Good safeties, say the coaches, can be a little bit bigger than
corners and go over 200 pounds. They have to be fast enough to
cover receivers deep but a good enough tackler to run up and make a
stop on the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Bennie Blades (6-0, 215) was one of the first of these
new safeties when he won the 1987 Jim Thorpe Award, which goes to
the nation's best defensive back. He and two-time Clemson
All-American Terry Kinard are the Dream Team safeties.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSIDE LINEBACKER
</P>
<P>
   These men have become the raptors of college football. They must
be big enough, usually in the 230-240-pound range, and strong
enough get rid of a 280-pound pulling guard and make the tackle.
They also must be fast enough to chase down running backs and wide
receivers and, occasionally, cover those guys deep.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of great ones have roamed Southern football in the modern
era, including Jessie Armstead and Darrin Smith of Miami, Sam
Cowart of Florida State and Wilber Marshall of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy probably needs to be the best athlete on your team,''
Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly was true at Alabama from 1984-1986 when Cornelius
Bennett was a three-time All-American. He was the 1986 Lombardi
Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and two-time All-American Aundray Bruce of Auburn get
the spots on the coaches' Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE LINEBACKER
</P>
<P>
   Before speed became such an important factor in the game, the
inside linebacker did not need to be particularly fast. He was
primarily responsible for run support inside the tackles. Today's
inside linebacker might be called on to pick up a running back
going out for a pass and follow him all the way down the field.
Today he's got to have size _ about 6-3, 240 _ and speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted our guy to be the kind of athlete that nobody would
challenge,'' said former Miami Hurricanes coach Jimmy Johnson, now
with the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had its fair share of great ones in the middle, including
Ray Lewis and Micheal Barrow, but the Dream Team spot goes to
Marvin Jones of Florida State. Of all the players drafted at
Florida State, Jones was the highest pick, as the Jets' took him
fourth in the 1993 draft. As a junior, he had 111 tackles and won
the Butkus and Lombardi awards.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE END
</P>
<P>
   The ends have one mission in the new, speed-oriented defenses:
To meet each other in the backfield as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have got to be strong, but it's more important that
they be quick enough to get around blocks,'' Stoops said. ``Their
job is to get into the backfield and cause as much damage as fast
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical defensive end is about 6-4 and can range anywhere
from 240 to 270 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them to be big enough to take on the offensive tackle
every play, but I'll never sacrifice speed for size,'' Torbush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama had what many consider the best pair of defensive ends
on one team in 1992 when Eric Curry and John Copeland led the
Crimson Tide to the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys set the tone,'' Oliver said. ``They were something
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry gets one of the slots on the Dream Team, while the other
goes to Miami's Greg Mark, the school second all-time sack leader
with 34 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE TACKLE
</P>
<P>
   In previous generations, the defensive tackle could be big and
slow. His job was to clog up the middle and grab anybody who
happened to run by. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Today's defensive tackle can tip the scales near 300 pounds, as
Florida's Ed Chester and LSU's Anthony McFarland do. But they also
have to be fast enough to get into the backfield and pressure the
quarterback when opponents pass.
</P>
<P>
   When opponents run, tackles must be strong enough to stuff their
blockers and slow down the development of the play. The newer
defensive schemes rely on the tackles to shut down the run in order
to allow the linebackers and defensive backs room to take advantage
of their speed and make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our tackles are playing well, there is a good chance we're
going to control the line of scrimmage,'' Stoops said. ``That's
where it all starts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of dream defensive tackles to choose from.
Miami had two great ones in Russell Maryland and Warren Sapp.
Auburn's Tracy Rocker was an Outland Award winner. But Virginia
Tech's Bruce Smith (Buffalo) and Tennessee's Reggie White (Green
Bay) have been to the most Super Bowls.

 &HT;    COLLEGE FOOTBALL PREVIEW: SEC East capsules
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   GATORS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 39,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 10-2, 6-2 SEC (T-2nd, East); beat Penn State 21-6
in Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 6, defense 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Steve Spurrier is 83-16-1 in eight years at Florida,
138-48-2 overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: Florida will win its fifth SEC championship in
the past six seasons because the Gators will field their best
defense in 1998. No team in America has a better front seven on
that side of the ball. Whether Florida will contend for the
national championship depends on the development of an offense,
where some questions persist. Either Doug Johnson or Jesse Palmer
must become a consistently productive quarterback. Spurrier doesn't
need to spend the season juggling the two and dealing with a
quarterback controversy every day. He also has to find a top
receiver from a group of young talented ones.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   7 Junior Doug Johnson, who was in and out of Spurrier's doghouse
last season, is recovering from shoulder surgery. Sophomore Jesse
Palmer, who has limited experience, will start early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   8 Fred Taylor is gone, but in his place will be senior Terry
Jackson, who sat out last season with a knee injury. Jackson is the
emotional leader of the offense and one of the most versatile
players around.

   7 Jacquez Green departed with a year of eligibility remaining,
so a big-play receiver must step forward.One of a group of talented
sophomores could fill that role. Nafis Karim and Travis McGriff are
dependable.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   9 Eight linemen with starting experience return, led by tackle
Zach Piller and guard Ryan Kalich, three-year starters on the left
side. A couple of newcomers, Notre Dame transfer Leon Hires and
redshirt freshman Kenyetta Walker could push for playing time.

Chester and Reggie McGrew and ends Willie Cohens and Tim Beauchamp.
But the four guys backing them up are almost as good.

   9 Defensive coordinator Bobby Stoops did some juggling in order
to get his three best guys _ _ Jevon Kearse, Mike Peterson and

impressive physical specimens in the country.

   7 Strong safety Tony George moves to corner, where he will make
a lot of plays. He won't be missed at SS, as Rod Graddy has emerged
as a future star. Teako Brown is back at free safety after
intercepting six passes last season.

   7 Practice had barely started when punter Robby Stevenson landed
in Spurrier's doghouse. He might lose his job to freshman David
Wasielewski or walk-on Josh Korn. Placekicker Collins Cooper also
will be challenged by the freshman.

</P>
<P>
   10 Florida missed out on its fifth straight SEC championship in
1997, but Spurrier and his staff won 10 games and upset No. 1
Florida State. With Spurrier calling the plays and Stoops running
the defense, this is one of the nation's strongest staffs.

   VOLUNTEERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 25,489.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 11-2, 7-1 SEC (1st, East); beat Auburn 30-29 in
SEC championship game; lost to Nebraska 42-17 in Orange Bowl.

   _ Starters returning: Offense 8, defense 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Phillip Fulmer is 54-11 in six years at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: Life must go on without Peyton Manning, and it
will quite nicely in Big Orange country. As strange as it sounds,
the offense actually could be better under junior quarterback Tee
Martin, a more versatile player than Manning. The line has matured,
as has tailback Jamal Lewis of Atlanta. Just about all the concerns
come on the defensive side of the ball, where six starters are
gone. The key is the month of September, when the Vols face
Syracuse and Florida. If the Vols win both of those, they could run
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   7 Martin earned the confidence of the Tennessee players by
leading a touchdown drive against Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.
Martin had a very good spring practice. But he must stay healthy,
because there is no experienced backup.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   10 Lewis was a freshman All-American after rushing for 1,364
yards and has returned faster and stronger after a summer of hard
workouts. He'll be the workhorse, but he'll get some help from
underrated fullback Shawn Bryson.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   9 Marcus Nash is gone with his 76 catches, but the Vols still
have the SEC's best one-two punch in Jeremaine Copeland (58
catches) and Peerless Price (48 catches). Price finally is back at
full speed after an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   10 Center Trey Teague is the only starter not returning, so the
Vols might have to do some juggling to get their five best players
on the field. Tackles Cosey Coleman and Chad Clifton are serious
talents.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   6 The Vols will find it difficult to replace tackle Bill Duff
and end Jonathon Brown. And it didn't help that five defensive
linemen missed spring practice because of various injuries. Two key
questions to be answered: Can end Shaun Ellis recover completely
from a spring car accident? Can tackle Billy Ratliff stay healthy?.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 Al Wilson moves to the middle and will be one of the SEC's
best against the run. If Eric Westmoreland comes back fully from a
knee injury, he'll join Raynoch Thompson to give the Vols two good
ones on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   6 Only one starter returns, but cornerback Dwayne Goodrich is a
good one. Experience gives Steve Johnson the edge at the other
corner, but he will be pushed. Sophomore Deon Grant has a lock on
free safety, but Fred White of Griffin will have to work to hold on
to the strong safety position.

</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jim Donnan is 15-8 in two years at Georgia, 79-29
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: The Bulldogs took a huge step back to
respectability last season with their first 10-win season since
1992 and their first win over Florida since 1989. Donnan and his
staff followed that up with a top-five recruiting class. With the
losses of quarterback Mike Bobo, running back Robert Edwards, and
all-purpose receiver Hines Ward, it's hard to see Georgia repeating
last season's magic. But if the Bulldogs get better than expected
play from one of their young quarterbacks and if one of the running
backs turns into a top player, they could make some noise in the
SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   6 Freshmen Quincy Carter and Nate Hybl have a real chance to
play early, with redshirt freshman Daniel Cobb still uncertain
while he takes blood thinners. Jon England and Mike Usry have taken
snaps but have done little with them.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   8 Olandis Gary and Patrick Pass have had their moments, but
neither has proved he can be the featured back. The X-factor is
Jasper Sanks, the top signee of 1997, who was in prep school last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   6 Senior Tony Small (26 catches) is the guy everybody hopes will
step up. Michael Greer has shown a knack for getting open and
making big catches. The group will be helped by the occasional use
of cornerback Champ Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 After this season, tackles Matt Stinchcomb and Chris Terry
both will be playing on Sunday. Georgia needs some rebuilding in
the middle, but Steve Herndon and Jonas Jennings should be good at
the guards. The key is center, where Miles Luckie needs to come
through in replacing Brad Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   9 Georgia is deeper and more talented here than it has been in
more than a decade. Ten lettermen, all good, are fighting for four
positions. Marcus Stroud and Antonio Cochran will handle the ends
while senior Emarlos Leroy will have a big season at nose guard.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 Gone are Greg Bright and Brandon Tolbert, who combined for 75
starts the past four seasons. Orantes Grant (81 tackles) is back at
his outside spot, and sophomore Adrian Hollingshed should land
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   8 Bailey is an All-America corner and free safety Kirby Smart
will make some All-SEC teams. Senior Glenn Ford can handle the
other corner.

</P>
<P>
   5 Placekicker Hap Hines struggled as a sophomore, and the hope
is that he'll regain his freshman form. If he doesn't, sophomore
Chad Holleman will push him. Punter is an even greater concern with
a host of players, including some walk-ons, battling for the job.
</P>
<P>

   _ Starters returning: Offense 9, defense 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Hal Mumme is 5-6 in one year at Kentucky, 70-33-1
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: There's no mystery about what Kentucky must do
to take its program to the next level, which would be a bowl bid.
The Wildcats must improve a defense that was dead-last in the SEC
in points allowed, giving up 32.91 per game. All too often, that
defense negated the best efforts of quarterback Tim Couch, who led
the Wildcats to 31.64 points per game, third best in the SEC.
Kentucky should make some strides, having signed 19 defensive
players last February. How big the strides will be remains to be
seen. Kentucky should move ahead of South Carolina to fourth in the
SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   9 Couch broke or tied 17 school and 10 SEC passing records with
3,884 yards last season. Now he must reduce his 19 interceptions
and show that he has matured as a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   7 The Wildcat backs are better than most folks know. Derek Homer
averaged 5.7 yards per carry while Anthony White averaged 5.6.
White also caught 59 passes out of the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   8 Craig Yeast caught everybody's attention last season when he
grabbed 73 passes for 873 yards. Kevin Coleman (52 catches) is also
a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 Four of five starters are back but the Wildcats will miss
guard John Schlarman, the leader on that unit. The good news is
that Kentucky will start five seniors, led by tackles Jonas Liening
and Kris Comstock.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   5 Kentucky recruited five defensive ends in hopes of improving a
front wall that was simply terrible a year ago. The tackles, Marvin
Major and Mark Jacobs, are respectable but there is a lot of work
to do at end.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   5 Jeff Snedegar returns after posting 97 tackles last season but
he needs some help. Dennis Johnson, the USA Today high school
defensive player of the year last season, will start at outside
linebacker. Other freshmen may be needed here as well.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   4 The good news: FS Willie Gary of Valdosta is back after
earning freshman All-America honors from The Sporting News. Now the
bad news: Gary is Kentucky's best and most experienced player in
the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   7 Punter Jimmy Carter rarely gets a chance to boom one because
Mumme prefers to keep opponents from returning kicks. Still he
averaged 40.2 yards. Seth Hanson won't get that many field-goal
tries because Mumme knows his team must score as many points as
possible to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   8 Mumme has made a smooth transition from Division II football
and has shown he can call plays with the big boys. He kept his
staff together and wisely went out and recruited some defensive
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   5 The first three games against Louisville, Eastern Kentucky and
Indiana are all winnable. But then the Wildcats play three of the
next four on the road at Florida, Arkansas and LSU. There is also a
road trip to Tennessee to finish the season. The SEC home games
with South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi State and Vanderbilt will
determine if Kentucky has a winning season.

   _ Starters returning: Offense 7, defense 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Brad Scott is 22-22-1 in four years at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: Scott made a painful discovery in 1997. He spent
four years trying to install the fast-break offense he used so
effectively at Florida State. Then he learned the offense is only
effective if backed up by a superior defense. South Carolina's
defense was anything but, finishing 10th in the SEC while giving up
24.82 points per game. So in this fifth season in Columbia, Scott
has junked that offensive philosophy in favor of a power running
game to hopefully control the ball and keep his defense off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   7 Anthony Wright returns after a severe knee injury in the ninth
game last season. Redshirt freshman Phil Petty is the backup, but
true freshman Keith Matkins of Charlotte is too talented not to get
a look.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   7 Troy Hambrick has rushed for 885 yards in his first two
seasons and will be the power back, with speedy Boo Williams giving
the team a change of pace. Dependable Steve Mixon will handle the
fullback job.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   7 Zola Davis has had an up-and-down career, but he still needs
54 catches to become the school's all-time leading receiver. That
won't happen because sophomore Jermale Kelly is the main man after
catching 10 touchdown passes a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   4 Things are so bad that Jamar Nesbit, an All-SEC tackle, may be
moved to center. Andray Spearman, a returning starter at tackle, is
the only other person who has played on the offensive line, which
will be filled out by redshirt freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   5 End John Abraham is a talented player, but he's not going to
get a lot of help from the cast of characters that return. Matt
Marsters will play the other end, but he's a bit small.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   5 There is some talent here, but most of it is young. OLB Corey
Atkins (77 tackles), is the lone veteran. Marco Hutchinson played
as a true freshman and Darion Hutcherson enrolled last January.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   6 This was going to be the bright spot on the defense until 11
days ago when safety Arturo Freeman, an All-SEC preseason pick, was
knocked out for the season with a knee injury. So the Gamecocks
will have two new safeties to play with veteran corners Homer
Torrance and Kevin Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   7 Placekicker Steve Florio is dependable after hitting nine of
13 field goals last season. Punter Courtney Leavitt settled down
after a shaky start to his career and averaged 40.9 yards per kick.
Williams led the SEC in kickoff returns last season with a 29.3
average.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   6 Scott is feeling some serious heat as it appears Kentucky has
surpassed the Gamecocks in the SEC East pecking order. Scott
brought in two new offensive coaches, Chuck Reedy and Woody
McCorvey, in hopes of turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   3 A nightmare. The traditional brutal finish _ Tennessee,
Florida and Clemson _ is still there. The Gamecocks also have to
play the first nine weeks of the season without a break. After four
straight home games to open the season, they play five of the final
seven on the road.

</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Woody Widenhofer is 3-8 in one year at Vanderbilt,
15-39-1 overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: Last season Vanderbilt proved defense will keep
you competitive, but it won't win a lot of games. The Commodores
led the SEC in defense (277.09 ypg) and were ninth nationally but
did not win a conference game. The problem was a truly awful
offense that finished 11th in the conference (275.45 ypg).
Widenhofer went out and hired Steve Crosby, who has 21 years of NFL
experience, as his new offensive coordinator. Crosby installed a
new one-back, pass-oriented offense in the spring. Now the
Commodores must recruit enough talent to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   3 The Commodores have six reasonably talented quarterbacks, but
none of them has ever played a college down. Junior Hi Lewis should
be the starter, but he could be pushed by a true freshman like 6-6
Sean O'Connor, an all-state player from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   5 Jared McGrath turned some heads as a freshman with 491 yards
rushing and will get some help from highly regarded redshirt
freshman Rodney Williams. This position was good enough to move
sophomore Jimmy Williams, the team's leading rusher last season, to
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   4 Todd Yoder (21 catches) and Tavarus Hogan (20 catches) are the
proven veterans, but they will get some help from redshirt freshman
Adam Ditto, who made a bid to start when he caught nine passes for
200 yards in the spring game.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   6 Four starters are back with five other lettermen to provide
some depth. Tackles Clay Condrey and Raminite Byndom have taken
their lumps over the past two seasons and should finally be ready
to play with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   7 The inside play will again be solid with the return of Ryan
Aulds, a freshman All-American last season. If end Alphonso Harvey
can stay in shape, it will again be tough to run against the
Commodores.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 All three starters are gone, including All-SEC Jamie Duncan.
Redshirt freshman Jamie Winborn takes over for Duncan in the
middle. Matt Stewart and Lamont Turner will handle the outside
spots but will be pushed by talented youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   9 Despite the loss of All-SEC corner Corey Chavous, the group
will still be very, very good. Corner Fred Vinson will be an
all-conference player and Jimmy Williams, a former running back, is
a star in the making at the other corner.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   4 Punter Joe Webb needs to improve on his 38.9 average as a true
freshman, particularly if Vanderbilt is going to struggle on
offense. John Markham hit eight of 13 field goals as a true
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   7 Widenhofer, a former defensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh
Steelers, has done a masterful job of upgrading the program with
defense. Now he has to get the offensive problems ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   4 The Commodores open with two straight road games at
Mississippi State and Alabama. They finish with Florida, Kentucky,
and Tennessee. Winning non-conference games with Duke, Western
Michigan and TCU is imperative.

 &HT;    SEC: Gators are team to beat
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most fun things about the beginning of a new college
football season is that all the questions finally start getting
answered. After endless months of speculation in print and over the
air, reality rules the day.
</P>
<P>
   In no conference are there more offseason questions than in the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Take the quarterback position. Only three SEC teams _ Kentucky,
LSU, and Arkansas _ will enter the fall secure in their starting
quarterback. The others still have questions, because of
graduation, injury or ineffectiveness. It could make for a wacky
year, league coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the league is like this, you'd just better hold on,''
Georgia coach Jim Donnan said, ``because anything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the other intriguing questions being asked as
the SEC begins its 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Can the SEC be as good this year as last year?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but in a different way. Last season, four SEC teams spent
some time among the top 10, and three (Florida, Tennessee, Georgia)
finished there. Two others (Auburn, LSU) finished in the top 13.
The conference might not be as strong near the top, but it could be
better in the middle and near the bottom. The SEC had seven teams
that were bowl-worthy last season, and that number could be eight
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Can Tim Couch win the Heisman Trophy?
</P>
<P>
   He can, but he probably won't. Couch put up great numbers _
3,884 yards, 37 touchdowns _ but the Wildcats need to have a
winning season to give him a shot. Couch threw too many
interceptions (19) last season. But here's an early indicator.
Kentucky could go to Florida on Sept. 26 with a 3-0 record. If
Couch puts up some impressive numbers, even in a loss, he could be
in the Heisman race all year. If Couch gets hammered, he could be
out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Can Florida get back to the SEC championship game?
</P>
<P>
   Count on it. For the first time last season, the SEC held a
championship game without the Gators, whose losses to LSU and
Georgia sent Tennessee to Atlanta. Sitting at home in December did
not set well with Steve Spurrier. He has put his players and his
staff on notice, so expect the Gators back at the Georgia Dome on
Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Who's this Nutt coaching for Arkansas?
</P>
<P>
   Houston Nutt is 35 years old and light years ahead of his
predecessor, Danny Ford, on the enthusiasm scale. Ford and Arkansas
parted ways because he got tired of athletics director Frank
Broyles looking over his shoulder. Nutt, a former Arkansas
quarterback, has been given the job of his life and has infused the
program with his energy. With 20 starters returning, the Hogs could
be the surprise team in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Will this be the year that Tennessee finally beats Florida?
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Vols beat the Gators was 1992 and Phillip
Fulmer was the interim coach for the ailing Johnny Majors. Since
Fulmer became the full-time coach in 1993, Tennessee has lost only
11 games, but five have been to Florida. This season, the Vols get
the Gators before a full house at Neyland Stadium. Florida has some
questions at quarterback. Won't matter: Gators will make it six in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the most improved player in the league?
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Jamal Lewis returned for his sophomore
season in the best shape of his life. With Peyton Manning gone,
Lewis will be the main man in what will be another good Tennessee
offense and should surpass the 1,364 yards he gained as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama was 4-7 last year but hasn't had two straight losing
seasons since 1956-57. Is the Tide going to be that bad again?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, and here are three reasons why:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the spring, Alabama installed a new passing offense that it
doesn't have the personnel to run. Coach Mike DuBose admits the
offense is geared for recruiting over the long haul. It will make a
lot of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense was supposed to be the bedrock of the team, but
Alabama has lost its best player, end Chris Hood, to academic
problems. Linebacker Steven Harris also is gone. A lot of young
players remain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama's non-conference schedule is the toughest in recent
memory, with BYU, East Carolina and Southern Miss. On the
conference schedule, Kentucky goes off and Florida comes on. Not a
very good trade.
</P>
<P>
   LSU again has the best talent in the Western Division. Any
chance they can't win the West?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Last year, the Tigers upset No. 1 Florida 28-21, which
should have been a springboard to the division championship. Turns
out the Tigers and their fans couldn't handle success. They were
still celebrating when Ole Miss came to Baton Rouge the next week
and beat them soundly, 36-21. This season, the Tigers have to
travel to Auburn, Florida, Ole Miss and Arkansas with a
quarterback, Herb Tyler, who struggles with consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the surprise player in the league?
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Carter has not played any kind of football in two years.
But Georgia's freshman quarterback appears to be a rare combination
of speed, strength and smarts. He'll struggle early. All young
quarterbacks do. But by late October, everybody in the country will
be talking about this guy.

   COLLEGE FOOTBALL PREVIEW: SEC West capsules
</P>
<P>
   LSU
</P>
<P>
   TIGERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 25,879
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 9-3, 6-2 SEC (T-1st, SEC West); beat Notre Dame
27-9 in Independence Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 9, defense 8.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Gerry DiNardo is 26-9-1 in three years at LSU, 45-34-1
overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: The offseason was a costly one for the Tigers,
who are looking for their first SEC championship since 1988. LSU
lost RB Cecil Collins, who had All-America potential, after his
arrest on assault charges. Two starters in the secondary, Chris
Beard and Clarence LeBlanc, were also removed from the team after
violating team rules. Despite those losses, LSU still has the
potential to be a top-10 team if a few things fall into place. LSU
was good enough to win the West last season but couldn't handle
success after upsetting No. 1 Florida. This should be DiNardo's
breakthrough team.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   7 Herb Tyler is 23-5 as a starter who has shown flashes of
brilliance, as he did in a win over Florida, only to crash and burn
the following week, as he did against Ole Miss. Week in and week
out, his play will set the tone for the offense. If he goes down,
there is no experienced backup.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   10 The departure of Collins still leaves the Tigers with Kevin
Faulk, an All-America candidate, and Rondell Mealey, who was the
MVP of the Independence Bowl. There is even more depth here with
senior Kendall Cleveland and sophomore fullback Tommy Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   7 The top four receivers from a year ago return, led by Larry
Foster (43 catches) and sophomore Abram Booty (35 catches). There
is some young talent that will provide some depth, but the Tigers
could use a few more big plays at this position.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 The Tigers lost a couple of good ones in guards Alan Faneca
and Adam Perry, but this group should still be strong, thanks to
three returning starters, including All-SEC center Todd McClure.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 New coordinator Lou Tepper will use a 3-4 alignment and move
Anthony McFarland from tackle to nose tackle, where he should have
a good season. Redshirt freshman Jarvis Green will handle one of
the ends.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   8 The new alignment will use four linebackers and the Tigers
have a pair of good ones inside in Joe Wesley (105 tackles) and
Charles Smith (78 tackles). Senior Arnold Miller has been moved
from end to outside linebacker and will do well.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   6 With Beard and LeBlanc gone, some shuffling is in order, but
there is still some talent. FS Mark Roman was a freshman
All-American two seasons ago and senior cornerback Chris Cummings
started all 12 games last season. Senior Raion Hill can play both
safety positions and will replace Beard at SS.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   6 The Tigers can't be as good because they lost the nation's
best punter in Chad Kessler and his 50.3-yard average. Danny Boyd
takes over at placekicker, which has been a real sore spot the past
few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   8 Throughout the troubles in the offseason, DiNardo has
maintained control of the program. This is his fourth season in
Baton Rouge and by far his most talented team.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   5 The Tigers have six home games instead of the usual seven.
They also drop Vanderbilt and pick up Georgia. There are also trips
to Auburn, Florida, Mississippi, Notre Dame and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE
</P>
<P>
   BULLDOGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Starkville, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 13,577
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 7-4, 4-4 SEC (T-3rd, West).
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 7, defense 4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jackie Sherrill is 41-37-2 in seven years at
Mississippi State, 146-82-4 overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: The Bulldogs came very close to a great season
in 1997 but lost their last two games to Arkansas (17-7) and
Mississippi (15-14), which knocked them out of the SEC championship
game. They were also passed over for a bowl bid with a 7-4 record.
This year, Mississippi State plans to make amends. The Bulldogs are
capable of going to a bowl if a couple of things fall into place.
First, Mississippi State must get more production out of the
quarterback position. Secondly, the defense has to recover from
losing seven starters.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   4 As a junior, Matt Wyatt simply didn't meet expectations with
only six touchdowns and 15 interceptions. He continues to be pushed
by junior Rob Morgan and redshirt freshman Wayne Madkin, the best
athlete in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   8 James Johnson ran for 1,069 yards and 12 touchdowns last
season. He will be counted on even more heavily than a year ago
when he had almost half (217) of the team's 441 rushing attempts.
Senior fullback Dennis McKinley is a very strong player.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   6 Senior Kevin Prentiss (20 catches) did not realize his
potential a year ago because of nagging injuries. Split end Kevin
Cooper was a junior college All-American two years ago but suffered
a knee injury. He could do big things now that he is at 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 Four starters return, including three that weigh over 325
pounds. Senior center Eric Allen is the lightest of the bunch at
288 pounds, but he is also the best.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   6 All four starters are gone, including some big-time players in
end Greg Favors and tackle Eric Dotson. But coordinator Joe Lee
Dunn got a lot of playing time for his backups last season. Tackles
Kevin Sluder and John Hilliard played in every game and nose tackle
Kenwoynne Smith has played in 27 career games.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 Junior Barrin Simpson returns after posting 104 tackles at
inside linebacker last season. Senior Bert Keys, a junior college
transfer last season, moved into the other spot to replace Dereck
Rush, the team's leading tacker from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   7 Cornerback Kendall Roberson is a very dependable cover guy and
will be joined at the other corner by Anthony Derricks, who
coverted from free safety. Strong safety Tim Nelson of Atlanta is
good tackler.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   10 Nobody in the SEC can match the daily double of punter Jeff
Walker (45.5 avg.) and placekicker Brian Hazelwood (16 of 26 field
goals).
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   7 Sherrill was on the hot seat last season after two consecutive
poor ones. He was rewarded with a four-year contract extension and
was able to keep his entire staff together. He has a winning record
(41-37-2) in seven years at Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   5 The good news is that the Bulldogs get Auburn, Alabama and
Arkansas at home. The bad news is they have only five home games
and tough road trips to Oklahoma State, LSU, Kentucky, and Ole
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   TIGERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Auburn, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 21,500
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 10-3, 6-2 SEC (T-1st, West); lost to Tennessee
30-29 in SEC championship game; beat Clemson 21-17 in Peach Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 7, defense 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Terry Bowden is 46-12-1 in five years at Auburn,
110-47-2 overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: The Tigers came within one point of winning the
SEC Championship last season but there are some hurdles to overcome
if they are going to get back into the race. First there is a
schedule that includes three top-10 teams (LSU, Tennessee,
Florida), a top-20 team (Virginia) and two tough road trips
(Mississippi, Mississippi State) in the first six games. With the
departure of quarterback Dameyune Craig, Bowden will install a more
conservative, run-oriented offense.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   7 Redshirt sophomore Ben Leard takes over after serving a
two-year apprenticeship under Craig. Leard is a solid player but
will not be asked to make the big plays of his predecessor. Meiko
Collier is the backup should Leard go down.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   6 Sophomore Demontray Carter is bigger, faster and stronger than
a year ago. If he shakes his fumbling habit, Carter could be a
big-time back. Juniors Rusty Williams and Markeith Cooper are
capable but don't have the qualities of a featured back.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   7 Karsten Bailey returns after catching 53 balls a year ago, but
fortunes at this position were hurt when Robert Baker was kicked
off the team for legal problems. Clifton Robinson and Errick Lowe
will get a chance to win the other job.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   7 The Tigers had to rebuild here a year ago but now it will pay
off as four of five starters return. Tackle Jeno James leads a
group that must change its mindset from passing to running.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   9 This will be the strength of the team as All-SEC end Jimmy
Brumbaugh (74 tackles) returns after an injury-filled 1997. He'll
get plenty of help from NT Charles Dorsey and end Leonardo Carson.
The only question here is depth.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 Inside linebackers Takeo Spikes and Ricky Neal combined for
260 tackles last season. Both are gone. The Tigers may need some
junior college help at this position. The outside linebackers, Ryan
Taylor and Quinton Reese, are back and are dependable players.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   8 Strong safety Martavious Houston was kicked off the team for
breaking rules, but the Tigers will still be good in the secondary.
Free safety Brad Ware, who has eight pickoffs over the past two
seasons, returns, as do corners Larry Casher and Antwoine Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   5 Auburn lost one of the nation's best kickers in Jaret Holmes,
who hit 14 of 17 field goals and averaged 42.9 yards per punt last
season. Jeremy Zills will be the punter and Rob Bironas has the
edge at placekicker.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   8 Bowden has won 46 games in five seasons at Auburn, so he must
be doing something right. This season will be a real test as the
Tigers change style on offense and could struggle early because of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   3 Few teams anywhere open the season with seven straight
opponents that won seven or more games in 1997. If Auburn can come
out of that stretch 4-3, it should be thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   REBELS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 12,542.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-4, 4-4 SEC (T-3rd, West).
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 6, defense 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tommy Tuberville is 19-15 in three years at Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: After two years of NCAA sanctions, the Rebels
are finally approaching their full compliment of 85 players on
scholarship. The future looks bright but there is a concern for
this team, which has only five seniors on scholarship. There are
several things the Rebels must do if they want to go to their
second straight bowl game. Sophomore quarterback Romaro Miller must
get comfortable running the offense. Running back John Avery, a
first-round draft choice, is gone and somebody must step up to fill
that void. Finally, a defense that lost three great linebackers
must find somebody who can make a play.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   6 Miller was one of the nation's most highly recruited high
school quarterbacks two years ago. He has all the skills to be a
great one.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   7 The Rebels can't be as good with Avery gone, but there is
talent in Deuce McAllister (402 yards), Tony Cannion (210 yards),
and redshirt freshman Joe Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   7 Rufus French (43 catches) is the nation's best tight end. Wide
receivers Corey Peterson and Grant Heard combined for 75 catches
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   8 Junior tackle Todd Wade, center Matt Luke, and sophomore guard
Terrence Metcalf can play for anybody. Junior Tutan Reyes and
sophomore Keydrick Vincent will fill the other spots.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   5 Both ends, Andre Harrison and Johnny Jones, are gone. As a
result, Derrick Burgess (49 tackles as a true freshman) has been
moved from tackle to end. Junior Michael Boone will man the other
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   6 Brock Kreitz, Nate Wayne and Walker Jones combined for 252
tackles last season. They are all gone. But a star is on the rise
in junior Armegis Spearman, who had 43 tackles as a backup. Al Rice
and Walt Hill are good but lack experience.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   7 Three of four starters return but one of them, SS Ronnie
Heard, has been moved to outside linebacker. Former free safety
Timothy Strickland (79 tackles) was moved to corner and joins Gary
Thigpen as the starters. JUCO transfer Kenny Woods won the free
safety job in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   5 Reagan King averaged 41.0 yards per punt last season while a
pair of redshirt freshmen _ Donald Juneau and Bill Sinis _ are
still battling for the placekicking job. Losing Avery really hurts
the return game. He averaged 24.2 yards on 13 kickoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   9 After turning down the job at Arkansas in the offseason,
Tuberville was able to keep his entire staff together. He did a
masterful job getting the Rebels to a bowl last year and knows how
to get the most out his players' ability.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   6 The Rebels drop Tennessee and pick up South Carolina in the
SEC rotation. The non-conference games with Memphis, SMU, and
Arkansas State are all winnable. With the exception of Georgia, the
toughest SEC games (Auburn, LSU, Mississippi State) are all at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   RAZORBACKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Fayetteville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 16,590
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-7, 2-6 SEC (T-5th West).
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 10, defense 9.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Houston Nutt is beginning his first season at Arkansas;
35-23 overall.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: After reaching the SEC championship game in
1995, things tailed off decidedly in Danny Ford's final two years
in Fayetteville. But Ford's staff did recruit well. As a result,
Nutt takes over a program filled with SEC-caliber athletes. First,
Nutt must do something about the anemic running game, which
finished last (56.5 ypg) among Division I's 112 schools. That
should happen with a stable of good running backs and a veteran
offensive line. Defensively, there is more than enough talent to
compete with the best of the SEC. .
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   6 Clint Stoerner set a school record for passing last season
(2,347 yards), but if he has to throw that much, the Hogs will be
in trouble. There is, however, no proven backup.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   7 If Madre Hill and Chrys Chukwuma have fully recovered from
their injuries, Arkansas will certainly improve its running game.
Rod Stinson (413 yards) and Eric Branch (251 yards) return to
provide depth.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   6 Three of the top four receivers are back, but it will be hard
to replace Anthony Eubanks, who set school records for receiving
yards, receptions, and touchdown catches. Still, there is talent in
sophomore Anthony Lucas (27 catches) and junior Emanuel Smith (28
catches).
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   7 The Hogs are strong up the middle with guards Russ Brown and
Brandon Burlsworth, who made several preseason All-SEC teams, plus
center Grant Garrett. Arkansas needs better play from its tackles,
who struggled against some of the SEC's quicker defenses last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   7 The front-line players, led by nose guard Melvin Bradley, are
solid but the Razorbacks have got to find some depth. Bradley has
led Arkansas in tackles the past two seasons and will get help from
Ryan Hale and D.J. Cooper up front.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   8 In addition to J.J. Jones, Harry Wilson, Jamel Harris and
Quenton Caver, outside linebackers C.J. McLain and Bryan Smith have
been reinstated to the team after being suspended late last season.
All these guys can run and can hit.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   7 Seven of the top eight secondary players are back. Senior Zac
Painter moves over from cornerback to the newly created rover
position. Jeromy Flowers and Kenoy Kennedy are very dependable
safeties. The Hogs could be a little undermanned at corner, which
could cost them.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   4 Not a whole lot went right last season and this still looks
like a weakness. Arkansas was 12th in the SEC in kickoff returns
and 11th in punt returns. Placekicker Todd Latourette has limited
range, and Arkansas is still in search of a punter.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>
   5 Nutt, an Arkansas native, was 22-3 at Murray State and brings
a new level of enthusiasm to Fayetteville. He still has to learn
about life in the SEC, however.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   5 The non-conference games with SW Louisiana, SMU and Memphis
are all winnable. Florida goes off the schedule and Kentucky comes
on. But after four straight home games to open the season, five of
the Hogs' next six are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   CRIMSON TIDE
</P>
<P>
   _ Location: Tuscaloosa, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enrollment: 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-7, 2-6 SEC (T-5th, West).
</P>
<P>
   _ Starters returning: Offense 3, defense 7.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Mike DuBose is 4-7 in one season at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998 outlook: Only one Alabama coach in history, J.B. ``Ears''
Whitworth, has posted two consecutive losing seasons. DuBose could
be the second if he doesn't create some magic. He started by
replacing four assistant coaches and installing a BYU-style passing
attack which he really doesn't have the personnel to run. DuBose
says he's committed to the passing game so that Alabama can recruit
the necessary athletes to compete with Florida and Tennessee on a
consistent basis. Defensively, the Tide has been hurt by a pair of
academic losses, end Chris Hood and linebacker Steve Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks
</P>
<P>
   5 Senior John David Phillips is a converted safety who has shown
a tendency to turn the ball over. Redshirt freshman Andrew Zow is a
better athlete but has never played. Incoming freshman Tyler Watts
is talented but will be burdened by unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Running backs
</P>
<P>
   6 Two years ago, Shaun Alexander ran for a school-record 291
yards against LSU. Last season he was good, but not great, running
for 415 yards. Fullback will be solid despite the loss of 22-game
starter Ed Scissum as Montoya Madden and Dustin McClintock return.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers
</P>
<P>
   6 The return of Michael Vaughn, who missed the 1997 season with
back surgery, and Calvin Hall, a starter last season, gives this
group a chance. Quincy Jackson is back after leading the team with
29 receptions as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line
</P>
<P>
   6 Left tackle Chris Samuels and center Paul Hogan are the only
two starters that return, but several players are back who had
signficiant playing time like tackle Will Cuthbert and guards Jason
McDonald and Griff Redmill.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line
</P>
<P>
   7 The front wall took a huge blow earlier this month when end
Hood, a strong All-SEC candidate, was declared academically
ineligible. Kenny Smith moves from end to tackle and should be an
inside force. Junior Jamie Carter and redshirt freshman Sam
Matthews will also be strong at tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers
</P>
<P>
   7 This position took a hit when Harris, who had 45 tackles in 11
games last season, was ruled ineligible because of academics.
Sophomore Travis Carroll started four games at in the middle as a
true freshman. Steve Stanley and Trevis Smith are solid veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs
</P>
<P>
   7 Fernando Bryant is one of the nation's best cornerbacks and is
primed to have a very good season. Antoine Hunter will fill the
other corner spot in place of Deshea Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams
</P>
<P>
   6 Punting is fine as senior Daniel Pope returns after averaging
43.1 yards per kick. In 1997 Alabama used three different kickers
on field goals and four on extra points, so this season the
position is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    COLLEGE PREVIEW: Defenses evolve to keep up
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a movement that changes the world begins with one
quiet act of desperation. So it was for college football when Jimmy
Johnson became head coach at Oklahoma State in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had taken over a perennial Big Eight whipping boy. He
was searching for a way _ any way _ he could compete with the
Nebraskas and the Oklahomas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we couldn't get the top player _ the player who had it
all,'' said Johnson, now head coach of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.
``So we had to sacrifice something. We decided to sacrifice size
and went after the player who had great speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson didn't know it at the time, but that decision began the
most significant shift in college football philosophy in the modern
era. Johnson took his emphasis on speed to Miami in 1984 and, on a
more visible stage, won 52 games and a national championship in
five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Johnson left Miami for the Dallas Cowboys in 1989, a
game that had relied on size and strength since World War II had
been taken over by speed, speed and more speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted to do was find a way for little people to beat
big people,'' said Johnson, who was in the top 10 four of his five
years at Miami. ``It also gave us a chance to be aggressive and the
players loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Johnson's success at Miami, the switch to speed
on defense methodically made its way across the college football
landscape. Many coaches jumped on the bandwagon when it became
obvious that this was the direction in which the game was headed.
Some, however, had to be pushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different people caught on at different times during the '80s
and '90s,'' said Carl Torbush, the head coach at North Carolina.
``Those who were slow to change eventually got tired of getting
their brains beat in. You either got faster or you got your butt
fired.''
</P>
<P>
   As college football approaches the next century, the offenses
remain more sophisticated and wide-open than ever. But this much is
clear: You're not going to win a national championship without a
fast _ make that a very fast _ and aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Michigan and Nebraska, which shared
the national championship last season, were ranked No. 1 (206.9
ypg.) and No. 5 (257.3 ypg.) nationally in total defense. In fact,
each of the top five teams in total defense (Michigan, North
Carolina, Florida State, Kansas State, Nebraska) finished the
season ranked in the top 10. And their defenses had one thing in
common. They were built around players who, if nothing else, could
run like the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest change I've seen in football since I started
coaching,'' said Bobby Stoops, the defensive coordinator at
Florida. ``Today, if you can put enough fast people together on
defense, you've probably got a chance to compete. If those people
are big and fast, you've got a chance to win every game you play.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Journal-Constitution visited several of the
nation's top coaches and got their views on how defensive speed has
changed the game of college football in the 1990s. Some of them had
to learn the hard way but all of them learned: There is no
substitute for speed.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Osborne, Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   Osborne was in his 16th season as a head coach and had won 158
games when the Cornhuskers lost to Florida State 31-28 in the 1988
Fiesta Bowl. The following year, the Cornhuskers lost to Miami's
national championship team 23-3 in the Orange Bowl. A trend had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988-94, Nebraska lost seven straight bowl games, six of
them to Miami or Florida State. Year after year, Osborne was asked
why his teams would win the Big Eight title in a breeze and then
fall flat in the bowl to a team from Florida. The answer was
simple. It was speed. Or, in Nebraska's case, the lack of it on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always asked us why we didn't recruit speed like Miami
but, believe me, we tried,'' said Osborne, who retired last season
after 25 years as coach. ``We eventually got some of those kind of
players and changed our defensive philosophy so that the whole
group could run better.''
</P>
<P>
   With vastly improved speed on defense, Nebraska won three
national championships (1994, 1995, 1997) in Osborne's last four
years as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say it made a difference,'' said Osborne,
who retired with 255 career victories.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Spurrier, Florida
</P>
<P>
   One of Osborne's national championships provided a painful
lesson about defensive speed to Florida's Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier's Gators were 12-0 and ranked No. 2 after the 1995
regular season. Their Fun 'N' Gun passing attack seemed to be the
perfect counterpunch to the Nebraska option attack.
</P>
<P>
   But those who picked the Gators didn't count on one of the
fastest defenses in Nebraska history. By game's end, Nebraska had
sacked Florida quarterbacks seven times, held the Gators to
minus-28 yards rushing and posted a 62-24 thrashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game I asked my offensive line coach what he liked
to run against those guys,'' Spurrier recalled. ``He said 'nothing'
because they always seemed to have an extra man up there. I
understood what he meant.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing Nebraska, Spurrier learned that if he was ever
going to win a national championship, he would have to have a fast,
dominating defense like the one that had destroyed his beloved
offense.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1996 season, Spurrier hired Stoops away from Kansas
State as his defensive coordinator. Stoops implemented a defensive
philosophy that emphasized speed and aggressiveness above all else.
That season, Florida won the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden,
</P>
<P>
   Florida State
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, Florida State has posted 11 consecutive seasons of
10 victories or more. The Seminoles have finished in the top four
of the final Associated Press poll in each of those years.
</P>
<P>
   But people forget that Bowden's program was struggling, at least
by his standards, in the early 1980s. The Seminoles were 6-5 in
1981 and 7-4-1 in 1986, the year before they started this
unprecedented run.
</P>
<P>
   So what changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a defense and we got faster,'' said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Bowden hired Mickey Andrews as defensive coordinator
and gave him marching orders to put some faster athletes on
defense. He was aware of what Johnson had done at Miami _ all too
well. Johnson beat Bowden in four out of their five meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became pretty obvious that we weren't going to get where we
needed to go until we learned how to stop people,'' said Bowden.
``And the only way to stop speed on offense is with more speed on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, when Andrews had his system in place and the
athletes he needed to run it, Florida State is 118-15.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Torbush, N. Carolina
</P>
<P>
   Torbush became North Carolina's defensive coordinator in 1987
but in 1994 he reached a pivotal moment in his career. North
Carolina had hung on to beat Duke 41-40 in the regular-season
finale. In the Sun Bowl, his defense had blown a 31-21 lead late in
the fourth quarter and the Tar Heels lost to Texas 35-31.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Mack Brown was not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became apparent to me that we better get better or old
Torbush was going to be gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina did an about-face on its defensive philosophy by
adding speed and aggressiveness. Brown promised Torbush he would
get as many fast athletes as he needed for his side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. In 1995 North Carolina led the ACC in defense (267.3
ypg.) and was sixth in the nation. The past two seasons the Tar
Heels have ranked second nationally in total defense. In 1996 and
1997, they won 21 games and posted consecutive top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brown left for Texas, Torbush was named head coach at
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you could say I kind of like this speed thing,'' said
Torbush.

 &HT;    ACC SCOUTING REPORT
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ TEAM ON THE RISE: After missing a bowl game for the first time
in five years, Virginia is restocked for another run at the best in
the ACC. QB Aaron Brooks thrived under offensive coordinator Sparky
Woods. The Cavaliers' strength is defense, where Antonio Dingle,
Wali Rainer and Anthony Poindexter have All-America talent.
Upsetting Florida State is a longshot, but Virginia could be in the
running for a major bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   _ TEAM ON THE DECLINE: After losing the likes of Raymond
Priester, Anthony Simmons, Nealon Greene and Tony Horne, Clemson
has to regroup with a diminished, although respectable core that
will carry a heavy burden. A new quarterback and running game will
have to come through early and the defense must find a leader to
replace the invaluable Simmons for the Tigers to match a 7-5
season.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOUGHEST SCHEDULE: Playing without a breather for its first
nine games, Clemson has the unenviable task of taking to the road
against Virginia, North Carolina and Florida State between Sept. 19
and Oct. 17, a slate preceded by an intriguing visit from Virginia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ EASIEST SCHEDULE: Considering the talent gap in the ACC,
Florida State shouldn't have much trouble reasserting its
dominance. Both North Carolina and Virginia have to come to
Tallahassee, and non-conference foes Texas A&AMP;M, Southern Cal and
Miami are coming off subpar seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ GAME OF THE YEAR: Given that Florida State will likely rule
the roost yet again, Virginia's home encounter with North Carolina
on Nov. 14 could determine second place. The Cavaliers will have
just returned from playing the Seminoles, while UNC's turn at FSU
will have come Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ UPSET OF THE YEAR: If Georgia Tech's mastery of Virginia in
Atlanta two years ago can be repeated on Oct. 17, it might be just
the midseason boost for the Yellow Jackets during some very rough
sledding on the schedule. Tech plays host to Florida State the
following week and also has a road game at Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   _ FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR: One of the most celebrated prep
two-sport stars in recent years could fill a variety of roles in
his debut season. North Carolina's Ronald Curry will serve as the
backup quarterback behind Oscar Davenport and is slated to be the
punt returner. The Tar Heels have the luxury of providing him with
some seasoning before he tangles with fellow rookie Luke Huard next
season to replace Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   _ PLAYER(S) OF THE YEAR: Defense has ruled in the ACC, where
Florida State defensive lineman Andre Wadsworth was tapped as the
league's best player. North Carolina cornerback Dre' Bly could very
well take honors in his junior, and probably final, season. Florida
State's Peter Warrick is an All-American candidate at running back
and as a punt returner, and his electrifying big-play ability are
unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   _ COACH ON THE HOT SEAT: Mike O'Cain got a contract extension to
remain at N.C. State, as did Tommy West at Clemson, and no other
ACC coaches appear to be in any imminent danger. Fred Goldsmith of
Duke and Wake Forest's Jim Caldwell have been given long leashes to
bring their their respective programs to life, but bad seasons
could set ominous tones next year. Ditto at Maryland, where
second-year-man Ron Vanderlinden is under duress to make some
substantial strides toward what appears to be an even greater
rebuilding task than what he inherited last year.

 &HT;    Teams are likely to keep moving as leagues seek best possible TV
deals
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, eight members of the 16-team Western Athletic Conference
suddenly announced that they were mad as hell and they were not
going to take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The language was couched in professional terms but, in essence,
eight of the strongest schools in the WAC said they were tired of
being held back by the weak ones. They would bolt and form a
yet-to-be named conference in the fall of 1999. WAC commissioner
Karl Benson, at home recovering from eye surgery, got the news in
an afternoon telephone call from the president of Colorado State:
``Hi Karl. Sorry you're hurting, buddy. Just wanted to let you
know. We are outta here!''
</P>
<P>
   The news sent shock waves through college football. ``I'm
assuming it got everybody's attention, because it sure got ours,''
ACC commissioner John Swofford said. ``I think people were
wondering 'Could that ever happen to us?'''
</P>
<P>
   This all-too-public temper tantrum began a debate that continues
as we approach the 1998 season. Was the breakup of the WAC:
</P>
<P>
   A: An inevitable consequence of an ill-conceived conference that
covered nine states and four time zones?
</P>
<P>
   Or . . .
</P>
<P>
   B: The first noticeable tremor of a major shakeup that will hit
the sport early in the next century?
</P>
<P>
   According to a group of key college football officials, the
answer is B. In fact, they say, the question is no longer if there
is going to be another major conference realignment but when.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's going to happen,'' SEC commissioner Roy Kramer said.
``We can see the signs like everyone else. So we're doing our
homework and trying to be prepared. Then when it happens, hopefully
we can make an intelligent decision on what we should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's view was echoed by several other conference
commissioners interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. They
do not want to be caught off guard when the rumbling starts.
</P>
<P>
   `Economics and politics'
</P>
<P>
   That conferences already are preparing for college football's
equivalent of The Big One probably surprises most fans. On the
surface, the game appears to be in pretty good shape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season, Division I teams set an all-time attendance
record of 27,565,959 _ an average of 42,085 per game. The total
attendance was almost 1 million more than the previous best mark.
</P>
<P>
   _ This season marks the debut of the new Bowl Championship
Series, which will guarantee that the two top-ranked teams _ based
on a formula _ will meet in the Fiesta Bowl for the national
championship. It's not a playoff, but it will be the closest thing
college football has ever had to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although concerns remain about the overall health of the
22-game bowl system, seven of them drew their biggest crowds last
season. Thanks to a new deal with ABC, which will broadcast all
four games in the Bowl Championship Series _ Fiesta, Orange, Sugar,
Rose _ the system will pump a record $127.3 million back into
college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, things are looking pretty stable right now,''
Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese said. ``Do I think they are
going to stay that way? Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the coming upheaval, as with
most of the changes that have taken place in the past 15 years,
will be driven by television.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major conferences have multiyear network deals that
are scheduled to run out during the early part of the next century.
As the renewal dates of those contracts draw near, each conference
will begin negotiating to try to increase _ or at least maintain _
its share of those finite television dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That's where expansion comes in. A conference's television
dollars are determined by how many viewers it can deliver to the
networks on any given Saturday. So if one conference expands in an
effort to increase its numbers, the others risk losing their share
if they don't react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has to do with both economics and politics,'' Big
Ten commissioner Jim Delany said. ``You have to maintain your power
to negotiate with the networks, but you also have to keep yourself
strong within an organization like the NCAA. So you have to stay on
top of things like this. You can never afford to be passive.''
</P>
<P>
   Started with Big Ten
</P>
<P>
   To understand how the process probably will work, go back to
December 1989, when the Big Ten extended an invitation to Penn
State to become its 11th member. The Big Ten already was the
nation's most powerful television conference, delivering the large
markets in Detroit, Cleveland and Chicago. With Penn State, it
added the eastern markets of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia to that
list.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State would not begin Big Ten play until 1993, but the move
brought about an immediate chain reaction:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1991, the SEC added Arkansas, which left the Southwest
Conference, and South Carolina to become a 12-team conference split
into two six-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC had a huge internal battle before taking Florida State
as its ninth member.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Penn State no longer available, the remaining Eastern
independents _ Syracuse, Rutgers, Pittsburgh, West Virginia,
Temple, Virginia Tech and Boston College _ persuaded Miami to join
them in forming the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, another television event created the next wave of
change. The SEC broke away from the College Football Association
television package to cut its own five-year, $125 million deal with
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The other conferences then began scrambling for their own TV
deals. In the process, the Southwest Conference, which had been in
business since 1914, dissolved and sent its four strongest schools
_ Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Texas Tech, Baylor _ to merge with the Big
Eight and form the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the WAC, sensing it was going to be left out in the
cold, took in three refugees from the SWC and pulled in several
others in what was essentially an act of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just think,'' Tranghese said. ``All of that happened with
just one move by the Big Ten. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Are Irish Big Ten bound?
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure exactly when the next wave of conference
realignments will begin, but they agree that the Big Ten again will
get the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   When the Big Ten made Penn State its 11th team, it was a given
that the conference eventually would add a 12th member and go to
divisional play, as the SEC, Big 12, Mid-American and WAC do. The
SEC title game generates almost $450,000 annually for each of its
12 schools. In the next century, when such economic pressures as
Title IX, which requires equal athletic opportunities for women,
grow greater, the schools will not be able to ignore any source of
income.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten has made it clear that it wants Notre Dame, the
greatest of all television teams, to become that 12th member.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, it was inconceivable that Notre Dame would give
up its 100-year status as an independent. For one thing, the Irish
already have the best television deal: NBC televises every home
game, and the school gets all of the money. That contract runs
through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two months, the Big Ten and Notre Dame have
been exchanging information, giving the school a sense of what
membership would be like. Notre Dame officials now concede that
joining the Big Ten would not necessarily bring about the major
financial hit it had feared. That, say those familiar with the
process, is a major concession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We once thought it was a pretty significant disincentive
financially,'' Notre Dame athletics director Mike Wadsworth said.
``It's certainly not so obvious as we thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame officials will continue to study the question and
some time next year will make a recommendation to the school's
administration. For the first time, it seems possible that Notre
Dame could join the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, the Big Ten would become college football's
version of the 600-pound gorilla, able to dominate in its
negotiations with the networks. That is, if everybody else stands
pat. Which, of course, they won't.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to happen
</P>
<P>
   Based on a number of interviews with officials around the
country, here is a possible sequence of events once Notre Dame
joins the Big Ten:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Big East, the weakest of the six conferences in the Bowl
Championship Series, will find it difficult to renegotiate its
television deal with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline of Miami, which was supposed to be its football
anchor, the Big East has struggled for respect on the field. Last
season the league's non-conference record was 13-20. Against
non-conference teams with winning records, it was 3-15.
</P>
<P>
   If the Big East takes a hit on its television package, the
strongest members will grow tired of being held back by such woeful
programs asRutgers (0-11 last season) and Temple (3-8). Some of
them will look for a new home and find it _ in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   _ But the ACC will have another major internal fight on the
subject of expansion. The non-expansion folks don't want to do
anything that would further divide ACC basketball tournament
tickets, the most precious commodity in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ However, the conference has a new commissioner and several new
athletics directors who will see the writing on the wall. Its
current TV contract with ABC expires in 2005. Without expansion,
the dollars on the next contract could be significantly less.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ACC will pass on such schools as West Virginia and
Virginia Tech, which make the most sense geographically. Instead,
it will add Boston College and Syracuse to expand its television
clout up the Atlantic coast. To get an even stronger presence in
Florida, it will add Miami.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pac-10 has had a long-standing invitation for Texas and
Colorado to join. That invitation will be extended again. Texas
will decline again, but Colorado will accept.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado makes no secret of its desire to get out of the Big 12,
a group of schools with which it has little in common. Colorado, in
fact, does most of its recruiting in California.
</P>
<P>
   Texas will have to say no because the state legislature won't
allow the Longhorns to go off on their own and leave the other
state schools behind.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Pac-10 will look for another strong football school
with West Coast ties and take BYU as its 12th member.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Colorado gone, the Big 12 will invite SMU to return to
the fold after its exile to the WAC in 1995. That move would give
the conference a bigger share of the Dallas market.
</P>
<P>
   _ The SEC will think seriously about inviting Texas and Texas
A&AMP;M in order to compete with the Big Ten's blockbuster package.
Ultimately, however, the conference will stand pat, confident that
its current strength will weather the storm. In May, the 12 SEC
members divided a record $58 million from television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our athletics directors are pretty smart. They certainly know
how to do math,'' Kramer said. ``They know the money we make is
more divided by 12 than divided by 14.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC expansion still isn't out of the question, because of the
Big 12 situation.
</P>
<P>
   After the WAC and the Big East, the Big 12 is on the shakiest
ground. Since the conference began in 1996, it has been wracked by
dissension between the old Big Eight members and the Texas schools,
who think they are treated like second-class citizens. The Big 12
forced out Steve Hatchell as commissioner earlier this year and
still doesn't have a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   If the league splits, the SEC will rethink its position on the
two Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   The new look
</P>
<P>
   When the dust finally settles, college football will look
significantly different:
</P>
<P>
   _ There will be five major conferences _ ACC, SEC, Big Ten, Big
12, Pac-12 _ and each will have 12 members. Each will negotiate a
multiyear deal with the networks, and, as a result, those 60
schools will control an even larger percentage of television
revenue than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   _ The second-level conferences _ the Great Eight (the WAC
secessionists), Mid-American, Conference USA, Big West _ will have
to scramble for regional-television exposure, which does not pay
the big bucks. As the TV revenue for these schools goes down, so
will their ability to compete at the highest level of the sport.
The gap between the haves and the have-nots will grow wider each
year.
</P>
<P>
   _ After absorbing Big East refugees West Virginia, Pittsburgh
and Virginia Tech to form a 14-team league, Conference USA will
make a push to be included as a member of the Bowl Championship
Series. It will fail.
</P>
<P>
   With the new television contracts in place, things will be
peaceful in college football once more. For a while, at least.
</P>
<P>
   But as the new contracts approach their ends, schools again will
get the itch to improve their situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that after the next series of realignments, things
should be pretty calm for a while,'' Kramer said. ``But I wouldn't
bet on it.''

 &HT;    Haves and have-nots
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A look at some of the teams, players and matchups to watch this
season in the major college conferences.
</P>
<P>
   BIG TEN
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: Joe Tiller delivered in his first season at
Purdue, giving the Boilermakers their first winning season (9-3)
since 1984. The sophisticated passing attack he brought from
Wyoming has been a hit with recruits. Two more recruiting classes
like the last one and the Boilermakers could start scaring people
at the top of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: This probably will be Hayden Fry's final
season at Iowa. Fry turns 70 in February and opponents are starting
to use his age against the school in recruiting. Hawkeye fans might
be ready for a change: Iowa had difficulty selling 2,000 tickets to
the Sun Bowl game against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Another reason for Fry to retire after this
season: The Hawkeyes open at Nebraska in 1999. Fry will turn the
program over to a younger man to take on that challenge. Florida
defensive coordinator Bob Stoops is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has the talent to win the national championship, but
will likely need to win at home against Michigan Nov. 21 to keep
the critics off coach John Cooper's back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: LB Andy Katzenmoyer, WR David Boston and DB
Antoine Winfield, Ohio State; RB Anthony Thomas, Michigan; RB
Sedrick Irvin, Michigan State; RB Ron Dayne, Wisconsin; LB Brandon
Short, Penn State; DL Jared DeVries, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Michigan at Notre Dame, Sept. 5; Ohio State at
West Virginia, Sept 5; Michigan State at Michigan, Sept. 26; Penn
State at Ohio State, Oct. 3; Penn State at Michigan, Nov. 7;
Michigan at Ohio State, Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (6): Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State,
Wisconsin, Michigan State and Purdue. Northwestern, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   CONFERENCE USA
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: Tommy Bowden performed nothing less than a minor
miracle in his first season at Tulane. When Bowden arrived, the
Green Wave had won only five games in the previous three seasons.
In 1997, it was 7-4 overall with the only conference loss to
champion Southern Miss. Tulane returns 10 starters from an offense
that set 26 school records. If Bowden stays a couple more years,
the Green Wave could win the conference. But that's a big if.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: It's hard to believe that in this decade,
Louisville played Alabama in the Fiesta Bowl _ and won. Ron Cooper
was let go after winning just six games in his final two seasons,
and on comes John L. Smith, who was an offensive guru at Utah
State. The Cardinals will be fun to watch, but they still have one
of the nation's worst defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Two years ago, Houston went to the Liberty
Bowl. Last year, the Cougars dropped to 3-8, and two of the wins
were by three points or less. Coach Kim Helton promises the program
will turn the corner soon. This season would be a good time to
start.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: QB Chris Redman, TE Ibn Green, Louisville;
RB Ketric Sanford, Houston; WR Sherrod Gideon, DL Adalius Thomas,
Southern Miss; DL Marquis Bowling, DB Mike McKenzie, Memphis; QB
Shaun King, RB Toney Converse, WR JaJuan Dawson, Tulane; OL Brian
Uhl, DB/KR Tinker Keck, Cincinnati
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Southern Miss at Penn State, Sept. 5; Kentucky at
Louisville, Sept. 5; Texas A&AMP;M at Southern Miss, Sept. 19; Southern
Miss at Tulane, Oct. 3; Southern Miss at Alabama, Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (2): Southern Miss, Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   BIG EAST
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: West Virginia appears ready for a breakthrough
season after finishing 7-5 and losing in the Carquest Bowl last
season. Heisman Trophy candidate Amos Zereoue and quarterback Marc
Bulger head an explosive offense. The Mountaineers could contend
for the national championship this season.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting bottom in a 47-0 loss to Florida State last
season, Miami is working its way back to respectability. After a
5-6 season in 1997, the Hurricanes finally were free of NCAA
sanctions and able to sign a full recruiting class. Running back
Edgerrin James leads a talented backfield. Coach Butch Davis has
turned down several offers to leave Miami. He knows the 'Canes
aren't far from being good again.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: Rutgers was 0-11 last season, which was Terry
Shea's second as coach. It doesn't figure to get much better. Shea
says he's optimistic about 1998, but that's not based on talent.
Getting good players to visit Piscataway, N.J., isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Syracuse is good enough to win the Big East
but must open the season with consecutive games against Tennessee
and Michigan. The Orangemen also face a stiff test with consecutive
games against West Virginia and Virginia Tech in November.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: QB Donovan McNabb, WR Quinton Spotwood,
Syracuse; RB Amos Zereoue, LB Gary Stills, West Virginia; RB
Edgerrin James, LB Dan Morgan, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Ohio State at West Virginia, Sept. 5, Tennessee at
Syracuse, Sept. 5; Penn State at Pittsburgh, Sept. 19; Florida
State at Miami, Oct. 10; Miami at West Virginia, Oct. 24; Syracuse
at West Virginia, Nov. 7; Miami at Syracuse, Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (4): West Virginia, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   WAC
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: SMU went 6-5 in Mike Cavan's first year and put
the rest of the conference on notice. The Mustangs weren't the most
talented bunch in the Mountain Division, but they played hard every
week. Cavan followed up by putting together an impressive
recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: TCU is coming off its worst season (1-10) in
17 years, and it looks as if things will get worse. Dennis
Franchione took over for Pat Sullivan as coach and has changed just
about everything, from the offense to the demands of the offseason
program.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Tulsa is 4-12 in the WAC and 6-16 overall
since joining the league three years ago. Coach Dave Rader has been
at Tulsa for 10 years, so it might be time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: RB Damon Washington, OG Anthony Cesario,
Colorado State; QB Jon Denton, UNLV; QB Graham Leigh, New Mexico;
DL Pene Talamaivao, LB Phil Glover, Utah; RB Ronney Jenkins, BYU;
DE Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Colorado State at Michigan State, Aug. 29;
Colorado State at Colorado, Sept. 5; BYU at Alabama, Sept. 5;
Arizona State at BYU, Sept. 12; SMU at Arkansas, Sept. 19; Colorado
State at Air Force, Sept. 17; Colorado State at Rice, Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (4): Colorado State, Utah, BYU, Rice.
</P>
<P>
   BIG 12
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: It won't show this year, necessarily, but Texas
is on the way back under new coach Mack Brown. Brown, unlike
predecessor John Mackovic, speaks the language of the Longhorn
state and has a knack for luring great high school players to his
program. Give Brown two more recruiting classes like the most
recent one, and Texas will be knocking on the door of a Big 12
title.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: Colorado went 10-2 in Rick Neuheisel's first
two years as coach before dropping to 5-6 last season. Something is
missing in this program, and it might be talent. The Buffs simply
haven't been doing a big-time job in recruiting as they did under
Bill McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Oklahoma could set a dubious school record in
1998 by posting its fifth straight losing season. The Sooners are
3-8 and 4-8 in John Blake's two years and have looked bad doing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: RB Ricky Williams, Texas; QB Michael Bishop,
Kansas State; DE Michael Rucker, QB Bobby Newcombe, Nebraska; RB
Dante Hall, LB Dat Nguyen, Texas A&AMP;M; RB Darren Davis, Iowa State;
QB Corby Jones, Missouri; RB De'Mond Parker, Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Texas at Kansas State, Sept. 19; Washington at
Nebraska, Sept. 26; Nebraska at Texas A&AMP;M, Oct. 10; Texas at
Nebraska, Oct. 31; Nebraska at Kansas State, Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (6): Kansas State, Nebraska, Texas A&AMP;M,
Colorado, Oklahoma State, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   PAC 10
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: Southern California coach Paul Hackett has yet to
prove he can get it done as the head man, but he inherits a team
with 15 returning starters and most of the tough games at home.
Given the surrounding talent base, USC should be a Top 15 team
every year. This season, the Trojans begin the long march back.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: Washington State had its 15 minutes of fame
last season, as it rode quarterback Ryan Leaf all the way to the
Rose Bowl. Only five starters return, and the Cougars return to
reality. Four years after advancing to the Rose Bowl, Oregon finds
itself fighting to remain in the upper half of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Dick Tomey is in the last year of his
contract at Arizona. The Wildcats saved him last season by winning
their last four games, including an upset of Arizona State. That he
didn't get a new deal speaks volumes. Arizona will begin the season
in the Top 25, but will face a tough stretch in October with
consecutive games against Washington and UCLA and the season finale
against Arizona State. Things will be tight in Tucson this season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: QB Cade McNown, OT Kris Farris, UCLA; RB
J.R. Redmond, Arizona State; CB Chris McAlister, Arizona; LB Chris
Claiborne, CB Daylon McCutcheon, USC; DE Andre Carter, California;
QB Brock Huard, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Washington at Arizona State, Sept. 5; USC at
Florida State, Washington at Nebraska, Sept. 26; Arizona State at
USC, Oct. 3; Washington at USC, Oct. 31; UCLA at Washington, Nov.
14; Arizona State at Arizona, Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (5): Arizona State, UCLA, USC, Washington,
Arizona. Oregon is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   MID-AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: Western Michigan, 2-9 in 1996, posted the
nation's best turnaround in 1997 with an 8-3 record in Gary
Darnell's first year as coach. Fifteen starters, including nine on
offense, return in 1998. The Broncos are expected to give Toledo a
run in the MAC's West Division.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: In the early '90s, Bowling Green was the class
of the league. Now, the Falcons are struggling with a 7-15 mark the
past two years. Coach Gary Blackney is trying to save things by
bringing in six JUCOs and some older players from Canada. It
doesn't look good.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Herb Deromedi, who won 110 games in 16
seasons as coach of Central Michigan, hand-picked friend Dick Flynn
to take over the program when he retired in 1993. Flynn won a MAC
championship in 1994 but the Chippewas have struggled since. They
were 2-9 last season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: QB Chad Pennington, WR Lavorn Colclogh,
Marshall; DL Jon McCall, WR Reggie Allen, Central Michigan; QB
Kareem Wilson, Ohio; LB JoJuan Armour, DB Paris Johnson, Miami; WR
Eugene Baker, Kent State. QB Chris Wallace, Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Marshall at Akron, Sept. 5; Western Michigan at
Toledo, Sept. 19; Ohio at Western Michigan, Sept. 26; Miami at
Marshall, Oct. 3; Marshall at Ohio, Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (1): Toledo will beat Marshall in the MAC
championship game and get the league's automatic berth in the Motor
City Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS
</P>
<P>
   _ On the rise: Central Florida put a major scare into some
big-time programs last season, thanks to the heroics of quarterback
Duante Culpepper. Now, the Golden Knights are thinking bowl game.
The program was rocked by the forced resignation of coach Gene
McDowell after the cell-phone scandal, but new coach Mike Kruczek
has held things together well.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the decline: Southwestern Louisiana has never been great
but usually was competitive. That is no longer the case: Last
season, the Rajun' Cajuns were 1-10, and they don't figure to get a
whole lot better. Coach Nelson Stokley has been there 12 years and
definitely is feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the hot seat: Central Florida's Kruczek inherited a very
good team with one of the nation's best quarterbacks. He turned
down a three-year deal to be an offensive coordinator in the NFL
and has only a one-year agreement with UCF.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davie has had to deal with several off-the-field problems
during the off-season, including an embarrassing trial involving
former assistant Joe Moore. It will be interesting to see how the
Irish handle adversity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players to watch: QB Daunte Culpepper, CB Reginald Doster,
Central Florida; TB Autry Denson, LB Kory Minor, Notre Dame; QB Tim
Rattay, Louisiana Tech; WR Marty Booker, NE Louisiana; TB Lucious
Foster, UAB; WR Brandon Stokley, SW Louisiana; RB Bobby Ray Tell,
Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best games: Notre Dame at Michigan, Sept. 5; Central Florida
at Purdue, Sept. 19; Central Florida at Auburn, Nov. 7; Louisiana
Tech at Texas A&AMP;M, Sept. 12; Louisiana Tech at Auburn, Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going bowling (2): Notre Dame, Central Florida.

 &HT;    Doug Williams tries to reinvigorate Grambling
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he replaces living legend Eddie Robinson on the Grambling
sideline, former G-man Doug Williams wants to make one thing clear
to fellow alumni and friends:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to realize that I won't be trying to walk in
Coach Rob's shoes. What he did won't be duplicated,'' Williams
said. ``But this is a new era, and I just hope me and my staff have
the opportunity to do our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who coached at Morehouse College in Atlanta last
season, returns to his alma mater as the second coach in school
history. Robinson, who stepped down after his last two teams had
posted 3-8 records, started football at Grambling in 1941.
Fifty-five seasons and 408 victories later, Robinson reluctantly
left his once-proud program.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams has inherited for his first season on the scene of
his collegiate heroics is a team thin on talent and short on
experience. He estimates that as many as seven freshmen could
start, perhaps all four in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer reloading here like we once were,'' Williams
said. ``Realistically, we're rebuilding, and we've got to take our
lumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten starters return, but Williams is not convinced that all 10
will start this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've moved some guys around, from offense to defense, and
defense to offense,'' he said. ``Some of them may not be out there
(as starters).''
</P>
<P>
   Williams does think he has linebackers and two transfers capable
of running his offense. One is former Arkansas quarterback Lajun
``Pete'' Burks (6-2, 195), and the other is Lionel Hayes (6-4,
225), who transferred from Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest suit, however, could be the coaching staff. It
includes former NFL star Sammy White (receivers coach), former
Grambling quarterback Matt Reed (quarterback coach), former
Pittsburgh Steeler Tyrone McGriff (offensive line) and three from
the Morehouse staff, including defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, a
Washington Redskins teammate of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year as a coach in the Southwestern Athletic
Conference, the league in which he passed for 8,411 yards as a
player (1974-77), Williams will be one of four new coaches in the
league. Ron Dickerson, who was fired after five years at Temple,
has replaced Houston Markum at Alabama State, former Louisville
coach Ron Cooper is the head coach at first-year conference member
Alabama A&AMP;M and Dr. Johnny Thomas, a former coach who put that
profession on hold for several years while he sought a doctorate,
is the new man at Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   None of those coaches is expected to guide their teams into
contention for the SWAC title, which Southern or Jackson State has
won four of the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Arkansas-Pine Bluff coach Lee Hardman, whose team went 8-3
last year and has been picked to finish third behind Southern and
Jackson State, said, ``I think the new coaches coming in are going
to be a plus for the conference, because they come in with new
ideas. They can only heighten our programs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference: With one of the
toughest defenses in Division II last year returning almost intact,
Albany State has an excellent chance of winning its sixth straight
SIAC championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were 11-0 before losing 22-21 to Carson Newman in the
second round of the '97 NCAA Division II playoffs. A repeat
probably hinges on how effectively freshman Jamal Robinson can
replace Purvis Jackson at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Valley State, with junior quarterback Renotto Solomon and
tailback LaVorris White, might have improved enough on both sides
of the ball in coach Kent Scholfield's second year to be in the
championship race from start to finish. Morris Brown is also
expected to compete for the title.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference: Hampton University has been
picked to repeat as champion in Joe Taylor's seventh season as
coach. The Pirates will have to replace their top three receivers
and leading rusher Charles Jackson (1,138 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M was the choice for second but will have to see if
former Southwest DeKalb High product Michael Morand is an adequate
replacement for Oteman Sampson, who passed for 3,292 yards and 25
touchdowns for the 9-3 Rattlers last year. Hampton and FAMU play
the critical game, Sept. 5 in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Howard University, led by quarterback Ted White (6-4, 220), who
during the past two seasons has thrown for 5,455 yards and 54 TDs,
could challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference: After the
remarkable 1997 run by Livingstone, the nation's smallest Division
II school, the CIAA probably returns to the hands of Virginia
State, which had won the two previous titles.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference that dropped to nine teams with Norfolk State's
move to the MEAC, Virginia State returns 55 lettermen, including
all-stars Antonio Hawkins at quarterback (1,550 yards, 17 TDs),
Desmond Thornton at wideout (44 catches, 601 yards) and linebacker
Eugene Brown (12 sacks).

 &HT;    ABC push leads to bowl game shove
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like ages ago, but earlier this decade ABC was not only
the big dog of college football but network television's only dog
in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those mavericks at Notre Dame, who dared to split
from the pack and cut a separate deal for their home games with
NBC, ABC was the sole national carrier on ``free TV.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the College Football Association fell apart, and CBS
moved deftly to acquire the SEC and Big East. ABC had to look on
with envy when CBS positioned itself to carry the national
championship game of the Bowl Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   However, ABC held a trump card to the effectiveness of the Bowl
Alliance because that setup did not include the Big Ten, Pacific-10
and Rose Bowl. ABC also would point out that its package continued
to win the ratings battle, consistently drawing numbers that were
25 percent higher or more than CBS' and NBC's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a network that always considered college football as
one of its main identities, it grated on ABC that a rival had
snatched the high-profile SEC and could claim the so-called
national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's situation with Michigan and Nebraska provided
ABC the impetus needed to get behind closed doors and emerge with
the Bowl Championship Series, which encompasses every conference
and theoretically should yield a true version of No. 1 vs. No. 2
for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ABC reportedly paid $80 million for the rights to the Bowl
Championship Series, which will rotate the national championship
game among the Fiesta, Sugar, Orange and Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often the networks are accused of dictating events, and
quite often that's simply not true,'' ABC publicist Mark Mandel
said. ``But in this case, we were the prime player. The Bowl
Championship Series would not have happened without ABC's
involvement. Any other network couldn't have pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous system was flawed because it did not have the
Rose Bowl. It took creativity and hard work by ABC to (persuade)
the Rose Bowl to be a part of this. It's not a perfect system. This
is not a perfect world. But it is a guarantee of a national
championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, although barely visible in the postseason picture now with
only the Sun Bowl, is not ready to concede that guarantee to its
rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a farce,'' CBS studio analyst Craig James
said. ``It's not what college football fans want. I was talking
playoff system before this, and I'll always talk playoff system.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS studio host Tim Brando said, ``The spin on the Bowl
Championship Series is they want to protect the bowls. But the
bowls are not doing fine. Kansas State was not as deserving as
North Carolina or UCLA last year, but Kansas State went because it
would bring 30,000 people to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing standpoint, the title Bowl Championship
Series suggests more than one game. Simply because we had a
Nebraska vs. Michigan scenario last year doesn't mean it will work
that way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the game coverage, not much has changed from a year ago.
Keith Jackson and Bob Griese return as ABC's No. 1 team, as do Sean
McDonough and Terry Donahue for CBS and Ron Franklin and Mike
Gottfried for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will make its debut in college football with the Cotton
Bowl, while Fox Sports South again will pick up Raycom's ACC
package at noon for the Atlanta market, while also airing games
from the Southern Conference, Conference USA, Big 12 and the
Pac-10. WATL (Channel 36) will carry Jefferson-Pilot's SEC schedule
at 12:30 p.m.

 &HT;    NFL High Fives
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Really good games
</P>
<P>
   Some ``don't-miss'' NFL games that will justify the purchase of
a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Tampa Bay at Green Bay (Sept. 13): If Tampa Bay is to be a
real contender, it must beat the Packers at Lambeau.
</P>
<P>
   2. Denver at Washington (Sept. 27): Redskins' new tackles, Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, get a shot at Broncos RB Terrell
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   3. San Francisco at Green Bay (Nov. 1): Niners get chance to see
if they are for real or just kings of the sorry NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kansas City at Denver (Dec. 6): One of the best rivalries in
the NFL. Game could determine division championship and playoff
seedings.
</P>
<P>
   5. Pittsburgh at Jacksonville (Dec. 28): Series is tied 3-3, and
the average margin is 3.3 points, with three of the last four
meetings decided in the final two minutes or overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Good gets
</P>
<P>
   Some teams made excellent veteran acquisitions during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   1. OG Kevin Donnalley (Miami): Coach Jimmy Johnson needed a good
blocker, and he got one.
</P>
<P>
   2. RB Curtis Martin (N.Y. Jets): If he's healthy, and that's a
big if, given his track record, former Patriots star will provide
Bill Parcells the tough inside slasher he wants.
</P>
<P>
   3. DT Dana Stubblefield (Washington): Coming off a 15-sack
season, and Washington paid ($9.9 million) because of it.
</P>
<P>
   4. WR Bert Emanuel (Tampa Bay): Brings big-play potential to Buc
passing game and should become go-to guy for erratic Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   5. DE Hugh Douglas (Philadelphia): Gives the Eagles their best
outside rusher since DE William Fuller departed in free agency in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the rise
</P>
<P>
   Terrific players who are known only to the hardest-core fans.
</P>
<P>
   1. DT Travis Hall (Atlanta): His trademark ``Mormon Maneuver''
rush move has helped him notch 16 1/2 sacks the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   2. OG Ron Stone (N.Y. Giants): Skeptics snickered when the
Giants signed the restricted free agent to a $2.069 million-a-year
deal in '96, but he's developed into a very physical in-line
blocker.
</P>
<P>
   3. OT Jonathan Ogden (Baltimore): Has allowed only three sacks
in two seasons and drives off on running plays better than he used
to.
</P>
<P>
   4. SS John Lynch (Tampa Bay): Sometimes a liability in coverage,
but his strong suit is run support and big hits.
</P>
<P>
   5. LB Mo Lewis (N.Y. Jets): Former University of Georgia player
has played well at all three linebacker spots during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Big hitters worth watching
</P>
<P>
   Open-field defenders who increase concussion rates and insurance
premiums:
</P>
<P>
   1. SS Rodney Harrison (San Diego): Plays the run like a
linebacker and hits bigger than his size.
</P>
<P>
   2. MLB Ray Lewis (Baltimore): Loves to knock off tight ends
coming across the middle. Actually has knocked himself out with
some tackles.
</P>
<P>
   3. ILB Earl Holmes (Pittsburgh): Has good speed and gets into
hitting position quickly.
</P>
<P>
   4. SS Lawyer Milloy (New England): Makes receivers fear him in
the intermediate zones. Has great timing.
</P>
<P>
   5. OLB Jamir Miller (Arizona): Doesn't blitz as much as he once
did but loves a running start before hitting high and driving his
shoulders into opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Terrific tutors
</P>
<P>
   The best assistant coaches, coordinators excluded, no one knows
about.
</P>
<P>
   1. Andy Reid (Green Bay/quarterbacks): Replaced Steve Mariucci
as confidant for Brett Favre. If Mike Holmgren leaves the Packers,
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis probably gets the job, but Reid
will get some consideration.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bill Kollar (Atlanta/defensive line): Coaching skills are
sometimes overshadowed by legendary growling at practices, but he's
developed into a top assistant.
</P>
<P>
   3. Joe Vitt (Philadelphia/linebackers): Great knowledge in the
``back end'' of a defense and has been very creative in developing
blitz and coverage packages.
</P>
<P>
   4. Kent Stephenson (Pittsburgh/offensive line): Tough-minded and
intense, and Steelers linemen have come to reflect that style.
</P>
<P>
   5. Jim Mora Jr. (San Francisco/secondary): There's no doubt his
name helped get him a job, but in 12 seasons ``J.R.'' has
demonstrated his own expertise.
</P>
<P>
   They love the game
</P>
<P>
   These players would consider playing for free.
</P>
<P>
   1. DE Chuck Smith (Atlanta): Plays with passion. Gives no
quarter and expects none.
</P>
<P>
   2. MLB Ted Johnson (New England): The epitome of what the old
4-3 middle linebackers used to be.
</P>
<P>
   3. OT Ross Verba (Green Bay): Got into a brawl in his first camp
practice as 1997 rookie and immediately earned the respect of QB
Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   4. MLB Ed McDaniel (Minnesota): An overachiever who doesn't know
when to quit; combines intensity with survival instincts.
</P>
<P>
   5. DT Wayne Martin (New Orleans): Rarely gets Pro Bowl
consideration, but he plays the game clean and hard on every snap.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Really bad games
</P>
<P>
   These games are for friends and relatives only.
</P>
<P>
   1. Jacksonville at Chicago (Sept. 6): The Jaguars could
represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXXIII. The Bears could have the
first selection in the 1999 draft. The point spread in Las Vegas is
in double-digits.
</P>
<P>
   2. New Orleans at Indianapolis (Sept. 27): Archie Manning's son
plays against his old team. Mike Ditka goes against former Saints
coach Jim Mora. Great storylines in the Big Easy; terrible game for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   3. St. Louis at New Orleans (Nov. 15): A chance for one of these
NFC West dregs teams to get a victory.
</P>
<P>
   4. Buffalo at Cincinnati (Dec. 6): Both teams probably will be
already eliminated from playoff contention, and the wind will be
howling off the Ohio River. Great reasons to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   5. Kansas City at Oakland (Dec. 26): This used to be one of the
NFL's big rivalries. But the Chiefs have won 15 of the last 17.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeting fame
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks who could lose their starting jobs by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   1. Gus Frerotte (Washington): The four-year veteran is right
behind coach Norv Turner on the Redskins' hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Glenn Foley (N.Y. Jets): The player anointed by coach Bill
Parcells hasn't started and finished with a victory since playing
at Boston College in '93.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tony Banks (St. Louis): Banks hasn't progressed, and coach
Dick Vermeil is losing patience.
</P>
<P>
   4. Billy Joe Hobert (New Orleans): The only reason coach Mike
Ditka likes him so much is that he's the best of a sorry lot.
</P>
<P>
   5. Erik Kramer (Chicago): He already has a history of injuries,
and it won't be easy to stay healthy behind the Bears' shaky
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Really hot seats
</P>
<P>
   Coaches who are high on the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   1. Ray Rhodes (Philadelphia): His act _ an incredible temper and
a vocabulary that would make some sailors blush _ has worn thin on
players and management.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kevin Gilbride (San Diego): GM Bobby Beathard apparently is
skeptical now about whether Gilbride can succeed.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dennis Green (Minnesota): Forget that the Vikings have been
in the playoffs five times in six seasons; new owner Red McCombs
will want his own man.
</P>
<P>
   4. Dave Wannstedt (Chicago): Wannstedt got total control when he
was hired, but poor drafts are hurting him.
</P>
<P>
   5. Mike Ditka (New Orleans): Never mind the new, three-year
contract extension; the Big Easy will be through with Iron Mike by
the end of this season, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Slip-sliding away
</P>
<P>
   Potential members of the Hall of Fame who stuck around too long.
</P>
<P>
   1. CB Rod Woodson (Baltimore): He's getting beaten by receivers
who shouldn't be on the field with him.
</P>
<P>
   2. DE Reggie White (Green Bay): The greatest sackman in history
is known more now for anti-everything statements.
</P>
<P>
   3. RB Thurman Thomas (Buffalo): One of the finest all-purpose
backs in recent history has been reduced to just one purpose,
third-down receiver, in his 11th season.
</P>
<P>
   4. DE Leslie O'Neal (Kansas City): Will be with his third team
in four seasons, and snaps should be limited primarily to obvious
passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   5. RB Emmitt Smith (Dallas): The workhorse pace of averaging
324.4 rushes a season during his career finally caught up to Smith
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Direct deposits
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most inexplicable free-agent signings of the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   1. DT Ray Agnew (St. Louis): Despite starting just two games in
two seasons, Agnew got a four-year, $8.1 million deal with a $2
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   2. QB Neil O'Donnell (Cincinnati): The usually thrifty Bengals
coughed up a signing bonus of $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. CB Larry Brown (Minnesota): Good thing the corner-thin Vikes
have only $100,000 in up-front money invested. Brown is slow.
</P>
<P>
   4. DE Gabe Wilkins (San Francisco): He got a $4.5 signing bonus,
but he hasn't practiced yet and won't play until at least
mid-September because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   5. OG Lester Holmes (Arizona): Cardinals paid $11 million for
four years, with a signing bonus of $3.5 million, to an average
blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Bad acts
</P>
<P>
   These people are acting phat but wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   1. WR Michael Irvin (Dallas): Irvin (left) has come to exemplify
the seamy side of the Cowboys, with scissors-wielding incident the
latest. But that's no problem for coddling owner.
</P>
<P>
   2. LB Bryan Cox (N.Y. Jets): Hard to believe that Bill Parcells
will put up with Cox's temper tantrums and lack of control.
</P>
<P>
   3. Owner Al Davis (Oakland): The once-brilliant Davis is living
in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   4. LB Bill Romanowski (Denver): Way over the edge, even for the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   5. Analyst Joe Theismann (ESPN): Giant ego. Doesn't do his
homework. A master of the obvious.

 &HT;    Len Pasquarelli's NFL Preview
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NFL writer Len Pasquarelli rates the league from top to bottom.
Power ratings in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   1. GREEN BAY (77.5): Free-agent talent drain puts more pressure
on QB Brett Favre and offense, but three-time MVP is still league's
best playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   2. JACKSONVILLE (77): Probably best overall depth in NFL, and
Jaguars veterans are tired of playing second fiddle to Pittsburgh
in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   3. KANSAS CITY (75.5): Only question is suspect running game,
with tailback by committee. The defense, No. 11 in 1997, is even
better this year.
</P>
<P>
   4. DENVER (75): Preseason injuries and offensive-line
uncertainty create some slippage, as QB John Elway stages his
``Farewell Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   5. TAMPA BAY (74): People love to take shots at owner Malcolm
Glazer, but where were all those geniuses when Tony Dungy couldn't
get a job?
</P>
<P>
   6. PITTSBURGH (73.5): Lost some free agents again but retained
director of football operations Tom Donahoe and coach Bill Cowher,
two keys.
</P>
<P>
   7. SAN FRANCISCO (73): Not nearly as good as advertised.
Division is so weak, though, Niners could win 11-12 games just by
showing up.
</P>
<P>
   8. WASHINGTON (72): Management laid out $16.4 million for two
new defensive tackles. This is the season QB Gus Frerotte must show
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   9. MINNESOTA (71.5): Offense rates as one of the league's most
explosive. Defensive coordinator Foge Fazio again will need some
smoke and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   10. N.Y. GIANTS (71.5): Roster better than a year ago, but a
killer schedule probably translates into fewer victories for coach
Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   11. MIAMI (71): Terrific athletes but few big stars on defensive
side. Will QB Dan Marino be content in a new offense designed to
run the ball?
</P>
<P>
   12. DETROIT (71): Best thing embattled QB Scott Mitchell can do
is keep handing the ball to RB Barry Sanders and get out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   13. NEW ENGLAND (71): Coming off sloppy training camp, and
second-year coach Pete Carroll already is rumored to be on the hot
seat.
</P>
<P>
   14. TENNESSEE (70.5): Intriguing offensive talent, certainly on
fringes of playoff contention. Chances hurt by overall strength of
division.
</P>
<P>
   15. N.Y. JETS (70.5): No denying Bill Parcells is a genius. But
it's hard to imagine making the playoffs with Glenn Foley or Vinny
Testaverde at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   16. CAROLINA (70): Ownership deemed 7-9 record of '97
unacceptable and spent NFL-record $27.32 million this year to sign
veteran free agents.
</P>
<P>
   17. SEATTLE (70): A lot of talent on both sides of the ball.
With Mike Holmgren and George Seifert in the wings, coach Dennis
Erickson needs playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   18. ATLANTA (70): Break-even year very likely, nine victories a
possibility, if offensive line opens some holes and protects QB
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   19. DALLAS (68.5): Atrocious drafts of past three years catching
up to aging roster, and lack of depth is a problem for rookie coach
Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   20. CINCINNATI (68): Should score plenty of points no matter who
plays quarterback. Young linebackers must grasp exotic zone-blitz
scheme quickly.
</P>
<P>
   21. ARIZONA (67.5): Rampant optimism would be more justified if
the offensive line and safety situations were more settled than
they are.
</P>
<P>
   22. OAKLAND (67.5): Has some of the NFL's most talented pure
athletes, but first-year coach Jon Gruden will find out football
isn't a track meet.
</P>
<P>
   23. BUFFALO (67): Rudimentary design of first-year offensive
coordinator Joe Pendry means fewer mistakes but also few points.
</P>
<P>
   24. BALTIMORE (66.5): Defense in particular has young, promising
players. Still, coach Ted Marchibroda could be gone by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   25. PHILADELPHIA (65.5): Only two years after winning 10 games,
the Eagles have fallen on hard times. Coach Ray Rhodes probably
will be bounced.
</P>
<P>
   26. INDIANAPOLIS (65): Even when the rookie quarterback is named
Peyton Manning, there are going to be the typical rookie mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   27. SAN DIEGO (64): An interesting team because of QB Ryan Leaf,
but there figures to be a major front-office housecleaning at
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   28. NEW ORLEANS (64): The TV cameras will stay on Mike Ditka,
who could become the first coach to spontaneously combust on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   29. ST. LOUIS (63): Have looked pitiful in camp. Fans are booing
every incompletion by QB Tony Banks, and coach Dick Vermeil might
throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   30. CHICAGO (62.5): Should be known as the ``Monstrosities of
the Midway.'' The spiral continues for once-proud franchise now in
disarray.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tom Coughlin is 26-26 in three seasons with the
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 11-5, second in AFC Central (wild card, lost in
first round of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Natrone Means (FA), C Michael Cheever (injury),
QB Rob Johnson (trade), DE Clyde Simmons (cut), FB Ty Hallock (FA),
C Dave Widell (FA), DT Esera Tuaolo (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: LB Bryce Paup (FA), RB Fred Taylor (D-1a), FS
Donovin Darius (D-1b), DE Fernando Smith (FA), C Quentin Neujahr
(FA), CB Cordell Taylor (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: In just their fourth season, Jaguars have a
legitimate shot to make it to Super Bowl XXXIII. They are one of
NFL's deepest and most well-rounded teams. Secondary is a concern,
but the Jaguars have plenty of young veterans who might be ready to
step up. QB Mark Brunell is the offensive key, but Coughlin would
prefer to run the football. Offensive line is one of the strongest
in league, and OT Tony Boselli might be NFL's best blocker at his
position. Look for Taylor to make an instant impact splitting time
with veteran RB James Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH STEELERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Bill Cowher is 69-38 in six seasons with the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 11-5, first in AFC Central (lost in AFC
championship game).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: WR Yancey Thigpen (FA), CB Chad Scott (injury), OT
John Jackson (FA), LB Greg Lloyd (cut), FB Tim Lester (injury),
offensive coordinator Chan Gailey (Dallas), SS Myron Bell (FA), OG
Tom Myslinski (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: Offensive coordinator Ray Sherman (Minnesota), CB
DeWayne Washington (FA), OG Alan Faneca (D-1), DT Jeremy Staat
(D-2), WR Hines Ward (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Sooner or later, free agency departures will result
in some slippage in the division. This could be the year. The
season-ending knee injury to Scott has forced SS Carnell Lake to
move to corner again, disrupting the whole secondary. Much on
offense will depend on continued development of QB Kordell Stewart,
who will have more freedom to audible. There is no proven ``go-to''
wideout, so Sherman wants the ball dumped more to the tight ends
and running backs. Pittsburgh is a veteran team that knows how to
win.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE OILERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jeff Fisher is 24-30 in four seasons with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-8, third in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: OG Kevin Donnalley (FA), RB Ronnie Harmon (cut),
KR Mel Gray (retired), TE Rod Lewis (FA), P Reggie Roby (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Yancey Thigpen (FA), WR Kevin Dyson (D-1), TE
Jackie Harris (FA), CB Samari Rolle (D-2), P Craig Hentrich (FA),
CB Dainon Sidney (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Too bad Nashville hasn't embraced what should be an
entertaining team. GM Floyd Reese upgraded the receiving corps for
QB Steve McNair, signing free agents Thigpen and Harris and
drafting Dyson in the first round. The trio should make life easier
for McNair, in his second season as the starter, and take pressure
off RB Eddie George. The Oilers blitz as much as any defense in the
league and count on their corners in man-to-man coverage. Fisher
and coordinator Greg Williams are creative and cause lots of
headaches for opposition. This is a fringe playoff team that
probably won't make the postseason because of killer division.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI BENGALS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Bruce Coslet is 14-11 in two seasons with the Bengals
and 40-50 in six NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 7-9, fourth in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Dan Wilkinson (trade), QB Boomer Esiason
(retired), LB Gerald Dixon (FA), DE John Copeland (injury), LB Rico
McDonald (FA), FS Bo Orlando (FA), LB Jerry Olsavsky (cut), LB
Andre Collins (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: QB Neil O'Donnell (FA), LB Takeo Spikes (D-1a), LB
Brian Simmons (D-1b), DE Michael Bankston (FA), DE Clyde Simmons
(FA), CB Thomas Randolph (FA), QB Paul Justin (trade), CB Artrell
Hawkins (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Even with the change to O'Donnell, the Bengals should
score points. Wideouts Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott can be lethal,
and RB Corey Dillon is an emerging star. A potential problem is
that the demoted Jeff Blake could be a distraction. Complex
zone-blitz scheme should sink in better in defensive coordinator
Dick LeBeau's second season. Linebackers drive the defense, though,
and Cincy has lots of kids there.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE RAVENS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Ted Marchibroda is 10-21-1 in two seasons with the
Ravens and 83-92-1 in 11 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 6-9-1, fifth in AFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB Antonio Langham (FA), QB Vinny Testaverde
(cut), RB Earnest Byner (retired), WR Derrick Alexander (FA), RB
Bam Morris (cut), C Quentin Neujahr (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: QB Jim Harbaugh (trade), CB Duane Starks (D-1), RB
Errict Rhett (trade), CB Rod Woodson (FA), WR Pat Johnson (D-2), FB
Roosevelt Potts (FA), OT James Atkins (FA), FS Corey Harris (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Defense has young quality in linebackers and
safeties, but front four is showing some age. Nobody knows how much
Woodson will help the secondary. Pass rush should be effective; LB
Peter Boulware and DE Michael McCrary are quick, upfield-type
players. WR Jermaine Lewis is emerging but might not post
Alexander's numbers. C Wally Williams ended a long holdout, but the
line could be a problem. Rhett hasn't beaten out second-year RB Jay
Graham.

<P>
   GREEN BAY PACKERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Mike Holmgren is 73-36 in six seasons with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 13-3, first in NFC Central (lost in Super Bowl
XXXII).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB Doug Evans (FA), DE Gabe Wilkins (FA), OG Aaron
Taylor (FA), RB Edgar Bennett (FA), FS Eugene Robinson (FA), OT
John Michels (injury), P Craig Hentrich (FA), WR Don Beebe
(retired), QB Steve Bono (trade), DT Darius Holland (trade).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: DE Vonnie Holliday (D-1), RB Raymont Harris (FA),
DE Vaughn Booker (trade), CB Terry McDaniel (FA), FS Pat Terrell
(FA), DE Jonathan Brown (D-2), LB Antonio London (FA), DE Eric
Curry (FA), OT Matt Willig (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Despite its free-agent defections the past three
years, Green Bay remains formidable with three-time MVP QB Brett
Favre. When RB Dorsey Levens gets to camp, the skill part of the
offense will be intact. Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur might
have to rotate a lot of people in his front seven, particularly on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tony Dungy is 17-17 in two seasons with the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 10-6, second in NFC Central (wild card, lost in
NFC semifinal round).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Errict Rhett (trade), TE Jackie Harris (FA), OG
Jim Pyne (FA), LB Rufus Porter (cut), FS Melvin Johnson (trade), DE
Eric Curry (FA), P Sean Landeta (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Bert Emanuel (FA), WR Jacquez Green (D-2a), FB
Lorenzo Neal (trade), OT Jason Mathews (FA), CB Brian Kelly (D-2b),
QB Jeff Brohm (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: With great depth, team speed and athleticism, Dungy
has closed the gap between the Bucs and Packers. The one-time
doormat franchise should go deep into the playoffs. The biggest
questions still revolve around QB Trent Dilfer, who needs to begin
taking advantage of the upgraded players on offense. WRs Emanuel,
Green and Reidel Anthony can stretch any defense. On defense, DT
Warren Sapp, LB Derrick Brooks and CB Donnie Abraham are among the
NFL's best young players at their positions.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA VIKINGS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dennis Green is 57-45 in six seasons with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 9-7, fourth in NFC Central (wild card, lost in
NFC semifinal round).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB DeWayne Washington (FA), LB Jeff Brady (cut),
DE Fernando Smith (cut), OG Scott Dill (cut), LB Ron George (cut),
CB Leonard Wheeler (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Randy Moss (D-1), CB Jimmy Hitchcock (trade), PK
Gary Anderson (FA), LB Bobby Houston (FA), CB Larry Brown (FA), DE
Kailee Wong (D-2), CB Ramos McDonald (D-3), QB Jay Fiedler (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: If the Vikings can stop somebody, they could be one
of the NFC's most dangerous teams. The creativity of defensive
coordinator Foge Fazio is underrated. He relies on an aggressive
scheme that emphasizes takeaways, and FS Orlando Thomas, if
healthy, is an opportunistic playmaker. QB Brad Johnson appears to
have recovered from neck surgery and began throwing better late in
camp.With WRs Cris Carter, Jake Reed and Moss, few secondaries will
be able to match up.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT LIONS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Bobby Ross is 9-8 in one season with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 9-7, third in NFC Central (wild card, lost in
first round of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: C Kevin Glover (FA), DT Mike Wells (FA), LB Reggie
Brown (injury), KR Glyn Milburn (trade), TE Pete Metzelaars
(retired), CB Corey Raymond (cut), LB Antonio London (FA), DT Shane
Bonham (FA), SS Van Malone (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: LB Allen Aldridge (FA), DT Dan Owens (FA), LB Rob
Fredrickson (trade), OG Jim Pyne (FA), CB Terry Fair (D-1), QB
Charlie Batch (D-3), WR Germaine Crowell (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The pressure is on erratic QB Scott Mitchell, much of
it from an impatient Ross. The spectacular RB Barry Sanders goes
after 1,500-plus yards for the fifth time in a row. Mitchell must
overcome his inconsistency in big games. A revamped linebacker
group will upgrade the overall defense, but the biggest improvement
should come from the continued development of second-year CBs Kevin
Abrams and Bryant Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO BEARS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dave Wannstedt is 37-45 in five seasons with the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-12, fifth in NFC Central.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Raymont Harris (cut), LB Bryan Cox (cut), DE
Alonzo Spellman (cut), FB Tony Carter (FA), RB Rashaan Salaam
(cut), WR Ricky Proehl (FA), OG Todd Burger (FA), KR Tyrone Hughes
(cut), KR Glyn Milburn (trade), OG Chris Gray (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: RB Curtis Enis (D-1), DT Mike Wells (FA), DT Shawn
Lee (trade), RB Edgar Bennett (FA), FS Tony Parrish (D-2), FB Ty
Hallock (FA), LB Rico McDonald (FA), C Olin Kreutz (D-3), LB Andre
Collins (FA), OG Mike Zandofsky (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Most observers who saw the Bears in preseason are
convinced they are legitimate contenders for the No. 1 overall pick
in the '99 draft. The club seems to lack direction, certainly is
shy on talent and is paying the price for some of Wannstedt's worst
draft decisions. New vice president Mark Hatley might be able to
put Humpty Dumpty back together again, but he'll probably have a
new coach manning the glue jar.

 &HT;    Sanders still going strong at age 30
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long dash into the history books is probably only two good
seasons away for Barry Sanders, certainly no more than three.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders, the brilliant Detroit Lions running back who has
used his trademark elusiveness to climb to within shouting distance
of Walter Payton's all-time rushing mark, cannot dodge an obvious
question as he enters his 10th pro season.
</P>
<P>
   Can the best pure runner the NFL has ever seen defy history at
age 30, a chronological turning point at which even great backs
have gone into a steady downward spiral? Even as Sanders was
blowing out the candles on his birthday cake the week before
training camp opened, he was blowing off the notion he is suddenly
going to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't age just in one year or in one day,'' said Sanders,
who needs 2,949 yards to pass Payton's rushing record. ``In my
workouts, games, whatever, I don't feel any different. Unless folks
are lying to me, no one else sees any difference, either. The
(drop-off), it seems to me, is more a gradual thing anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But in the 78-year history of the NFL, no player in
his 30s ever has won a rushing title. Only a dozen backs aged 30 or
older have rushed for 1,000 yards. Dallas tailback Emmitt Smith,
eight months younger than Sanders, is a prime example of how the
production of workhorse runners can slip as they approach 30.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's 1,684 yards in 1984 is the most ever gained by a
30-something runner. But coaches will be surprised if Sanders, who
has run for 1,500 yards a record four straight times, doesn't
demolish that mark. Just two workouts into camp, coach Bobby Ross
had seen Sanders sidestep would-be tacklers enough to realize that
the team's offensive meal ticket remains the premier back in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't lose anything from the end of last year to this
camp,'' Ross said. ``Then again, I hadn't expected him to.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sanders joined Eric Dickerson and O.J. Simpson as the
only backs to rush for 2,000 yards in a season, his 2,053 yards the
second-most ever. Dickerson ran for 2,105 yards in 1984 and then
slipped to 1,234 the following year. Simpson's total fell by 878
yards the season after he went for 2,003 yards in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders isn't predicting another 2,000-yard campaign, but he's
not imposing limits on what he feels he can accomplish in '98. ``I
think,'' he said, laughing, ``I'm maybe still good enough to play
in this league.''

 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON REDSKINS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Norv Turner is 26-37-1 in four seasons with the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-7-1, second place in NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Sean Gilbert (FA), DE Rich Owens (injury), WR
Henry Ellard (retired), OT Ed Simmons (cut), OG Keith Sims (FA), DT
Steve Emtman (cut), DT William Gaines (FA), DT Keith Rucker (cut),
OT Darryl Ashmore (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: DT Dana Stubblefield (FA), DT Dan Wilkinson
(trade), TE Stephen Alexander (D-2), OG Rod Milstead (FA), RB Skip
Hicks (D-3), OG Joe Cocozzo (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Defense hurt when DE Rich Owens went out for the
season, placing even more emphasis on DTs Stubblefield and
Wilkinson, who cost $16.4 million for 1998. Mike Nolan must improve
run defense, 28th last season. The pressure is on Turner, who
hasn't been to the playoffs, and QB Gus Frerotte. With his job
perhaps on the line, Turner could turn more quickly to backup Jeff
Hostetler if Frerotte struggles. Offensive line has been
overhauled, but the running game is strong.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK GIANTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Jim Fassel is 10-6-1 in one season with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 10-5-1, first place in NFC East (lost in first
round of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB Jason Sehorn (injury), LB Corey Miller
(injury), C Brian Williams (injury), RB Rodney Hampton (cut), DT
Ray Agnew (FA), CB Thomas Randolph (FA), QB Dave Brown (cut), RB
LeShon Johnson (illness).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: FS Shaun Williams (D-1), RB Gary Brown (FA), QB
Kent Graham (FA), WR Joe Jurevicius (D-2), WR Brian Alford (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: With a playoff collapse in the final two minutes and
the notion that their first division title since 1990 was a fluke,
the Giants enter the season feeling they have much to prove. A
daunting schedule might preclude another 10-victory season, but New
York is better than in '97. The key will be continued progress by
QB Danny Kanell. Look for FB Charles Way to become the featured
rusher and WR Ike Hilliard, who played just two games last year, to
emerge as a top receiver. The defense is outstanding, with no
player over 30.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS COWBOYS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Chan Gailey is in his first season as an NFL head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 6-10, fourth place in NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DE Tony Tolbert (cut), OT Mark Tuinei (retired),
FS Brock Marion (FA), DT Tony Casillas (retired), LB Fred
Strickland (injury), SS Bill Bates (retired), FB Herschel Walker
(cut), DE Shante Carver (cut), OG George Hegamin (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: RB Chris Warren (FA), DE Greg Ellis (D-1), OG
Everett McIver (FA), FS George Teague (FA), WR Ernie Mills (FA), OT
Flozell Adams (D-2).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: In his first season, Gailey faces no easy task. His
four-wideout sets and disciplined manner have excited some players,
but not everyone has bought in to the whole package. It's still an
aging team with a dwindling talent base, particularly on offense.
At times in camp, star running back Emmitt Smith appeared spent.
Troy Aikman remains the quarterback and Michael Irvin the main
target. The defense looks soft on the edges of the front seven, but
it should be fairly solid, especially the secondary, even with
nagging injuries to Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA CARDINALS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Vince Tobin is 11-21 in two seasons with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-12, fifth place in NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: LB Eric Hill (FA), DE Michael Bankston (FA), FS
Brent Alexander (FA), FB Cedric Smith (injury), QB Kent Graham
(FA), SS Matt Darby (cut), P Jeff Feagles (FA), WR Kevin Williams
(FA), RB LeShon Johnson (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: RB Adrian Murrell (trade), DE Andre Wadsworth
(D-1), WR Eric Metcalf (trade), OG Lester Holmes (FA), QB Dave
Brown (FA), RB Mario Bates (FA), OT Anthony Clement (D-2b), LB
Patrick Sapp (trade).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: A rare air of expectancy surrounds the Cardinals this
season. Just because they'll be better, however, doesn't make them
a playoff contender. Under vice president Bob Ferguson, the front
office has improved its professionalism and made a big point of
retaining the club's core of good, young players. Quarterback Jake
Plummer gives the franchise a playmaker on the field and a
marketing tool off of it. But holes remain in the offensive line
and secondary.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA EAGLES
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Ray Rhodes is 27-23-1 in three seasons with the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 6-9-1, third place in NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Ricky Watters (FA), offensive coordinator Jon
Gruden (Oakland), QB Ty Detmer (FA), LB Darrin Smith (FA), WR Chris
T. Jones (cut), OG Joe Panos (FA), DT Andy Harmon (cut), LB Jeff
Herrod (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: DE Hugh Douglas (trade), director of football
operations Tom Modrak (Pittsburgh), OT Tra Thomas (D-1), WR Jeff
Graham (trade), LB Jeremiah Trotter (D-2), DT Bill Johnson (FA), OG
Keith Sims (FA), OG George Hegamin (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Eagles have a new director of football
operations, and they probably will have a new coach, too, by 1999.
Rhodes is a master motivator but also wears on people, and his act
apparently is growing old. The drafts have not provided the nucleus
that ownership wanted, and the Eagles never have run after free
agents. With Watters gone, tiny Charlie Garner, who never has
gained 600 yards in a season, will run the football. QB Bobby
Hoying shows promise but lacks experience.

 &HT;    Giants hungry for second chance
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because those who ignore the past are destined to repeat it, New
York Giants coach Jim Fassel wouldn't allow his young team to
easily forget its painful postseason collapse of 1997. So when
training camp opened this summer, there were frequent reminders
from the scholarly looking Fassel of how the Giants squandered a
nine-point lead against Minnesota in the final 2 1/2 minutes of a
first-round playoff defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the old line about how tomorrow is promised to no
one?'' said linebacker Jesse Armstead, the emotional leader of the
NFL's best young defense. ``The feeling around here is that none of
us can wait for another shot, (because) it won't happen the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' critics think that shot might be a long time coming.
They contend New York's success resulted from an easy 1997 schedule
and suggest the Giants sneaked up on opponents in a season when the
NFC East was the weakest it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants were undefeated in intradivisional play and could
be ready to surprise again this year. A tough schedule could keep
Fassel's team from matching its 10 victories of a year ago, but
players and coaches insist the Giants are more solid than they were
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are actually pretty psyched that teams will be out
gunning for us,'' said quarterback Danny Kanell, who must improve
if New York is to advance past the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kanell improves, a defense that is solid at every
position will carry the team. A front four led by end Michael
Strahan and tackle Keith Hamilton is imposing; its starters
averaged 8.2 sacks last year. Armstead is an emerging star.
Cornerback Phillippi Sparks is strong.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending injury to cornerback Jason Sehorn is
devastating, however, and top pick Shaun Williams, normally a
safety, is being asked to work some at corner.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, which helped New York to a league-best plus-25
turnover differential, doesn't have a starter as much as 30 years
of age. Little wonder the Giants insist the stunning loss to the
Vikings was more a beginning than an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be around for several more years,'' said strong
safety Sam Garnes. ``So people better get used to that idea.''

 &HT;    49ers can toss Rice against defenses
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Even before Jerry Rice sustained a severe
knee injury in the 1997 season opener, San Francisco 49ers rookie
coach Steve Mariucci had decided his debut season would feature a
back-to-the-future twist.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rice went down on Aug. 31, Mariucci re-emphasized, even
more than he had planned, a physical running game and increased use
of the screen pass. It served the 49ers well, as they ranked 12th
in total offense and fifth in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the NFL's career leader in touchdowns, is healthy again in
his 14th season. His return will allow Mariucci to transform his
play-calling from fundamental to fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many possibilities for us,'' said quarterback
Steve Young, who benefited from the conservative approach last year
to stay healthy enough to start 15 games, his most since 1994.
``The plan is to be more wide-open.''
</P>
<P>
   That likely means an increase in three-wide-receiver sets, with
Rice joining Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes, the youngsters who
stepped up big in 1997. The 49ers historically haven't featured the
three-receiver alignment much; instead, they relied on packages
that made clever use of the tailback and often kept the tight end
on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Stokes and Owens, who both possess the size the
Niners always have stressed at the position, will serve as a
catalyst for change. Stokes had 58 catches for 733 yards and four
touchdowns, and Owens had 60 catches for 936 yards and eight TDs.
There are plans to use Rice in the slot position, where single
coverage is dictated. If the running attack continues to struggle
behind a makeshift line, Mariucci might rely heavily on the three
wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The three receivers should present a tough physical matchup for
any secondary, and the three men know it. Stokes is 6 feet 4, 223
pounds; Owens is 6-3, 217, and Rice is 6-2, 196.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many teams with three corners good enough to
cover us all,'' Owens said. ``We're going to have some fun with
this.''

 &HT;    NFC West capsules
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Steve Mariucci is 14-4 in one season with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 13-3, first in NFC West (lost in NFC championship
game).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Dana Stubblefield (FA), team president Carmen
Policy (resigned), FB William Floyd (FA), TE Brent Jones (retired),
CB Rod Woodson (cut), LB Gary Plummer (FA), OT Kirk Scrafford
(retired), DE Kevin Greene (cut), RB Terry Kirby (cut), CB Tyronne
Drakeford (FA), PK Gary Anderson (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: LB Winfred Tubbs (FA), CB Antonio Langham (FA), CB
R.W. McQuarters (D-1), DE Gabe Wilkins (FA), QB Ty Detmer (FA), OT
Jamie Brown (trade), SS Lance Schulters (D-4), TE Irv Smith (FA),
DT Shane Bonham (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: If a team could win a division by default, it might
be the 49ers. They aren't as talented as in the past, but it might
not matter in the NFC West. The biggest problems for San Francisco
are up front. The offensive line is unsettled, and the defensive
line will play at least the first two games undermanned. Look for
more three-wideout sets from Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA PANTHERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dom Capers is 27-23 in three seasons with the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 7-9, second in NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: LB Sam Mills (retired), OG Greg Skrepenak (cut),
FS Chad Cota (FA), DE Gerald Williams (retired), DT Greg Kragen
(retired), TE Walter Rasby (FA), OG Matt Elliott (FA), LB Andre
Royal (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: DT Sean Gilbert (FA), CB Doug Evans (FA), FB
William Floyd (FA), offensive coordinator Gill Haskell (Green Bay),
DE Jason Peter (D-1), FS Brent Alexander (FA), OG Corbin Lacina
(FA), LB Ernest Dixon (FA), WR Donald Hayes (D-4).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Owner Jerry Richardson deemed '97 unacceptable and
spent a league-record $27.325 million on veteran free agents. The
defense will have at least six and maybe eight new starters, but
age is a concern at outside linebacker. QB Kerry Collins seems
comfortable with the new West Coast offense, but the running game
has looked awful. The line is fairly average, and one-time
undrafted free agent RB Fred Lane will have to show he's not a
flash in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA FALCONS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dan Reeves is 7-9 in one season with the Falcons and
156-122-1 in 17 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 7-9, second in NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: WR Bert Emanuel (FA), DT Dan Owens (FA), C Roman
Fortin (cut), QB Jim Miller (FA), OT Matt Willig (FA), DE Anthony
Pleasant (cut), OT Antone Davis (cut), DT Nathan Davis (retired),
LB David Brandon (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Tony Martin (trade), FS Eugene Robinson (FA), LB
Keith Brooking (D-1), WR Keith Crawford (FA), C/OT Dave Widell
(FA), CB Randy Fuller (FA), WR Tim Dwight (D-4b), OT Corey Louchiey
(FA), QB Steve DeBerg (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: One of Reeves' strengths is his ability to keep a
game close and give his team a chance to win late. During the
second half of last season, the Falcons began making
``crunch-time'' plays to win those close games, and they have to
build on that experience. The offensive line is a concern again,
especially right tackle. Coordinator Rich Brooks established a much
sounder defense in '97 and maybe can add some wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS SAINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Mike Ditka is 6-10 in one season with the Saints and
118-78 in 12 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 6-10, fourth in NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: CB Eric Allen (trade), LB Winfred Tubbs (FA), DE
Darren Mickell (retired), TE Irv Smith (FA), RB Mario Bates (FA),
WR Randal Hill (FA), SS Anthony Newman (FA), QB Heath Shuler
(injury), WR Daryl Hobbs (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: OT Kyle Turley (D-1), WR Sean Dawkins (FA), FS Chad
Cota (FA), RB Lamar Smith (FA), CB Tyronne Drakeford (FA), TE Cam
Cleeland (D-2), LB Andre Royal (FA), LB Kevin Mitchell (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Zaven Yaralian gets his gritty defense to play hard
every week, and he designs some creative blitzes to take advantage
of the quickness of OLB Mark Fields. If DE Joe Johnson continues to
hold out, though, DL will be thin. No matter how well the defense
performs, it won't be good enough, because the offense still lacks
a top-shelf quarterback and enough playmakers. If QB Billy Joe
Hobert is the best you have, it's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS RAMS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dick Vermeil is 5-11 in one season with the Rams and
62-62 in eight NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 5-11, fifth in NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Bill Johnson (FA), DE Leslie O'Neal (cut), LB
Robert Smith (cut), C Bern Brostek (retired), WR Keith Crawford
(FA), QB Mark Rypien (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: LB Eric Hill (FA), WR Ricky Proehl (FA), DE Grant
Wistrom (D-1), RB Greg Hill (FA), DT Ray Agnew (FA), RB Robert
Holcombe (D-2), QB Steve Bono (trade), DT Joe Phillips (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Rams have talent but don't play well in games.
It's clear something is missing and that talent isn't enough. Word
is that players are grousing about Vermeil's extra-long practices,
and some veterans want out. The guy Vermeil soon may want out is QB
Tony Banks, whose maturity level and leaderships skills have yet to
catch up to his talent. Jim Hanifan is the league's premier
offensive-line coach, but he hasn't been able to put together a
solid enough group. The defense simply has too many underachievers.

 &HT;    Bigger players at all positions: An expanding league trend
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From a burgeoning database of 80,000-plus athletes, Dr. Frank I.
Katch, a professor of exercise science at the University of
Massachusetts, has arrived at a startling conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   By the 2007 season, offensive linemen in the NFL will average a
whopping 6-feet-8 and 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The thick research files that threaten to engulf Katch's
on-campus office and his home in Amherst, Mass., aren't the only
things expanding in the NFL's universe. This advice for equipment
managers leaguewide: Start ordering up the size-XXXXL practice
pants before the rush begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tracked growth since the 1920s, and you can identify
certain periods where it's on an upswing and others where it levels
off for a while,'' said Katch, who has served as a consultant for
several NFL teams. ``In the early '80s, it was relatively flat.
Now, we are back on the rise again. It makes you wonder if there's
a limit to `big' in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The league that was founded at a Canton, Ohio, automobile
showroom in 1920, is being re-created by a Big Bang Theory all its
own: If you're big and like to bang people around, an NFL training
camp probably has a spot for you.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1980, the league had no 300-pound players. This
year, 361 of the 2,493 players who went to training camps _ nearly
15 percent and an average of 12 heavyweights per team _ weighed 300
pounds or more. At least three dozen players weighed more than 340.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played (at 6-7, 291), it was like I was some kind of a
freak,'' said former defensive tackle Dave Butz, who played 16
seasons before retiring in 1988. ``Now, teams might not give me a
second look.''
</P>
<P>
   Size is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I couldn't hold up at anything less than (the 320 pounds)
I am,'' Washington defensive tackle Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson
said. ``You get those big, ol' (offensive) guards hanging on you,
and you better be pound for pound with them. I mean, those are some
big (people) there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the so-called ``skill'' positions, average height and
weight has increased dramatically in the past two decades. Starting
quarterbacks in 1998, for instance, are an inch taller and 16
pounds heavier than their counterparts were in the 1980 season.
Ryan Leaf, who weighed 261 pounds at combine workouts last spring,
wondered what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   There are similar increases for wide receivers and cornerbacks.
On the offensive and defensive lines, the gains are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The ``all-size'' team, a lineup compiled by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and comprising the biggest veteran starters at
each position, features an offense averaging 282.6 pounds and a
defense that averages 268 pounds. Thin, certainly, is not in.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, just because you're bigger doesn't mean you're
necessarily better,'' said Chet Fuhrman, the conditioning
coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers. ``But with us seeing so
many 320-pound guys nowadays who can move so quickly, . . . that
axiom might not be true anymore in the NFL. Yeah, it's become a
`bigger is better' league.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran coach Bill Parcells and former New York Giants general
manager George Young once espoused a shared brainchild known as the
``Planet Theory.'' It held that there is a finite number of
large-bodied individuals on planet Earth and shame on the personnel
director who passed one by. For years, the ``Planet Theory'' shaped
Giants draft classes, Young at one point taking six offensive or
defensive linemen in the first round in a 10-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ``Planet Theory'' is reshaping the entire league.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, who long has favored speed
over size, brought to camp this year 16 players who weighed 300
pounds or more. Parcells also had 16 in his New York Jets camp. The
New York Giants had a league-high 19. Just five of 30 teams brought
fewer than 10 to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's a big man's game, certainly,'' Johnson said recently
between training camp practices. ``You can't ignore what's gone on
with size just in the last 10 years alone.''
</P>
<P>
   League personnel directors spent much of the summer driving by
giant billboards that touted the movie ``Godzilla'' and declared,
``Size does matter.'' Most of those talent scouts chuckled quietly
at the advertising. ``Hey, we could all have signs like that in our
scouting offices,'' Oakland Raiders personnel man Ken Herock said.
</P>
<P>
   What surprises some people is that The Big Boom continues,
despite the fact the Denver Broncos received so much publicity just
seven months ago for taking Super Bowl XXXII without a single
300-pounder on their offensive line. The victory seemed to
reinforce the notion that leverage, not tonnage, is the most
essential element in line play.
</P>
<P>
   That's true only to a certain extent, said St. Louis Rams
assistant coach Jim Hanifan, one of the premier offensive line
coaches in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What everyone thought,'' Hanifan said, ``is that we'd all run
out and start beating the bushes for 280- or 290-pound linemen.
Uh-uh. All it meant when the Broncos won was that we'd now look at
the smaller guys a little different, that's all. But if you're
asking, 'Do I want a 280-pound guy with quick feet or a 310-pound
guy with the same kind of feet' _ well, brother, that's a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Dallas guard Nate Newton looked like a Slim
Fast poster boy after shedding 75 pounds from his 350-something
frame. In recent days, however, Newton admitted he might have
overdone it. Former Atlanta Falcons offensive tackle Lincoln
Kennedy, now with the Raiders, went to camp at 325 pounds, the
lightest he has been since high school. He decided to bulk back up
to about 340 because he felt too weak at the lower weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be a place for the great player, no
matter what he weighs,'' said Arizona Cardinals defensive line
coach Joe Greene, the Pittsburgh Steelers' Hall of Fame tackle.
``Look at (John) Randle or (Warren) Sapp. They're dominating
tackles, and they don't play at 300. But if you're going to play in
the 270s or 280s, you have to be exceptional anymore just to hang
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of Hall of Fame selectors two weeks ago, all-time
middle linebacker Joe Schmidt, who played at 222 pounds for 13
seasons, argued emotionally that size has replaced skills in the
NFL. He might have a point. Katch fears that without post-NFL
counseling, most 300-pounders are headed for physical disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants 'bigger, bigger, bigger,' and it can be
dangerous,'' Katch said. ``For all their claims in the NFL,
steroids still aren't totally under control. The coaches don't want
to hear about it, and the players won't talk about it, but there's
still a lot of underground stuff going on. It's like size has
become the prize, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Katch, who once worked for Washington, told the story of a
tearful Butz coming to him and explaining his reluctance to accept
Redskins coach George Allen's demand that he bulk up to 305 pounds.
``He cried, literally,'' Katch said. ``He said to me, 'I think
about my weight every single day.' And that was years ago, before
this craze for bigger. Like I said before, you wonder where it's
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to Madison, Wis., is where. That's the home of the
Wisconsin Badgers, a team that features Aaron Gibson. A senior
offensive tackle, Gibson is an All-Big Ten player. He is projected
to be among the top five players selected in the 1999 NFL draft.
And he regularly plays at almost 400 pounds.

 &HT;    LINEBACKERS: 276-pounder gives chase to passers and receivers
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATROBE, Pa. _ There are 115 defensive linemen projected as
starters in next weekend's NFL regular-season openers, and
linebacker Levon Kirkland outweighs 32 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers star entered the league in 1992 at 240
pounds. Six years and 36 pounds later, Kirkland sees his status as
one of the bulkiest linebackers in league history as worth the
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can still run, and I think I can, it gives our
defense a lot of flexibility,'' he said. ``There are certain things
we can scheme around my size and ability and not have to substitute
to do them. Certainly, I'm a better player now than I was (at 240
pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   That he went from huge to hulking wasn't necessarily planned by
Kirkland, who spent his rookie season playing on special teams. But
years in the weight room at Three Rivers Stadium, combined with
offseasons spent at home in Lamar, S.C., feasting on his mother's
fried chicken, eventually added up.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 NFL combine workouts, Kirkland ran the 40-yard dash
in 4.88 seconds. While the Steelers don't clock their veteran
players annually, linebackers coach Mike Archer estimated
Kirkland's current time probably isn't much over five seconds. The
quickness allows Pittsburgh to keep the seventh-year veteran, who
recently signed a new contract that makes him the NFL's
highest-paid linebacker, on the field for third down.
</P>
<P>
   The past two years, Kirkland's versatility netted him six
interceptions, nine sacks and a dozen passes defensed. On the first
two defensive series of last year's AFC title game, Kirkland, who
played at Clemson, had two solo tackles, a quarterback pressure off
an inside blitz and an interception. In his team's Super Bowl XXX
loss, he had 10 tackles, a sack and a pass defensed.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland is regarded by Steelers fans as the team's best inside
linebacker since Hall of Famer Jack Lambert retired after the 1984
season. Lambert also could cover the tight end but did so while
weighing 212 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect (Kirkland) to muscle you,'' Denver tight end
Shannon Sharpe said. ``What you don't expect is that he'll hang
with you 15 yards up the field _ but he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   The unassuming Kirkland is part of a trend of growing
linebackers bigger. As recently as 15 years ago, just a handful of
linebackers in the NFL weighed 240 pounds. This season, seven
linebackers weigh at least 255, and the average weight for starters
now is more than 230 pounds.

 &HT;    QUARTERBACKS: QB's have gotten bigger and stronger as well
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ His critics, including several who can be
identified in the New England locker room, say Drew Bledsoe must
toughen mentally before the underachieving Patriots can claim their
first Super Bowl victory. Because he disagrees with the assessment,
and wouldn't know where to find a gym that specializes in mental
calisthenics, Bledsoe spent the past few months girding himself
physically for the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Probably harder than in any other spring, the five-year veteran
hit the weight room. The result is a well-toned quarterback better
prepared to deal with a pass rush. And Bledsoe is not the only
quarterback suddenly more conscious of conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the past two seasons, Miami's Dan Marino has
attempted to slow the aging process by working with a personal
trainer. Always a weight-room guy, Jeff George of Oakland recently
got into a power-walking program. Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer became a
regular on the weight machines this year, to shed soft fat and
improve muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago, I'm sure it was almost (sacrilegious) for a
quarterback to be pumping (weights),'' Bledsoe said during a spring
minicamp. ``But you take so many big hits now at the position . . .
that you have to be prepared to withstand them. Everybody at every
other position is bigger now, and you're seeing bigger
quarterbacks, too. I mean, look at (Ryan) Leaf. The guy is huge; he
looks like a linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf sent personnel directors into apoplexy when he arrived for
the NFL combine seven months ago at a whopping 261 pounds. He is 20
pounds lighter now, and during preseason looked like a sequoia with
legs when he dropped into the pocket. If he isn't yet the prototype
at his position, Leaf certainly is a sneak preview of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL likes quarterbacks who are ``tall in the pocket,'' but
that scout euphemism is a bit inaccurate. What coaches really
prefer is a sturdy passer, and statistics indicate that the league
leans heavily toward passers who have a better chance for
durability.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the 28 starting quarterbacks averaged 6-feet-2 1/2 and
205.3 pounds. Phil Simms (6-3, 216) and Terry Bradshaw (6-2, 215)
were considered physical tough guys and the heaviest quarterback
weighed 220. The average height of the 30 starters for this season
has increased only an inch over 1980, to 6-feet-3 1/2. But the
average weight has increased to 221.7 pounds, and 14 passers weigh
225 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, in a league where the battle cry is 'Get the
quarterback' and everybody wants to see a lot of sacks, it's a
matter of survival,'' Bledsoe said. ``It's one thing to take the
hits, but the biggest thing is being able to get up from them.''

 &HT;    Battles taking place at higher level
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 11 months after the fact, each of the players still
recalls the head-to-head confrontation on Oct. 19 as the equivalent
of a championship title fight that just happened to be surrounded
by a football game.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner, Detroit Lions four-time Pro Bowl performer Herman
Moore, 6 feet 4 and 210 pounds and probably the most physical wide
receiver in the NFL. In the other, Jason Sehorn, the New York
Giants' emerging star, and at 6-2 and 212 pounds, the prototype for
the bigger-is-better cornerback philosophy that is pervading the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (was) a knock-down, drag-out afternoon,'' Moore said
about his matchup with Sehorn for more than half of the Lions' 65
offensive snaps in a 26-20 overtime defeat. ``He is a strong guy
who can dominate you with his raw strength. He is one of the best.
But, really, we're seeing these gigantic cornerbacks almost every
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore caught seven passes in the game, but only two against
Sehorn. The corner had a key pass defensed and seven
tackles.Defensive coordinators urgently seeking Sehorn wannabes are
acting in response to the offenses. About eight years ago, it
became fashionable for teams to draft bigger wide receivers. The
success of such pass-catchers as Moore, Michael Irvin and Jake Reed
triggered the predictable countermove: long, lean cornerbacks to
cover them.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive coordinator John Fox said the trend toward
bigger corners has a back-to-the-future flavor. The seven pure
cornerbacks in the Hall of Fame averaged just under 6 feet 2 and
198.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts going onto college campuses now check out safeties as
would-be cornerbacks, if possible. The standard rationale _ that
cornerback is easier to learn as a rookie _ is only half the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get (wide) receivers reaching up and just plucking
the ball away from a tiny corner, you have to do something about
that,'' Philadelphia defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   So in his second year with the Eagles, coach Ray Rhodes drafted
Notre Dame cornerback Bobby Taylor (6-3, 216) to help his defense
match up better with the big wideouts in the NFC East. A year after
that, he signed ``transition'' free-agent corner Troy Vincent (6-0,
194) from Miami. For all the talk of size, though, the bigger keys
are still strong hands and quick feet, Sehorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to turn and run deep with those guys,''
said Sehorn, who will miss the 1998 season with a knee injury.
``But the overlooked element is hand strength. If you can get your
hands on (a receiver) and redirect him, it's half the battle.''

 &HT;    CBS return causes ripples in TV lineups
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When CBS stepped into the NFL negotiations with a check for $4
billion for the AFC package, and Disney followed by giving ESPN the
green light to pay $4.8 billion for the entire Sunday night cable
package, it meant viewers would need a scorecard to keep up with
all the movement among the announcers.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, there has never been a season for change like
this one. The biggest involves CBS returning to the NFL, a move
that ousted NBC and set off a chain of events that would introduce
new faces and put some old faces in new places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't start with a blank sheet,'' CBS executive producer
Terry Ewert said. ``We played the what-if game ... if we got the
NFL back. We looked at over 130 resumes and inquiries and reviewed
close to 60 demo tapes. Although we've looked to upgrade
operationally and technically, we knew we had a good infrastructure
to resume our NFL coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But CBS turned to NBC's talent roster for its No. 1 announcing
team. Both Greg Gumbel (play-by-play) and analyst Phil Simms left
NBC to ride in the lead chariot for CBS. Armen Keteyian was then
lured from ABC to join them as a sideline reporter.
</P>
<P>
   For Gumbel, the decision to return was easy, because it was
during his first stint at CBS from 1989-94 that he secured his
place as one of sport television's top talents. Simms said his
decision was a no-brainer, too, while Keteyian jumped at the chance
to do the NFL. On paper, it looks like CBS has compiled a winning
combination for its No. 1 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes there is a tendency to try and reinvent the wheel.
But we do not want to lose sight of the fact people just want to
watch football,'' Gumbel said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Simms: ``The biggest thing is: Let's just don't mess it
up. This is a great game for TV, so keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Verne Lundquist, who returns to CBS after a three-year stint
with Turner, joins analyst Randy Cross and reporter Michele Tafoya
on the No. 2 team. The other teams include Kevin Harlan-Sam Wyche,
Gus Johnson-Steve Tasker, Ian Eagle-Mark May and Don Criqui-Beasley
Reece.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS pregame show is expected to receive the most scrutiny.
Only host Jim Nantz and reporter Bonnie Berstein (from ESPN) are
experienced. The three analysts, Marcus Allen, Brent Jones and
George Seifert, are rookies in network television.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps CBS felt compelled to go with a totally new look because
of the imposing competition from ESPN's ``NFL Countdown,'' which
added an extra half-hour and former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly to
the formidable cast of Chris Berman, Tom Jackson, Sterling Sharpe
and Chris Mortensen. And Fox's star-studded lineup got stronger
with charismatic Cris Collinsworth joining Terry Bradshaw, Howie
Long and James Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled for Jim Nantz, but it will be tough for anybody
to get rhythm with three guys who have not been in that environment
before,'' Fox executive producer Ed Goren said. ``Jim will not have
an asset like we had with Terry Bradshaw, who was experienced in
the studio setting and took Howie and J.B. under his wing. If Nantz
had that kind of anchor, it would make it easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ewert: ``We know we are going against two great pregame
shows. But we wanted to come up with an alternative that would be
contemporary and newsy with a certain hard edge. All three of our
analysts have broadcasting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent and George did sports talk, and Marcus had his own show
in Kansas City. They are not new to the red light going on.... We
are going to surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise was Frank Gifford's resignation from ``Monday
Night Football.'' Gifford will join Berman on an abbreviated
pregame show, but Boomer Esiason will take his place beside Al
Michaels and Dan Dierdorf. Judging by the preseason telecasts, the
transition will be a smooth one.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth could also be used to describe ESPN's move to a three-man
booth on ``Sunday Night Football,'' with Paul Maguire joining Mike
Patrick and Joe
</P>
<P>
   Theismann. Initially, Theismann voiced his preference for a
two-man booth, but was singing a different tune after a couple of
preseason telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egos always take a back seat because the single most important
element is the game,'' Theismann said. ``I didn't have an
expectation going in, but that first broadcast felt like we had
been working together forever.''

   Meanwhile, CNN's ``NFL Preview'' moves to 10 a.m. to get the
jump on the pregame competition, while HBO's long-running ``Inside
the NFL'' stood pat with Len Dawson, Nick Buoniconti, Jerry
Glanville and Collinsworth.

 &HT;    Dolphins fulfilling J.J.'s need for speed
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The man's gait is reminiscent of an Olympic
speed-walker, and he talks with the rat-a-tat precision of a
Gatling gun.
</P>
<P>
   Have a beer with Jimmy Johnson, and he will chug-a-lug a
Heineken over ice before your mug is half-empty. When it comes to
falling in and out of love with a rookie, no one in the NFL does it
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder, then, that in the bigger-is-better universe of
the NFL, the Miami coach likes a bit of contradiction? He knows
that size is good. But speed, Johnson decided long ago, is what
kills offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing Jimmy looks at, especially on
defense,'' Dolphins director of football operations Bob Ackles
said. ``If you can't run, you can't play defense for Jimmy. It's
that simple. He really is a speed freak.''
</P>
<P>
   The revamped Miami defense certainly reflects Johnson's
preference.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding 320-pound tackles Tim Bowens, who finally ended a
long camp holdout, and Daryl Gardener in the front seven are lean
and athletic players. The first four ends on the depth chart
average 262.8 pounds. Except for Zach Thomas in the middle, the
linebackers look more like tight ends. The emphasis in a reshuffled
secondary is on ``ball skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Taylor, who struggles to keep his weight above 250 pounds
but who can run around blocks and get upfield, is one of Johnson's
favorites. A thin frame kept Taylor on the 1997 draft board until
the third round, long enough for Johnson to ignore his lack of bulk
and focus on the player's quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Jimmy is that he doesn't worry about the
packaging,'' Taylor said. ``If you're an end who can make plays,
he's the last guy who's going to say, `Yeah, but he's a little too
skinny.' He talks all the time about dictating (to the offense)
with speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint, tweaked slightly from Johnson's championship days
in Dallas, could dramatically improve a unit that ranked No. 26
last season. After a preseason loss to Johnson's team, Washington
Redskins players noted the difficulty they had holding blocks
against the slippery Dolphins defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want play-makers, and that means across the board, not just
at the so-called skill positions,'' Johnson said. ``Give me a bunch
of guys who can redirect, knock the ball loose, scoop it up and run
it in . . . and I'm happy. I think we have more of those kinds of
players now.''

 &HT;    AFC West capsules
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY CHIEFS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Marty Schottenheimer is 97-56-1 in nine seasons with
the Chiefs and 143-87-1 in 14 NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 13-3, first in AFC West (lost in AFC semifinal
round).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: RB Marcus Allen (retired), RB Greg Hill (FA),
offensive coordinator Paul Hackett (Southern Cal), DE Vaughn Booker
(trade), FS Kevin Ross (retired), WR Lake Dawson (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: DT Chester McGlockton (FA), WR Derrick Alexander
(FA), DE Leslie O'Neal (FA), OT Victor Riley (D-1), DT Darius
Holland (trade), FS Melvin Johnson (trade), RB Rashaan Shehee
(D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Chiefs have finished first or second in the
division all nine seasons under Schottenheimer but haven't made it
to a Super Bowl. Even the true believers who pack Arrowhead Stadium
on Sunday are focusing on the coach's subpar playoff performances.
The Chiefs almost certainly will make the '98 postseason. How far
they go probably will depend on how well Jimmy Raye's new offense
clicks. The tailback-by-committee situation could be troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER BRONCOS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Mike Shanahan is 37-16 in three seasons with the
Broncos and 45-28 in five NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 12-4, second in AFC West (wild card, won Super
Bowl XXXII).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: OT Gary Zimmerman (retired), DE Alfred Williams
(injury), OG Brian Habib (FA), LB Allen Aldridge (FA), QB Jeff
Lewis (injury), OT Jamie Brown (trade), CB Tim McKyer (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: WR Marcus Nash (D-1), DE Marvin Washington (FA), SS
Eric Brown (D-2), DE Anthony Smith (FA), C Courtney Hall (FA), WR
Justin Armour (FA), DE Martin Harrison (DE), QB Brian Griese (D-3).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: After taking 15 years to win his first Super Bowl, QB
John Elway could go 2-for-2. Even without Zimmerman, the talent
level is high, and RB Terrell Davis, the offensive hub, is a unique
runner. Shanahan is savvy enough to prevent any letdown the Broncos
might suffer after capturing Elway's holy grail. But his defensive
staff might not be able to compensate for a shaky front seven. The
Broncos spent much of camp looking for a middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE SEAHAWKS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Dennis Erickson is 23-25 in three seasons with the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 8-8, third in AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: C/OG Kevin Mawae (FA), RB Chris Warren (cut), RB
Lamar Smith (FA), SS Bennie Blades (retired), LB Winston Moss
(retired), OT James Atkins (FA), FS Tim Hauck (FA), DE Martin
Harrison (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: RB Ricky Watters (FA), C Kevin Glover (FA), LB
Anthony Simmons (D-1), LB Darrin Smith (FA), RB Ahman Green (D-3),
OG Brian Habib (FA), FS Mark Collins (FA), OG Chris Gray (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Erickson almost certainly needs a playoff berth to
save his job. Seattle should be aided by the hiring of Pete
Rodriguez, a top-flight special teams coach, who will be asked to
solve the club's glaring problems in the kicking game. The defense
is quick, with LB Chad Brown and DE Michael Sinclair pressuring
from outside. The secondary doesn't play up to its talent. On
offense, QB Warren Moon likes to spread the field, but he'll be
more content this year to hand the ball to Watters.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND RAIDERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: John Gruden is in his first season as an NFL head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-12, fourth in AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: DT Chester McGlockton (FA), CB Terry McDaniel
(cut), LB Rob Fredrickson (trade), DE Leon Bender (deceased), OG
Lester Holmes (FA), DE Anthony Smith (FA), QB David Klingler (cut),
CB Larry Brown (cut).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: CB Eric Allen (trade), CB Charles Woodson (D-1a),
OT Mo Collins (D-1b), WR Terry Mickens (FA), SS Anthony Newman
(FA), FB Jon Ritchie (D-3), PK Greg Davis (FA), SS Louis Riddick
(FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: A typical Raiders team, with speed and playmakers at
skill positions. Unfortunately, the defense, last in the league
last year, won't improve enough, even with new blood at cornerback.
The defenders at ends and linebackers are average, and Oakland will
</P>
<P>
   surrender lots of points again. The Raiders will score some,
too, with QB Jeff George benefiting from the coaching of Gruden.
The former Atlanta starter had a terrific '97 season, which was
overshadowed by the defensive collapse.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO CHARGERS
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Kevin Gilbride is 4-12 in one season with the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 4-12, fifth in AFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Key losses: WR Tony Martin (trade), WR Eric Metcalf (trade),
DT Shawn Lee (trade), QB Stan Humphries (retired), RB Gary Brown
(FA), RB Aaron Craver (cut), LB Patrick Sapp (trade), QB Jim
Everett (retired), OG Joe Cocozzo (FA).
</P>
<P>
   _ Key gains: QB Ryan Leaf (D-1), RB Natrone Means (FA), OT John
Jackson (FA), OG Aaron Taylor (FA), offensive line coach Joe Bugel
(Oakland), LB Gerald Dixon (FA), C Roman Fortin (FA), quarterback
coach June Jones, WR Mikhael Ricks (D-2), DT Jamal Williams
(supplemental draft).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Chargers might not win much more than last year,
but Leaf will make them more compelling to watch. He has superb
size and arm strength, and Jones will be a steadying force. A
youthful receiving corps could slow Leaf's progress, but Charger
defense ranks as a greater concern. San Diego has almost no pass
rush, and the secondary gets exploited as a result. Look for a
shakeup at season's end.

<P>
   Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, Ingrid
Bergman had to walk into Humphrey Bogart's in Casablanca. And ever
since, Casablanca has been a romantic place somewhere out there in
the imagination of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Casablanca, the biggest city and main port of
Morocco, is intensely romantic _ faded, languid and vaguely
decadent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if you ask residents, they will most often tell you that
their city is just another disagreeable metropole with too many
people and too many cars and that you'd be far better off setting
out for the more authentic Morocco _ Marrakesh and Fez, say.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Casa, as they call it, seem hardly to notice that
they are living in an Art Deco museum, with some austere French
Colonial buildings mixed in. To them, the muezzin's soulful call to
prayer is as ordinary as the sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And the daily tide of veiled women and desert tribesmen, and
others in tatters, jeans and the latest designer stuff barely
merits a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Casablanca, which was a small town when the French made it the
commercial capital of their protectorate in 1912, is clearly not
ancient. And it is not entirely Moroccan in body and soul. But none
of that makes it mundane.
</P>
<P>
   It is a whitewashed city of sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants
with bazaars where you can bargain for carpets and hand-painted
plates or just lose yourself among sacks of spices, baked sheep's
heads and Hermes knockoffs. And if you like to rock, Casablanca has
a club for you.
</P>
<P>
   An enduring modern legend is that Bogie never set foot in
Casablanca (the movie was shot in Hollywood). But his latest
biographers, A. Sperber and Eric Lax, say it isn't so. According to
them, Bogie dropped by in 1943, shortly after the Allied landing in
Morocco and the release of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been a Rick's. The Hyatt Regency Hotel has
tried, with its Casablanca Bar, a wicker and mahogany refuge with
ceiling fans. But the real Casablanca, just outside, is a lot more
exciting.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Ben M'Sik Theater Festival takes place Sept. 3 to 15, with
companies from 28 countries, including France, Italy and England.
Tickets will range from about $2.35 to $4.70 (at the rate of 8.4
dirham to the dollar), and can be bought at the performance sites,
including the Moulay Rachid Theater, Avenue Akim Allam; phone
(212-2) 70-23-49.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the festival, Dar America, the American cultural
center, at 10 Place Bel-Air, will present two performances of
``Stuff as Dreams Are Made On,'' a one-man adaptation of
Shakespeare's ``Tempest,'' by Fred Curchack, a University of Texas
drama professor. Information: (212-2) 22-14-60.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9 at 8 p.m., the jazz duo of Tom Wolfe on guitar and
Rick Condit on saxophone will play at La F.O.L. (Lay Charities
Foundation), 16 Avenue Moussa Ibn Noussair, (212-2) 26-67-51.
Condit, a former soloist with the Stan Kenton Orchestra, and Wolfe
are American college professors. Free; contact Dar America.
</P>
<P>
   The WAFA Bank has collected 500 modern Moroccan paintings and
rotates them through the gallery at its headquarters at 163 Avenue
Hassan II. The gallery, which also shows foreign art, is open daily
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco architecture of Casablanca is so plentiful that you
don't have to work at seeing it. A relaxed way to take in some and
enjoy the street life is to stroll east along Mohammed V Boulevard
from the Place des Nations Unies in the heart of the city, by the
Old Medina with its landmark clock tower, wandering off on side
streets when the fancy strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn down the Rue Mohammed Qori, for example, and you'll find
the Rialto Theater, whose interior has been renovated in modern
style. It presents first-run films and live performances in its
1,000-seat auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   At the Place Mohammed V, the post office, the police prefecture
and the Palace of Justice are examples of the neo-Mauresque style
of French architects in the 1920s and 1930s, rich with arches,
columns and tiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the north end of the quiet, thickly wooded League of Arab
Nations Park on Boulevard Hachidi is Paul Tornon's Sacred Heart
Cathedral, closed for years, but a towering 1930s Art Deco wonder
of soaring stone spires that El Greco might have dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the city's great visual delights is the corniche, the
oceanfront boulevard that looks out on the freighters and derricks
in the port, the remains of an old fortress, the towering Hassan II
Mosque, nightclubs, hotels and miles of beaches and rolling surf.
</P>
<P>
   At the vast, somewhat scruffy public beaches, packed with
humanity, young men gallop along the water's edge chasing soccer
balls. The few women sit together chatting, fully clothed. But at
private beach clubs like the Miami, which charge a few dollars to
enter, the standard is more Monaco than Mecca, and foreigners and
less traditional Arab women take the sun in bikinis by half a dozen
sparkling swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of Casablanca's two main bazaars comes close to the
teeming maze of passageways of the one in Marrakesh, with its snake
charmers and medicine men. But the one in the walled Old Medina,
which dates from the 18th century and is across from the Hyatt
Regency, is a working market with lots of practical goods, like
bargain shirts and shoes, and gives a peek at the daily life of
ordinary Moroccans.
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar in the New Medina, which is merely about 65 years old
and is in the Habous neighborhood, 10 minutes or so by taxi south
of Place des Nations Unies, is a real tourist center, unnaturally
spic and span and orderly, with stacks of brass trays, ceramics and
rugs. It is mostly souvenirs, but some shops offer antique jewelry,
old knives and occasionally, a memorable rug.
</P>
<P>
   One of the complaints about Casablanca is that it has no
museums. But the Hassan II Mosque, opened only five years ago,
comes pretty close to filling that gap. Its angular minaret,
visible throughout the city, soars 60 stories and its interior is a
tour de force of craftsmanship: walls and ceiling covered with
mosaic tiles, intricately carved wood and stucco.
</P>
<P>
   Three-story-high Venetian crystal chandeliers _ among the few
imports in the mosque _ are virtually swallowed up beneath the
180-foot-high vaulted ceiling, one of the high-tech features. It
slides open and, when the wind picks up, the two halves are quietly
closed by computers.
</P>
<P>
   The mosque also shoots a laser beam of light nearly 20 miles
toward Mecca, and has electrically warmed marble floors. There are
several tours daily for visitors.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Room rates often turn out to be negotiable, and some of the
least expensive hotels are charming.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Idou Anfa, with 220 rooms in plain, European modern,
at 85 Boulevard d'Anfa, (212-2) 20-01-36, fax (212-2) 20-00-09,
makes up in efficiency what it lacks in ambiance. Though the
switchboard is not geared for computers, there is cable television
in every room. Views from the high floors sweep across the city to
the sea. Doubles are $86.
</P>
<P>
   Out at the beach, 15 minutes from downtown, double rooms at the
51-room Hotel de La Corniche, with its angular Art Deco concrete
and marble and gold trim, cost $58; (212-2) 36-10-11, fax (212-2)
39-11-10.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The Hotel Bellerive, on the ocean drive, a few doors
from Hotel de la Corniche, is an Art Deco gem with 35 commodious
rooms with high ceilings, 14 of them with small sitting areas
looking out to sea over a terrace cafe, a park and a good-sized
pool. Doubles are about $45; (212-2) 39-14-09, fax (212-2)
39-34-93.
</P>
<P>
   Across Place des Nations Unies from the Old Medina is the
80-year-old Hotel Excelsior, at 2 Rue el Amraoui Brahim, (212-2)
20-02-63. It has 60 rooms and a lovely curving stairway leading up
from the dark-wood lobby. The rooms are large and clean, but expect
no frills except breakfast in doubles for $30.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: The Royal Mansour at 27 Avenue de l'Armee Royale,
(212-2) 31-30-12, fax (212-2) 31-48-18, offers spacious doubles
from $225 and a five-room suite from $3,570. Managed by the French
Meridien chain, this 182-room hotel boasts a spectacular arched
entrance, a soaring pillared lounge and mosaic-tiled corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And at the 251-room Hyatt Regency, on the Place des Nations
Unies, (212- 2) 26-12-34, fax (212-2) 22-01-80, doubles start at
about $230. The rooms are big, with contemporary furnishings, and
amenities include a pool and a fitness center.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best Moroccan food is served in Arabian Nights-style
restaurants, with colorful inlaid tiles, filigreed stucco and,
sometimes, fountains.
</P>
<P>
   Menus feature tagines, stews of lamb or chicken with olives,
prunes, lemons and onions; incredible pastries called pastillas,
stuffed with cinnamon, pigeon and almonds and topped with powdered
sugar; and the national dish, couscous _ steamed cracked-wheat
semolina, usually with raisins and chickpeas, and piled high with
lamb, chicken or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of these restaurants is Al-Mounia, at 95 Rue du
Prince Moulay-Abdallah, (212-2) 22-26-69. There, dinner for two
with a bottle of Moroccan wine is about $65.
</P>
<P>
   In the same price range is the excellent Ryad Zitoun, at 31
Boulevard Rachidi, (212-2) 22-39-27. The restaurant features the
simple rose-colored walls typical of Marrakesh rather than the
ornate local style.
</P>
<P>
   For about $45, two can dine on grilled shrimp and fillets of
local fish under the ceiling fans of the Taverne du Dauphin, at 115
Boulevard Houphouet-Boigny, within sight of the main entrance to
the port; (212-2) 27-79-79.
</P>
<P>
   The proprietors of Restaurante Au Petit Poucet, with its white
tablecloths, crystal sconces and gauzy curtains in the shade of one
of the arcaded sidewalks downtown at 86 Boulevard Mohammed V, boast
that Antoine de St.-Exupery was a regular when he flew airmail
around North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fixed lunch and dinner menu, with soup, a choice of
steak, chicken or fish, dessert and a cocktail for an astounding $9
each; (212-2) 27-54-20.
 &UR; NIGHT LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things get pretty quiet in downtown Casablanca by 10 p.m. or so.
But the hot spots on the Corniche _ the playground of well-to-do
Moroccans, other Arabs and Europeans _ don't even open until near
midnight. Most nights at most places, the pricey drinks _ $7.50 for
a beer, $11 for the best scotch _ are the only admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clubs, L'Armstrong, is a paneled and raw-brick,
slightly hard-to-find subterranean room at 41 Boulevard de la
Corniche, (212-2) 39-76-56. The music is rock-n-roll, country,
blues or jazz, whatever the singing manager, Albert Cohen, can
arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The Fandango, at the Rue de la Mer Egee-sur La Corniche, (212-2)
39-85-08, and Le Cafconce, at 10 Rue de la Mer Adriatique, (212-2)
94-42-33, are pleasantly decorated villas with soft lighting and
the easy feel of a friend's home. If Bogie were operating in
Casablanca today, the Fandango might be his place.

midnight. Most nights at most places, the pricey drinks _ $7.50 for
a beer, $11 for the best scotch _ are the only admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the clubs, L'Armstrong, is a paneled and raw-brick,
slightly hard-to-find subterranean room at 41 Boulevard de la
Corniche, (212-2) 39-76-56. The music is rock-n-roll, country,
blues or jazz, whatever the singing manager, Albert Cohen, can
arrange.
</P>
<P>
   The Fandango, at the Rue de la Mer Egee-sur La Corniche, (212-2)
39-85-08, and Le Cafconce, at 10 Rue de la Mer Adriatique, (212-2)
94-42-33, are pleasantly decorated villas with soft lighting and
the easy feel of a friend's home. If Bogie were operating in
Casablanca today, the Fandango might be his place.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Over the years, we have spent the year-end holidays sightseeing
London, cruising on board the Mississippi Queen, seeing the
Rockettes perform in New York City and cheering on the Northwestern
Wildcats in Pasadena, Calif., during one of their two Rose Bowl
appearances in half a century. Wherever we go during the holidays,
we find other mature travelers who also choose to celebrate the
season on the road.
 &HT;    The lure of a holiday trip is not the same for everyone. For
some mature travelers, it's a way to let succeeding generations
develop their own Christmas customs. For other travelers, family
members may be few or far-flung.
 &HT;    For especially large families, central destinations such as
Nashville's Opryland can offer a place to gather without hassle or
stress. And, of course, for the inveterate traveler, it's a way to
see favorite places in a new way _ all dressed up for the season.
 &HT;    Now is the time to book holiday tours or cruises. Because of
their growing popularity, people who wait too long to make
reservations are likely to be disappointed.
 &HT;    Travel company catalogs feature holiday tours to places such as
Branson, Mo., San Antonio, Texas, Williamsburg, Va., the Christmas
markets in Germany, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Vienna,
Austria. Other possibilities include Kenya wildlife safaris and
Caribbean, Mediterranean or Pacific cruises.
 &HT;    Here is a sampling of great places and tours for your holiday
trip:
 &HT;     _ Saga Holidays,  which packages tours just for those 49-plus,
has a special Christmas in London tour for singles and a Danube
River Christmas cruise. Also on its menu of holiday destinations
are old favorites such as Palm Springs, Calif., and San Antonio,
Texas. Many of its trips do not require a single supplement.
 &HT;    The London tour features a walking tour of Dickensian London,
Christmas Eve with caroling and an evening at the theater. The
price, which includes round-trip airfare, is $2,149 from New York
or $2,349 from San Francisco. For more information, call (800)
343-0273.
 &HT;     _ Holland-America  offers 11 different itineraries for holiday
cruises ranging from seven to 16 days, with new ports of call at
Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala; Hualtulco, Mexico; and Virgin Gorda and
Tortola, British Virgin Islands.
 &HT;    Holiday cruises feature caroling, an international crew choir
and a visit from Santa. Seven-day Christmas cruises, double
occupancy, start at $1,381. Call your travel agent or

 &HT;     _ Gerhard's Odysseys' annual Christkindles (Christmas) Markets

1998 departure dates _ Nov. 27 and Dec. 4. The price is $1,440 per
person, double occupancy. Call (503) 223-2402 for details.
 &HT;     _ Maupintour's Top 40 Holiday Treats  start in November with
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City and conclude with

Newark on Dec. 18 and includes tours of the Jewish Quarter,

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Walt Disney World in Orlando is the grand prize of American
tourism. But a vacation there does not come cheaply.
 &HT;    Adding up the cost of admission tickets, parking, eating and a
couple of T-shirts, the average family of four can spend $360 per
day in the land of Mickey and Minnie. And that's before factoring
in the cost of hotel accommodation, car rental and air fares.
 &HT;    ``It can be a very expensive vacation,'' says Bob Sehlinger, the
author of ``The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 1998,''
(Macmillan, 1998; $15.95), a jampacked 742-page bible for
Disney-goers.
 &HT;    ``We're geared for travelers who really want to get their
money's worth,'' he says. ``My average readers are very organized
and button-down. But they're intimidated by the destination. It's
twice as big as Manhattan, with four major theme parks and three
minor ones. They want to be in control before they set foot in the
place.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger, who's been authoring this guide since 1985, has
become an expert on planning a vacation in Walt Disney World. He
extols the merits of traveling during low season, which runs from
September to mid-December, except Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    He ranks all the hotels _ both inside and outside ``the World,''
as it's known. Accommodations outside the park may lack Disney's
magic, he contends, but they almost always give better value.
 &HT;    Sehlinger rates Disney's full-service restaurants. He gives
strategies for those with small children, honeymooners, couples and
single travelers. And he gives specific itineraries for touring
each park within Walt Disney World.
 &HT;    ``Our research methodology is very unique,'' Sehlinger says of
himself and his staff. ``Most of us come from business backgrounds
and about half are MBAs. We use a scientific approach and do
sophisticated survey work. And we've worked on queuing theory.
That's another way of saying that there's got to be a better way to
go through this place than standing in the sun all day.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger's guide is a statistical marvel. He's figured out down
to the minute how to beat the crowds with early admission, how to
cope if a line proves to be too long and when and where to eat.
 &HT;    He's also figured out, based on the number of people standing in
line at a given attraction, how long a wait will be. At ```Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids' Movie Set Adventure Playground,'' a line of 100
people means a 20-minute wait.
 &HT;    At ``New York Street Backlot,'' 100 people in line signifies
almost no wait, because this attraction can process people faster.
 &HT;    ``We had a platoon of researchers with stopwatches who hung out
inconspicuously and monitored line lengths,'' Sehlinger explains.
``We produced flow charts of how the traffic was moving, how it
dispersed and what it did during the course of the day.''
 &HT;    ``We had a test group and a control group who started at the
same time,'' he adds. ``The control group had never been to the
park before and toured according to their own plan. Their only
instruction was to see as much as was humanly possible in a single
day.''
 &HT;    When Sehlinger compared groups, he discovered that on a day when
the park has an average to high attendance of, say, 40,000 people,
the group using his plan at the Magic Kingdom spent three hours and
10 minutes less time standing in line than the other group.
 &HT;    ``People feel a lot of pressure to maximize their time,''
Sehlinger says. ``In some cases, they're almost obsessive about
squeezing value out of their vacation.''
 &HT;    While conceding that having and using such a rigorous plan is
not as necessary in low season, Sehlinger says, ``The bottom line
is that the place is large and overwhelming and Disney is
hyperorganized. If you go, you have to have a plan. If you don't,
whatever spontaneity you have is going to be lost standing in a
line.''
 &HT;    A visit to Disney World with the family is often not a relaxing
vacation. Sehlinger notes that many people tell him they need a
vacation after their vacation to recover.
 &HT;    ``It's important to get your butt out of there during the hot,
crowded part of the day,'' he advises. ``Take a nap, swim, eat.
People think that they have to see a theme park from opening to
closing, and they hit the wall after two or three days. They're
just flat wiped out and not having much fun.''
 &HT;    But for all of Sehlinger's organizing, there are the naysayers _
those who contend that such planning and strategizing are the very
antithesis of a vacation.
 &HT;    Sehlinger admits there are the ``type Bs.''
 &HT;    ``They stop and enjoy the architecture and people-watch,'' he
says. ``They draw the line, no pun intended, at standing in a queue
for hours and hours. That's how my sister goes. She never uses a
plan and she loves the atmosphere. Being there is good enough for
her.''
 &HT;    But for the readers who write to him ``with a certain amount of
rebellion and glee when they circumvent regimentation,''
Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

 &HT;    Walt Disney World in Orlando is the grand prize of American
tourism. But a vacation there does not come cheaply.
 &HT;    Adding up the cost of admission tickets, parking, eating and a
couple of T-shirts, the average family of four can spend $360 per
day in the land of Mickey and Minnie. And that's before factoring
in the cost of hotel accommodation, car rental and air fares.
 &HT;    ``It can be a very expensive vacation,'' says Bob Sehlinger, the
author of ``The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 1998,''
(Macmillan, 1998; $15.95), a jampacked 742-page bible for
Disney-goers.
 &HT;    ``We're geared for travelers who really want to get their
money's worth,'' he says. ``My average readers are very organized
and button-down. But they're intimidated by the destination. It's
twice as big as Manhattan, with four major theme parks and three
minor ones. They want to be in control before they set foot in the
place.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger, who's been authoring this guide since 1985, has
become an expert on planning a vacation in Walt Disney World. He
extols the merits of traveling during low season, which runs from
September to mid-December, except Thanksgiving.
 &HT;    He ranks all the hotels _ both inside and outside ``the World,''
as it's known. Accommodations outside the park may lack Disney's
magic, he contends, but they almost always give better value.
 &HT;    Sehlinger rates Disney's full-service restaurants. He gives
strategies for those with small children, honeymooners, couples and
single travelers. And he gives specific itineraries for touring
each park within Walt Disney World.
 &HT;    ``Our research methodology is very unique,'' Sehlinger says of
himself and his staff. ``Most of us come from business backgrounds
and about half are MBAs. We use a scientific approach and do
sophisticated survey work. And we've worked on queuing theory.
That's another way of saying that there's got to be a better way to
go through this place than standing in the sun all day.''
 &HT;    Sehlinger's guide is a statistical marvel. He's figured out down
to the minute how to beat the crowds with early admission, how to
cope if a line proves to be too long and when and where to eat.
 &HT;    He's also figured out, based on the number of people standing in
line at a given attraction, how long a wait will be. At ```Honey, I
Shrunk the Kids' Movie Set Adventure Playground,'' a line of 100
people means a 20-minute wait.
 &HT;    At ``New York Street Backlot,'' 100 people in line signifies
almost no wait, because this attraction can process people faster.
 &HT;    ``We had a platoon of researchers with stopwatches who hung out
inconspicuously and monitored line lengths,'' Sehlinger explains.
``We produced flow charts of how the traffic was moving, how it
dispersed and what it did during the course of the day.''
 &HT;    ``We had a test group and a control group who started at the
same time,'' he adds. ``The control group had never been to the
park before and toured according to their own plan. Their only
instruction was to see as much as was humanly possible in a single
day.''
 &HT;    When Sehlinger compared groups, he discovered that on a day when
the park has an average to high attendance of, say, 40,000 people,
the group using his plan at the Magic Kingdom spent three hours and
10 minutes less time standing in line than the other group.
 &HT;    ``People feel a lot of pressure to maximize their time,''
Sehlinger says. ``In some cases, they're almost obsessive about
squeezing value out of their vacation.''
 &HT;    While conceding that having and using such a rigorous plan is
not as necessary in low season, Sehlinger says, ``The bottom line
is that the place is large and overwhelming and Disney is
hyperorganized. If you go, you have to have a plan. If you don't,
whatever spontaneity you have is going to be lost standing in a
line.''
 &HT;    A visit to Disney World with the family is often not a relaxing
vacation. Sehlinger notes that many people tell him they need a
vacation after their vacation to recover.
 &HT;    ``It's important to get your butt out of there during the hot,
crowded part of the day,'' he advises. ``Take a nap, swim, eat.
People think that they have to see a theme park from opening to
closing, and they hit the wall after two or three days. They're
just flat wiped out and not having much fun.''
 &HT;    But for all of Sehlinger's organizing, there are the naysayers _
those who contend that such planning and strategizing are the very
antithesis of a vacation.
 &HT;    Sehlinger admits there are the ``type Bs.''
 &HT;    ``They stop and enjoy the architecture and people-watch,'' he
says. ``They draw the line, no pun intended, at standing in a queue
for hours and hours. That's how my sister goes. She never uses a
plan and she loves the atmosphere. Being there is good enough for
her.''
 &HT;    But for the readers who write to him ``with a certain amount of
rebellion and glee when they circumvent regimentation,''
Sehlinger's book is probably the Disney-goer's best friend.

 &HT;    COOLNESS COMING TO GEORGE WASHINGTON'S HOME
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (t) travel categories for release
Sunday, Sept. 13.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly 200 years after George Washington
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved plantation overlooking
the Potomac River, his house is getting air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   That's cool with most folks. Millions of summer visitors have
sweated through tours of the carefully preserved home of the
nation's first president, and electric fans are needed to keep
guides from fainting in the stifling heat.
</P>
<P>
   But a few preservationists are downright hot over the decision
of Mount Vernon's governing board to install a $1 million
computerized climate control system in one of America's most
historic homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've died a thousand times over this,'' said Marc A.
LeFrancois, Mount Vernon's former architectural curator, who
resigned in protest over the air-conditioning issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That place is so important,'' LeFrancois told the Associated
Press. ``To do that much damage for something that may not work,
and probably won't work, is just unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a decision made lightly, conceded James Rees,
resident director of the Mount Vernon Estate and Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1735, Mount Vernon has survived for more than 250 years
without air-conditioning. During the sweltering summers, George and
Martha Washington would dine outside on the portico to catch the
breeze blowing in from the river. He loved the view. ``No estate in
the United States is more pleasantly situated than this,''
Washington wrote in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists today see an estate that is much the same as in
Washington's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Vernon Ladies Association, America's oldest national
historic preservation organization, raised $200,000 to purchase the
500-acre plantation from the first president's great-grandnephew in
the 1850s and has owned and operated it ever since. More than 1
million visitors tour the 18th-century mansion and grounds each
year, making it the nation's second most visited historic home,
ranking behind only the White House.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where the past is revered. George Washington
walked on the hardwood floors, chose the paintings on the parlor
walls, wrote at the desk in the study, ate hoecakes and honey for
breakfast in the small dining room, fretted over the nearby
furrowed fields, and died in the four-poster bed upstairs. Change
does not come easily here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rees went to Rome to check out the Sistine Chapel's new
air-conditioning before agreeing that a similar system would work
at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get to talk to the Pope'' about BTUs and air ducts,
said Rees. But he did hire the same company _ Carrier Corp. _ and
same engineer who designed and installed the system in the Sistine
Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Final approval was granted in June, and the Heating, Ventilation
and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system is scheduled to be operating
this autumn, in time for a year-long bicentennial commemoration of
Washington's death on Dec. 14, 1799.
</P>
<P>
   After years of considering the pros and cons of
air-conditioning, Rees said that technological advances finally
tipped the scales toward installation.
</P>
<P>
   There are drawbacks, he acknowledged. The primary problem is
that ``you have to cut through original fabric in the mansion'' to
put in air ducts and other parts of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have decried this ``irreversible'' destruction of
18th-century plaster and wood. ``It's extremely sad,'' Christine
Meadows, a former Mount Vernon curator, told AP.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is not the first time such action has been deemed
necessary, Rees pointed out. The original structure was cut to
install electricity, heating, lighting and fire protection in
earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   He said care is being taken to minimize damage to the original
building and more than half of the air-conditioning vents were put
in without destroying original fabric. The work was done inside
closets and in other hidden areas wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
   The second major concern was condensation. Mount Vernon is built
of wood, and its historic planks are vulnerable to water damage.
</P>
<P>
   This is where technology came in, Rees said. The computerized
system will ensure that there is never such a difference in
temperature and humidity to cause condensation. The formula is
complex, said Rees, but basically the range will never be more than
15 degrees when the air-conditioning is on. Thus, if the outside
temperature is 100 degrees, the temperature inside Mount Vernon
will be about 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rate below objects'' in this equation, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The entire project is aimed more at preserving the historic
house and furnishings than at providing comfort for visitors and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In summer now, we do what George Washington did _ open the
doors and windows,'' said Rees. ``That lets in dirt and dust and
light,'' all of which can damage the historic furnishings.
Carefully controlling the climate will help preserve the mansion's
artifacts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums and
historic houses will not lend art and furniture that Washington
owned to Mount Vernon because of the uncontrolled environment, said
Rees. Once the HVAC system is working, these traveling exhibits
will enable the curators to make the house even more as it was when
the nation's first First Family lived there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to bring home many of Washington's artifacts
which have been maintained by collectors and museums around the
country,'' said Carter King Laughlin, Mount Vernon's curator.
``Without a modern climate control system, we are limited in the
variety of historical artifacts we can borrow from other
collections to display here.''
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the pastoral setting, the system's condenser is
located in a wooded area about 200 yards from the mansion, hidden
from visitors by trees. Buried pipes connect it to the underground
air handlers in the site of a former archeological dig about 100
feet from the house. The only visible parts of the system will be
small air vents in ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning should disturb the historic ambiance
considerably less than the current electric fans that circulate the
air in almost every room in the summer, said Rees.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Matt Damon with Gretchen
Mol in a scene from ``Rounders'' and with Robin Williams in a scene
from ``Good Will Hunting.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not long ago Matt Damon was down and out in Hollywood.
 &HT;    The boyish actor was counting pennies, living on beans and
wondering if he'd ever get work for bit parts in TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    What a difference a couple of years make.
 &HT;    Today at 28 Damon is the hottest actor in Hollywood. He's been
on the cover of just about every major magazine since he and his
writing partner Ben Affleck sold their ``Good Will Hunting'' script
to Hollywood for half a million dollars and as a bonus took home
the Oscar for screenwriting. Now Damon finds himself working
virtually around the clock.
 &HT;    Currently he's appearing in the title role in Steven Spielberg's
blockbuster ``Saving Private Ryan.'' On Sept. 11 he shows up in a
leading role in ``Rounders,'' a film about professional poker
players, costarring Edward Norton, Martin Laundau, John Turturo and
John Malkovich. Damon plays a cardsharp who uses his winnings to
put himself through law school.
 &HT;    He's about to spend five months in Italy shooting ``The Talented
Mr. Ripley'' opposite Jude Law, with ``English Patient'' director
Anthony Minghella. Billy Bob Thornton will direct him in ``All The
Pretty Horses'' early next year.
 &HT;    Damon was hired for ``Saving Private Ryan'' while on the set of
``Good Will Hunting,'' when Robin Williams introduced him to
Spielberg. Damon compared working on ``Ryan'' to ``having a
scholarship into the best film school in the world.''
 &HT;    On the personal front he ended his high-profile romance with his
``Good Will'' costar Minnie Driver shortly after going on TV to
announce his love for her. Since the Oscars he has been dating
Winona Ryder so persistently that USA Today ran a story that said,
``Winona and Matt are not engaged.''
 &HT;    Sitting in a swank hotel in Marina Del Rey, Calif., he smiles at
the story: ``Well, I don't want to talk about it. There was a time
when I was very open about my personal life but I've made mistakes
before. This engagement stuff is kind of silly.''
 &HT;    Apart from the occasional wince, however, he handles his
newfound status with aplomb and tries to keep a sense of
proportion.
 &HT;    ``It's gotten a little crazy,'' he sighs. ``But I think it's all
due to the power of the media. Look, in the mid-'80s there were
stories that said Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen were the
biggest stars in the world. Michael couldn't leave the house
without 25 bodyguards and Springsteen you could bump into in a
local bar. I think it's all what you make of it. I'm not gonna do
the whole bodyguard nonsense _ or anything like that. I'm trying to
keep things in perspective.''
 &HT;    Family and friends in hometown Boston help keep his feet on the
ground. ``I'm really lucky that it didn't happen until now,'' he
says. ``I have a whole bunch of people I grew up with who aren't
that impressed but are happy for us.''
 &HT;    One of them is Ben Affleck, his longtime writing and acting pal
who is now dating Gwyneth Paltrow. ``I haven't seen him in a while,
'' says Damon, ``but I like to kid him about Gwyneth _ I'd
telephone and say, 'Hey, your girlfriend is doing real good. How
are those love scenes going?'''
 &HT;    He says Affleck plans to join him in Italy to finish a script.
``It might be a story about a halfway house in Boston,'' says
Damon. ``We've done 150 pages ... but only five of them were
usable. We're dying to get to work. ``Good Will Hunting'' is a hard
act to follow.'
 &HT;    Also they both have concerns about overusing their friendship
and the cute story of their collaboration. ``We're getting to the
point,'' Damon explains, ``where we don't want to feel we pimped
out our friendship _ especially with the flood of stories about how
we grew up together. And sometimes you can't help feeling that
you're whoring out your personal life for professional gain.''
 &HT;    If he seems overly cautious about, ``the success thing'', it's
because he sees the danger signs everywhere he goes. ``People laugh
at your jokes too hard now and you know the joke wasn't that funny.
But then maybe after a while you think it is. ''
 &HT;    Still he wants to make it clear he's not one of those stars who
no sooner get a whiff of success than they start whining about a
loss of privacy. ``I went from needing money and really needing a
job to being able to sit back and pick select jobs really
carefully. It's an incredible feeling. Things have turned into an
embarrassment of riches _ it's every dream I've ever dared dream
come true.
 &HT;    ``And it's tough to have a bad day when you're in the dairy
section of the supermarket and people keep coming up and saying,
'Good job.''''

   Not long ago Matt Damon was counting pennies, living on beans
and wondering if he'd ever get work for bit parts in TV sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a couple of years make.
</P>
<P>
   Today at 28 Damon is the hottest actor in Hollywood. On Sept. 11
he shows up in a leading role in ``Rounders,'' a film about
professional poker players, costarring Edward Norton, Martin
Laundau, John Turturo and John Malkovich. Damon plays a cardsharp
who uses his winnings to put himself through law school.

 &HT;    Monday's 512-point fall produced good bargains in solid
companies
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Domestic stock markets' free fall Monday, August 31, and partial
recovery Tuesday proved that at least one cliche has some cachet:
The dark cloud over the markets does indeed have a silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the market fell a staggering 512 points, veteran
money managers figured, hey, it's a buying opportunity. The lurking
bear produced some pretty good bargains in solid companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great silver lining is that you get a chance to buy stocks
at much lower prices,'' said Carl Domino, a money manager at West
Palm Beach-based Carl Domino Associates, with more than $2 billion
under management. ``You're getting more money for your investment
dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one of the most popular stocks in America,
Microsoft Corp., was selling as high as $118 a share in mid-July,
but on Monday savvy investors could snap it up for $96. On a
typical trade of 100 shares, that's a savings of $2,200. Plus, the
stock moved up to $101.25 Tuesday, a gain of $525 on those 100
shares bought Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's Corp., another perennial favorite, was going for $74
a share in early July, before falling to $56 on Monday. That
translates to a savings of $1,800 on a 100-share buy. The stock
closed Tuesday at $60.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors should use (a down market) as a buying opportunity
for good, quality companies that are market leaders, especially in
consumer staples, health care and financial services,'' said Thomas
Doak, a broker with the Lake Worth office of Edward Jones, a St.
Louis-basedcq investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average bear market lasts only eight months and fully
recovers in an average of 13 months,'' Doak added, ``so if you are
a long-term investor and have realistic expectations, you need not
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stocks you bought before a correction most likely
are going to take a temporary hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money you've already invested is now worth a lot less,''
said Alex Bigelow, branch manager at the West Palm Beach office of
St. Louis-basedcq A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. And anybody looking for
a bargain, Bigelow said, needs to keep in mind that lower prices
don't necessarily translate into a great buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because stocks are cheaper right now doesn't mean they
are a better value,'' he said. ``You still have to do the
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important benefit of the recent drop in stock
prices is that it brings a dose of reality to a market that has not
had a bad year in nearly a decade, market players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of correction is healthy,'' said Barbara Trebbi, a
senior vice president with Boca Raton-based Ivy Management Inc.
``It's unrealistic to think stocks could continue to trade at such
high (price-to-earnings) ratios. . . . So I think this should
provide the foundation for the next move up.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Raborn, a money manager at Delray Beach-based Raborn &AMP; Co.,
with $120 million under management, urges his clients not to
``panic'' when inevitable corrections shake the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market has compounded at 11 percent since 1926,'' he
said, reciting a well-worn pitch. ``At these levels, the Dow will
exceed 30,000 by the year 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   That's usually enough to convince most people.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Fagan straightens the record
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palm Beacher Stephen Fagan wants to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   After allegedly kidnapping his two young daughters from their
mother nearly 20 years ago, he didn't take them to live with a
stripper.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can one characterize a human being that way by taking a
cheap shot and calling someone a stripper?'' Fagan told The Palm
Beach Daily News in a story published this week. ``She was an
exotic dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a stripper. An exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   I ran this distinction by Al Goldstein, the publisher of a
pornographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, Al?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a pornographer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you come up with a better title than that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein came up with ``Fantasy Entertainment Industry
Executive,'' but his heart wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a pornographer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein couldn't imagine there'd be a difference between a
stripper and an exotic dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just semantics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who stripped ... oops, I mean ... danced exotically
while getting undressed met Fagan at a bar where he worked as a
bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I may be accused of taking a cheap shot by
characterizing Fagan's former job as that of ``a bouncer.''
</P>
<P>
   To be on the safe side, let's just call him a former ``customer
egress specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Fagan's old housemate hadn't figured out a way to
do interesting things with tubers while taking her clothes off on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fagan could have bristled with righteous indignation that
he lived with ``a performance artist'' with a grant application
pending at the National Endowment of the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   I called up Rachel's, a ``gentlemen's club'' in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you call the women who work there _ strippers or
exotic dancers?'' I asked manager Craig Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would label the girls as entertainers or exotic
performers,'' Bordeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   And to think we're amazed that the Eskimos can come up with 20
names for snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference between an exotic dancer and a
stripper?'' I asked Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're interchangeable,'' he said. ``One's just a fancier
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The name, Bordeaux said, has more to do with the audience than
the job itself.
</P>
<P>
   White-collar guys watch ``exotic dancers'' take their clothes
off.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-collar guys watch ``strippers.''
</P>
<P>
   The more faux-respectable the joint gets, the more obfuscating
the job title becomes for the women who undress for a living.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with Dixie Evans, president of the Exotic Dancers League
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Before I got down to semantics, I had to ask a simple question:
</P>
<P>
   ``So where do you women keep your membership cards?''
</P>
<P>
   Evans is a voice for the professionally underdressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strip tease dancer has been discriminated against for many
years,'' she said. ``They're a lovely bunch of girls, what I like
to call renegade girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to stay in the arts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fagan is trying to stay out of ``long-term government
housing'' (prison) on the charge of ``sudden youthful relocation''
(kidnapping).
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he took his daughters because his ex-wife, Barbara
Kurth, had frequently been drunk and neglectful. But to paraphrase
a earlier complaint, how can one characterize a human being that
way?
</P>
<P>
   It might be better for Fagan to say that Kurth was
``alcoholically inclined,'' to the point of ``chronic
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   So he took the girls to live with a budding artist, who used to
take her clothes off on stage, but certainly wasn't a stripper.

   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ If any investor can stand up to the
gut-wrenching swings of this week's volatile stock market, it's a
day trader like Andy Friis.
</P>
<P>
   Don't talk to Friis about price-to-earnings ratios or order
backlogs or any other traditional gauge of a company's health. It's
more information than he needs to know. Friis lives for
``movement,'' how a company has traded in a period of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of a new breed of investor who earns his daily bread
by squeezing fractional profits from each share he buys and selling
as a stock rolls in one direction or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys don't even know what the companies make,''
Friis says.
</P>
<P>
   Friis trades from a computer terminal at Broadway Trading Co.,
one of several shops in the area where day traders access stock
markets electronically. Broadway operates out of a second-floor
office in a bank building in Boca Raton where rows of tables
crowded with computers fill two rooms of mostly young men.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when markets plummeted, day traders were doing their
best to follow the first rule of day trading _ minimize loss. It
wasn't easy, Friis says. Many were trying to pull their cash out of
the market. If they were smart, they had already taken short
positions _ betting that stocks would go down _ and could watch
unemotionally as the panic ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would come to an end but it never did,'' Friis
says.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders will buy and sell stocks in keystrokes _ sometimes
in seconds, often in minutes but most certainly in hours. Holding a
stock all day would be considered unusual.
</P>
<P>
   A day trader might buy 1,000 shares of a stock, watch it go up
by a sixteenth, then an eighth, and finally by a fourth before
selling it. He pays the shopkeeper 2 cents a share on the trade and
pockets $210.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can all happen in a matter of two or three minutes,''
says Chris Perry, a day trader at On-Site Trading Inc. in West Palm
Beach. ``We're trying to get quarters, or halves, or
three-eighths.''
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's stock slide, many held onto their money and
waited for one of two trading respites when some stocks leveled
off. They bought into the market briefly or took a short position
in anticipation of a deeper drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys caught a bounce in a stock. But it got a
little rough,'' Broadway Manager Glenn Disort said. ``Nobody threw
anything. But I had to tap a couple of guys on the shoulder and
say, 'breaking your keyboard isn't going to help anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although day-traders can trade on the New York and other
exchanges, The market of choice for day traders is the Nasdaq Stock
Market. There are two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First is volatility. Day traders play stocks that move up and
down in great volume, and the Nasdaq is heavy in technology stocks,
a mercurial sector that often suffers from mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the trader operates on the Nasdaq, he can act, in
effect, like a market maker, an investment house that buys and
sells stock and helps to maintain its price in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders don't care if the market goes up or down. They'll
jump in on any trend in a stock's movement. Even so, the
requirement that a stock must have an uptick before a trader can
take a short position makes trading on the long side a bit easier,
Disort said.
</P>
<P>
   Friis' plan for Tuesday was to short stocks in an anticipated
upward swing at market opening before it began to slide again. ``I
won't enter on the long side until the market shows signs of
strength,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On-Site Manager Jack Polsky said one key to day trading is going
with the flow, or following a short-term trend in a stock's price.
The other is minimizing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Disort, Broadway Trading's manager, preaches discipline in
either direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a rule that you will not lose more than 25 cents a
share, you have to stick to the rule,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Friis lost money on Monday even though three-quarters of the
traders at Broadway made a profit, Disort says. ``Nobody expected
the selling in droves,'' he lamented. ``When the trend goes in one
direction _ up or down _ it's hard to stay on the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry is a former broker; Friis a former floor clerk on the
American Stock Exchange. But not everyone has stock-trading
background. A former surgeon, gas-station owner and Motorola
engineer also are day-traders.sure, and lots of other people in
other occupations are too. but what makes these special? were they
people who were there today???
</P>
<P>
   After the 1987 crash, the Nasdaq began the small-order execution
system, or SOES, so individual investors could make trades of 1,000
shares or less automatically rather than go through an investment
middleman. Day traders have even been described a SOES (pronounced
sose) bandits in the past because of their lightning quick use of
the electronic trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders also avoid small-cap stocks because they aren't
traded in enough volume for changes in price _ up or down _ to gain
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can just walk in and sit down at a terminal in a
day-trading office. Traders are required to plunk down a sizable
chunk of cash to draw from. At Broadway, $75,000 is the minimum; at
On-Site, it's $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. Friis let one stock ride up $18, and made
$18,000 but he also let one slide a little too long and lost
$10,000 after it fell $10 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a dismal day like Monday, as the market fell more than
500 points, day traders were clicking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys are doing okay, made over $10,000. But
everyone is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general mood was amazement. Most of these guys haven't
seen something like this,'' Disort said.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as there's momentum, there's opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most momentum traders are long traders but in a market like
this, you have to go short,'' Disort said of the practice of
gambling on certain stocks going down. ``What is there to take
long?''

 &HT;    Baptists who came Second beg to differ
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Would somebody please pass the crow?
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to apologize to the multitude of churchgoers I
inadvertently eliminated from existence in my column recently.
</P>
<P>
   That's the last time I'll ever joke around about how you never
see a Second Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   See, like an idiot, while writing about the Texas high school
football ranking system, I mentioned how Americans love to be No. 1
and hate coming in second. And that, I said, explains why nobody
ever names their church the Second Baptist Church. It's always the
First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I could try to weasel out of this by claiming I stole
this joke from former Boston Globe columnist Mike Barnicle. But the
fact is, I didn't realize how many Second Baptist Churches there
are until y'all called me up to tell me about it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that. There's at least one Third Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did make a mistake; now you're talking to Third,'' said
Rev. Larry Davis, associate pastor of the Third Baptist Church in
St. Louis, Mo. ``I get questions and remarks about Third Baptist
all the time. They wonder what happened to First and Second.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering about Fourth, Davis added that the Fourth
Baptist Church in St. Louis is still there, although Fifth Baptist
is no longer around. But Third Baptist in St. Louis will celebrate
its 150th anniversary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But let's forget about who's on First and what's on Third for a
second and talk about Second. As in Second Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   There are Second Baptist Churches all over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're scattered throughout the state,'' said Dale Gore,
executive director of the Austin Baptist Association.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there are Second Baptist churches in Lubbock,
Corpus Christi, La Grange, Odessa and San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Second Baptist churches call themselves second because
they came along second, after First Baptist, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But Second Baptist in Dallas got the name because it was founded
on Second Avenue in 1912, said Betty Proctor, church secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that we were trying to be second behind First
Baptist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And just because you're called Second Baptist doesn't mean
you're playing second fiddle. According to the Union Baptist
Association in Houston, last year the Second Baptist Church in
Houston had 24,334 members, compared to 21,169 for First Baptist in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Curious about how widespread this phenomenon really is, I called
New York and asked the operator for the number of the Second
Baptist Church. She wanted to know which one I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have multiple listings for Second Baptist churches,'' she
said. Multiple, as in eight churches in New York with the words
Second and Baptist as part of their names.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the New York phone directory, there's just one
listing for a Dew Drop Inn.
</P>
<P>
   You know you've got a lot of Second Baptist churches when you
outnumber the Dew Drop Inn 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how I missed seeing all these Second Baptist
churches, but it makes me wonder: Ever notice how you never see a
Ninth Baptist Church around these parts?

   COLUMN: Lessons in charisma
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Out of view of the television cameras, President
Clinton should give charisma lesson to President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows better than anyone that the secret to maintaining
a strong following is charisma, certainly not character.
</P>
<P>
   Charisma coupled with a good economy blinds people to a
multitude of character flaws. No one knows this better than
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While he's at it, Clinton also can teach Yeltsin to blame his
troubles on a vast outside conspiracy, perhaps masterminded by a
man named Starrsky.
</P>
<P>
   Without immediate help from Clinton, Boris Yeltsin is a dead
duck in Russia. At this point, Yeltsin's political career can be
salvaged only if he develops a nationwide cult following strong
enough to discount all the man's obvious defects.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for Yeltsin, Clinton is the right man for that job. After
all, Clinton has been on the verge of turning the Democratic Party
into a cult for the past six or seven years.
</P>
<P>
   If a cult is defined as a group of people who blindly follow an
unscrupulous charismatic leader, then that description comes
uncomfortably close to the power Clinton holds over his devoted
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it's nearly impossible to explain why so many good,
intelligent Americans could not see that they were being held
spellbound by an obvious scoundrel.
</P>
<P>
   Like successful cult leaders, Clinton has shown an uncanny
ability to manipulate people to serve his interests. And from
Clinton's actions, it's easy to see that his interests seldom rise
to a level higher than himself. Clinton first, right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cult leaders always invent powerful enemies bent on the
destruction of the selfless leader and his faithful flock.
</P>
<P>
   Evil outside forces combined with the cult leader's charismatic
believability convince beguiled followers to ignore clear and
convincing evidence that their leader is telling them lies they
want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his companion enabler and a host of enchanted acolytes
vigorously blame their troubles in a vast right-wing conspiracy, an
anti-Arkansas conspiracy or an out-of-control independent counsel,
who, by the way, Clinton could fire.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good cult leader, Clinton has made a career out of
telling people what they want to hear. From the beginning, Clinton
has been willing to lie, invent and shift positions to manipulate
the support he needs to obtain and maintain personal power.
</P>
<P>
   A telling indicator of both his charisma and his total lack of
scruples came during his 1992 presidential campaign after poll
watchers told him he needed to beef up his support among Jewish
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Clinton was standing before 500 surprised members of
the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park, a Hasidic
stronghold in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I become president,'' he said, ``we will keep a glatt
kosher kitchen in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it, of course, because he didn't mean what he said.
He looked his audience in the eye and lied.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's admission that he ``misled'' people when he looked the
nation in the eye and emphatically said, ``I did not . . . have . .
. sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' could surprise
only those people who had been deluded by Clinton's characterless
charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's history of mendacity and manipulation is obvious to
anyone not caught in his spell.
</P>
<P>
   Most politicians have unfulfilled campaign promises. But
thankfully few politicians are so devoid of personal convictions
that they go out of their way to tell purposeful lies to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that even Clinton can save Yeltsin's job. And if
Clinton gets many more cracks in his charisma, he will be defrocked
by his own flock.

 &HT;    Program like a morning hug for Glades tots
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Used to be that Sam King the kind-hearted custodian would come
around to the back of the new elementary school in Belle Glade, and
there they'd be.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen or 20 of the little squirts. Waiting outside the gate.
Rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   Sweltering heat. December cold spell. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   And Sam would usher the little guys inside, or, at the very
least, he'd bring them around and let them stand inside the gate,
under the roof of the bus port where the drivers drop off kids each
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't have the heart to let those kids stand outside,''
said Juanita Malone, assistant principal at Belle Glade Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, these weren't middle schoolers or high schoolers
standing out there at 6 a.m. These were itty bitty kids, many of
them too small to cross a road alone. We're talking 5-, 6-,
7-year-olds, dropped off at school before the sun was up.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Many parents in the Florida Glades _ some of them
field workers _ have to be at work early. Very early. And they have
no place to drop their kids at that time of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes our parents go to work at 5 o'clock,'' Malone said.
``They know it's safe here, so they would just bring them to
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it worried Malone to death. What if some kid got lost?
What if a fight broke out and someone got hurt? What if, what if,
what if?
</P>
<P>
   But all that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Three schools in the Glades are getting grants from the Quantum
Foundation to start what will be called the Glades Before School
Care Program.
</P>
<P>
   Daphne Nikolopoulos, director of development for the Boys and
Girls Clubs of Palm Beach County, says they will take the $338,210
and start morning programs at three schools _ Belle Glade
Elementary, Glades View Elementary and Pioneer Park Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Quintero, 27, falls into the ranks of these working
Glades parents. She's a little different because she was able to
move back her hours at the Wellington hospital where she works. But
that meant she lost precious work hours _ and precious money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to increase my hours and increase my pay,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The grant is new, it was just approved last week, so officials
haven't decided when the program's going to start and exactly who's
going to staff it. But Nikolopoulos says they want someone
bilingual who will start the kids off with a little exercise in the
morning _ ``Some of these kids are still half asleep,'' she said _
give them breakfast and help them with homework.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time you wake up late and it's 7:15 and you're
rushing around making Pop-Tarts and packing lunches and telling the
kids to hurry, hurry, hurry, take a minute to stop and think about
those little guys out in the Glades. The ones Sam the custodian
treats with kindness each morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real thrust of this program is education,'' says
Nikolopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's that.
</P>
<P>
   But me, I like the part about bringing little kids in out of the
dark and giving them a hug and a hot breakfast, all before the sun
comes up.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Teen dad is dilemma in flesh
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Sex education in the 1990s. Here is the egg. Here
is the sperm. Put the two together and here is what they create in
approximately nine months:
</P>
<P>
   A visit from Child Support Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere this week a boy in his teens is learning that
reproduction is a lot more than arrows and ova. Under welfare
reforms still in the toddler stage, a mom who seeks federal
assistance must declare the name of the father. Once identified, he
is approached to declare paternity. If he refuses, the government
takes him and his blood sample to court. Paternity established, a
pencil-thin neck is fitted with a monster yoke.
</P>
<P>
   The obstetrician has this word for the laboring teen mom:
``push.'' Now, the government has this word for the teen dad:
``pull.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the latter player, Pamela Wilson has her own word for a
society trying to make the best out of what happens when teens have
children: ``firmth.'' It's the wedding of ``firm'' with ``warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   Society could stick with the ``firm'' alone. It could be as cold
as Siberian winter. But Wilson, a Washington-based expert on
getting teen fathers to act responsibly, isn't just talking about
child support in a fiscal sense. She's talking about co-parenting,
even when parents don't cohabit.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was speaking to concerned citizens in a public forum
following a daylong seminar with professionals sponsored by Planned
Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Although society does some reasonable things to help teen moms
get on their feet and do what's best for their children, teen
fathers are treated either as irrelevant or as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   We are well aware of the deadbeat dad, he who has money but
won't share it. In the case of teen fathers not even out of school,
Wilson points to something else entirely: the dead-broke dad.
</P>
<P>
   Under tough welfare reforms, you can wallop that turnip with
sadistic intensity and still not get child support that will matter
in the short run or in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   If society wants to make the best of such a bad situation, says
Wilson, it must find ways to warm these young people to the task
facing them. It must provide them with job training, support
groups, counseling.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes after them like the ATF executing a warrant, many
do what little boys do. They hide.
</P>
<P>
   A teen father is a dilemma in the flesh: You want him to start
helping out with child support. But do you want him dropping out of
school to do it? Surely not. That's lost earning power, not to
mention all else lost for the sake of earning the quickest buck.
And yet it happens all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The other dilemma is about the extent to which a teen dad should
be involved in his child's life. In the ideal world, of course,
wedding bells would ring before the twinkle of a mom's eye. In the
real world . . .
</P>
<P>
   Some of offspring of teen dads grow up with suitable fathers
when their mothers marry suitable life partners. Others don't. And
in those fatherless homes incubate so many of society's more
serious ills, including teen fatherhood, a cycle prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Involving the dad can work. Waco resident Joan McClary, in the
audience at the forum, was a teen mom. She said that the father of
her child has played an important role, including caring for the
child while she went to college. She's a physician now.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in earning power or in nurturing potential, or in the
essential ingredients that make humanity wondrous and complex, the
teen dad is raw material society doesn't want to squander.

 &HT;    Anthem charges premiums to subsidize rural Ohio
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One option for Anthem to keep its Medicare HMO in some less
profitable rural and suburban counties is to charge new monthly
premiums to Anthem Senior Advantage members in Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   Sources outside the company said Anthem is considering a
proposal that would include monthly premiums of about $40 for
beneficiaries in Montgomery and certain outlying counties, who
currently pay no premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Those premiums would be a legal way to subsidize the lower
federal payments all Medicare HMOs receive for covering residents
of outlying counties, said the top regional Medicare HMO
administrator. But the federal government will not increase its
reimbursement rates for those counties.
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar the government pays a Medicare HMO to cover a
Montgomery County resident, it pays 83 cents in Greene County and
89 cents in Miami County. That kind of disparity was a main reason
Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield announced last spring it would
discontinue the Medicare HMO Dec. 31 for about 20,000 Ohio
customers in 22 rural and suburban counties.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem says it is reconsidering that decision, but officials
declined to discuss whether or how much of a premium there might
be, which counties it plans to retain for coverage or any other
details on the proposal it is preparing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is settled about Anthem's plans, stressed Michael
Gessel, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, D-Dayton, but he said
Hall ``expects the final decision to be fair to residents of
Montgomery County, and he would certainly be very upset if
residents of Montgomery County were not treated equitably.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the four Medicare HMOs in Montgomery County currently
charge premiums. But even at $40 a month, Senior Advantage is a
better value than beneficiaries can find in a traditional Medigap
supplement, said Bob Thimmes, president of the Miami Valley Health
Improvement Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't cut any benefits, that's not too bad,'' Thimmes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration would have to approve
any proposal from Anthem and would streamline the approval process,
said Bette Weisberg, HCFA's regional HMO administrator in Chicago.
Nov. 1 is the deadline for all Medicare HMOs to notify
beneficiaries of changes in fees and coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Weisberg called it ``very likely that there will be either fewer
benefits or more of a premium'' in at least some of the 15 counties
where Anthem planned uninterrupted Medicare HMO coverage. She said
Medicare HMOs can change fees and benefits year-to-year under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Xenia attorney representing discontinued Anthem Senior
Advantage members in a class-action lawsuit said he hoped Anthem
would remain in all Ohio counties it planned to leave, even though
that would make the suit irrelevant before lawyers were paid a
dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to get these people's health care back
would be great,'' Charles Rowland said. If Anthem decides to retain
Senior Advantage coverage in only selected counties, he said he
would continue the lawsuit on behalf of any discontinued members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to complain if we have to pay $40 a month for
our insurance,'' said Becky Howe, the Senior Advantage member in
Piqua who organized grass-roots opposition to Anthem's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said she believed most of the thousands of people she has
talked to would also tolerate slight increases in Senior Advantage
co-payments, currently $5 for a doctor visit, $25 for an emergency
room visit, $5 a month for generic prescription drugs and $15 for
brand-name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But from Howe to U.S. Rep. David L. Hobson, R-Springfield, there
has been strong agreement that the best solution would be to
consider uniform HCFA reimbursement rates throughout metropolitan
regions instead of county by county.
</P>
<P>
   The only way HCFA can bypass its county-by-county rate
structure, said Weisberg, is if a governor requests a single
reimbursement rate throughout a state. Such a request would include
lowering the rates in urban counties as well as raising them in
less-populated counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be budget-neutral, so that's why that hasn't
been popular,'' said Weisberg. No state has made such a request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense to do it by metropolitan areas,''
Thimmes said. As he pointed out, the reimbursement rate disparity
has prompted United HealthCare, Aetna and Pacificare to announce
they will discontinue Medicare HMOs in other regions across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've probably got similar problems around the country,''
Thimmes said, ``simmering right below the surface that haven't
bubbled out yet.''

 &HT;    Waco houses world's largest Browning collection
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushing through the 1,500-pound bronze double doors, visitors
might think they've stepped from the confines of Waco, Texas, into
a museum somewhere in the midst of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive terrazzo-tiled floor bordered with shiny bronze,
magnificent vaulted, molded plaster ceilings and brilliant
stained-glass windows are introductions to inspiring tales of love
and a passion for poetry _ introductions to the Armstrong Browning
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one of Waco's unintentionally best-kept secrets, the
library houses the world's largest collection of poetry and
materials of world-famous poets Robert Browning and his wife,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant amusement to us, though we try not to be a
secret,'' said Dr. Cynthia Burgess, curator of books and printed
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``library'' might be the dispelling word that acts as a
repellent for the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it's called a library, it's intimidating,'' said Dr.
Mairi Rennie, the library's director. ``The outside is very gray
and stern looking _ not very becoming.''
</P>
<P>
   But once inside the heavy front doors, it's like entering a
magical kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what to expect,'' Burgess said. ``They can't
imagine this building until they've actually been here. We've had
so many visitors from around the world say that when they walk in
this building they feel like they're walking in a building they
would find in Europe. We would love to be better know and
appreciated in Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 50-year-old, three-story library was the vision of
Dr. A.J. Armstrong, who was head of Baylor's English department
from 1912 to 1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Armstrong enjoyed the spiritual aspect of Browning's
poetry _ the optimism he found there _ and he felt Browning would
be an appropriate poet to promote at Baylor University, a
Christian-based university,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Armstrong focused on Robert Browning and the building
was in fact dedicated to Robert and his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. Armstrong appreciated Elizabeth, but more as the
wife of a poet than a poet in her own right, although now she has
ended up getting more and more attention for her poetry,'' Burgess
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Browning collection began as a small assemblage Armstrong
gave to Baylor in 1918. As Armstrong acquired additional books,
letters, manuscripts and pieces of art, he raised the $1.5 million
it took to build the library.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the building houses more than 27,000 volumes of poetry,
first editions of the Brownings' work, books that belonged to the
Brownings and critical works about the Brownings. About half of the
volumes are considered rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to acquire all the new books about Browning, and we
have acquired all the first editions that they wrote and many of
the subsequent editions,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Browning books aren't the only items visitors will find. The
library has numerous items that belonged to the Brownings,
including the writing desk Robert used after Elizabeth's death in
1861. Busts that belonged to the Brownings, including one of their
only child, Robert (Pen) Wiedemann Barrett Browning also are on
display. Pen, an artist and sculptor, painted several of the
paintings featured inside the library.
</P>
<P>
   A small hallway alcove contains some of the pressed flowers
Robert sent Elizabeth in the love letters the two wrote each other
before their first face-to-face encounter. Elizabeth's dainty ink
well sits inside the display case, as well as a tea set Robert used
on a train.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lady offered tea to Browning not knowing who he was and as
the conversation went along, he discovered she was a fan of
Elizabeth,'' said Rita Humphrey, curator of manuscripts. ``She told
him that she really enjoyed her works of poetry and that it had
touched her so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The library contains the world's largest collection of secular
stained glassdownright bizarre (``Do I welcome my shadow side?''
``Do I believe in elves, dragons or fairies?'' ``Whom have I held
spellbound?'')
</P>
<P>
   Object: To share, not to win.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonial by game creator Prasuti Kirk, from her
kitchen/office in California: ``We were playing once at a bridal
shower in the Taos pueblo in New Mexico. It came around to the
oldest woman there, and she couldn't even read the question, and
everyone was laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say the poor woman read the question _ a highly
personal one exploring her opinion on the male anatomy _ and she
answered it honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This game works,''' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in Taos, N.M., where everyone welcomes their shadow sides.
But would cowgirls ride the trail of truth in, oh, Lake Worth?
</P>
<P>
   We took the game to Monday bridge night at Temple Beth Sholom,
where Cecile Sulkin, 79, Sylvia Rappaport, 85, and Nadine Spencer,
71, agreed to play.
</P>
<P>
   Good sports that they were, no one refused to answer a question,
though with lucky rolome decoupaging Web sites, such as
www.dogbyte.com/tiptriks/decobox.html and www.durwinrice.com.

 &HT;    Decoupage: Found objects are turned into art
 &HT;    With sidebar, DECOUPAGE-TIPS
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What others might see as a useless, cardboard box, Evelyn Holmes
envisions an endless world of decoration.
</P>
<P>
   She sees pictures and colorful paint, lace and ribbon. Holmes is
a crafter who's taken on the old art of decoupage _ a craft that
involves cutting out decorated pieces of paper and affixing them to
a solid-surfaced item to create a display.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started doing it because it's simple,'' she said. ``It
doesn't take a lot of time to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two or three years, she's turned dozens of
ordinary items into attractive accents for the home. Using scrap
art, magazine clippings, prints from napkins and wrapping paper,
Holmes decoupages Easter baskets, birdhouses, papier-mache boxes,
candles and candle holders.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her items can be found at Brazos Craft Mall in Waco,
where she rents a small booth to sell her artwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just mostly do it for the fun,'' she said. ``It's fun taking
a magazine clipping or something from a napkin or wrapping paper
and making something someone would buy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Decoupage has been around since the 17th century, when the
French began using the technique to spruce up somewhat homely
furnishings, such as hat boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's decoupaging process isn't as complicated or
time-consuming as it was in the old days, said Holmes, who's been
creating various home crafts for about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still do it the old way with layers and layers of
finish and sanding between each layer so it would be real smooth,''
she said. ``But you probably wouldn't want to do that unless you
(were decoupaging) furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's decoupaging process basically involves cutting out
pictures and gluing them down with decoupage glue or another type
of sealer.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any item can be dressed up with decoupage, Holmes said _
glassware; bottles; any type of wood, metal or paper boxes; tea
pots; birdhouses; shelves, books; picture frames; flower pots, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Local craft and discount stores carry the necessary products for
decoupaging products _ decoupage glue and medium-bristled brushes.
And also items that encourage crafters to use their imaginations _
decoupage prints and papers, doilies, papier-mache boxes, pressed
flowers, foil kits to add foil accents, kits to add 3-D effects,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use your imagination and just about anything will work,''
Holmes said.

 &HT;    We pray for a bad vacation, Mike Kelly
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There 'til 9 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But it's how you win 85 percent of your games. There's only so
much genius in the world, and after that the guy who puts in 15
hours a day has the wall full of plaques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 140 degrees,'' Kelly was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to explain why he lasted less than an hour on the
streets of Nassau on the ship's first stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls went on and had a good time,'' he said. ``They
bought all the trinkets and stuff. I went back and read an
autobiography of Billy Graham. They had a big cooler full of iced
tea and the library was air-conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   A coach in his element.
</P>
<P>
   He was quite the sight on this cruise. He wore bracelets on both
wrists, plus patches behind both ears, plus he was on a steady diet
of Dramamine because, ``Whenever I'm on water, as soon as I lose
sight port playing cards, trying to figure out what to do with our
four free tickets, and then a bunch of people didn't show up, and
they didn't have to bump anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   And for his daughters, even worse _ Leonardo di Caprio wasn't on
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Tough world.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back on the job. It was too hot in Nassau and Key West,
but over the last couple of weeks at Welcome Stadium, where the
temperature on the AstroTurf has reached 136 at times, no big deal.
He could stand out there all day teaching football.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward he goes back to his office and watches films of
the practice. I'm serious. Two cameras sit atop the press box,
taping practice, and when we finished talking at 7 p.m., he was
going back to go watch those tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do without them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    PAX TV gets higher-than-expected ratings on its first day
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new PAX TV network officials were was in seventh heaven,
uplifted by strong overnight Nielsen ratings for the first day of
the network's programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great ratings. Great Day America. Great Day Bud,'' said Paxson
Communications Chairman Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson, playing off the name
of an original talk show PAX TV is airing.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's seventh TV network, which promises family friendly
programming without sex and violence, posted an average weighted
1.4 rating for prime-time programming in its markets measured by
Nielsen Media Research. Network executives have said they need to
average a 1 rating to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Palm Beach market, PAX TV drew a 2.4 rating for
prime-time programming, meaning that 14,244 homes with televisions
in this market were watching Paxson Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 1.4 is incredible,'' Paxson said.''It's a lot of people.''
Paxson said iIt's a mass audience that the network can deliver to
advertisers as well as introduce to the networks original
programming during the weekend and in the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point represents 1 percent of households with
television sets. Nationally, there are 99.4 million TV households
in the nation and 593,480 in the West Palm Beach market.
</P>
<P>
   While Paxson was elated, The numbers had Paxson staffers
psyched, but industry watchers cautioned against putting too much
weight on the initial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One media buyer said he didn't expect to look at the ratings for
a while. ``To watch the first day, the first week, even the first
month is probably not fair to them and more than a little premature
to be making judgments as to how well they're doing,'' said Allen
Banks, who oversees media buying for advertising agency Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight Nielsen ratings were collected in 31 markets in
which PAX TV broadcasts. A national sample was not available.
Paxson averaged the ratings in its markets, weighting each market
to reflect its number of TV households to arrive at a 1.4 rating
nationally. That compares to the national ratings for the week of
CBS, which were 6.9; ABC, 6.4; NBC, 7.3; FOX, 5.3; WB, 2.3 and UPN,
1.5, according to Nielsen spokeswoman Anne Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson did not release market specifics. But in the West Palm
Beach market, at 4 p.m., PAX TV aired Hogan Family, which drew an
average 0.7 rating. That went up against NBC's Oprah Winfrey, with
a 8.6 rating and ABC's Jerry Springer, with an average 4.5 rating.
UPN's rating was 0.6 in the time slot for Sweet Valley High.
</P>
<P>
   In prime time in the West Palm Beach market, PAX TV'sTouched by
an Angel reruns averaged a 2.2 rating; CBS's Cosby reruns received
7.8; NBC's Princess Diana special, 10.7; The Kickoff Classic
football game featuring the Florida State Seminoles on ABC scored a
7.8; Fox's Melrose Place took 8.2 and UPN's In the House took a
1.4.
</P>
<P>
   One media buyer said he didn't expect to look at the ratings for
a while. ``To watch the first day, the first week, even the first
month is probably not fair to them and more than a little premature
to be making judgments as to how well they're doing,'' said Allen
Banks, who oversees media buying for advertising agency Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson Communications owns, operates or is affiliated with 95
broadcast stations that can reach up to 76 million households with
television sets in the nation. Not all the stations are up and
operating yet. Paxson also has several deals with cable companies
to air its network where it has no broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's Elliott said the rating service is still determining
whether PAX TV meets all the criteria to be a full network.
Specifically it's looking at whether Paxson reaches 70 percent of
the TV households, she said. Paxson, however, said his network has
proved to Nielsen it does.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kuzio, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisers, called the
showing ``pretty impressive.'' His company has been forecasting an
average 0.7 rating for the year, a number Kuzio called
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how much of it is a `new-thing factor,' '' Kuzio
said, adding that he'll wait to see the ratings for a month or so
before reconsidering his forecast.

 &HT;    Senate poised to approve Texas' nuke dump deal
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate is expected to approve an agreement
allowing Maine and Vermont to ship nuclear waste to Texas, despite
last-minute lobbying by people who live near the proposed West
Texas dump site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're going to have some strong opposition (to the
waste agreement), but it's an uphill fight,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., the lead opponent of the agreement in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday on the U.S. Capitol grounds, where
he was surrounded by about 15 Texans holding posters protesting the
waste agreement, Wellstone said their fight has been hampered by a
lack of support from President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and
other members of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he has heard ``precious little'' from an
administration that ``says it's focused on environmental justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the president's and vice president's support,''
Wellstone said. ``We need for them to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor his staff had made a public statement about
the waste agreement as of Tuesday. But a White House official
speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press on
Tuesday that a veto is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's vote is the last legislative action needed to seal
the agreement, known as a compact, which will allow Maine and
Vermont to ship low-level radioactive waste _ including pieces of
dismantled nuclear power plants _ to Texas for long-term storage.
The two states would pay Texas $55 million. The House has already
approved the compact, which does not specify a site for storing the
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' two senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, support the compact. Both have said they're following
the wishes of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former Gov. Ann Richards
and the Texas Legislature. In a statement Tuesday, Hutchison also
noted that the compact has been approved by governors and state
lawmakers in Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the federal government has a mandate to
nullify a contract signed by three state governors and ratified by
their legislatures,'' Hutchison said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, said Tuesday that the ``Senate
should say 'no' to this final action to allow our state to become a
dumping ground for radioactive waste and say 'yes' to protecting
the citizens of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature has approved a site near Sierra Blanca in
Hudspeth County for the waste dump, but that plan became less
certain in early July when state examiners recommended that the
site be rejected because of concerns that the area's geology and
because the economic impact of the dump had not been adequately
addressed. Those two issues drove Tuesday's protest and lobbying
effort in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The geological study should include a look at what leakage from
the waste site might do to underground water supplies and the Rio
Grande, said state Rep. Norma Chavez, D-El Paso, and Sierra Blanca
resident Bill Addington _ two of the Texans who met Tuesday with
Senate staffers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a hanging offense to poison a man's well in
Texas,'' Addington said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact on Sierra Blanca, a mostly Hispanic
community about 90 miles southeast of El Paso, has stirred
Wellstone's passion against the compact. ``This isn't just a Texas
issue,'' he said Tuesday. ``This is a national civil rights
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's work against the waste agreement earned him honorary
Austin citizenship last October from the Austin City Council and
gratitude Tuesday from state Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair to dump on us (in Texas), and I thank Senator
Wellstone for serving as my senator,'' Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency in charge of developing the waste site, the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, has taken
issue with the examiners' report in a formal res

 &HT;    Stubbs likes familiar feeling of fast team
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Daniel Stubbs has a need for speed . . . from his
linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs, the Dolphins' veteran defensive end, has prospered most
when he's played on a defense that's terrorized running backs who
dared turn the corner. Stubbs was a staple on the legendary
University of Miami teams that chased down and pulverized
ballcarriers. And his best season in the NFL was when he started 15
games for the Cowboys, whose defense followed the Hurricanes'
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stubbs feels he's back on a football freeway, with no speed
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised how much speed we've got now,'' Stubbs said.
``Just like at UM and the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator to the Hurricanes of the mid '80s, the
Cowboys of the early '90s and the Dolphins of the late '90s is
coach Jimmy Johnson, who prefers speed over size.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggressive style has helped us and we've been able to
utilize our athletic talent and we'll be able to make more plays,''
Johnson said of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's relationship with Stubbs dates back to 1983, when
Johnson recruited Stubbs out of Red Bank (N.J.) Regional High
School. At the time, Stubbs was a linebacker. But those were the
years when Johnson would turn safeties into linebackers and
linebackers into defensive linemen to use their speed.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining All-America status at Miami, Stubbs has had a
checkered NFL career, playing for five teams in nine seasons, and
even being released by Johnson late in 1991, 19 months after he
acquired Stubbs in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But with Jason Taylor's injury and Stubbs' excitement over the
improved defense, he's hoping for a spark to his 33-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to start, you want to battle, but you don't want to
do it because somebody gets hurt,'' Stubbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs will line up for his first regular-season start in almost
two years Sunday at Indianapolis if Taylor's knee _ injured in last
Friday's pre-season finale _ does not heal in time.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs' 1997 season ended Aug. 31, when he tore a tendon in his
right knee. Before that, he had never missed an NFL game, a string
of 129 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bored and anxious to play,'' Stubbs said of the nine
months of rehabilitation. ``You want to see what you can do and
after mini-camps you (realize) the knee is not everything that you
thought and you're wondering when it will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   By training camp, Stubbs was fully recovered physically, but
started having doubts mentally. He watched as Johnson sifted
through his stable of defensive ends, giving most snaps to rookies
Kenny Mixon and Lorenzo Bromell, and Taylor, a second-year player.
He started hearing rumors about trades, and worst of all, his job
being in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to prove I can play,'' Stubbs said. ``And I got lumped
into the group that played last year. I wasn't part of the problem.
I played one game and I come back and (hear) I can't play against
the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove to myself and prove to the coaches that I
can still play and make plays in the backfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Taylor and Bromell (sprained left knee) were not injured
Friday, Stubbs' job appeared safe. Johnson enjoys the luxury of
having five ends _ Taylor, Mixon, Stubbs, Bromell and Trace
Armstrong _ and finally has a defense that brings back memories of
the glory days at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has the components and the parts he's been talking
about,'' Stubbs said. ``We're so aggressive in the secondary our
safeties can run and, boom, make a stop. People aren't going to get
around the corner like they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland, Harper visit camp: The Dolphins worked out wide
receivers Horace Copeland and Alvin Harper on Tuesday. Neither
player was signed and Johnson said he doesn't expect to add a
player to the active roster this week.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland played at the University of Miami and was released
Sunday by the Buccaneers after five seasons. He had 33 catches for
431 yards and one touchdown in 13 games last season. Harper, a
seven-year veteran, caught two passes for 65 yards for New Orleans
last season. He played for Johnson for three years in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Miami brought back defensive tackle Antoine Simpson
and signed Andy McCullough, placing both on the practice squad.
Simpson, a defensive tackle, was released last Tuesday. McCullough,
a wide receiver, was a seventh-round draft pick of the Saints this
year. . . . Guard Scott Shaw, the Dolphins' fifth-round pick who
was released last Tuesday, has found a home in Cincinnati, which
expects him to play this season.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS

</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the lifeboats from the Titanic that were
dropped off at the White Star Lines' New York dock by the
Carpathia? Are they still in a museum somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows exactly what happened to the 13 Titanic
lifeboats that were brought to New York by the first ship to reach
the survivors, said Scott Andrews of Titanic International, but
it's certain that none are now in any museum. The lifeboats taken
aboard by the Carpathia were hauled to the second floor of the New
York pier where they were kept until after hearings into the
Titanic's sinking were over, Andrews said. After that, it's not
known for sure where they ended up.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that they might have been used by White Star Line
on a Titanic sister ship, the Olympic, Andrews added. A photograph
taken after the 1912 disaster shows ``quite a few'' lifeboats in
the water next to the Olympic, and they may or may not have been
from the Titanic. The Olympic's stokers had gone on strike over the
issue of insufficient lifeboats, so in order to get the ship back
into service, extra lifeboats _ possibly some or all of those from
the Titanic _ had to be brought onboard. After the Titanic sank,
however, its name was removed from the lifeboats, so it would have
been impossible to identify them ever again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been collecting Princess Diana stamps from around the
world since her death. Does the U.S. Postal Service plan to issue a
commemorative for her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No such U.S. stamp is planned. The first of the Postal
Service's 12 guidelines for subject selection is the main reason,
according to Postal Service spokeswoman Sandra Harding in
Washington: ``It is a general policy that U.S. postage stamps
primarily will feature American or American-related subjects.'' And
another guideline specifies that no postal item will be issued
sooner than 10 years after the proposed subject's death. So even if
an exception is made to feature Diana, a British citizen, it
woundn't happen for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year at Mother Teresa's death it was reported that she
was one of only a few people in the world granted honorary U.S.
citizenship. Who were the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before Mother Teresa received the designation in 1996,
honorary U.S. citizenship had been conferred only three times
before: on British leader Winston Churchill; Swedish diplomat Raoul
Wallenberg, believed to have saved at least 20,000 Jews from the
Nazis; and Pennsylvania founder William Penn and his wife, Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was air conditioning invented? A recent letter to the
editor said that if Southerners gave up everything Yankee, they'd
have to give up air conditioning, because it was invented in the
North. I thought a Dr. Gorrie in Apalachicola, Fla., developed it
in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's difficult to pinpoint a ``first,'' because the concept
of trying to cool hot air has been around since ancient times, when
Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used wet mats to cool indoor air. In
1838, David Reid, an English scientist, provided the British House
of Commons with a system to ventilate and humidify the air, and in
the mid-1800s, John Gorrie, the doctor you mention, invented a
cold-air machine for hospital rooms. In 1897, Joseph McCreery of
Toledo, Ohio, received a patent for the type of spray now used in
air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   The forerunner of present air conditoning systems was developed
in 1902 by a Northerner, Willis Haviland Carrier of Buffalo, N.Y.,
for a Brooklyn printer trying to align color inks on paper. Perhaps
this is what the letter writer meant by saying ``Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of heat and humidity conditions, Southern textile mills,
such as the Chronicle Cotton Mill in Belmont, N.C., were among the
first users of his new system, starting about 1906. Carrier's ``dew
point control,'' an air conditioning unit based on the principle
that cooled air reaches saturation and loses moisture through
condensation, solved static electricity problems at the mills. The
first refrigeration system with centrifigual chillers made its
debut in 1924 at the J.L. Hudson Department Store in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that two Spanish climbers fell to their deaths on Mont
Blanc, bringing to 10 the number of climbers losing their lives on
that same mountain within a week's time. What happened to cause so
many deaths so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recent high-altitude rains have made the 15,750-foot
mountain, on the border of France and Italy, dangerously slick,
authorities in Chamonix, France, said. The most recent victims fell
several hundred yards on the icy northern approach to the peak a
few hours after they reached the summit. Several other climbers
have been ``gravely injured'' in falls in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Those of us observing low-fat diets have trained ourselves to
read nutrition labels. Why are they not required on breads and
certain other products prepared and sold in the deli sections of
grocery stores?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only processed foods made in large quantities are required to
have nutrition labeling, said Connie Crawley, nutrition and health
specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service. Anything
made locally in small volume is exempt.
</P>
<P>
   You can voice your concern to the deli or store manager, and if
enough people do so, the stores may put labels on these daily
items. But as Crawley observed, analyzing a food for its nutrition
content isn't cheap, and they may be reluctant to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CVS pharmacies seem to be popping up on everywhere lately.
Where did this company come from all of a sudden?
</P>
<P>
   A: CVS isn't new, but its recent growth has been dramatic. The
first CVS opened in 1963 in Lowell, Mass., under the name Consumer
Value Store. The merger of CVS and Peoples Drug in 1990 allowed CVS
to leap into major new markets, according to the company. On May
29, 1997, CVS Corp. completed its acquisition of Revco, making CVS
the largest drugstore chain in the United States based on store
count: nearly 4,000 properties in 24 states. And on March 31, 1998,
CVS expanded further when it completed its acquisiton of Arbor
Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, CVS expects to dispense about 12 percent of all
retail prescriptions in the United States, the company says. Based
in Woonsocket, R.I., CVS Corp. expects to have operating revenues
this year exceeding $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Bill Clinton ever a Boy Scout?
</P>
<P>
   A: Profiles of Clinton before the 1992 election reported that he
was a Boy Scout into high school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We always hear a lot about Andersonville, the Civil War
prison camp in South Georgia where many Northern soldiers died. I
understand a prisoner of war camp in Delaware was just as
notorious, but no one ever mentions that. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andersonville gained its reputation because as many as 33,000
Union prisoners at a time were crowded into a log stockade that
enclosed only 16 1/2 acres. As many as 13,000 men died there in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as you say, there were prisons in the North where
Confederate soldiers were confined in miserable conditions. At Fort
Delaware, on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River, up to 8,000
prisoners were held on a site so marshy and muddy that the
overcrowded barracks sank to the point of falling over. More than
300 prisoners died even before a smallpox epidemic broke out;
statistics after that weren't kept.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worst used by the Union were Alton Prison, in
Illinois, where severe overcrowding and bad sanitation produced a
smallpox epidemic that raged for weeks. It was estimated that
several thousand Confederates were buried on a nearby island in the
Mississippi River. At Camp Chase, near Columbus, Ohio, 10,000
Confederates were jammed into facilities intended for half that
many; prison laborers were forced to build improved barracks and
more secure fences for their own confinement. Elmira Prison in New
York was another disaster. By May 1865, it held 12,122 Confederate
prisoners on 40 acres. Accounts showed that hundreds of prisoners
developed scurvy and 2,917 prisoners died.
</P>
<P>
   Other Northern prisons included Ohio Penitentiary; Old Capitol
Prison in Washington, D.C.; Point Lookout (Md.), the largest prison
in the North; and Rock Island Prison in the Mississippi River
between Rock Island, Ill., and Davenport, Iowa. At war's end,
26,500 Southerners and 22,600 Northerners had died in prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a program about World War II on the History Channel, the
narrator kept referring to German U-boats. What does the U stand
for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Think of underwater. A U-boat was a German submarine, from
the German word Unterseeboot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard about a sugar substitute, Splenda, which I believe
was developed from sugar cane and is available in Canada. Do you
have any information about this product?
</P>
<P>
   A: Made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, sucralose (sold under the brand
name Splenda) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
April. Johnson &AMP; Johnson had applied for approval in 1987. Said to
be 600 times sweeter than sugar, the low-cal sweetener, which
indeed is made from sugar cane, has been available in Canada since
1991. Q: Could you explain the difference between probation and
parole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probation falls under the judicial branch of government.
Judges may impose a probated sentence in lieu of, or in addition
to, prison time, explained Scheree Lipscomb of the State Board of
Pardons and Parole. Let's say a person is convicted of a crime and
is sent to prison. When the prison term is completed, he (or she)
is released to the sentencing court jurisdiction to begin serving
probation. If the person violates probation terms, the judge can
revoke the probated sentence and send the person back to prison.
The parole board isn't involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system isn't involved in parole matters, Lipscomb
said. Parole deals with prison time. For certain types of offenses,
and adhering to rules requiring a minimum amount of time to be
served, the parole board can allow an inmate to serve a portion of
the prison time in the community. The board maintains authority
over the inmate until he reaches the expiration date of the time to
be served in prison. If he violates parole, the board returns him
to prison to continue serving the original sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If a person is serving a split sentence _ prison time followed
by probation _ he completes his parole time before being
transferred to probation supervision.
</P>
<P>
   There are 230,000 people on probation currently in Georgia,
including people guilty of misdemeanors who are under private
supervision, Lipscomb said, and just under 20,000 people on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the public be able to buy independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress on the investigation of President
Clinton, or if not the entire report, at least a summary of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire report probably never will be released to the
public, said Michelle Morgan of the House Judiciary Committee. One
reason: It would contain grand jury material. However, it's
possible that an executive summary may be released to the public,
she added. At this point, it's not certain when or if that will
occur, and there's no precedent, because an independent counsel has
never reported to Congress, Morgan said. If a summary is made
available to the media, you'll know about it.

 &HT;    Austin area keeps brainstorming on commuter rail
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- Lured by the prospect of a quick trip to San Antonio's
Riverwalk or a less stressful commute to work, about 50 Austin-area
residents sat down recently to start brainstorming about commuter
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has always been literally a car-driven state,'' said
Claudia Parker, who attended the meeting. ``There's just a need for
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the brainstorming session was to determine what
some of those alternatives were, and how a commuter rail line from
Georgetown to San Antonio might become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the second of three scheduled this week by a
team studying commuter rail feasibility. The team includes
representatives of the state Transportation Department, Austin-San
Antonio Corridor Council, Austin and San Antonio transit
authorities and metropolitan planning organizations, Bexar and
Travis counties and the cities of Austin and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The final meeting this week is at 6 p.m. today at the San Marcos
Activity Center, 501 E. Hopkins St. in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Business and community members along the Austin-San Antonio
corridor have long been discussing a proposal to run a commuter
train along the existing Union Pacific railroad tracks, which run
primarily in the MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) median in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Hackley of Carter &AMP; Burgess, the consultant team heading up
the study, said the Austin-San Antonio corridor will have a
population in 2020 of 4 million, twice the population of the region
in 1990. Traffic on Interstate 35 between the two cities has
increased at a higher rate. On an average day 200,000 vehicles
cross Town Lake on the interstate in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those attending Tuesday's meeting didn't need to be
convinced about the need. When participants broke into three groups
to discuss specific ideas about commuter rail, they pointed out
some of the benefits: faster travel, easy access to shopping,
tourism, better air quality, safety, improvements to the
environment, reduced stress and more time for travelers to do the
things they enjoy while commuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people read the paper or study while driving, but it'll
be safer on the train,'' said Pierre Riom.
</P>
<P>
   The groups also brainstormed over some of the biggest unanswered
questions about commuter rail, such as who would pay for it.
Participants suggested public-private partnerships, joint
development agreements, car and gas taxes, local economic
development sales taxes and I-35 tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Those suggestions will be incorporated into the commuter rail
feasibility study, which will be released in a draft by
Thanksgiving. An early ridership study will be ready in September.
Additional public meetings will also be held before the study is
complete.

 &HT;    Golfview, Florida dies amid townfolk mourning
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE AREA FORMERLY KNOWN AS GOLFVIEW, Fla. _ It can be argued
this place died a few years ago when most of its longtime residents
left or a few months ago when boarded-up houses first outnumbered
occupied ones.
</P>
<P>
   There was the symbolic kiss of death in July when the town's
20-foot concrete entrance arch was disassembled and carted off to
Yesteryear Village at the South Florida Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, the long demise of Golfview became final and
official.
</P>
<P>
   With the filing of some papers at the Palm Beach County
Courthouse, the tiny 61-year-old municipality ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a city or town has dissolved in Palm Beach
County and the first time a municipality has extinguished itself in
Florida since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Golfview, once a tree-shaded hamlet that about 150 people called
home, will be swallowed up by neighboring Palm Beach International
Airport, just as the golf course from which it derived its name was
obliterated during World War II by the Army airfield that was
PBIA's forerunner.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of Golfview's 63 houses were purchased for $15.9
million this year by Palm Beach County to provide 65 acres for
as-yet-unspecified airport expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the county acquired all the properties it needed _ the last
two houses aren't essential to its plans, the county says _
Golfview Town Clerk Cynthia Harmon signed a document last week
abolishing the town and revoking its charter.
</P>
<P>
   The document was filed at the courthouse Tuesday by Richard
Berryman, the town's final mayor. At 10:01 a.m., intake clerk
Gloria Johnson stamped the papers in, and Golfview was stamped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like death,'' Berryman philosophized afterward. ``You
grieve a little bit, then you kind of analyze and (ask) `Is it for
the best?' and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Golfview residents decided it was for the best 13 years
ago. Eyeing the problems and opportunities of living next to the
growing airport, a majority of homeowners banded together and
offered their properties for sale with a $35 million asking price.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to sell to a developer who would use the land for
an airport hotel or office park. But private buyers were
uninterested. The county eventually offered up to $19.5 million but
lowered the price when appraisals suggested the town wasn't worth
that much. A final $16.3 million figure was agreed upon in 1997,
and the county began closing sales with individual property owners
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout has cost $15.9 million so far because of the two
houses along Belvedere Road that didn't sell. A strip of businesses
along Military Trail wasn't part of the buyout, either. The last
two houses and the commercial properties became part of the
county's unincorporated area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the town's death certificate was being filed a few miles
away at the courthouse, wrecking crews were demolishing two more of
Golfview's old houses along Country Club Road Tuesday morning. A
little ways away, environmental specialist Bob Miro of J.J. Sosa
and Associates was overseeing the removal of asbestos from a house
on Bahia Lane in preparation for its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it was a nice community,'' Miro said, surveying the
substantial ranch houses around him.
</P>
<P>
   No more. As he looked at the overgrown lawns and boarded-up
homes and empty streets, Miro offered the same observation
countless other Golfview visitors have made in recent months. On
Tuesday, though, it was truer than ever: ``It looks like a ghost
town.''

   Q: House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt was quoted as saying
President Clinton was elected by a ``big majority.'' Did Clinton
actually receive a majority of the popular vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Clinton obviously received more votes in 1992 than George
Bush, and more in 1996 than Bob Dole, but in neither presidential
election did Clinton receive more than 50 percent. So in fact he
didn't receive a ``majority,'' which is defined as ``more than half
the total number.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the particulars of the major party candidates in the
two elections:
</P>
<P>
   1992: Clinton/Al Gore, 44,908,233 votes (43 percent); Bush/Dan
Quayle, 39,102,282 (37.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   1996: Clinton/Gore, 45,628,667 (49.2 percent); Dole/Jack Kemp,
37,869,435 (40.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, by the way, was not the first president who failed to
receive a majority of the popular vote. He was the 16th in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hurricane Opal is often overlooked in reports of hurricane
damage, but didn't it cause a great deal of destruction in the
Southeast?
</P>
<P>
   A: Opal, which came ashore east of Pensacola, Fla., on Oct. 4,
1995, was indeed destructive, slamming along Florida's beaches for
120 miles before moving northward into Georgia. It caused at least
$1.8 billion in damage to insured property in Florida alone. Opal
killed at least 19 people in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that not all the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish.
For example, I understand that many Jehovahs Witnesses were killed
by the Nazis, too. Can you list the numbers, or approximate
numbers, of victims by category?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources differ considerably. There's no ``absolute, knowable
single set of statistics,'' said Mary Ann Leonard, a librarian at
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The best
information, she told Q&AMP;A, comes from a report compiled in 1996 by
Sybil Milton, former senior historian at the museum. Rather than
dealing with specifics, Milton's report lists ranges of victims to
take into account the differing numbers in other sources, Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 11 million people who died during the
Holocaust, Jewish victims were believed to number up to 6 million.
Soviet prisoners of war were as many as 2.3 million. More than 1
million Polish victims were identified. Estimates of other
categories: Gypsies, 250,000 to 500,000; mentally or phsyically
disabled, 200,000 to 250,000; Jehovahs Witnesses, about 10,000
imprisoned, of which about 2,500 died in prison camps; and
homosexuals, 5,000 to 12,000 arrested, with the mortality rate
unknown but believed to be at least 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims, with no specific numbers or ranges assigned,
included people identified by Nazis as communists, socialists,
trade unionists, Free Masons and various political and religious
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Internet, the Holocaust Memorial
Museum's site _ www.ushmm.org _ is a valuable resource.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We continue to see photos of President Clinton and his dog,
Buddy. What happened to his cat, Socks? Does Socks still live at
the White House?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Socks ``sure is a resident'' of the White House, a
spokeswoman at the first lady's press office told Q&AMP;A. Although
Buddy got to go on the Clinton family's recent Martha's Vineyard
getaway, the first feline didn't. He stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Socks, by the way, shouldn't be called the president's cat; he
belongs to Chelsea. Both the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
are said to be allergic to cats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can people, including members of the media, stay in areas
in the path of a hurricane when a mandatory evacuation has been
ordered?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no general rule applying to every area and every
case, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Decisions on evacuations _ and even the definition of what
``mandatory'' means _ are up to local authorities in affected
areas, and can vary from county to county, even from sheriff to
sheriff, a FEMA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As to news media representatives remaining in the path of a
storm, a FEMA spokeswoman said local authorities in affected areas
probably consider that the benefit of getting information out to
the public outweighs any potential risk to reporters and camera
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Ronald Reagan had been divorced before he became
president, but isn't it true that Gerald Ford also was divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ford's only marriage was on Oct. 15, 1948, to Elizabeth
Bloomer Warren, said Donna Lehman of the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Mich. Elizabeth Warren, known as Betty, was a
35-year-old divorcee, which may explain the confusion. Her first
husband was William Warren, a furniture salesman in Grand Rapids,
Mich. They were married in 1942, divorced in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several times that there may be some problems with
getting water and other necessary items in the future because of
computer and other problems, including Y2K on Dec. 31, 1999. I want
to store enough water to last six months. What is the proper way to
do this, and what type containers should I use?
</P>
<P>
   A: To store water for long periods, clean glass or plastic
food-grade containers are recommended. For the best taste, use
glass. The water should be boiled for 10 minutes and stored at room
temperature in a dark place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A three-judge federal panel in Washington has ruled that the
Census Bureau's plan for statistical sampling violates 1957 and
1976 laws governing the census. Will you explain what statistical
sampling is, and how it works?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this case, statistical sampling would be something like a
public opinion poll. It would supplement, but not replace,
traditional head counting, which is accomplished with forms mailed
to residential addresses. Opponents of statistical sampling point
to the Constitution, which requires the federal government to
conduct an ``actual enumeration'' every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under statistical sampling, the Census Bureau would employ three
sets of samples. In the first, it would send counters to one in 10
of the 6 million residential addresses said by the Postal Service
to be vacant. Normally, census forms are not sent to those
addresses, but studies have shown that at least 11 percent of the
homes said to be empty were, in fact, occupied. After the counters
checked these presumably vacant residences, it would use the number
of people actually living in them to estimate the population in
other housing units nationwide that were thought to be vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also would check a proportion of residences
from which census forms had not been returned. And it would conduct
a random nationwide sample to check for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about storms in the Pacific. What is the
hurricane or typhoon season there? Do storms ever cause problems
between Hawaii and California or Baja California?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tropical cyclone season in the western Pacific is never
quite over, but varies greatly in intensity. Every year, conditions
east of the Philippines send a score of violent storms howling
toward Asia, but it is worse from June through October. Southwest
of Mexico, eastern Pacific storms develop during the spring and
summer. Most die at sea as they move over colder ocean waters, but
there are destructive exceptions when storms occasionally curve
back toward Mexico. It's not the norm, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a California columnist who
supposedly was fired for writing, the day after President Richard
Nixon died, that he was a ``wretched, wretched man''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident involved Matt Coker of the Daily Pilot in Orange
County, Calif., who minced no words after Nixon died. In a column
the day before Nixon's funeral, Coker called the former president
``a paranoid liar who did irreparable harm to these United States .
. . these same media that helped facilitate his downfall are now
giving teary-eyed eulogies to this wretched, wretched man. . . .
Goodbye and good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   After hundreds of readers complained and some canceled their
subscriptions, the Daily Pilot apologized and printed a front-page
item criticizing Coker's view. Editor William Lobdell, who had
approved the Nixon column, said: ``We try not to be mean-spirited
and vicious in our columns. I try to bend over backwards to let a
columnist have his say. But the minute I saw it in print, I knew it
was a mistake.'' Coker no longer is writing a column, but at last
report remained on the staff as arts editor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about the E. coli outbreak listed safety
tips for avoiding this bacteria. One was to drink carbonated
bottled water when traveling in areas where the water quality is
uncertain. Why is it important that the water is carbonated?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not because carbonation itself makes the water better
for you, according to Connie Crawley, nutrition and health
specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service. The only
reason it's recommended is that if you ask for bottled water in
some areas of the world, you may get a previously opened bottle
that has been refilled with tap water _ exactly what you're trying
to avoiod. If you ask for carbonated water, and open the bottle
yourself, you can tell by the fizz that it hasn't been tampered
with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible for a president to serve two consecutive
terms, then be out for a term, and then return for another two
terms?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's possible for a person to serve for more than two
terms only if one succeeds to the office of president and serves
less than two years of the departed president's four-year term,
then is elected two times on one's own. But serving two terms, then
staying out for a round or two, and trying again, is not permitted
under the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which reads: ``No
person shall be elected to the office of president more than twice,
and no person who has held the office of president, or acted as
president for more than two years of a term to which some other
person was elected president, shall be elected to the office of the
president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it known why the suspected Islamic terrorist financier
Osama bin Laden is so anti-American? When the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, both he and the United States supported the
mujahedeen. Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that throughout the 1980s, the United States and
bin Laden were on the same side against the now-collapsed Soviet
state, but bin Laden made no secret that he saw secular, powerful
Washington as an infidel just as much as Moscow. However, his first
priority was Moscow, which invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to
prop up a communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of religious edicts faxed to the outside world from
his suspected hideout in Afghanistan, bin Laden has laid out his
case against the United States: Its soldiers protecting oil in his
homeland, Saudi Arabia, are desecrating Muslim holy sites with
their very presence; its power has emasculated Arab countries,
turning them into client states; and its friend is Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In February, bin Laden helped form the World Islamic Front for
Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, a coalition that brought together
two Egyptian militant groups, two Pakistani groups and a
Bangladeshi group. ``We _ with God's help _ call on every Muslim
who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's
order to kill Americans and plunder their money wherever and
whenever they find it,'' read one of the group's statements.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the lifeboats from the Titanic that were
dropped off at the White Star Lines' New York dock by the
Carpathia? Are they still in a museum somewhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one knows exactly what happened to the 13 Titanic
lifeboats that were brought to New York by the first ship to reach
the survivors, said Scott Andrews of Titanic International, but
it's certain that none are now in any museum. The lifeboats taken
aboard by the Carpathia were hauled to the second floor of the New
York pier where they were kept until after hearings into the
Titanic's sinking were over, Andrews said. After that, it's not
known for sure where they ended up.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that they might have been used by White Star Line
on a Titanic sister ship, the Olympic, Andrews added. A photograph
taken after the 1912 disaster shows `quite a few'' lifeboats in
the water next to the Olympic, and they may or may not have been
from the Titanic. The Olympic's stokers had gone on strike over the
issue of insufficient lifeboats, so in order to get the ship back
into service, extra lifeboats _ possibly some or all of those from
the Titanic _ had to be brought onboard. After the Titanic sank,
however, its name was removed from the lifeboats, so it would have
been impossible to identify them ever again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been collecting Princess Diana stamps from around the
world since her death. Does the U.S. Postal Service plan to issue a
commemorative for her?
</P>
<P>
   A: No such U.S. stamp is planned. The first of the Postal
Service's 12 guidelines for subject selection is the main reason,
according to Postal Service spokeswoman Sandra Harding in
Washington: ``It is a general policy that U.S. postage stamps
primarily will feature American or American-related subjects.'' And
another guideline specifies that no postal item will be issued
sooner than 10 years after the proposed subject's death. So even if
an exception is made to feature Diana, a British citizen, it
woundn't happen for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year at Mother Teresa's death it was reported that she
was one of only a few people in the world granted honorary U.S.
citizenship. Who were the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before Mother Teresa received the designation in 1996,
honorary U.S. citizenship had been conferred only three times
before: on British leader Winston Churchill; Swedish diplomat Raoul
Wallenberg, believed to have saved at least 20,000 Jews from the
Nazis; and Pennsylvania founder William Penn and his wife, Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was air conditioning invented? A recent letter to the
editor said that if Southerners gave up everything Yankee, they'd
have to give up air conditioning, because it was invented in the
North. I thought a Dr. Gorrie in Apalachicola, Fla., developed it
in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's difficult to pinpoint a ``first,'' because the concept
of trying to cool hot air has been around since ancient times, when
Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used wet mats to cool indoor air. In
1838, David Reid, an English scientist, provided the British House
of Commons with a system to ventilate and humidify the air, and in
the mid-1800s, John Gorrie, the doctor you mention, invented a
cold-air machine for hospital rooms. In 1897, Joseph McCreery of
Toledo, Ohio, received a patent for the type of spray now used in
air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   The forerunner of present air conditoning systems was developed
in 1902 by a Northerner, Willis Haviland Carrier of Buffalo, N.Y.,
for a Brooklyn printer trying to align color inks on paper. Perhaps
this is what the letter writer meant by saying ``Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of heat and humidity conditions, Southern textile mills,
such as the Chronicle Cotton Mill in Belmont, N.C., were among the
first users of his new system, starting about 1906. Carrier's ``dew
point control,'' an air conditioning unit based on the principle
that cooled air reaches saturation and loses moisture through
condensation, solved static electricity problems at the mills. The
first refrigeration system with centrifigual chillers made its
debut in 1924 at the J.L. Hudson Department Store in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that two Spanish climbers fell to their deaths on Mont
Blanc, bringing to 10 the number of climbers losing their lives on
that same mountain within a week's time. What happened to cause so
many deaths so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recent high-altitude rains have made the 15,750-foot
mountain, on the border of France and Italy, dangerously slick,
authorities in Chamonix, France, said. The most recent victims fell
several hundred yards on the icy northern approach to the peak a
few hours after they reached the summit. Several other climbers
have been ``gravely injured'' in falls in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Those of us observing low-fat diets have trained ourselves to
read nutrition labels. Why are they not required on breads and
certain other products prepared and sold in the deli sections of
grocery stores?
</P>
<P>
   A: Only processed foods made in large quantities are required to
have nutrition labeling, said Connie Crawley, nutrition and health
specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service. Anything
made locally in small volume is exempt.
</P>
<P>
   You can voice your concern to the deli or store manager, and if
enough people do so, the stores may put labels on these daily
items. But as Crawley observed, analyzing a food for its nutrition
content isn't cheap, and they may be reluctant to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: CVS pharmacies seem to be popping up on everywhere lately.
Where did this company come from all of a sudden?
</P>
<P>
   A: CVS isn't new, but its recent growth has been dramatic. The
first CVS opened in 1963 in Lowell, Mass., under the name Consumer
Value Store. The merger of CVS and Peoples Drug in 1990 allowed CVS
to leap into major new markets, according to the company. On May
29, 1997, CVS Corp. completed its acquisition of Revco, making CVS
the largest drugstore chain in the United States based on store
count: nearly 4,000 properties in 24 states. And on March 31, 1998,
CVS expanded further when it completed its acquisiton of Arbor
Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, CVS expects to dispense about 12 percent of all
retail prescriptions in the United States, the company says. Based
in Woonsocket, R.I., CVS Corp. expects to have operating revenues
this year exceeding $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was Bill Clinton ever a Boy Scout?
</P>
<P>
   A: Profiles of Clinton before the 1992 election reported that he
was a Boy Scout into high school.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We always hear a lot about Andersonville, the Civil War
prison camp in South Georgia where many Northern soldiers died. I
understand a prisoner of war camp in Delaware was just as
notorious, but no one ever mentions that. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andersonville gained its reputation because as many as 33,000
Union prisoners at a time were crowded into a log stockade that
enclosed only 16 1/2 acres. As many as 13,000 men died there in
seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as you say, there were prisons in the North where
Confederate soldiers were confined in miserable conditions. At Fort
Delaware, on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River, up to 8,000
prisoners were held on a site so marshy and muddy that the
overcrowded barracks sank to the point of falling over. More than
300 prisoners died even before a smallpox epidemic broke out;
statistics after that weren't kept.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worst used by the Union were Alton Prison, in
Illinois, where severe overcrowding and bad sanitation produced a
smallpox epidemic that raged for weeks. It was estimated that
several thousand Confederates were buried on a nearby island in the
Mississippi River. At Camp Chase, near Columbus, Ohio, 10,000
Confederates were jammed into facilities intended for half that
many; prison laborers were forced to build improved barracks and
more secure fences for their own confinement. Elmira Prison in New
York was another disaster. By May 1865, it held 12,122 Confederate
prisoners on 40 acres. Accounts showed that hundreds of prisoners
developed scurvy and 2,917 prisoners died.
</P>
<P>
   Other Northern prisons included Ohio Penitentiary; Old Capitol
Prison in Washington, D.C.; Point Lookout (Md.), the largest prison
in the North; and Rock Island Prison in the Mississippi River
between Rock Island, Ill., and Davenport, Iowa. At war's end,
26,500 Southerners and 22,600 Northerners had died in prison camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a program about World War II on the History Channel, the
narrator kept referring to German U-boats. What does the U stand
for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Think of underwater. A U-boat was a German submarine, from
the German word Unterseeboot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard about a sugar substitute, Splenda, which I believe
was developed from sugar cane and is available in Canada. Do you
have any information about this product?
</P>
<P>
   A: Made by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, sucralose (sold under the brand
name Splenda) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
April. Johnson &AMP; Johnson had applied for approval in 1987. Said to
be 600 times sweeter than sugar, the low-cal sweetener, which
indeed is made from sugar cane, has been available in Canada since
1991. Q: Could you explain the difference between probation and
parole?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probation falls under the judicial branch of government.
Judges may impose a probated sentence in lieu of, or in addition
to, prison time, explained Scheree Lipscomb of the State Board of
Pardons and Parole. Let's say a person is convicted of a crime and
is sent to prison. When the prison term is completed, he (or she)
is released to the sentencing court jurisdiction to begin serving
probation. If the person violates probation terms, the judge can
revoke the probated sentence and send the person back to prison.
The parole board isn't involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system isn't involved in parole matters, Lipscomb
said. Parole deals with prison time. For certain types of offenses,
and adhering to rules requiring a minimum amount of time to be
served, the parole board can allow an inmate to serve a portion of
the prison time in the community. The board maintains authority
over the inmate until he reaches the expiration date of the time to
be served in prison. If he violates parole, the board returns him
to prison to continue serving the original sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If a person is serving a split sentence _ prison time followed
by probation _ he completes his parole time before being
transferred to probation supervision.
</P>
<P>
   There are 230,000 people on probation currently in Georgia,
including people guilty of misdemeanors who are under private
supervision, Lipscomb said, and just under 20,000 people on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the public be able to buy independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress on the investigation of President
Clinton, or if not the entire report, at least a summary of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The entire report probably never will be released to the
public, said Michelle Morgan of the House Judiciary Committee. One
reason: It would contain grand jury material. However, it's
possible that an executive summary may be released to the public,
she added. At this point, it's not certain when or if that will
occur, and there's no precedent, because an independent counsel has
never reported to Congress, Morgan said. If a summary is made
available to the media, you'll know about it.

<P>
   (UNDATED: Q: Will the public be able to buy independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on the investigation of
President Clinton, or if not the entire report, at least a summary
of it?)
</P>
<P>
   Q: House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt was quoted as saying
President Clinton was elected by a ``big majority.'' Did Clinton
actually receive a majority of the popular vote?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Clinton obviously received more votes in 1992 than George
Bush, and more in 1996 than Bob Dole, but in neither presidential
election did Clinton receive more than 50 percent. So in fact he
didn't receive a ``majority,'' which is defined as ``more than half

</P>
<P>
   Here are the particulars of the major party candidates in the
two elections:
</P>
<P>
   1992: Clinton/Al Gore, 44,908,233 votes (43 percent); Bush/Dan
Quayle, 39,102,282 (37.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   1996: Clinton/Gore, 45,628,667 (49.2 percent); Dole/Jack Kemp,
37,869,435 (40.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, by the way, was not the first president who failed to
receive a majority of the popular vote. He was the 16th in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Hurricane Opal is often overlooked in reports of hurricane
damage, but didn't it cause a great deal of destruction in the
Southeast?
</P>
<P>
   A: Opal, which came ashore east of Pensacola, Fla., on Oct. 4,
1995, was indeed destructive, slamming along Florida's beaches for
120 miles before moving northward into Georgia. It caused at least
$1.8 billion in damage to insured property in Florida alone. Opal
killed at least 19 people in Florida, Georgia, Alabama and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that not all the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish.
For example, I understand that many Jehovahs Witnesses were killed
by the Nazis, too. Can you list the numbers, or approximate
numbers, of victims by category?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources differ considerably. There's no ``absolute, knowable
single set of statistics,'' said Mary Ann Leonard, a librarian at
the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The best
information, she told Q&AMP;A, comes from a report compiled in 1996 by
Sybil Milton, former senior historian at the museum. Rather than
dealing with specifics, Milton's report lists ranges of victims to
take into account the differing numbers in other sources, Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 11 million people who died during the
Holocaust, Jewish victims were believed to number up to 6 million.
Soviet prisoners of war were as many as 2.3 million. More than 1
million Polish victims were identified. Estimates of other
categories: Gypsies, 250,000 to 500,000; mentally or phsyically
disabled, 200,000 to 250,000; Jehovahs Witnesses, about 10,000
imprisoned, of which about 2,500 died in prison camps; and
homosexuals, 5,000 to 12,000 arrested, with the mortality rate
unknown but believed to be at least 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims, with no specific numbers or ranges assigned,
included people identified by Nazis as communists, socialists,
trade unionists, Free Masons and various political and religious
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   If you have access to the Internet, the Holocaust Memorial
Museum's site _ www.ushmm.org _ is a valuable resource.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We continue to see photos of President Clinton and his dog,
Buddy. What happened to his cat, Socks? Does Socks still live at
the White House?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, Socks ``sure is a resident'' of the White House, a
spokeswoman at the first lady's press office told Q&AMP;A. Although
Buddy got to go on the Clinton family's recent Martha's Vineyard
getaway, the first feline didn't. He stayed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Socks, by the way, shouldn't be called the president's cat; he
belongs to Chelsea. Both the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
are said to be allergic to cats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can people, including members of the media, stay in areas
in the path of a hurricane when a mandatory evacuation has been
ordered?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no general rule applying to every area and every
case, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Decisions on evacuations _ and even the definition of what
``mandatory'' means _ are up to local authorities in affected
areas, and can vary from county to county, even from sheriff to
sheriff, a FEMA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As to news media representatives remaining in the path of a
storm, a FEMA spokeswoman said local authorities in affected areas
probably consider that the benefit of getting information out to
the public outweighs any potential risk to reporters and camera
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know Ronald Reagan had been divorced before he became
president, but isn't it true that Gerald Ford also was divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ford's only marriage was on Oct. 15, 1948, to Elizabeth
Bloomer Warren, said Donna Lehman of the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Mich. Elizabeth Warren, known as Betty, was a
35-year-old divorcee, which may explain the confusion. Her first
husband was William Warren, a furniture salesman in Grand Rapids,
Mich. They were married in 1942, divorced in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read several times that there may be some problems with
getting water and other necessary items in the future because of
computer and other problems, including Y2K on Dec. 31, 1999. I want
to store enough water to last six months. What is the proper way to
do this, and what type containers should I use?
</P>
<P>
   A: To store water for long periods, clean glass or plastic
food-grade containers are recommended. For the best taste, use
glass. The water should be boiled for 10 minutes and stored at room
temperature in a dark place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A three-judge federal panel in Washington has ruled that the
Census Bureau's plan for statistical sampling violates 1957 and
1976 laws governing the census. Will you explain what statistical
sampling is, and how it works?
</P>
<P>
   A: In this case, statistical sampling would be something like a
public opinion poll. It would supplement, but not replace,
traditional head counting, which is accomplished with forms mailed
to residential addresses. Opponents of statistical sampling point
to the Constitution, which requires the federal government to
conduct an ``actual enumeration'' every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under statistical sampling, the Census Bureau would employ three
sets of samples. In the first, it would send counters to one in 10
of the 6 million residential addresses said by the Postal Service
to be vacant. Normally, census forms are not sent to those
addresses, but studies have shown that at least 11 percent of the
homes said to be empty were, in fact, occupied. After the counters
checked these presumably vacant residences, it would use the number
of people actually living in them to estimate the population in
other housing units nationwide that were thought to be vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also would check a proportion of residences
from which census forms had not been returned. And it would conduct
a random nationwide sample to check for accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about storms in the Pacific. What is the
hurricane or typhoon season there? Do storms ever cause problems
between Hawaii and California or Baja California?
</P>
<P>
   A: The tropical cyclone season in the western Pacific is never
quite over, but varies greatly in intensity. Every year, conditions
east of the Philippines send a score of violent storms howling
toward Asia, but it is worse from June through October. Southwest
of Mexico, eastern Pacific storms develop during the spring and
summer. Most die at sea as they move over colder ocean waters, but
there are destructive exceptions when storms occasionally curve
back toward Mexico. It's not the norm, though.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a California columnist who
supposedly was fired for writing, the day after President Richard
Nixon died, that he was a ``wretched, wretched man''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The incident involved Matt Coker of the Daily Pilot in Orange
County, Calif., who minced no words after Nixon died. In a column
the day before Nixon's funeral, Coker called the former president
``a paranoid liar who did irreparable harm to these United States .
. . these same media that helped facilitate his downfall are now
giving teary-eyed eulogies to this wretched, wretched man. . . .
Goodbye and good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   After hundreds of readers complained and some canceled their
subscriptions, the Daily Pilot apologized and printed a front-page
item criticizing Coker's view. Editor William Lobdell, who had
approved the Nixon column, said: ``We try not to be mean-spirited
and vicious in our columns. I try to bend over backwards to let a
columnist have his say. But the minute I saw it in print, I knew it
was a mistake.'' Coker no longer is writing a column, but at last
report remained on the staff as arts editor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about the E. coli outbreak listed safety
tips for avoiding this bacteria. One was to drink carbonated
bottled water when traveling in areas where the water quality is
uncertain. Why is it important that the water is carbonated?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not because carbonation itself makes the water better
for you, according to Connie Crawley, nutrition and health
specialist at the University of Georgia Extension Service. The only
reason it's recommended is that if you ask for bottled water in
some areas of the world, you may get a previously opened bottle
that has been refilled with tap water _ exactly what you're trying
to avoiod. If you ask for carbonated water, and open the bottle
yourself, you can tell by the fizz that it hasn't been tampered
with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible for a president to serve two consecutive
terms, then be out for a term, and then return for another two
terms?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's possible for a person to serve for more than two
terms only if one succeeds to the office of president and serves
less than two years of the departed president's four-year term,
then is elected two times on one's own. But serving two terms, then
staying out for a round or two, and trying again, is not permitted
under the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which reads: ``No
person shall be elected to the office of president more than twice,
and no person who has held the office of president, or acted as
president for more than two years of a term to which some other
person was elected president, shall be elected to the office of the
president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it known why the suspected Islamic terrorist financier
Osama bin Laden is so anti-American? When the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan, both he and the United States supported the
mujahedeen. Why the change?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true that throughout the 1980s, the United States and
bin Laden were on the same side against the now-collapsed Soviet
state, but bin Laden made no secret that he saw secular, powerful
Washington as an infidel just as much as Moscow. However, his first
priority was Moscow, which invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to
prop up a communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of religious edicts faxed to the outside world from
his suspected hideout in Afghanistan, bin Laden has laid out his
case against the United States: Its soldiers protecting oil in his
homeland, Saudi Arabia, are desecrating Muslim holy sites with
their very presence; its power has emasculated Arab countries,
turning them into client states; and its friend is Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In February, bin Laden helped form the World Islamic Front for
Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, a coalition that brought together
two Egyptian militant groups, two Pakistani groups and a
Bangladeshi group. ``We _ with God's help _ call on every Muslim
who believes in God and wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's
order to kill Americans and plunder their money wherever and
whenever they find it,'' read one of the group's statements.

<P>
   1. HOW MUCH OF POLITICS IS ENTERTAINMENT? Have we reached the
point where the line between entertainment and news is blurring?
Like entertainment, politics is increasingly part of the
easy-listening background music of the time. More and more,
politicians play to the camera. There's nothing entertaining about
Bill Clinton's plight since the Monica Lewinsky story broke in
January - and yet the entire spectacle has more in common with mass
entertainment than with serious politics. By David M. Shribman.
From The Boston Globe Magazine. 2,500 words. 2. ASHLEY JUDD Ashley
Judd has grown up now and is a movie star. It wasn't always that
way. In this interview she recalls her life before she hit the big
time in Hollywood with a number of films, including ``Kiss the
Girls'' (1997.) Judd's star power shines through. The director of
her new film ``Simon Birch'' marvels that she is ``vivacious,
strong and sexy,'' and Interview magazine has called her ``a young
Elizabeth Taylor.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo. 3.
CINDY CRAWFORD GRABS ATTENTION WITH SPECIAL ON SEX In the first
result of a three-year development deal she recently signed with
ABC, supermodel Cindy Crawford is going on TV for an hour-long
special program to talk about .... sex. ``I'm not a journalist or a
sex expert, but I'm curious about sex,'' Crawford says. In this
interview she says she would act in movies again only under the
right circumstances, after the failure of her debut ``Fair Game''
(1995.) The 32-year-old cover girl (ancient in modeling circles)
does worry about getting old and is already obsessing that her
knees are starting to droop ... By Ian Spelling. 1,400 words +
photo. 4. SPIELBERG BASHES INTELLECTUALS Steven Spielberg's film
``Saving Private Ryan'' has one false and creepy note, writes
Nicholas Lemann. From SLATE. 500 words. 5. FOR MATT DAMON, FAME
MEANS PROTECTING HIS PRIVATE LIFE Matt Damon is riding high at the
box office with the success of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' His latest
film is ``Rounders,'' about card sharks. But now that he is truly a
star, he has learned the hard way to keep his private life low key.
In this interview Damon discusses the new movie as well as his
turnabout on private topics - after he told Oprah Winfrey about his
break up with actress Minnie Driver. He also talks about the
lengths to which he goes in acting, including Robert De Niro-like
physical changes. In Damon's case, he goes on diets for some of his
roles, once losing 18 kilos. By Jeanne Wolf. (N/A England.) 1,400
words + photo. (Cartoon of Matt Damon by Vance Lehmkul also
available.) 6. ROSEANNE JOINS THE RANKS OF TV TALK SHOW HOSTS Watch
out Oprah! Roseanne is coming to host talk-show television. When
last heard of, she had just left TV with a bang, abandoning her hit
sitcom ``Roseanne'' with a few last potshots at ABC, people who
worked with her and Hollywood in general. Now with ``The Roseanne
Show'' she is claiming to be the perfect talk show host : ``I've
got five kids by three different men .... I came from a trailer
park ...''. If the show is a hit, she can expect to earn around $50
million a year. By David Kronke. From TV Guide. 1,400 words + photo
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
NOTES ON THE NON-CRITICS Reviewers have a stake in keeping up the
pretence that most films are worth reviewing, writes Jacob
Weisberg. Were they to acknowledge that 95 per cent of what comes
out of Hollywood is rubbish, there wouldn't be much left for most
of them to do. Critics should address the larger question of why
Hollywood thinks so little of today's film audience. From Slate.
1,000 words. 8. PRINCESS DIANA : FASHION STATEMENTS James Fallon
reports on a new book ('Diana : Her Life in Fashion' by Georgina
Howell) on how designers perceived Princess Diana. ``Princess Diana
absolutely was not a fashion leader,'' Howell says, ``but she used
fashion as a language to get her message across to her public, and
I believe it made her one of the great communicators of the
century.'' From Women's Wear Daily. 700 words. 9. LEELEE SOBIESKI :
TEEN ANGEL She's worked with Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Stanley
Kubrick, but Leelee Sobieski is still a wide-eyed 16-year old. She
is in the latest Merchant Ivory production, ``A Soldier's Daughter
Never Cries,'' playing an American girl who comes of age in Paris
and the U.S. in the '60s and '70s. Interview by Julie L. Belcove.
From W Magazine. 1,500 words + photo.

<P>
   STOX-RETIREMENT (San Francisco) _ By the size of the headlines

   GRAFFITI-CAR (Albany, N.Y.) _ Tom Mosquera, an aspiring

through bumper stickers a little farther down the road. With a

   BUTTERFLY-EXTINCTION (Albany, N.Y.) _ The Karner blue butterfly

</P>
<P>
   TUSCANY (Volpaia Italy) _ Lightning flickered across the Tuscan
sky. Thunder crackled and boomed off medieval stone towers. As
heavy drops spattered the piazza, we dashed across rain-slick
cobblestones to the sanctuary of the village's only restaurant. It
was one of the many good fortunes we encountered walking through
the Chianti hills, through vineyards full of plumping grapes and
dark forests sheltering wild boar. By JOHN FLINN.

   MINT (Albany, N.Y.) _ This summer I gave in to the mint
dominating our herb garden. Instead of cursing the aggressive

mint, one sprig at a time. The results have exceeded expectations.

the Dow Jones had bounced back from its big drop. ``That explains

observed. By ROB MORSE.

 &HT;    HOW I SPENT MY BALTIC VACATION: Estonia beats Russia, hands down
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia _ I'm like most Americans traveling in foreign
countries. I recognize only two languages: English and gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the words on the pocket of the Estonian border
guard's uniform took the form of a warm welcome, especially after
traveling in Russia:
</P>
<P>
   ``Border Guard,'' it said _ in English!
</P>
<P>
   He even looked rather like an American, tall and handsome in a
sort of Clint Eastwoodiness fashion, and not at all Slavic.
</P>
<P>
   I would have thought otherwise of the people of the Baltics _
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with Russia bordering to the east
and Poland to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Estonians are of Finnish heritage. Latvians and
Lithuanians, closer cousins in language and tradition, are of
German lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Tallinn, Estonia's capital, on the northern edge of the Baltic
Sea, is only 30 minutes by air from Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have to look twice to find the Baltic States on
the map. Often we confuse them with the Balkans _ Serbia, Croatia
and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What all I didn't know until I arrived:
</P>
<P>
   _ The people call themselves Balts.
</P>
<P>
   _ The tradition of Christmas trees may have originated here, as
early as the 1500s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Christian religion is prevalent. You'll find Lutheran,
Orthodox, Baptist, Methodist and Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Estonian currency is the Kroon, valued at about 14 to the
U.S. dollar. Prices are reasonable. A first-class hotel room in
Tallinn is about $100 a night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old Estonian superstition: If you eat in the dark, your
children might grow up to be thieves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Geographically, Estonia is about the size of Louisiana, 45,000
square miles. The similarity doesn't end there. A favorite holiday
dish is Verivorst, blood sausage. Old Cajuns would feel much at
home.
</P>
<P>
   So did I.
</P>
<P>
   Tallinn is a clean, safe and beautiful city of slightly more
than 400,000 population, almost Disney-like with its Old Town
sector dating back some five centuries. The parks are lovely and
numerous.
</P>
<P>
   You find English spoken most everywhere, and people couldn't be
nicer, though a bit reserved. Blame that on their Finnish culture.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, one of the most popular pastimes for Estonians is to
go into the woods and sit under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom saw a police car or heard a siren. Evening time is
quiet time for Tallinn. The order of the day seems to be
orderliness.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that in World War II Estonia had its own unit of the
SS fighting alongside the Nazis against the Soviet Red Army. The SS
veterans, in staging a recent reunion, are a great embarrassment to
the current democratic government seeking membership in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltics suffered equally under Nazi and Soviet occupation.
In just one day in 1944, Red Army air strikes leveled more than 10
percent of Tallinn's Old Town.
</P>
<P>
   The end of World War II was only the beginning. During the first
year of Soviet rule, Estonia lost 60,000 of its citizens, exiled to
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltic States broke away from Russian dominance in the early
1990s as the Soviet Union crumbled. Nowadays, it's not so easy
being Russian in Estonia, although they make up 32 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Russians feel they are being treated as second-class citizens.
Indeed, citizenship in the new Estonia is difficult for Russians to
obtain. For instance, they have to be able to speak Estonian.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians, even those born here, never bothered to learn
Estonian. They expected everyone else to speak their language, if
you can imagine such an attitude.
</P>

LAW STUDENT PUTS THE PEDAL TO THE MEDAL FOR FREE SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When it comes to defending the right of free
speech, Tom Mosquera lets his car settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquera, 32 and an aspiring constitutional lawyer, has taken
the practice of free expression through bumper stickers a little
farther down the road. With a black Magic Marker taped to the front
of the windshield and the First Amendment written on the hood,
Mosquera's 1982 cream-colored Volvo is now a mobile marketplace of
ideas _ open for anyone to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very popular with the lesbian crowd, apparently,''
Mosquera said this week, pointing to messages like ``Lesbians
rule'' and ``Mary loves Joan'' scrawled on the sides of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look _ `Down with liberals.' Isn't that ironic? They should
try to find a conservative with a car like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the politics of the vehicular graffiti, Mosquera
doesn't care. Only about a quarter of the messages are political,
anyway. Many have to do with legalizing marijuana. Some promote the
Bible. Most are simply reflections of the progressive residents in
Mosquera's Hudson Park neighborhood, where the car is quickly
becoming a local _ albeit transient _ landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquera, who is in his first year at Albany Law School, said he
got the idea after watching a debate on flag burning and people who
opposed that form of expressive opinion. On July 9 _ the date is
written atop the Volvo's grill _ Mosquera dedicated the car he
bought in 1996 for $2,500 to demonstrating free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was to remind people that a car like this
couldn't exist in China,'' said Mosquera, whose thinning hair swept
into a ponytail belies his twentysomething grunge attire. He
aspires to someday work for the American Civil Liberties Union or a
similar nonprofit activist organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is to get people to think. A lot of people have
opinions, but not a lot of people actually think. I was curious to
see what people would write.''
</P>
<P>
   The results have run across the gamut:
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive locally, pollute globally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``'98 Led Zepplin!! Nothin' left to do but Smile, Smile,
Smile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get pulled over, this one might come in handy,'' Mosquera
said, pointing to the latter message, written just below the
driver's seat window.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the messages toe the line. Racial epithets and
profanity are quickly covered with spray paint. The Volvo gets
edited on a daily basis, and the painted-over spots outnumber its
patches of rust.
</P>
<P>
   Whether graffiti-makers will try to spread the word to other
cars is another concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people choose to write on their own cars, that's one thing.
If it does start to spread, that's something we'd have to address
with the police,'' said Hudson Park Neighborhood Association
President Colleen Ryan. The neighborhood has recently been looking
at enforcing issues like picking up garbage or cleaning up after
dogs, but ``so far that hasn't included people who write on their
cars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of characters in this neighborhood who are
involved with making it a better place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mosquera's marker has yet to be stolen or used on
another car. How long he will continue to use the Volvo as a
pontificating point remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to do this in some upscale community, it would
probably get towed,'' Mosquera said with a grin. ``Here, no one's
ever said `You're an idiot' for doing this.''

 &HT;    BEYOND JAMAICA'S POSH RESORTS: ANOTHER SIDE TO PARADISE

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ ``Crime's so bad they'll cut off your arm to
get a nice watch,'' warned the American businessman seated beside
me during a nearly two-hour flight from Miami to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous beginning to what was supposed to be a quick
business trip to paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Often I'd heard Jamaica, the Caribbean's largest
English-speaking country, touted as a succulently green island,
where honeymooners munch on mangoes for breakfast at posh hotels
while gazing at blooming hibiscus plants and palm trees dripping
with coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million tourists
last year, many of whom were undoubtedly charmed by the country's
azure waters and mountains that look as high as heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the scenery in many parts of this
Connecticut-sized nation is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another side to Jamaica that lies beyond the high
walls of all-inclusive resorts.
</P>
<P>
   I found, for example, that driving through this capital city was
like driving through the worst slums of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Children in tattered clothing live inside squalid shanties with
corrugated tin roofs in neighborhoods where rancid fruit stands and
closet-sized liquor stores are fixtures and the only
sanitary-looking structure is a Texaco service station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is like El Salvador after the war except that there
wasn't any war in Jamaica,'' exclaimed a dumbfounded official at
the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   But what the country has suffered from is an economy in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   When most of the world was enjoying an economic boon, Jamaica's
economy was shrinking by nearly 3 percent in both 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that even Haiti -- the Western Hemisphere's
poorest country -- has a better-performing economy than Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Just the sheer unreliability of everyday life offers a peephole
into the downturn's effect on average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With many manholes uncovered, walking down a sidewalk can be
precarious business.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A sign in Montego Bay claims Kingston is 190 kilometers away;
another says 122.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And, in a country that sees rain almost every afternoon, many
people are without water 12 hours a day thanks to broken pipes that
allow an estimated 60 percent of the water supply to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to blame for the country's devastating recession is a
massive government debt that has choked off any chance at
development. Interest rates of 40 percent have slowed investment.
And, as an unemployment rate now at nearly 20 percent has grown, so
has its dark shadow -- crime.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 murders were reported here last year, a rate
fueled primarily by a thriving drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're few places doing as poorly as Jamaica,'' laments
Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organization
of Jamaica. ``And, we expect another year of negative growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government points to inflation of 9 percent in 1997 -- the
first single-digit increase in a decade -- as a resounding
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It has also managed to forestall a spectacular financial-system
collapse by taking over 50 percent of all the banks and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the government of Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson has increased the number of public-sector employees by 11
percent when most other Caribbean governments have trimmed bloated
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree that the only thing keeping Jamaica's economy
afloat today are $800 million in remittances the island receives
each year from the 2 million or so Jamaicans who're living
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what has average Jamaicans scratching their heads is
that, in a country strapped for cash, the government promised each
member of its soccer team, dubbed the Reggae Boyz, a two-acre
building plot and a low-cost home loan after it won a place in the
World Cup final late last year.
</P>
<P>
   And they're still baffled over the Jamaican Tourist Board's
decision last year to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to
commission what it had hoped would be the world's largest
inflatable soccer ball as part of a promotional scheme only to have
it rejected by the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to wonder what the government is thinking,''
pondered Gerald Hamilton, a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jamaica used to be one of the more prosperous
islands in the West Indies, and the preferred playground of
celebrities like Bette Davis and Rudyard Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   Even today the most popular saying on T-shirts here is ``Smile
Mon -- No Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem on this lovely island -- an economic
crisis -- and until it's solved, this no-problem getaway offers
visitors very little to fantasize about.

IF YOU GO: TUSCANY AND UMBRIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Guidebooks: ``Walking and Eating in Tuscany and Umbria,'' by
James Lasdun and Pia Davis (Penguin Books; $16.95). In addition to
providing historical information, the book also contains data on
bus connections, restaurants and accommodations, as well as
information on other walks in Tuscany and Umbria. Lonely Planet has
just released ``Walking in Italy,'' which describes a different
three-day walk through the Chianti hills.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation: At a bookstore in Siena I bought two topographic
maps; neither was terribly useful. The verbal description of the
route in the guidebook was reassuringly precise, although once or
twice I was thrown off course briefly due to the rerouting of farm
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics: We started from Siena, took an express bus to
Florence and one of the frequent local buses to Greve, the starting
point. The walk has two alternative ending points. We chose
Vagliagli over San Sano because bus connections back to Siena were
much more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: ``Walking and Eating'' lists hotels along the
route. From a purely logistical standpoint, some may be more
convenient than the ones where we stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the walk we stayed at Hotel Chiusarelli, Viale
Curtatone 15, Siena, Italy; phone: 011-39-577-280562; fax:
011-39-577-271177. $74 a night for two, not including breakfast.
Clean, quiet, located near the Chiesa di San Domenica and the bus
station; a good place to leave excess clothes and other gear during
your walk.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get a room in Greve at the start of the walk, we
stayed at the Relais Fattoria Valle, Case Sparse 56, Panzanon
Greve, Chianti, Italy; phone: 011-39-55-852-482. $90 a night for
two, including breakfast. A stately, restored 19th-century Tuscan
villa about 15 minutes by local bus from Greve. Note: limited, if
any, English spoken.
</P>
<P>
   In Parco San Michele there's only one place to stay: Villa San
Michele Hostel, Parco Naturale de San Michele, Greve, Italy; phone:
011-39-55-851034. All rooms are $63 a night for two, including
breakfast. Ask for room No. 3 _ it's by far the nicest.
</P>
<P>
   Between Volpaia and Radda we stayed at Azienda Il Pruneto, Loc.
Il Pruneto 37, Radda in Chianto, Italy; phone: 011-39-577-738013.
Cost: 120,000 lire ($68.50) per night for a double room, not
including breakfast. A farmhouse in a spectacular location.
</P>
<P>
   Also between Volpaia and Rad da, Podere Terreno, alla via della
Volpaia, Radda in Chianti (SI), Italy; phone: 011-39-577-738312;
fax: 011-39-577-738400. Rooms are 140,000 lire ($80) per person per
night, with half board (breakfast, dinner and wine). Minimum
two-night stay. Those not overnighting there may book dinners
separately for 45,000 lire ($26) if space permits. Phone before 10
a.m. the day you plan to dine.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: In Siena, Grotta del Gallo Nero, Via del Porrione
67, Siena; phone: 011-39-577-284356; serves authentic dishes from
medieval recipes. Multicourse menus, including wine, are $22 to $33
per person.
</P>
<P>
   In Panzano we had a superb dinner at Trattoria Oltre il
Giardino, Piazza Bucciorelli, 42 5022 Panzano, Chianti, Italy;
phone: 011-39-571-310483. Dinner for two, including wine, came to
$48.

WALKING DOWN MEMORABLE LANES IN CHARMING TUSCANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With TUSCANY-INFO)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOLPAIA, Italy _ Lightning flickered across the Tuscan sky.
Thunder crackled and boomed off medieval stone towers. As heavy
drops spattered Volpaia's piazza, we dashed across rain-slick
cobblestones to the sanctuary of the village's only restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   What timing! All morning long we'd been walking with our
backpacks through the Chianti hills, through vineyards full of
plumping grapes and dark forests sheltering wild boar. This cozy
little ``trattoria'' was the first real shelter we'd come to all
day, and it had appeared at precisely the moment the gathering
thunderstorm had let loose.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``signora'' bustled out of the kitchen with platters of
delicate, sage-scented ravioli, braised rabbit with rosemary, bowls
of hearty ``ribollita'' and earthen pitchers of Chianti wine, I
leaned my dripping backpack in the corner, listened to the downpour
hissing on the cobblestones outside and thought: let it rain!
</P>
<P>
   The genesis for this trip had come several months earlier, when
a new guidebook had landed on my desk. In just seven succinct words
its title managed to embrace two of my favorite places and two of
my favorite endeavors: ``Walking and Eating in Tuscany and
Umbria.''
</P>
<P>
   For years we'd been trying without success to plan an inn-to-inn
walking trip through Tuscany. We had longed to saunter down the
stony lanes of medieval hill towns, to picnic in the shade of
gnarled olive trees, to sip the local wines with stubble-faced
winemakers and to end each day with a four-course Tuscan feast, a
hot shower and a snuggly bed.
</P>
<P>
   The adventure travel catalogs are full of such trips, but we had
wanted to do it on our own. And we'd been stymied.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, we realized, is that Tuscans are not recreational
walkers. Their countryside is not crisscrossed by well-maintained,
carefully signposted hiking paths in the manner of, say, England.
And maps? The Italians put their exemplary skills to many tasks,
but cartography, alas, does not seem to be among them.
</P>
<P>
   But as I leafed through the guidebook it suddenly looked
possible. The authors had cobbled together a series of walks making
use of cypress-lined country lanes, rutted farm tracks and
half-overgrown forest paths _ and, not incidentally, linking a
series of tempting trattorias. The walk that caught my eye was a
three-day excursion along the spine of the gentle, vineyard-covered
Chianti hills, which stretch through the storied heart of Tuscany
between Florence and Siena.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was one warm May morning that Jeri and I came to be
darting around the crowded market square in the village of Greve,
filling our backpacks with the makings of a fine picnic lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial capital of Chianti, Greve is a prosperous little
wine town that wouldn't look out of place in the Napa Valley. Its
shop windows were filled with pricey kitchen knickknacks and
designer sunglasses; its travel agency advertised flights to Ibiza
and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   But in the center of town, where the Saturday market was
buzzing, Piazza Matteotti showed off a different Greve. Dressed in
their finest, the townsfolk moved from stall to stall swapping
gossip, thumping melons, slapping backs, sniffing wedges of cheese,
tousling the heads of dogs and scrutinizing tomatoes. They filled
their shopping satchels with not just fruits and vegetables but
also shoes, sweaters, kitchen utensils, soap, live chickens, even
chainsaws. They didn't have a Wal-Mart in Greve, and this was how
they made do.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a deep breath, we plunged into the fray. At the fruit
stall we bought a couple Golden Delicious apples, at the cheese
stall a small orb of provolone, at the ``forno'' a small loaf of
crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   I pushed open the door to the salami shop and was hit by an
aromatic blast that nearly sent me staggering backward. Inside,
strings of thick, musty links dangled from rafter to rafter. The
cured hocks of a huge boar hung in one corner, along with those of
several smaller animals I couldn't identify. We bought a couple
small links, shouldered our backpacks and set off into the Chianti
hills. Our eventual destination was Vagliagli, three days and
perhaps 30 miles to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Our route followed a little cypress-lined country road that
zigzagged uphill past a graveyard and the high, ivy-covered walls
of several villas. Soon the hillsides were lined with terraced
vineyards of Sangiovese grapes, the main component of Chianti wine.
We began to see signs with the ubiquitous Gallo Nero _ the black
rooster, once the herald of the baronial alliance known as the
``Lega di Chianti'' and now the symbol of the Chianti Classico wine
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vendito vino e oio,'' announced a hand-lettered sign at the
Melazzano vineyard: wine and olive oil for sale. Tempting as it was
to stop in and pick up a bottle of Chianti for lunch, I resisted.
Painful experience has taught me there's no better way to ruin my
motivation for an afternoon of walking.
</P>
<P>
   It was springtime, and our little lane was surrounded by a riot
of wildflowers _ bright red poppies, pink dog-rose, purple vetch,
yellow broom, irises and dandelions. D.H. Lawrence, who passed
through in the 1920s, was similarly impressed: ``It is queer,'' he
wrote, ``that a country so perfectly cultivated as Tuscany, where
half the produce of five acres of land will have to support 10
human mouths, still has so much room for wild flowers.''

   As we climbed higher above Greve the views began to open up.
Gentle hills undulated in all directions, each covered with a
patchwork quilt of vineyards and crowned with a fortified villa or
hill town _ a reminder that throughout medieval times this region
was, more than anything, a theater of war. The golden,
late-afternoon light blended with the ever-present Tuscan haze to
paint the countryside like a Renaissance landscape.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Along the ridgetop we entered a cool, fragrant pine forest and a
few minutes later, five hours after setting off from Greve, passed
through an ancient stone gateway to reach our home for the night,
Villa San Michele.
</P>
<P>
   A monastery until 10 years ago, San Michele now consists of a
hostel-type inn and a 700-year-old chapel. In the candle-lit dining
room, we sat down to a Tuscan feast of ``crostini mista'' (toasted
bread with toppings); gnocchi with pesto; chicken with musky forest
mushrooms; and salads of wild greens. It was simple peasant fare _
``cucina povera,'' food of the poor, it's called.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, we washed it down with a bottle of Terre di
Melazzano, a Chianti Classico from the vineyard we'd walked through
that morning. Chianti wine is the embodiment of Tuscany: It doesn't
aspire to aristocracy; it's not meant to be sniffed, swirled and
held up to cross-examination. Rather, it's an earthy, unpretentious
friend who makes a delightful _ and delightfully inexpensive _
dinner companion.
</P>
<P>
   As we climbed the stairs to our room, the night was
preternaturally silent. We were finally beyond the whiny buzz of
the Vespas, the mechanized mosquitoes of Italy. All we could hear
was the breeze sighing through the pine trees. We slept well.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, as we were leaving, Jeri mentioned to the woman
behind the counter that we hoped to reach Volpaia by lunchtime. Her
face lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' she said, struggling for words in English and finally
giving up. She made a hugging motion and said, ``la signora _
simpatica!'' I gathered we were in for a treat.
</P>
<P>
   Midmorning, at the edge of a forest, we came to an old
stone-hewn farmhouse that my map identified as Casa Lungagna.
Outside, leaning on a gnarled cane, stood its owner, a weathered
old man in a beret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volpaia?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   In Italian he launched into a discussion of the various routes,
and through his gestures I made out that we could get there either
on a well-tended wagon track or by an overgrown footpath that
plunged into the forest. The guidebook said we should take the
forest trail, so we thanked the man and set off. Before I entered
the woods I turned to wave goodbye and saw him feeling his way
slowly along the lane with his cane. It was, quite literally, a
case of the blind leading the blind.
</P>
<P>
   The forest was dark and a little spooky, our path overgrown with
brambles and yellow broom. From the footprints in the mud next to a
spring I could see these woods were far more popular with cinghiale
_ wild boar _ than humans.
</P>
<P>
   Our path passed by an abandoned stone farmhouse, called Dogole,
which was rapidly being reclaimed by the forest. The roof had
collapsed; a young oak pushed up through the floor and out a
window. Since the early 1960s, when Italy's sharecropping system
was dismantled, the ``contadini'' _ peasant farmworkers _ have been
fleeing these farms for better-paying jobs in the city. Few traces
remained of the terraces they had patiently carved out of the
hillsides over generations, and in a few years it will be hard to
tell anyone had ever farmed here at all.
</P>
<P>
   It had been warm and sunny when we had entered the forest, but
when we emerged at the other side the skies were dark and gray and
the temperature was falling rapidly. We raced the approaching storm
to the fortified hamlet of Volpaia, reaching the shelter of La
Bottega trattoria just as the downpour started.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where the trajectory of our little adventure began
to veer off course. The signora, rather than being simpatica, was
clearly not happy to see us. I could hardly blame her: all the
diners at the restaurant's outside tables had rushed inside, along
with virtually every other Sunday day-tripper in Volpaia. Her
little trattoria couldn't hold such a crowd; her overworked kitchen
couldn't feed us. Pointing to the door, she ordered everyone
without a reservation _ including us _ out into the rain.
</P>
<P>
   I was zipping up my rain jacket and contemplating the soggy walk
to Radda, five miles distant, when some guardian angels came to our
rescue. A group of Americans, the Feinberg family from San Diego,
kindly offered us a ride.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Radda they dropped us off at the trattoria
Il Vigne, where we were midway between the antipasto and the
``primo piatto'' when the sun came out. Even though Radda was our
intended destination for the night, we wanted to walk the stretch
from Volpaia to Radda, reputedly one of the prettiest in Chianti.
So when we finished our meal we hitched a ride back to Volpaia.
</P>
<P>
   Young boys kicking a soccer ball against a ninth-century stone
tower stopped to let us pass. Exiting the walled village through a
vine-covered archway, we strolled down a lane lined with stately,
missile-shaped cypress trees. Off to our right, atop one hill,
stood the fortifications of a 12th-century Romanesque church, Pieve
di Santo Maria Novella. Directly ahead, another hill was crowned by
the towers of Radda, the old capital of the Chianti League.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   And just to our left was a farmhouse with a disturbingly
familiar name. I pulled the sheet of paper from my backpack to make
sure: Indeed, it was Pruneto _ the farmhouse where we had
reservations for the night.
</P>
<P>
   We had asked the woman at the local tourist office to book us a
room in Radda. Apparently still not clear on the concept of hiking,
she'd put us here, way out in the country, apparently miles from
the nearest restaurant. Prunetto was perfectly charming, but it
didn't serve meals. I fumed as I dropped my backpack in our
bedroom. Not only would we have to share a PowerBar for dinner, but
we'd have to make up the mileage with a long, long day of walking
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a note with our reservation sheet: the woman at
the tourist office had made us dinner reservations at another
farmhouse, Podere Terreno, 20 minutes' walk away.
</P>
<P>
   The other guests were just sitting down at a long oaken table
when we arrived. The owner, Roberto Melosi _ who looked like a
Tuscan Dick Van Patten _ pulled out two chairs for us and filled
our glasses with Chianti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the '97 from my vineyard here,'' Melosi said. ``It's very
young now, but I think one day it will be excellent. I hope you
find it to your liking.''
</P>
<P>
   Melosi, who once worked at the Savoy in London, seemed more at
home here in this 16th-century farmhouse of stone and oak. He and
his wife, Marie-Sylvie Haniez, owned the surrounding 110 acres,
including seven acres of vineyards and four of olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   As we sipped our wine, Melosi's wife began laying steaming
platters of food down on the table. First came ``paglia e fieno'' _
green and white pasta with fresh mint and pungent porcini mushrooms
picked by Melosi on his property. The olive oil also came from his
farm; it had been pressed at the mill up the road in Volpaia.
</P>
<P>
   Next came ``spezzatino'' _ a fragrant Tuscan beef stew with
celery, carrots, red and white onions, bay leaves, juniper berries
and tomatoes. Except for the beef, Melosi had grown it all. A salad
of rucola (arugula) and radicchio was flavored with fennel he'd
picked just outside his door.
</P>
<P>
   When my glass was empty Melosi refilled it with a velvety 1993
Sangiovese-Cabernet _ again, from his vineyard. Then he uncorked
one of his 1994 Chianti Classicos and set the bottle down between
us.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break before dessert, Melosi stood up and offered to
show me around his farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please _ fill your glass,'' he said, ``and bring it with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   As we wandered past his crackling fireplace and down narrow
hallways, ducking beneath massive, rough-hewn oak beams, I asked
Melosi about the special relationship between the Tuscan people,
their landscape and their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, sharing food is more than eating,'' he told me. ``It's
an excuse for gossip and love, a moment of pleasure and intimacy.
It's a way of expressing yourself to another person without any
secondary motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Melosi topped off my glass; he'd thoughtfully brought along the
bottle. Down a curving flight of stairs, his stone basement was
dark and musty. It seemed more like a cave, an organic part of the
landscape. So, it seemed, did my host.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cook you are pulling nature out of each ingredient,''
he explained. ``You dissect the nature, get inside it like an
alchemist. You put it in the pot and the heat does the magic.''
</P>
<P>
   He took another sip of wine and tried to find a metaphor I'd
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature supplies everything; you just try to get the most out
of it,'' he said. ``You're like a mechanic tuning up a Ferrari.''
</P>
<P>
   As I tottered back up the stairs toward dessert, I paused to
fret about the next day, about the miles we'd have to make up for
having stopped here. I didn't fret long: The extra walking would
be, I decided, a trivial price to pay for one of the most memorable
meals of my life.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the stairs Melosi paused, held out his Chianti
bottle and arched an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please,'' I said, extending my empty glass.

RUSSIANS HAVE ALWAYS LOOTED STATE FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Allegations by foreign bankers that the Russian elite
has systematically plundered more than $33 billion in international
loans came as little surprise to those familiar with the country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials of Credit Swiss First Boston bank claimed
that members of the so-called ``oligarchy'' _ high-flying Russian
business executives and bankers close to the Yeltsin regime _ had
siphoned the immense sum into their own pockets, helping to account
for the plunge of the ruble and the political crisis now
threatening Russia.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the charge is an echo of similar looting that has
occurred through the centuries. The czars regularly provided choice
morsels from the state coffers to their supporters. Little
differentiation was made between public funds and private money.
Indeed, in the final analysis, all property was considered to
belong to the czar, to do with as he wished.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the current crisis erupted, President Boris Yeltsin
was reported to be following the old tradition, helping his cronies
to become Russia's new tycoons. One of them, banker Boris
Berezovsky, is said to be so wealthy and powerful that Yeltsin
seldom makes a move without his advice _ in much the same way the
czars relied on the favorites they had raised to positions of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   If Yeltsin did bankroll his friends, he didn't have to look all
the way back to the czars for a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five years of Soviet government legitimized the lack
of scruples,'' according to historian Robert Vishnogradov of
France's National Research Council, a government-funded think tank
here. ``The rule of law did not exist under the communists. This
has made it easier for the post-communist era to be lawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``State property was considered easy pickings for theft in
Soviet times,'' Vishnogradov said. ``It has been hard for Russians
who grew up under communism to shake that view. It is a widespread
notion that if you don't steal from the state, others will _ and
will take your share.''
</P>
<P>
   At the highest levels of government and finance, the same casual
attitude is often found, he noted. It helps to explain the large
number of wealthy people who have emerged in just a few years
although Russia itself remains a poor and backward country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theft has simply become one way _ a frequent way _ to make
money,'' Vishnogradov said. ~``The fact is, nobody holds it against
you if that is how you get rich. Rather, they envy you for being
clever enough to do it and get away with it.''

   In the fairy tale ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' the heroine is saved
from her seeming endless sleep by a kiss from the handsome prince,
who whisks her away to his palace where they live happily ever
after. This same idea is portrayed in ``Snow White'' and in
countless other stories.
</P>
<P>
   Many films and novels continue to follow a similar plot concept.
People grow up believing the message that something or someone can
rescue us from our mundane lives and turn us into all that we want
to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even our parents may inadvertently give us the impression that
the right person can make everything just fine. Young women dress
up like fairy princesses in white lacy dresses on their wedding
day, propagating this myth even further.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do so many people seem discontented in their
marriages and relationships? Why do people divorce and then often
remarry someone who may resemble their previous partner?
</P>
<P>
   Is one reason because they remain the same within? And like
attracts like? So they continue on and on, attracting the same
painful and unsatisfactory relationships for as long as they
continue to live with the same old attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   When a person begins to work on changing himself from within, he
begins to attract different types of people and experiences into
his life. The junkie who is using drugs is likely to associate with
other drug users. When he reforms himself and starts to change his
attitudes, he may start associating with a different sort of
person. This is because he is changing from within.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of love as some sort of power outside of
themselves that will ``take them away from all of this.'' Sadly,
that is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   Love exists only within our own hearts, and to have happy
relationships we must first become truly loving people. And as we
fill our hearts with love by expressing love toward others in
thought, word, and deed, that love can heal our own lives, help to
solve our problems, and enable us to feel good about ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy and natural to love family and friends. But how about
the people who hurt us and make us angry? How about those who do
not live up to our own standards of appearance and conduct? Do we
love them, or do we simply tolerate them?
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that the harder someone is to love, the more he
needs to be loved! There is nothing that indicates the degree of
our maturity so well as our ability to love well.
</P>
<P>
   In Alan Cohen's book ``The Healing of the Planet Earth,'' the
following passage pours a beautiful light on how love is the real
key to success in all of our endeavors:
</P>
<P>
   ``The real secret of success is love. We must love ourselves
enough to know that we are worthy to succeed. We must believe that
those around us want us to win at life, and that our winning can
only support their winning. We must know that God wants us to be
happy in all the arenas of our life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand that there is no need to struggle, strain,
or live in pain or a state of lack. These hellish conditions are
but signals that we must try another way....
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the right person can be the real story of our life. When
we live centered and focused in the light of truth, we become a
shining beacon, drawing to us our own.''
</P>
<P>
   In his famous prayer, St. Francis asks that he may seek rather
to love than to be loved. ``For it is by self-forgetting that one
finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, it can be our experience that it is by loving that we
are loved; it is by being the right person that we find the right
person.

KEEPING UP WITH THE DOW JONESES

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In this city you don't need a ticker to know
which way the stock market is going. You just need to watch
bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   While I was having a plate of perfectly fried calamari at
Farallon restaurant on Tuesday, I told bartender Patrick Dunn that
the Dow Jones had bounced back from its big drop the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``That explains why I've been selling so many martinis and so
much champagne,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You've got to love this town. The high rollers go to one of our
finest restaurants and get tanked on Moet to celebrate the stock
market not tanking.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market ever crashes, they'll just drink cheaper
stuff. Any excuse to have a pop in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I don't usually have lunch at Farallon, but I was wondering what
the rich people were doing.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was wondering about the large portion of the
Bay-area population who sell things to rich people.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch Tuesday, Farallon was filled with beautiful people.
Business types smiled and laughed over chef Mark Franz's grilled
pike with caper aioli. An impeccably tailored young woman took a
table for one near the window for an intimate lunch with her cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market completely folds, will it please take cell
phones with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the restaurant business goes, the stock market can
have an effect,'' said Farallon's operations manager, Nick Peyton.
``People become a little more value-conscious. Not that they stop
going out. They'll just say, `I'm not going to get the Peter
Michael Chardonnay at $75, I'll get something cheaper.'''
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask me who Peter Michael is. I never saw his stuff in
Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   Peyton, who has been in the restaurant business since the 1960s,
says every economic dip hurts. ``I was at the Ritz Carlton in 1991
when there was a downturn after the Gulf War, and it had a profound
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, the rich and not-quite-so-rich have lost some
money on paper in recent weeks, but they aren't selling pencils and
they're still buying Jaguars and Land Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can't believe how steady our clients are,'' said
Gordon Blackstock, sales manager of British Motor Car Distributors
Ltd. ``We're so consistent. We sell 20 to 30 Jaguars every month
and 30 to 35 (Land) Rovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackstock said that no matter what the stock market does, his
clients buy luxury cars at that pace, among them the gorgeous new
Jaguar convertible priced at $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Salesman Craig R. Perry, who was closing a deal, said his
customers don't waste time listening to market news because they're
in for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``I guess it's better to worry about
the market than to worry about a bomb coming in your window, as in
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business was brisk at the San Francisco Gun Exchange. Never
fear. Customers weren't arming themselves to take to the hills in
case of national collapse. They were arming themselves for dove
season, duck season, deer season and elk season.
</P>
<P>
   Co-owner Bob Posner said he has a beautiful handmade Purdy
shotgun that a customer had imported from England for $60,000 and
never used. Posner said he should have no problem selling it. ``I'd
have people lined up for this gun at $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The rich are different from you and me. Their idea of a bargain
is buying a $30,000 gun so they can sit in the cold and shoot a
duck they can get at Farallon for about 20 bucks _ already cooked,
and better than their personal chefs can prepare.

<P>
   At Neiman-Marcus, jewelry saleswoman Marci Halabis said business
was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the crossroads of the world,'' she said from behind
the counter in the front of the store. Some architect friends saw
her and came in to say hello. Halabis, who is studying massage,
gave one friend a quick hand massage.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing about San Francisco. Buy jewelry at
Neiman's in Dallas, and you won't get a hand massage. Well, here
you have to be an old friend of Marci Halabis, but she has a lot of
friends after 13 years selling jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has money in a 401(k), but she doesn't worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm above ground,'' said this practical Michigan native. ``As
long as I'm alive and can make decisions, I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the American attitude. Never mind what the rich people
are doing, or how much Bill Gates or Larry Ellison have lost on
paper. We're an optimistic people.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look on the bright side. Optimism sure beats pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   I was so optimistic I even took a close look at that Jaguar
convertible (hey, I play Lotto), and invested in a glass of wine
futures at Farallon. You don't have to be rich, and it makes an
hour of the present quite wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the Municipal Railway, all leading San Francisco
indicators are up. I ran into the Brown twins, Vivian and Marian. I
said hello and asked them what they thought of all this stock
market hullabaloo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an investor,'' Marian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have that kind of money,'' Vivian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good news, is it?'' Marian said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I don't know. I was smiling, just because they had put
their money into duplicate suits and hats of the brightest yellow
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, and we have better things to look at than
jagged falling lines on a graph.

problem.'' -- Emmet Fox)

to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges

</P>
<P>
   The prophets of Old Testament times, esteemed in leadership
positions, assumed two major roles in their society:
</P>
<P>
   --As advisers they had an aptitude for solving the problems that
confronted the ancient Hebrews.
</P>
<P>
   --As seers they had the ability to anticipate the outcomes of
various plans the ``chosen people'' considered as their culture
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seers are sometimes called research analysts because they
seek to anticipate outcomes. Advisers are known as doctors,
lawyers, merchants, business executives, and others who also try to
anticipate outcomes and solve problems in their area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Emmet Fox, a twentieth-century author and problem-solver, wrote
that the only way to solve a problem is to ``lift your
consciousness above the level where you met the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem appears as an obstacle unlikely to be seen accurately
because it dominates our mental landscape. From the meadow, the
forest may appear ominous and troubling; the trees may seem to
block our journey to a desired destination.
</P>
<P>
   A lifted consciousness, however, functions like a hot air
balloon -- when it gets up high enough, the forest can be revealed
in is entirety, and shown in proper relationship to its
surroundings. Distance, height, and growing awareness can provide
an encompassing perspective that may be helpful in showing us how
to cope with challenging circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Often a successful problem-solver is one who creates a new
context in which to view the problem. This can often be done by
directing one's attention away from the distracting details of the
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   From a detached perspective, we may examine the situation in a
new or different light and, after exploring information and
options, choose an appropriate course of action.
</P>
<P>
   King Solomon was noted for his wisdom. As an aid in solving the
problems that were presented to him, he examined the inner
motivation of the participants in order to gain perspective.
</P>
<P>
   His decision in the case of two women who claimed the same child
has become legend and illustrates how he used wisdom and
imagination to get inside of people's true feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon examined the motivation of the woman by suggesting that
the infant be divided in half so that each woman could have an
equal share of the child. The true mother begged him not to do so,
preferring that her child should live, even if with the other
woman, rather than be destroyed so that she could have her ``fair
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon easily determined the rightful parent by her concern for
the child.
</P>
<P>
   Prophets are perhaps most widely acclaimed for their ability as
seers. But prophets are not the only ones endowed with some
capacity to anticipate outcomes. Each one of us possesses the
ability to discern, that is, to make choices. Each one of us can
examine the appearance of a situation, look at motives, and then
make an informed decision.
</P>
<P>
   Some judgments or choices must be made based on information from
the five senses -- touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Other judgments yield more beneficial results when made at the
level beyond what may be readily available as fact. This kind of
discernment may be recognized through a hunch (sometimes called
intuition), and sometimes it may be deemed truly wise.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ralph E. Coleman, a neuropathologist, has for many years
made a study of psychophysics -- the science of relations between
mental and physical processes and phenomena. Today this science is
closely connected with such other new sciences as biophysics,
cybernetics, biomedical engineering, and medical sciences of a
neural or behavioral type.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman made a speciality of the relationship of the seen and
the unseen, the physical and the nonphysical, the body and the mind
in our human existence -- a speciality that was waiting for ages to
have persons of high quality devote their attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper entitled ``The Enigmas of Psychophysics,'' Dr.
Coleman writes, ``Man is innately curious about life and its
significance. His curiosity has caused him to search (and research)
in hope of escaping the dissatisfactions of the present and of
obtaining a future knowledge and freedom from discontent.... Modern
medical science considers the mind and the living physical body
inseparable parts of the whole person.''
</P>
<P>
   This wonderful ``mind'' within each person may be the catapult
to lift us above the present level of any problem.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you may not be able to change or control the people or
circumstances around you, but you can determine the level of
consciousness on which you meet them and react to any situation.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the most significant discoveries we can make. You
do not have to be fearful, and you really do not have to worry or
be anxious. You can determine your reaction and then your course of
action, and you can choose a higher level of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Testament prophets understood higher wisdom and
judgment. They used it; they sought to anticipate results as a way
to solve problems. They were the leaders of their day.
</P>
<P>
   Often the ability exists today in you, as it did in the ancient
prophets, to rise above the problem, examine motives, look at
options, and make choices.

RARE BUTTERFLY FACES A NEW MENACE: ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Karner blue butterfly is slowly losing its
fight to survive in the Albany Pine Bush Preserve, one of the
species' last remaining natural habitats in the United States. The
killer: humans. The latest tool of destruction: the all-terrain
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The azure-winged butterflies, about the size of a 25-cent coin,
are being threatened by burly ATVs illegally churning through the
property, Pine Bush officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As they pop wheelies and spin doughnut-shaped grooves into the
earth, ATV riders are also mowing down the wild blue lupine, the
only plant that Karner caterpillars eat, Preserve Steward Joel
Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you impact the plant, you're going to directly impact the
Karner blue butterfly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate New York was once home to hundreds of thousands of the
flying blue lepidoptera, which were first identified in 1949 and
named after the now-extinct village of Karner. Now there are only a
few hundred in the Pine Bush. The northern Saratoga County town of
Wilton also is home to a significant Karner Blue buttery
population. They live in the state-owned Wildlife Preserve and
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Once found in 12 states, the butterflies remain only in Indiana,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin, preserve
ecologist Neil Gifford said. The species is listed by the federal
government as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   ATVs aren't permitted in the 2,400-acre Pine Bush, said Joseph
Hess, the lone New York Department of Environmental Conservation
forest ranger patrolling the preserve. But morning and weekend joy
riders ignore posted signs.
</P>
<P>
   Though ATVs have long been a scourge of the Pine Bush, the
problem has become so severe that officials decided to hold a news
conference Tuesday near a sand dune freshly engraved with ATV
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get people to ride responsibly,'' Hess said.
Meaning: Stay off Pine Bush property.
</P>
<P>
   ATVs aren't the only threat to the Karner blue. Shrinking open
space and the lack of rejuvenating scrub fires also have hurt,
Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Bush officials are trying to maintain the population of
Karner blues by protecting what lupine-laden land there is as a
breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without intervention, they will be lost,'' Gifford said.

FIRST CHASIDIC LEADER WAS BORN 300 YEARS AGO 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1971 I moved across the country from Brooklyn to Lomita,
Calif., an area where few Jews lived. I was sent by the Chasidic
leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, to
establish a Chasidic Jewish community for the South Bay.
 &HT;    Being Chasidic means our family customs and lifestyles are
different. On the Sabbath married men wear a long jacket called a
kapota, which looks like a Prince Albert tuxedo, and distinct black
fedoras. We don't work on the Sabbath, and we keep the many other
customs of Orthodox Jews.
 &HT;    One Sabbath morning as I was walking to the synagogue, a Chevy
convertible drove past me. The driver hit his brakes, got out of
the car and ran over to me. I was startled and frightened.
 &HT;    ``Hey, Padre, are you Jewish?'' he asked.
 &HT;    I said, ``Yes.''
 &HT;    ``Padre, are you a Chasid?''
 &HT;    I said, ``Yes.''
 &HT;    ``If that's the case, you must be from the happiest people in
the world,'' he said. Then he asked to shake my hand.
 &HT;    ``My name is Jose Rodriguez and I come from Mexico. I took a
college course called social anthropology. In studying the Jewish
people I was told by my professor about a group called Chasidim.
'Chasidim are the happiest people in the world,' he said. 'No
matter what happens to them their deep faith in God keeps them
happy.'
 &HT;    ``So, Padre, when I drove by I thought it couldn't be possible
that a Chasid would live so far away from his people. When I saw
that you had a beard, a black hat and a long black coat, you fit
the description of my textbooks and I realized that, yes indeed,
you must be a Chasid. So, amigo, let me wish you good luck.''
 &HT;    He saluted and off he went. The encounter gave me a wonderful
feeling.
 &HT;    Sept. 9 will mark a great day in the Chasidic movement. It is
the 300th anniversary of the birth of the first Chasidic leader,
Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov -- Master of the Good Name.
 &HT;    Rabbi Yisroel, living in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern
Europe, launched a movement called Chasidism. It captured the
attention of millions of Jewish people. Within the initial 150
years of the movement six million Jews adopted this lifestyle. It's
been said that more than half of Eastern Europe were followers of
the Chasidic movement.
 &HT;    Rabbi Yisroel's mother died when he was born and his father, a
saintly man, addressed the 5-year-old boy before his death and told
him, ``Yisroel, have no fear of anyone except God.''
 &HT;    As a child Yisroel spent much time in the forest, observing
nature. He wasn't known to be a brilliant student; as a matter of
fact, he was different from most children. The young Yisroel was
definitely plugged into a different spiritual source.
 &HT;    The elders of the town tried to bring him back to the school;
however, Yisroel defied them and lived his own lifestyle. He
befriended many of the simple people. As he grew older he brought
joy and happiness to the poor and oppressed. One of his greatest
attributes was a joyful attitude to life and all sorts of people.
 &HT;    For 30 years Yisroel traveled from town to town where he
introduced the people to the concept of self-worth and happiness.
Everything, he claimed, had a purpose, whether good or seemingly
bad. The main thing was to have faith in God and to obey his
commandments happily. If you are happy with your lot in life, then
God will be happy with you. Our Father in Heaven hates sadness and
rejoices when his children are joyful. He had a saying, ``It is
man's duty to always live joyfully while serving God through prayer
and the study of Torah.''
 &HT;    You can well imagine the opposition of the scholars toward this
man's philosophy in saying that the main thing was to be happy when
worshiping God. This meant that the ignoramus could be just as
happy as the scholar. They thought maybe the scholars would not be
respected for his learning.
 &HT;    According to the Baal Shem Tov, all men were created equal, some
more learned than others, but when it came to joy there was no
monopoly. As a result, a schism was created within the Jewish
people.
 &HT;    To the gentiles of his era, the Baal Shem Tov was extremely
kind. He extended his patience and understanding to those in need.
Tradition tells us how he learned the mysteries of roots and herbs
from a gentile peasant whom he had saved when he was sick. As a
gift the peasant gave the Baal Shem Tov the secret healing powers
found in herbs and shrubs.
 &HT;    According to the Baal Shem Tov, every event in the physical
universe, even that of a leaf twirling from a tree, has a purpose.
 &HT;    Once there was a scoffer of the Baal Shem Tov who decided to
follow a leaf which was twirling across a street. He followed the
leaf over many blocks until it stopped. ``Ha,'' said the man to
himself, ``the leaf stopped for no purpose.''
 &HT;    He bent down and looked under the leaf and sure enough there was
a dying baby worm baking in the heat of the day. Now this little
leaf was providing the worm with shelter, thus ensuring that the
worm would not perish.
 &HT;    This idea of God loving everybody and everything having a
purpose was novel. The new movement flourished. People who followed
the Baal Shem Tov were called Chasidim -- pious ones -- for they
respected everything and considered that everything created in the
world has worth and is divinely given.
 &HT;    Next week, hundreds of thousands of Jewish people worldwide will
celebrate the birth of this Chasidic leader. During this period
people will speak about the many different Chasidic movements that
have flourished and branched out due to the encouragement of this
man.
 &HT;    In a way, the Baal Shem Tov is a great emancipator of the soul.
His lessons revived and rejuvenated the individuality of every
single person in this world. Our society could use the message of
worshiping God with joy.
 &HT;    If we had a generation of joyful people, what a wonderful world
it would be. Through joy any person can follow his religious
instinct and immerse himself in helping the world become a better
and safer place.
 &HT;    Within the many Chasidic movements, it has been the Chabad
Chasidic movement that has balanced the modern world and ancient
Jewish religion. Today there are over 3,000 Chabad centers spanning
the globe and continuing the work started by the Baal Shem Tov.
Thousands of young and old rabbis carry out his work in trying to
bring Godliness and goodness to the world, all inspired with joy.

ON-LINE BROKERAGES SURVIVE A HECTIC DAY WITHOUT TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Popular on-line trading sites say stock market
turbulence has sent record numbers of individual traders to their
keyboards. But unlike one hectic trading day last year when sites
buckled under demand, the electronic brokerages appear to be
handling the recent crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Though exact numbers were not available, Monday's white-knuckle
market ride most likely set records for on-line trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was our largest single day,'' said Ken Squire, a
spokesman for ETrade, the No. 2 on-line trading broker behind San
Francisco-based Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.'s ESchwab site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday, we hit a volume record,'' said a spokesman for
Ameritrade, another heavily advertised on-line trading site.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab spokesman Tom Taggart said that after the numbers were
tallied, ``we're sure it will be a record-setting day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 512
points, on-line stock traders were nervous. During the 554 stock
market free fall last Oct. 27, on-line trading sites collapsed
under the load of users rushing to check out and trade on their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had some capacity issues,'' Taggart said, ``but we all
also learned from those times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard lesson. Following last year's market drop, ETrade
was hit with a class-action lawsuit for allegedly failing to live
up to its promise of reliable, efficient trading. That suit is
still pending in a California court. In addition, the Securities
and Exchange Commission investigated the World Wide Web trading
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had real trouble then,'' said Jonathan Squire, a
spokesman for CyberInvest, a San Diego-based clearinghouse for
on-line trading and financial services. ``It was total chaos for a
moment or two.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem affected the entire industry as investors
deluged brokerages house with trade orders, questions or concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people trying to reach their brokers with their phones
had trouble getting through,'' Squire said. ``But from what we
hear, things went a lot better this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's troubles have not dented the on-line brokerage
business. According to Taggart, as of July, ESchwab had $132
billion in its on-line trading accounts. Taggart added that on-line
trading accounted for 52 percent of all trades executed by Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's growing,'' he said.

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,
recognized Israel's right to exist. Mikhail Gorbachev let communism
die.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, on the other hand, has agreed to take part in the
parliament of a province whose right to exist as part of the United
Kingdom it does not recognize. The IRA has neither formally nor
informally renounced its absolute opposition to British rule in any
part of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
which has always argued for peaceful politics, continues to press
for a united Ireland _ especially in the statements and speeches of
its leader, John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   It is, then, no mystery why unionists do not all gladly embrace
peace. They see the enemy against which they have fought for three
decades brought inside the pale of democratic politics and rewarded
with seats, ministerial posts and salaries _ without changing
position, apologizing for past murders or giving up any of its
large stock of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The largest uncertainty in the unionist mind is Irish
nationalism. For all of this century, Irish nationalism has been
variegated and has spoken with different accents, but in the end
saw itself as a family that, when challenged, would always put
unity before agreement with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, no nationalist, no matter how reasonable,
peacefully inclined or constitutionally minded, would betray the
cause of a united Ireland, even if he might tut-tut at the methods
used by the IRA. The British were never a friendly neighboring
state or fellow member of the European Union. Where not the enemy
(as they were to the IRA), they were at least an obstacle to the
historic mission to unify.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein sold the agreement to their
followers on the understanding that it would lead to a united
Ireland sooner or later. Gerry Adams won assent from his doubting
organization by persuading it that peaceful means could advance the
republican agenda better than war.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the IRA has not handed in any weapns and has
consistently refused to countenance doing so. Weapons surrender has
been the great failure of the talks. They were supposed to be
surrendered before the talks began, while they were taking place,
and before Sinn Fein takes the seats it won in the June assembly
elections and before Adams gets the ministerial position to which
Sinn Fein's vote entitles him. The lack of any progress on this
front fuels unionist fears.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue that aggravates the unionists even more than
weapons is the release of terrorist prisoners. Although both
republican and loyalist terrorists are to be released, the former
greatly outnumber the latter, and their release causes much more
outrage in unionist areas than loyalist releases do in nationalist
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men to be released killed policemen; others gunned
down part-time members of the army reserve. Some were enforcers
within the nationalist community, where punishment for crimes such
as drug dealing is a bullet through one or both kneecaps, or for
suspected betrayal, death. Their release causes revulsion,
especially among members of the police force (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary) and former members of the army reserve.
</P>
<P>
   There is also fear as Sinn Fein continues to strive to overtake
the SDLP as the largest nationalist party by stressing the
discrimination and exclusion many Catholics still say they feel.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely voiced but always present factor in Northern
Ireland's politics is the ticking clock of demographics. Catholics
were little more than 30 percent of the population in the 1920s, at
the time of partition; they now account for well over 40 percent
and are still growing relative to the Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   While a significant minority of Catholics probably vote for a
unionist party, the overwhelming majority votes nationalist and can
be expected to continue to do so. When the number of Catholics
approaches a majority, Protestants who cannot bear the thought of
becoming part of a united Ireland may turn to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among unionists, loyalty to God, conscience, or both is more
highly esteemed than loyalty to a party leader. Further, the
messianism of republicanism is countered by a view that Ulster's
status as part of the United Kingdom is quasi-religious and
includes for many unionists a passionately felt loyalty to a
monarchy which remains Protestant (no Catholic can succeed to the
throne of Great Britain).
</P>
<P>
   These issues are large _ and the mood is delicate, especially in
the unionist camp. Indeed, the strains of mistrust and violence may
sink the peace process and produce a situation as dangerous as any
of the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it cannot be denied that, thus far, the changes are vast,
and the situation is more hopeful than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs used to go off nightly; the cities of Belfast,
Londonderry, and most towns and villages were saturated by police
and army troops, with endless roadblocks, body searches and random
questioning by patrols. The British and Irish governments were
coldly formal with each other; the old provincial parliament was
abolished and direct rule put in its place; much of the Catholic
working class was slipping toward the IRA, and Protestant
paramilitary groups were massing across the province.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though Belfast is not a showcase among British cities, it
has recovered something of its tranquillity and lost some of its
grimy, slummy industrial look _ rather like Glasgow, which it
resembles and whose industrial development was similar to its own.
</P>
<P>
   So much public money has been pumped into the province that its
infrastructure is better than most other parts of the United
Kingdom. The two great engineering plants in Belfast _ the
shipbuilders Harland and Wolff and the Shorts aircraft
manufacturers _ have been kept in existence through adroit placing
of state contracts. An erstwhile culinary desert and possessor of
thousands of smoky, men-only bars divided on sectarian lines now
has a rash of bistros, trendy restaurants, and comfortable hotels.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate nationalist has become mayor of Belfast, reflecting
both unionist division and a growing Catholic inner-city
population, and has won cautious assent from the moderate
unionists. The second main city, Londonderry, has been
nationalist-controlled for years. Apart from some flashpoints
around marching season, trouble has been relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   In all this visible improvement, ``relatively'' is the key word.
In all but the most solidly Protestant enclaves, which have been
largely untouched by the troubles, both communities are
distrustful, sometimes vengeful, with collective memories of
grievance that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Time is needed in which the main political figures have _ or
should have _ some space in which to create, rather than merely
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 21st century, peace is a tall order, but the
agreement still gives hope it might be done, at last.

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the

<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ The nightmare never ends. Every
horrific bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division
that political will has yet to mend.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinn family knows the violence all too well. In July,
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, three young sons, died in the first
major terrorist attack since the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, their mother, Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the
first time about her grief _ a family's dreams shattered, a
country's future in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she fears the grief will drive her insane,
Chrissie Quinn tells herself she's just having a nightmare and that
when she wakes up, all her boys will be alive, laughing and
inseparable, as they always were.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact three of her four boys are lying, inseparable
forever, side by side by side, in their graves. Only her eldest,
Lee, 13, is with her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brothers _ chatty Richard, 11, gentle Mark, 10, and
wee Jason, the warrior who turned nine just four days before they
died _ were murdered in an evil and cowardly way by someone who
used the name of God as a pitiful excuse for hatred. The family was
targeted while they slept; the terrorist tossed at least one,
perhaps more, firebombs into their home July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on merciful days, Chrissie is just numb. She's beyond
tears. Months later, the reality hasn't really sunk in.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winding road to Rasharkin, a town about 35 miles northwest
of Belfast, is quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn is staying in this mostly Catholic small town
with her mother. Along the way, sheep graze peacefully in gently
rolling hills people proudly describe as ``40 shades of green.''
Church bells seem to be always ringing. Weaving through villages,
one can see children playing in quiet streets with tidy flower
beds. The serenity is so deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Union Jacks mark areas where Protestants live. None fly in
pockets where Catholics dwell. The area suffers the undercurrent of
hatred that sweeps throughout Northern Ireland pitting Catholic
against Protestants, loyalists against those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's always tension between the Catholic minority that pushes
for a united Ireland, free of British rule, and the 60 percent
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious hatred can do, and has done _ bombings,
shootings and beatings, all especially brutal over the past 30
years _ makes parents overly protective of their children.
</P>
<P>
   And then the death of the Quinn boys in the early morning hours
of July 12 shocked the world and brought it to disbelieving tears.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney,
about five miles from Rasharkin. Outrage rocked Northern Ireland, a
place quite accustomed to violence, a place where 1.6 million
people had their hopes pinned on the Good Friday peace agreement
developed last April.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was endorsed in the Irish republic and on May 22, an
overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland voted to give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence would not be over that easily. Dissidents in
the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights
playing cards and TV games and drinking tea Mummy made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will
do. Things particularly get tense when July 12 approaches, the
anniversary of the 1690 battle when the Catholic army was defeated
by England's Protestant king. Catholics don't want Protestants
parading in their areas. Protestants say it's their right. Conflict
goes hand in hand with demonstrations and parades. And so do
sinister threats.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 Protestant and about 25 Catholic homes in
Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received
letters warning them to ``get out'' from a paramilitary group
identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the
envelopes had bullets in them. Many families left to live with
relatives elsewhere _ and are still staying away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's mom had recently moved to Rasharkin because it was
coming up to the 12th. On the 10th, two petrol bombs were hurled
into the house she left. It was empty so they just burned
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a letter. I thought I must be excepted,''
Chrissie says.
</P>
<P>
   There had been trouble in the past, but she thought it was over.
``Three years ago around July 12, my husband and my brother fought
with people in the square. It started because my childrens' tennis
ball went into the neighbor's yard.'' The neighbors were
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a different home in Ballymoney, her second
husband John Dillon, a Catholic, was shot. ``It took his thigh
away,'' Chrissie says. Shortly after, about 15 members of the UVF
came by ``to smash chairs through my windows.'' She asked the
housing executive to move her to another house. They said no.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that police visited and said they'd received a
``coded message'' warning that John's life was in danger. The
family fled to England. After six months Chrissie was homesick. She
and the boys returned. All was calm. Her four boys played football
with other children and went to the Protestant school. And now
there is only one.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie clings to a vow made by police, who Uncle Harry says
``haven't slept _ the whole team hasn't slept.'' ``They promised me
they'll never close this case until they get all of them. I know
there's more than one,'' Chrissie says. ``I want them all caught,''
she says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, the outpouring of grief from
around the world has stunned Chrissie Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you realize there's only a small percentage of
people who are evil,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of letters continue to arrive. Chrissie says some are
written in foreign languages _German, Japanese. It doesn't matter
to her. She knows that whatever the contents are, whoever sent them
meant well. Others offer words of sympathy. And still others
personal stories of their own tragic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Three innocent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Three lives lost in a horrible way.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? One confused brother and one devastated mother who
face spending the rest of their lives without them, trying to make
sense out of why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the outrage and outpouring of grief, Chrissie
believes, their brutal murders won't help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ireland won't get better. It won't change,'' Chrissie
sighs.

<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ The nightmare never ends. Every
horrific bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division
that political will has yet to mend.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinn family knows the violence all too well. In July,
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, three young sons, died in the first
major terrorist attack since the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, their mother, Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the
first time about her grief _ a family's dreams shattered, a
country's future in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she fears the grief will drive her insane,
Chrissie Quinn tells herself she's just having a nightmare and that
when she wakes up, all her boys will be alive, laughing and
inseparable, as they always were.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact three of her four boys are lying, inseparable
forever, side by side by side, in their graves. Only her eldest,
Lee, 13, is with her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brothers _ chatty Richard, 11, gentle Mark, 10, and
wee Jason, the warrior who turned nine just four days before they
died _ were murdered in an evil and cowardly way by someone who
used the name of God as a pitiful excuse for hatred. The family was
targeted while they slept; the terrorist tossed at least one,
perhaps more, firebombs into their home July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on merciful days, Chrissie is just numb. She's beyond
tears. Months later, the reality hasn't really sunk in.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winding road to Rasharkin, a town about 35 miles northwest
of Belfast, is quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn is staying in this mostly Catholic small town
with her mother. Along the way, sheep graze peacefully in gently
rolling hills people proudly describe as ``40 shades of green.''
Church bells seem to be always ringing. Weaving through villages,
one can see children playing in quiet streets with tidy flower
beds. The serenity is so deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Union Jacks mark areas where Protestants live. None fly in
pockets where Catholics dwell. The area suffers the undercurrent of
hatred that sweeps throughout Northern Ireland pitting Catholic
against Protestants, loyalists against those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's always tension between the Catholic minority that pushes
for a united Ireland, free of British rule, and the 60 percent
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious hatred can do, and has done _ bombings,
shootings and beatings, all especially brutal over the past 30
years _ makes parents overly protective of their children.
</P>
<P>
   And then the death of the Quinn boys in the early morning hours
of July 12 shocked the world and brought it to disbelieving tears.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney,
about five miles from Rasharkin. Outrage rocked Northern Ireland, a
place quite accustomed to violence, a place where 1.6 million
people had their hopes pinned on the Good Friday peace agreement
developed last April.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was endorsed in the Irish republic and on May 22, an
overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland voted to give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence would not be over that easily. Dissidents in
the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights
playing cards and TV games and drinking tea Mummy made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will

Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received

identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine if just a portion of world military spending was
redirected toward human development. In 1995, world military
spending totaled nearly $800 billion dollars.
 &HT;    If we channeled just $40 billion of that figure over the next 10
years into antipoverty programs, all of the world's population
would enjoy basic social services, such as education, health care
and nutrition, clean water and sanitation.
 &HT;    Another $40 billion over 10 years would provide all people on
the planet with an income above the poverty line for their country.
 &HT;    Since the end of the Cold War, many industrialized nations have
reduced their defense budgets. As a result, those countries' arms
merchants have turned to new clients in the developing world, where
the majority of today's conflicts take place.
 &HT;    The United States stands as an extreme case. Currently, the
world's only superpower is responsible for 45 percent of all
weapons deliveries in the world. And, in the past four years, 85
percent of U.S. weapons sales have gone to undemocratic governments
in the developing world.
 &HT;    During President Bill Clinton's first term in office, his
administration gave $35.9 billion to the militaries of
non-democratic governments for arms and training _ an average of $9
billion per year. This figure represents 82 percent of the $44
billion in total U.S. military support for developing nations.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, half of the world's governments dedicate more
resources to defense than to health programs. Such distortions in
national budgets contribute to poverty and retard human
development. War, and the preparation for war, is one of the
greatest obstacles to human progress, fostering a vicious cycle of
arms buildups, violence and poverty.
 &HT;    In South Asia, an arms race rages between India and Pakistan,
fueled by a dispute over the Kashmir territory. India spent more
than $12 billion on arms purchases from 1988 to 1992 alone _ more
than either Saudi Arabia or Iraq during the same period. From 1978
to 1991, Pakistan increased its defense budget sevenfold, so that
defense now accounts for nearly 40 percent of all government
spending.
 &HT;    These two nations, which rank alarmingly low on the Human
Development Index, spend exorbitant amounts on this unforgivable
arms race, leaving their people in their own desperate race against
time to merely survive.
 &HT;    In the past few years, two countries in Latin America have taken
historic steps toward ending once and for all the vicious cycle of
poverty and militarism.
 &HT;    Following the restoration of democracy to Panama in 1989 and to
Haiti in 1994, I helped persuade both countries to constitutionally
abolish their national armies, as Costa Rica did in 1949. As a
result, Costa Rica and Panama now enjoy the safest border in the
world.
 &HT;    Furthermore, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, may now dedicate more resources to crucial development
needs. These landmark decisions have shown the world that Costa
Rica is not a unique case. The abolition of national armed forces
is truly a viable option for many countries.
 &HT;    Commitments made toward demilitarization in the developing world
must be supported by responsible leadership in the global
community. Yet in several industrialized countries that manufacture
weapons, armament production is viewed as a vital source of
employment and income.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, world leaders must accept the fact that we cannot
let the free market rule the international arms trade. We must not
enrich ourselves through the commerce of death. Rather, we must
realize that the arms trade is most often a friend of dictators and
an enemy of the people.
 &HT;    The time has come to choose human lives over weapons. Indeed, we
must settle at nothing less than a comprehensive, international
effort to regulate and monitor arms transfers.
 &HT;    Toward this end, I convened a meeting this spring with seven
other Nobel Peace laureates _ Elie Wiesel, the Dalai Lama, Jose
Ramos-Horta, Betty Williams, and the directors of American Friends
Service Committee, Amnesty International and International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War _ to publicly unveil
an International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers.
 &HT;    This Code is also fully endorsed by eight more Nobel Peace
laureates: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa, Rigoberta Menchu,
Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Mairead Maguire, Norman Borlaug, Joseph
Rotblat and this year's winner, Jody Williams. Furthermore, former
President Jimmy Carter has expressed his strong support for the
Code of Conduct.
 &HT;    This International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers would
prevent undemocratic governments from building sophisticated
arsenals. Governments that systematically abuse internationally
recognized human rights through practices such as torture or
arbitrary executions would not receive military training.
 &HT;    Countries that commit genocide would not be able to buy
munitions. Governments engaged in armed aggression against other
countries or peoples could not buy missiles. States that support
terrorism would be prevented from acquiring weapons.
 &HT;    In addition, all nations would be required to report their arms
purchases to the United Nations. This Code of Conduct would
undeniably promote global security and protect human rights.
 &HT;    Current initiatives to restrict arms sales in the United States
and the European Union represent a first step toward our mission
for peace. Earlier this year, owing to back-room dealings and
political tricks, a U.S. Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers failed
to pass a joint House and Senate Conference Committee.
Nevertheless, its strong showing was indicative of the Code's moral
sway and great promise.
 &HT;    Across the Atlantic, Belgium and the United Kingdom have taken
the lead in promoting a comparable European version.
 &HT;    Some might question the Code's relationship to the free-market
concept of supply and demand. If a country's leaders want arms,
some might ask, who are we to say that they shouldn't have them?
 &HT;    First, since the end of the Cold War, arms manufacturers have
been aggressively promoting sales to the developing world in order
to compensate for the drastic reduction in arms purchases by most
industrialized countries. Furthermore, when we assert that a
``nation'' desires arms, to whom exactly are we referring?
 &HT;    (ital) Is the single mother in Indonesia or the street orphan in
Egypt pressuring government leaders to buy tanks and missiles? Or
is it a dictator _ who sees arms purchases as the only way to
maintain power? (end ital) The poor of the world are crying out for
schools and doctors, not guns and generals.
 &HT;    Another argument posited to justify the sale of arms is that, if
one country does not sell arms to a nation that wishes to buy them,
someone else will. That is precisely why all weapons-selling
nations must agree to certain common restrictions.
 &HT;    We can no longer say business is business and turn a blind eye
to the poverty and oppression caused by arms transfers. Just like
slavery and the drug trade, the arms trade reaps profits tainted
with blood.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine if just a portion of world military spending was
redirected toward human development. In 1995, world military
spending totaled nearly $800 billion dollars.
 &HT;    If we channeled just $40 billion of that figure over the next 10
years into antipoverty programs, all of the world's population
would enjoy basic social services, such as education, health care
and nutrition, clean water and sanitation.
 &HT;    Another $40 billion over 10 years would provide all people on
the planet with an income above the poverty line for their country.
 &HT;    Since the end of the Cold War, many industrialized nations have
reduced their defense budgets. As a result, those countries' arms
merchants have turned to new clients in the developing world, where
the majority of today's conflicts take place.
 &HT;    The United States stands as an extreme case. Currently, the
world's only superpower is responsible for 45 percent of all
weapons deliveries in the world. And, in the past four years, 85
percent of U.S. weapons sales have gone to undemocratic governments
in the developing world.
 &HT;    During President Bill Clinton's first term in office, his
administration gave $35.9 billion to the militaries of
non-democratic governments for arms and training _ an average of $9
billion per year. This figure represents 82 percent of the $44
billion in total U.S. military support for developing nations.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, half of the world's governments dedicate more
resources to defense than to health programs. Such distortions in
national budgets contribute to poverty and retard human
development. War, and the preparation for war, is one of the
greatest obstacles to human progress, fostering a vicious cycle of
arms buildups, violence and poverty.
 &HT;    In South Asia, an arms race rages between India and Pakistan,
fueled by a dispute over the Kashmir territory. India spent more
than $12 billion on arms purchases from 1988 to 1992 alone _ more
than either Saudi Arabia or Iraq during the same period. From 1978
to 1991, Pakistan increased its defense budget sevenfold, so that
defense now accounts for nearly 40 percent of all government
spending.
 &HT;    These two nations, which rank alarmingly low on the Human
Development Index, spend exorbitant amounts on this unforgivable
arms race, leaving their people in their own desperate race against
time to merely survive.
 &HT;    In the past few years, two countries in Latin America have taken
historic steps toward ending once and for all the vicious cycle of
poverty and militarism.
 &HT;    Following the restoration of democracy to Panama in 1989 and to
Haiti in 1994, I helped persuade both countries to constitutionally
abolish their national armies, as Costa Rica did in 1949. As a
result, Costa Rica and Panama now enjoy the safest border in the
world.
 &HT;    Furthermore, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, may now dedicate more resources to crucial development
needs. These landmark decisions have shown the world that Costa
Rica is not a unique case. The abolition of national armed forces
is truly a viable option for many countries.
 &HT;    Commitments made toward demilitarization in the developing world
must be supported by responsible leadership in the global
community. Yet in several industrialized countries that manufacture
weapons, armament production is viewed as a vital source of
employment and income.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, world leaders must accept the fact that we cannot
let the free market rule the international arms trade. We must not
enrich ourselves through the commerce of death. Rather, we must
realize that the arms trade is most often a friend of dictators and
an enemy of the people.
 &HT;    The time has come to choose human lives over weapons. Indeed, we
must settle at nothing less than a comprehensive, international
effort to regulate and monitor arms transfers.
 &HT;    Toward this end, I convened a meeting this spring with seven

   Lori Vara writes, looking for a recipe for a layered salad. The
one she remembers included lettuce, mushrooms and peas and perhaps
some grated cheese and egg. It's topped with ``some sort of
mayonnaise dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The original recipe was re-created by the home economists at
Kraft (gotta find more ways to use that mayonnaise). Over the
years, the recipe has evolved and been updated.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe is very similar to the original. The second
recipe is from the home economists at the Hawaiian Electric Co. and
puts a fusion twist on the proceedings.

   In a glass bowl, place shredded lettuce. Cover with a layer of
cucumber, then onion, then peas, then mayonnaise. Top mayo with
bacon and cheese. Refrigerate overnight, and serve. Make sure the
lettuce is on the dry side, however, or the salad will get runny
and will not be as good.

SMALL TOWN SEEKS RESPITE FROM BIG-CITY DRUGS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, N.H. _ Welcome to Newport, the ``Sunshine Town!'' where
the Main Street luncheon special offers all-you-can-eat for $5.95,
the major employer makes guns and golf clubs, the local weekly
bills itself as ``a good newspaper in a good community,'' and, in a
typical year, the 12-member police force registered 105 bicycles
and chased down 526 complaints involving dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin was but a whisper in the wilderness. That is, authorities
say, until Lidia Nunez, a convicted drug dealer from Massachusetts,
and her three sons came to town, relocating from the competitive
streets of Lawrence to this rural whistle-stop community of 6,110
in the Upper Connecticut River Valley. Branching out into a new
market with the help of locals, the group flooded Sullivan County
with their ``Kool Kat'' brand of heroin, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   The change was immediate: A county that prosecuted only two
cases involving heroin charges for more than a decade before the
Nunezes allegedly began selling in 1995 brought some 20
heroin-dealing cases in 1997 alone. Three people have died of
heroin overdoses in Newport during the past three years. In nearby
Claremont, police this month investigated three nonfatal heroin
overdoses in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Nunez organization has been run out of this
textile-mill town near the Vermont border _ and into the arms of
jailers and federal prosecutors, who are preparing to try Nunez as
a drug-conspirator in October.
</P>
<P>
   But as Nunez and one son await trial and two others await
sentencing, residents say scars remain.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of the case, they say, is in the shattering of
small-town lives _ and small-town life.
</P>
<P>
   Businesspeople and blue-collar workers got hooked on heroin and
hocked their possessions. Addicts blitzed the area with burglaries,
break-ins, and bad checks _ a cycle of neighbor ripping off
neighbor that robbed a small town of its innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On Main Street, residents say, the pulse of small-town life has
become disoriented. Motorists now lock their cars while strolling
downtown. Shopkeepers sheepishly ask for telephone numbers when
being paid by check. Pharmacists keep a sharp eye for stolen
pain-killer prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs have a corrosive effect on the soul of a community,''
said Marc Hathaway, the Sullivan County attorney who helped drive
out the group. ``People live here because they don't want problems
associated with big cities _ and we have them. It hurts. It hurts
people's sense of community ... It's just a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wiggins was a classic small-town guy, a hard-working,
hard-drinking man in a hard-working, hard-drinking town. In the
summer of 1995, the 34-year-old carpenter, machinist, and father
was found slumped in a car off a dirt road, after he suffocated
from too many drinks and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His death, and the heroin found in his body, exposed an
underground group of townspeople using the drug, which still
carried the reputation of a big-city vice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone dies in a small community, it's like a whole web,
and everyone has a thread to the family or person it's
affecting,''said Patryc Wiggins, 44, Peter's sister and an artist
and civic activist.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the Nunez clan may have been invited here by
local contacts who had bought drugs from them in Lawrence. The same
locals allegedly joined the gang, serving as guides, runners and
dealers to supply and broaden the circle. Two of Nunez's three
adult sons already have pleaded guilty, one earlier this month, to
conspiring to sell drugs. Nunez, 47, has pleaded not guilty. Her
lawyer did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   In Lawrence, police say, the Nunez family had long worn out
their welcome. Records show Nunez was convicted of dealing drugs in
1992 and of fraudulently obtaining $10,000 in welfare benefits in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think there's any mother-son relationship like you
see in `The Waltons,' do you?'' said Lawrence Police Lieutenant
Calvin Deyermond. ``This is pure and simple for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   So, police and prosecutors say, the Nunez group moved from the
alleys to the backwoods. Several times a week, they allegedly
shuttled heroin and cocaine from the teeming streets of Lawrence to
rustic Newport, driving two hours through a corridor lined with
pine trees, moose-crossing signs, bait-and-tackle shops, and white
church steeples that rise above the verdant valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the Newport area, police say, the out-of-town organization
set up shop in local homes, ordering in fast food and delivering
takeout drug orders, shunning sidewalk sales to avoid being spotted
as strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They drummed up sales by passing out free heroin samples at
local parties, like marketers testing a new brand of
pigs-in-a-blanket. They hopped from one house to another,
authorities said, dropping local members of the organization when
they became drug-addicted and cut into the profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on a mission,'' said Detective Lieutenant James
Brown, of the Newport Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend the Nunez group brought in $10,000 a week in
heroin and cocaine sales, offering heroin at $10 to $20 a bag to a
county customer base of more than 100 people. The users included a
husband, a housewife, and a former high school sports star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a convenience store,'' the onetime three-letter
man said of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin became so easily available in town, he said, he felt like
he was running in circles, kiting checks and moving money between
bank accounts like a three-card monte dealer; borrowing cash with
one hand while scoring heroin with the other, running up a $15,000
debt; buzzing on an hours-long heroin high only to crave more when
it ended to chase away the drug sickness that struck him like a
relentless flu, causing him to drop 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin is evil,'' said the 26-year-old man, who did not want
his name used. ``It'll ruin everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the range of users was staggering. One local man
propped his car up on blocks and sold the tires to feed his heroin
habit. He sold the car jack and tools, too. A Newport nurse lost
her job and moved out of town. Her husband lost his landscaping
business, and his home. He was sentenced to 7 1/2 to 20 years after
he was caught running drugs for the organization. He used to play
basketball with the local prosecutor in games at the recreation
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the people we put in jail were friends and
neighbors,'' said Hathaway, the Sullivan County attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunez case sparked a blaze of anger around town because
Newport, townspeople say, has a long history of being tough on
crime. In 1945, town officials offered a $25 war bond as a reward
information leading to the capture of the yeggs who stole three
gumball machines.
</P>
<P>
   So in December 1996, when word seeped out that heroin was in
town, police began infiltrating the network and, a year later,
rounded up the alleged ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   There is an increased threat of AIDS, officials say, with nearly
100 discarded drug needles being discovered last year. A Newport
drug counselor says she worries for the future of children
traumatized by strung-out parents.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of heroin came at a time when Newport was remaking
itself from a rough-and-tumble mill town into a quaint cultural
center, with an opera house, bandstand concerts on the common, and
a machine-tool museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no heroin problem _ after we got rid of the
`flatlanders' from your part of the country,'' said Arnold
``Spunky'' Dodge, 63, who has been waxing flattops and philosophy
from his Newport barber shop for almost 40 years. But he admits
``it changed everybody's way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge can see the changes through customers like Harley Cheney,
62, a retired Navy man. Cheney now locks the doors of his home to
keep out burglars looking for drug money. And he worries about
heroin getting too close to children like his 9-year-old grandson,
Jeremy. Now this grandfather watches anxiously as the boy bounds
off the barber's chair and into a new day, with a buzz cut and a
piece of Bazooka bubble gum.

streaks of cadmium yellows and oranges, brushes splayed and
tortured, paint flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to start with a gold base,'' Rotenberg was saying, more to
himself than his observer dodging paint. ``With time, the gold will
come through, the painting will brighten, and the picture will only
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in an image, is Harold Rotenberg: time-ripened, determined
to capture on canvas the midday shadows and impatient sunsets that
signal summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of artist to linear shoreline foot may be no greater
in Cape Ann than in Marblehead, Newburyport, Small Point, Maine, or
a dozen other New England coastal enclaves that get visually sliced
and diced each summer.
</P>
<P>
   But most artists aren't painters in their nineties whose work
hangs in the Isreali Parliament and Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
Rotenberg _ seemingly tireless, a dreamer, and a backseat driver of
some repute, according to his wife, Charlotte _ is a man who can
expound at length on the colors of air in a shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in his eighth decade in the neighborhood, Rotenberg
agreed to share his perch, opening the door to a favorite hangout
(he tends to save time by closing doors with a much blasphemed
cane). He unsheathed his brushes to look anew at one of New
England's most painted icons, Motif No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick,'' said Rotenberg as he continued splashing first
colors on the canvas, gaze fixed on the horizon, ``is to see and
feel the atmosph...''
</P>
<P>
   He interrupted himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, look at all the air in front of that rock!''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg lives outside Orlando, but comes to Rockport several
weeks each summer to visit his daughter Judi, a painter and owner
of the Judi Rotenberg Gallery on Newbury Street and the Square
Circle Gallery in Rockport. It was behind the Rockport Gallery, on
a patch of lawn secreted away from the throngs of tourists plying
the area, that the elder Rotenberg was scrutinizing the color of
shadow...
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadows,'' he continued. ``Shadows are as important as the
base tones on a piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes into it, his painting was beginning to look _ more
accurately, feel _ like the landscape before him, lobster boats in
the foreground, the granite pier with its grandstanding shack, the
outer harbor cluttered with sailing yachts capped by a granite
headland taking shape in splotches of color, not lines. This was
Rockport, but it was also a painting of 11:22 a.m. sunlight on a
New England day in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg is the son of an Attleboro clothing merchant who
taught his children the beauty of art and music. Lofty start _ but
it was lust for the sculpted female nudes created by his older
brother Frank that nudged him toward a career in art.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg attended the Boston Museum School, then, as now,
affiliated with the Museum of Fine Arts, and taught for several
years in the ``settlement houses'' for the poor that were located
in Roxbury, the West End, and the South End. On weekends he would
take the ferry to Provincetown or Rockport, renting a room for $5
weekly and painting landscapes with the 2-inch-wide blade of a
putty knife. Color then, and now, went on in rich globs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color gives form. So all you have to do is add composition,
and you've got a painting!''
</P>
<P>
   Some other Rotenberg truisms:
</P>
<P>
   ``God is so good. I thank him every day, every minute. He pours
in atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to see a painting in a frame. The frame is clothes,
the painting a naked woman. She's more interesting with a dress
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to make a painting. One to apply the paint, the
second to hit you over the head when it's done so you don't ruin
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, since school days Rotenberg has been coming to
Rockport seasonally, and now he and his wife live with Judi and her
family during visits. He is so much a local fixture in his
captain's hat and trim, parted beard that a film crew producing ``A
Love Letter'' the other day paid Rotenberg $40 just to stay put on
a bench while the action unfolded around him.
</P>
<P>
   His fears at age 93?
</P>
<P>
   ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear time, and I thank God for every minute because when I'm
gone, I will miss all of this,'' he said with a hand sweeping the
shadows and sunlight. ``Sometimes I wake up at night and just paint
pictures.''

MCGWIRE IS FOOLING HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire should get the asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, one of the two baseball players closing in on Roger
Maris's record of 61 home runs in a season, uses androstenedione, a
product that is converted to testosterone by the liver. The extra
testosterone aids in muscle growth and recovery.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a naturally occurring steroid, but in its six decades
of availability in synthetic form it has never been scientifically
tested for its effects. Andro's makers and marketers claim it is
nothing like anabolic steroids, which are a direct form of
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But concern is widespread that andro provides unnatural
advantages and may act enough like an anabolic steroid to cause
long-term damage. Anabolic steroids can injure the liver and heart,
cause cancer, and spark aggression. Andro is banned by the National
Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the
Olympics, and the men's tennis tour.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the shot put, Randy Barnes,
has been banned for life for using androstenedione. Lineman Paul
Wiggins of the Pittsburgh Steelers was suspended for four weeks for
testing positive for andro.
</P>
<P>
   In classified documents recently discovered about the East
German athletic program, andro was one of the substances that East
German officials developed to thwart the Olympic Committee's war on
testosterone. In the 1988 Games, such substances were reportedly
used without detection. East Germany finished second in total
medals behind the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   One East German swimmer said the replacement drugs provided the
feeling of a ``volcanic eruption.'' Andro was far from the worst
substance but was still part of a 20-year, 10,000 athlete
hormone-doping program that included East German Olympic prospects
as young as 10. Today, many former athletes, some of whom never
knew about the testosterone cocktails served by their coaches,
complain today of a wide range of effects, from uncontrollable
acne, deeper voices, and infertility in women to breasts in men and
cancer and liver dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Now the volcanic eruption is taking place in America's most
sacred sport. Curiously, most of the nation cheers. McGwire hides
behind the fact that it is a legal ``food supplement,'' a legality
born of a Congress and a Food and Drug Administration that err on
the side of profit rather than caution.
</P>
<P>
   His team, the St. Louis Cardinals, and Major League Baseball
both use ignorance as a shield, desperate to do anything to avoid
tainting McGwire's home runs. The Cardinals have said, ``Due to
current research that lacks any documentary evidence of any adverse
side effects, the Cardinals' medical staff cannot object to Mark's
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of seasoned sports columnists have actually looked at
the dubious usage of andro and have called for its immediate ban
from baseball locker rooms. The GNC nutritional chain has banned
andro, though it is flying off the shelves in muscle-headed stores
elsewhere in the nation. Almost everyone says children should not
take the substance.
</P>
<P>
   But many sports columnists defend McGwire with many novel
theories. They say andro does not taint his record because he hit
49 home runs in 1987 in his first full season. They say andro does
not taint him because he is otherwise an overachiever and
workaholic. They say andro does not taint him because it cannot
help the hand and eye coordination needed to hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Those who would repeat this mantra conveniently forget that the
vast majority of East German athletes, and Randy Barnes, Ben
Johnson, swimmer Michelle Smith, and other athletes who have
illegally used performance-enhancing drugs, were assuredly
overachievers, workaholics, and were powerful and well coordinated
in their natural state.
</P>
<P>
   The most common theme is that McGwire was no weakling before
andro; therefore andro is of minimal concern. But no professional
or Olympic-caliber athlete is a wimp. If andro added a mere single
home run to McGwire's total, that 1/62d or 1/63d improvement is no
different in spirit from Ben Johnson or East German swimmers
shaving hundredths of seconds off their Olympic times, fractions
that can separate medalists from athletes who did not even qualify
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   We can castigate the East Germans for their sins. We abhor
athletes who abuse drugs that cannot help them on the field, such
as alcohol or marijuana. Yet it seems that McGwire's roulette with
andro and the blissful adoration around him is another example of
how America, in its own way, stresses winning at all costs rather
than consider the cost of winning. Americans just can't seem to win
naturally these days, whether it be McGwire or American road
runners who participate in races where they can earn more money
with lower finishes than better trained and more determined foreign
runners.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will get an asterisk in the lore of baseball, because
sooner or later, the sport will take its head out of the sand and
ban the substance, thus causing all retrospectives to note his use
of it. We can only hope that there is no long-term cost to McGwire
himself. We do know this. In raising his testosterone to reach
Maris's record, McGwire has lowered the values of his sport. No
longer is it the best man who wins. It is the best-enhanced man.

A WORLD ON EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Schadenfreude'' is a German word for the undeniably human
trait of taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of it going around these days. It's nasty if it's
your misfortune, and can be delicious, in small doses, if it's your
enemy who's on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   If the American government of 10 years ago had been informed
that the Russian government was imploding, Russian soldiers were
begging kopecks for food in the shadow of the Kremlin, the Russian
banking system had collapsed, the ruble was turning to rubble, and
there was no painless way out of the economic calamity visited upon
the nation by ruthless and selfish oligarchs of low morals and
lower intelligence, the White House of that era would have been in
ectasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's crowd feared the Russians above everything, and
quadrupled our national debt in a headlong military buildup that
spawned a 600-ship Navy, more nuclear submarines than we could
possibly use, Stealth bombers at $2 billion a copy, as well as the
infamous $680 toilet seat and the hammer that cost the Pentagon
almost as much.
</P>
<P>
   If you gave Reagan the prostrate plutocracy that is Russia
today, the Gipper and his gang would have overdosed on
schadenfreude. In the Cold War era, which covered most of the
half-century between World War II and this morning, news of a
rubbery ruble, a weakened Kremlin, a toothless Russian Bear, would
have quickened heartbeats and encouraged stock markets in the free
world.
</P>
<P>
   A vast, brooding colossus of a country that had lost 18 million
dead to the Nazis, that had slaughtered much of its own officer
corps and imprisoned many of its finest intellects and artists, was
much to be feared by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes all the more incredible the spectacle of an American
president landing in the Russian capital in the midst of a Moscow
meltdown _ and trying his damnedest to keep his opposite number
from crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Boris Yeltsin is barely functioning. An ailing
alcoholic who behaves erratically, is out of business by lunchtime,
and cannot conduct a meeting for more than an hour, the Russian
president seems to be on his last legs, physically, mentally,
psychologically, symbolically. But there's not even a micro-trace
of schadenfreude aboard Air Force One, or in the clucking of the
camp followers of journalism. Because the US policy of engaging
Russia, defanging Russia, selling stuff to and buying stuff from
Russia, of loaning large sums and promising more, this all worked _
too well.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists used to joke about how the dumb capitalists would
sell them the rope with which to hang capitalism. ``We will bury
you'' was another Cold War yuk. Nikita banging his shoe at the UN
was ludicrous, until he went to the nuclear brink with Kennedy over
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now that communism destroyed itself, capitalism tried to come to
the rescue. Perhaps not as swiftly and as skillfully as we might
have. But the Russians keep screwing up. Unlike the Poles, who took
their bitter medicine and started to get better quicker, the
Russians have screwed around, and won't do the hard things, like
pay taxes, or obey the traffic rules of global markets.
</P>
<P>
   The US kept prodding the International Monetary Fund to throw
more billions into the furnace, to keep Russia stable. But the
world's Big Five leaders have all got problems. Clinton is hounded
from Martha's Vineyard's pillar to Moscow's post by Republicans
demanding his resignation or impeachment for dallying with a
20-something femme fatale.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's problems are about a thousand times more grievous than
Clinton's, but his Communist majority in the Duma hamstrings any
move he makes. Clinton's conservative Republicans and Yeltsin's
combative Communists conspire to render both men less effective in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Keizo Obuchi is impotent to tackle the bad-bank-loan
hangover that paralyzes the world's second-biggest economy. China's
Jiang Zemin heads a shaky, unelected government of oligarchs who
have just mishandled the worst flooding in decades, with dire
implications for the food supply of one-quarter of the earth's
people. Helmut Kohl faces an election this month that will likely
find him booted out of office. That's the lineup of the world's
five most important economies. Not exactly Murderer's Row.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stem the sort of panic that caused stock
markets around the world to quake, Merrill Lynch took out full-page
newspaper ads, headlined ``Putting the world into perspective.''
After a tour of the crumbling market horizons, the giant brokerage
firm concluded: ``In all these regions, we believe the markets are
increasingly looking for clear and decisive leadership, and that it
must come from key public policy makers.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no echo of agreement from the editorial pages, or
from the Congress. Clinton's personal conduct with an intern looms
larger in the media than any need for sound elected leadership. The
Republicans won't fund the IMF or give Clinton anything but the
most grudging cooperation. When it comes to Monica vs. monetary
policy, the media and Congress seem to prefer the young lady in the
beret.

PRINCESS DI _ A SHOT AT FIRST CELEBRITY SAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's said that every baby boomer can remember where he or she
was when John F. Kennedy was shot. I have no idea. But I remember
precisely where I was when I learned that Princess Diana had died
in a car crash. My father-in-law mentioned it just before breakfast
on the porch of my wife's lakeside cottage in New Hampshire. We all
thought he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Diana obtrudes in my daily life. No small amount
of marital tension attended ``our'' decision _ my wife's decision _
to rise at dawn and watch the Westminster Abbey funeral. Though no
fan of Diana's (I've been a Prince Charles man all along, and have
the clips to prove it), I did find the service, crooning and all,
to be quite moving.
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening year, Diana has impinged on me again and
again. I visited Paris this spring and found myself reading
graffiti (why, Alex?) at the makeshift shrine erected near the site
of the fatal crash. And I was the first Globe staffer to obtain the
ceremonial in memoriam Dianae plastic margarine tub released in
England. When I mentioned it in a column, a Globe editor insisted I
show her the actual object, by way of fact checking. And then she
made off with it. Such is life at the Great Metropolitan Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems that Diana may be with us ... forever.
</P>
<P>
   Who first bruited the notion that Diana might live on as a
saint? Pope John Paul II dropped a hint last summer in his
condolence message to Queen Elizabeth: ``The Holy Father has
offered prayers summoning her to our Heavenly Father's eternal
love.'' (Uh ... what about the Sixth Commandment?) In his recently
published analysis of women and theology, ``The World According to
Eve,'' Cullen Murphy quotes a feminist theologian saying that
Jesus' mother Mary ``cannot be a model for the New Woman.'' Murphy
notes that ``for a brief period in 1997 it seemed as if the
theological model for the New Woman might be Princess Diana.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. All the signs are there. The hawking of the relics.
The scholastic dispute over the Last Words. The suggestion of
``healing powers,'' put forward on television Monday night by
Diana's socialite pal Lucia Flecha de Lima. The three shrines: the
Alma underpass in Paris, the island at Althorp, and _ yes _
Harrods. The Althorp shrine bears a cross, and the following
inscription: ``Whoever is in distress can call on me. I will come
running wherever they are.'' The Gospel of Mark meets James Taylor
... I dig it.
</P>
<P>
   None of this Diana worship sits well with the Church of England,
of which the late princess was a nominal communicant. Wary of the
``cult'' of Diana, Lord Coggan, the retired archbishop of
Canterbury, condemned Diana's ``loose morals'' and branded her a
``false goddess.'' The bishop of Hull took to the airwaves earlier
this week to announce that ``the Church believes that the dead are
with God.'' The implication being: And they should stay there.
</P>
<P>
   One English publication has even dared to ask the toughest
question of all: Is Diana indeed with God? Writing in Prospect
magazine, a ``theologian'' named Philip Nobile examines her case.
(Can this be my old friend Phil, the former Penthouse editor? The
same! He tells me he made his theology bones at Holy Cross. But I
digress ...) Phil casts a cold eye on Diana's chances: ``The
argument for heaven, is, I am afraid, weak ... even the `cleansing
fires' of purgatory is a long shot.'' Roman/Anglican doctrine, Phil
concludes, ``leaves little room for optimism in Diana's case. But
that tells us more about the chilling core of Christianity than
about the ultimate worth of a young, kind, and sometimes foolish
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Eloquently stated. But it turns out there is hope. There is a
movement called Christians for the Cloning of Christ that wants to
engineer a Second Coming using genetic material from the Shroud of
Turin. So let's bring back Lady Di. For the right price, that
charming brother of hers will be willing to sell some DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Then she _ and we, her public _ can start the fairy tale all
over again. And who knows? Maybe this time she will live happily
ever after.

EXPERTS SAY MARKET SHOULDN'T DISCOURAGE RETIREMENT SAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Given the size of the headlines about the sharp
fluctuations in the stock market, it would come as no surprise if
retirement-minded investors like Carol Covington of San Francisco
cowered in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hiding, she's still as bullish as they come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not shaking in my boots,'' said Covington, a
self-employed curator and art dealer. ``I just feel like if you are
invested in a good company, it is still a great place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tarica, who retired from Chevron Corp. last year at 54,
turned his company stock over to Gary Pollock at Bay Isle Financial
in San Francisco and was out playing tennis Tuesday when some
retirees might have been apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith in our economy that it is not going to tank,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there is nervousness in the land this week. On Monday,
the Dow Jones industrial average _ the leading stock market
indicator _ plummeted 512 points or six percent. Despite a healthy
comeback after Monday's free fall, the market has lost much of the
gains it made this year.
</P>
<P>
   The skittishness explains why retirement plan investors on
Monday moved money at more than 4 1/2 times the normal pace,
pulling about $142 million out of stocks and putting it into
fixed-income investments and cash.
</P>
<P>
   It's prudent, as one nears retirement, to have a conservative
strategy and not be at the mercy of the market, Pollock said. But
the extraordinary range of client requirements and risk tolerance
means there's no such thing as one retirement investment plan that
fits all.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Colette Norman, a librarian at the College of San
Mateo, who is organizing an investment club for herself and about
20 working women, and will be investing for her retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stocks are still good buys,'' she said. ``We'll start
investing when the market hopefully is on an upward swing.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a discernible level of stock market panic among
people at or near retirement age, it's hard to find. For one thing,
many financial planners have correctly advised clients to make
portfolio adjustments to prepare for market volatility. Few have
heard from any anxious investors in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Investment adviser Barbara Rosenblum of Rosenblum, Silverman and
Sutton in San Francisco said people should expect occasional
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every few years you go through these external-driven events,
whether it be Russia or Japanese banks refusing to recognize their
loses or turmoil in the White House. They will pass. Will we have
more pain? Probably. Is this the end of the world? Absolutely not.
Will you feel like a fool a year from now if you sell securities
today? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about long-term taxable money and about
people who need to rely on this money,'' Rosenblum said, ``it is
absolutely gross stupidity to dump out a bunch of stocks and buy
them back a week from now and pay taxes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollock said investors close to retirement might have
three-fourths of assets in more conservative quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighten up on small cap. Lighten up on international stocks.
But don't worry,'' he said. ``The broad market is down
substantially from mid-July, but it was the 50 or so largest
companies that came down in the last couple of days that is causing
all this. There is good value out there and I do not see interest
rates or inflation as being of great concern _ and that's two out
of three legs of the market, with corporate earnings.''

   He was of medium height and medium weight. His hair was a medium
shade of brown. It's not a lot to go on, but Kimberly Ripley
intends to find the Massachusetts man who helped save her
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly one month ago a trucker sideswiped Ripley's car on
Interstate 95 near the Virginia-North Carolina line. He had been
weaving his tractor-trailer in and out of traffic for about two
miles before the impact forced her tiny Hyundai off the road and
into the woods. Her car rolled over twice before slamming into a
pine tree and coming to rest on its roof.
</P>
<P>
   Ripley was battered and bruised but managed to free herself from
the wreckage. Her three children _ Elizabeth, 9; Ricky, 7; and
Andrew, 1 _ were trapped in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter was unconscious. Her first grader's leg was broken.
Her baby was hysterical. The trucker and his 18-wheeler were long
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Ripley was near hysteria herself when, seemingly out of
nowhere, a stranger's hands reached through the shattered rear
window and eased first Ricky, then Elizabeth, and finally Andrew
out of the car and onto the grass a safe distance from the smoking,
twisted metal.
</P>
<P>
   The man who rescued Kimberly Ripley's children from the burning
car identified himself as an emergency medical technician from
Massachusetts. He had been driving directly behind her. Just before
the crash, he had called police from his car phone to report the
trucker's erratic driving. If he told her his name it did not
register in all the confusion at the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   She watched him find a board on the side of the highway and use
it to set her son's leg. She saw him wave down passersby to solicit
blankets, ice, towels, whatever makeshift aids he could use to
stabilize her injured children. By the time Ed Miraglia, a nurse
from Bowie, Md., pulled over to help, the EMT from Massachusetts
had the situation well in hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the kids out of the car, the severity of the accident
became starkly apparent to Kimberly Ripley. The spare tire had been
pushed into the back seat; the jack had been thrown into the front
passenger seat. The infant car seat that had held Andrew had
crumpled like paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andrew only had burns from the straps of his car seat and some
scratches. It's miraculous that he, that all of us, weren't
killed,'' says Ripley, who passed out when she saw the extent of
the damage and how close her family had come to tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   When Ripley regained consciousness at Halifax Hospital, the EMT
from Massachusetts was at her bedside. He told her it had taken the
ambulances about 45 minutes to arrive but that her two youngest
children had remained remarkably calm.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth was the most severely injured. The head trauma that
had knocked her out during the rollover kept her in the intensive
care unit for four days and hospitalized for many more after that.
She remains under the care of a team of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sobbing, `I almost killed us all; I almost killed my
family,' and this man kept consoling me, telling me that it was not
my fault, that I had not caused the accident, that the truck driver
was the one responsible,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until she stopped crying that she noticed that the
man she calls ``my hero'' was holding new toys, a stuffed white
kitten for her little girl and some toy soldiers for her boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember he told me that he went to Wal-Mart after the
ambulances took us away and then he came to the hospital to check
on us. He bought toys to try to cheer up my children. Can you
imagine? And I don't even know his name.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina Highway Patrol is still looking for the
driver of the tractor-trailer who hit the Ripley family on I-95
three miles south of the Virginia border and then ran. Kim Ripley
hopes the police find him but, for her part, she is looking for the
man from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the stranger who stops to help an injured man
on the roadside is a crucial element of the biblical story of the
Good Samaritan. There is virtue in doing good without any
expectation of acknowledgment or reward.
</P>
<P>
   In this story, however, the stranger from Massachusetts _ the
emergency medical technician with the medium build and the medium
brown hair _ could perform one more act of kindness for the Ripley
family by raising his hand.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mother in Mechanicsville, Va., who really needs to
say, ``Thank you.''

BRAVO, PORTLAND, ORE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. -- In Beijing, Chinese officials are admitting
their environmental mistakes. Clear-cutting timber near the Yangtze
River, they acknowledge, created runoffs of rainwater and huge
floods. As soldiers piled up sandbags, officials issued a formal
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The American habit is not to apologize, but to move on while
correcting past mistakes. In the hub of this continent's timber
industry, Portland today is livable and walkable because the city
undid mistakes, then developed a habit of undoing them.
</P>
<P>
   The 450,000 residents of the nation's 30th largest city, as well
as the almost 2 million in its metropolitan area, are heirs to a
sophisticated land use and transportation policy begun by a native
of Massachusetts, Tom McCall, elected governor in 1966. To save the
Willamette River from environmental depredation, he envisioned
parkways similar to what his grandfather, Governor Samuel Walker
McCall, recommended to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, McCall was a Republican. In other states,
``land use'' is regarded as a Bolshevik plot. But here the respect
for Oregon's majestic mountains and the mighty Columbia River also
extends to the built environment. Today, thousands enjoy the Tom
McCall Waterfront Park, where cars once roared along a major
highway, blocking off downtown from the river.
</P>
<P>
   In civic design, success breeds success. Portland is planning a
similar park on the west bank, between the Willamette and I-5.
</P>
<P>
   To move people, Portland has invested heavily in mass transit.
The city's new convention center is on the West Side near the
sports arena in the Rose Quarter. Trolley service departs
frequently from downtown and the ride is free. In the summer and
fall, antique open-air trolleys cross the 1912 Steel Bridge, with
commentary from conductors like Frank Weiler: ``Skidmore Fountain,
built in 1888, for man, horse and dog. ... Old Town district, site
of cast-iron and terra cotta buildings from the 1890s.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown's architecture is robustly Richardsonian and
Sullivan-esque. Because land use policy has stymied the bulldozer,
ad agencies are moving into old warehouses in the newly named Pearl
District.
</P>
<P>
   The city is celebrating a new West Side trolley line the way
Boston is anticipating the finish of the Big Dig. ``It's a very big
deal,'' says former Governor Barbara Roberts. ``We have 18 miles of
light rail that run from the city east and we're about to open
another 18 miles going west. It will be one of the most significant
movement of people, particularly during rush hours, that has ever
occurred. Portland is one of those cities that has gotten better
instead of worse. Our growth, instead of destroying the city, has
enhanced the community. The thing that's made the difference is
politicians not being afraid to take on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's triumph has been East Side, West Side and bipartisan.
In seeking federal funding, Les AuCoin, a former congressman,
recalls that the West Side line's ambitions lengthened when he won
a seat on the House Appropriations Committee. A Republican senator
from Oregon already chaired the Senate panel. ``If Mark Hatfield
had to do it alone,'' he says, ``I don't know how short that track
would have been, maybe half the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time this city left a major decision to chance was in
1845, when it was still an anonymous settlement 78 miles east of
the Pacific Ocean. Two New Englanders, Asa Lovejoy and Francis
Pettygrove, flipped a coin for the naming rights. Lovejoy, a
Bostonian, lost and Pettygrove named it after his hometown of
Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Portland takes to heart what Tom McCall said of the
first effort to rescue the Willamette: ``This great environmental
triumph could prove to be a Pyrrhic one if we don't keep the
pressure on. It won't stay clean if we languish in the admiration
of our own handiwork.''

<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Conn. _ Michelle is sitting in a green wooden beach
chair completely as God made her 15 years ago, talking about tan
lines. Or lack thereof. ``We have Teva lines,'' she giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle's feet have the white strips that come from wearing
sandals and nothing else. So do most of the hundreds of undraped
folks, from toddlers to octogenarians, who flock to the Solair
Recreation League's woodsy hideaway at the end of a narrow dirt
road in the state's ``quiet corner'' just south of the
Massachusetts border.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer since 1937, Solair's members, most of whom live
within a two-hour drive, have passed through the big wooden gate,
doffed their clothes and gamboled unencumbered and unabashed among
the resort's 350 acres.
</P>
<P>
   They sun themselves beside the lake and the heated outdoor pool,
working on the nudist's classic head-to-toe bronzage. They hike
along Bare Trail, swatting insects seeking a fleshy feast. They
play volleyball and shuffleboard, they marinate in the hot tub,
they circle their chairs for wine-and-cheese before the Sunday
exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come up here and we have a community,'' says Phil, who
brings his wife and daughter up from New Haven. ``It's almost
secondary that we don't wear clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the whole idea of Solair, which bills itself as a family
nudist resort, is to be naked. Most of the nearly 300 full-time
members, who pay $1,333.50 a season (per couple) are social nudists
year-round, and many belong to the American Association For Nude
Recreation, whose 50,000 members are ``clothed when practical,
unclothed when possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Solair's members will toss on a shirt when they're frying their
breakfast bacon or when their shoulders are burned pink from the
sun, and the women will wear a sports bra on the tennis court and
shorts during certain feminine days. But most of the time they're
nude right down to their sandals, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We notice when you're wearing clothes,'' says Michelle, who
has been coming to nudist resorts since she was 4. ``We don't
notice when you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny weekend day, Solair's spacious grounds are filled
with 400 or more bare bodies strolling and lolling, gardening,
paddling canoes, tooling around on golf carts and standing in line
at the canteen for knockwurst-and-sauerkraut sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that you can do clothed, Solair's members do naked,
although they usually sit on towels for sanitary reasons. Bathing
suits actually are banned on the beach, not that anyone would ever
wear them. ``They're nasty,'' testifies Michelle. ``They're sticky,
you get sand in them ... Once you go without, you just can't go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Solair's community (nobody inside the gate has called it a
colony for years) believes that nude is natural. If it was good
enough for Adam and Eve....
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, people forget to put their clothes back on when
they leave,'' chuckles one father, who brings his family down from
Oxford, Mass., every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gate, it is easy to forget that the rest of the world
wears tops and bottoms and looks askance at those who don't. So
most of Solair's devotees will happily reveal everything but their
real names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say most of our members are in the closet,'' says Billie
Carlson, a retired ob/gyn nurse and grandmother who serves as
Solair's membership director.
</P>
<P>
   There are still too many bosses, clergy, relatives, and
neighbors who think nudists are a shameless bunch of libertines who
are anything but natural. ``People have been raised to think the
only time you should be nude is to have sex or take a shower,''
Carlson says.
</P>
<P>
   So except for a handful of full-timers like Carlson (``I'm not
ashamed of it'') and her husband, Ed, most of the nearly 700 people
who come to Solair regularly will give only their first names, if
that, to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know lots of people who don't want their last names used, or
don't want any mailings,'' says Butch, an engineer from
Massachusetts who belongs to the community with his wife, son, and
daughter, and says his friends, relatives, and customers all know
he's a nudist.
</P>
<P>
   People on the outside tend to have odd notions of what goes on
inside. ``They think it's one big orgy,'' says a mother, laughing.
In fact, Solair is approximately as erotic as Water Country.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is naked, the mystery and titillation that come
from concealment vanishes. Every bulge and blemish is out in the
open. Like most nudist resorts, Solair is filled with average
people with average shapes. The American Association For Nude
Recreation estimates that only 5 percent of its members have
``exemplary bodies'' and that a third have surgical scars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pluck 100 random shoppers out of Kmart and defrock them and
you would have roughly the same physical spectrum, from perky to
paunchy, from strapping to sagging.
</P>
<P>
   Solair's members are doctors and housewives and teachers and
policemen and artists and real estate agents. ``We're a
cross-section,'' says Carlson. The folks inside the big wooden gate
aren't much different from those outside. They just go through a
lot more towels.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All there was in the beginning was the woods and a lake filled
with leeches and snakes. Solair's pioneers slept in tents, cooked
outdoors, and used a plank and a pail for a toilet. They didn't
bother with electricity until 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came here there was one light in the whole
camp,'' remembers one member, who joined four decades ago. ``The
shower was two 55-gallon drums on top of the canteen. The first
people in got the hot water, where it was warm from the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Solair is a cooperative ``cottage resort'' whose full-time
members reside in everything from trailers to upscale houses,
throwing on clothes to go out for groceries. Some are snowbirds who
head south once the leaves fall. Others make weekend pilgrimages
year-round, skating and skiing (usually clothed) in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Solair has cabins and rooms and trailers for vacationers, plus
campsites with R/V hookups. A two-story pavilion provides a hot
tub, sauna, rec room, showers, and toilets. A roofed outdoor picnic
area serves as a dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Though the resort has made some concessions to the outside
(such as street signs, so fire engines and ambulances can find
their way around), Solair remains a refuge for those who want to
shed the world beyond the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me, what did you think of the bombing in
Sudan?'' Butch says. ``I had no idea about the bombing. I'd been
here all week.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still an Edenesque innocence to Solair, whose members
seem to assume that the world's stresses, dangers, and temptations
can be shed along with their clothes. Parents let their kids wander
about unsupervised. Teenaged girls stroll nonchalantly past
middle-aged men. ``I'm naked,'' one of them shrugs. ``So, what's
the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Life inside the gate is casual, unhurried, collegial,
deliberately family-oriented. Parents pull chairs around in a
circle and bring out chips and dips and drinks. Teens, who have
their own rec room, horse around on the raft, shoving each other
into the water. Kids frolic on the swings. Grandmas, some of them
wearing makeup and jewelry, sun themselves by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The things that go on here are the same things that go on at
any other resort,'' says Phil's wife. ``That isn't something that
people who don't come here would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Solair offers pig roasts and talent shows and scavenger hunts
and dances. There's even a camp song (``When the weekend comes
around, they all wonder where we run...''), but everyone's
forgotten it.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers are welcomed as kindred spirits _ as soon as they
remove their clothes. ``We follow kindergarten rules here,'' says
one member. ``Get along in the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the outside world does not follow kindergarten rules, and
Solair's campers understand that. So prospective members, who must
be interviewed by different members on each of four visits, are
carefully screened to weed out unsuitables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask them how they got interested in social nudism,'' says
Billie Carlson. ``Have they been to other resorts? Are they
married? Does their wife know? How does their family feel? What's
their idea of what goes on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Solair's members have concluded, some of them from unpleasant
experience, that most outsiders have the wrong idea of what goes on
here. Though pollsters found that 40 million Americans had gone
skinny-dipping (and that was in 1985), most people think social
nudism aberrant, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neighbor's daughter asked our daughter where she was going
for the weekend, and our daughter told her,'' one father says.
``The neighbor wouldn't let her daughter play with our daughter
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So the members, especially teenagers, are careful about what
they tell to whom. ``I told one friend, and she told people at
school,'' says Michelle, who won't give her real name. ``But I'm
such a good pretender that nobody believed her. `Can you imagine me
going to a nudist camp?' I told them. `Knowing my family? No
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is the inside and the outside, Michelle says, ``and you
don't mix the inside with the outside.'' Outside Solair's gate are
those who'll skinny-dip but won't go naked, who can't separate
nudity from sex, who are uncomfortable in their own skins. Inside
are those who have stripped life to its bare essentials. By their
Teva lines shall ye know them.

INSIDE JETER'S HEAD; FLIPPING OVER MOVIE WIGS; OD'ING ON RITALIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the eyes of the baseball world are fixed upon the
McGwire/Sosa home-run derby, there's been another riveting hardball
spectacle this summer.
</P>
<P>
   I speak of the extraordinary constellation of talent at the
shortstop position. Has there ever been a trio to match Nomar
Garciaparra of our own Red Sox, Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle
Mariners, and Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   In this month's GQ, Peter Richmond tries to get inside Jeter's
head. Richmond finds baseball, and only baseball, there; like
Nomar, Jeter lives for the game, and like Nomar, he is a
less-than-scintillating interview. But that's OK. We can never be
reminded enough that when it comes to athletes, they are what they
do, and being a scintillating interview is not what they do.
Besides, Jeter has other virtues: He doesn't swear (!), he gives to
charity, he signs autographs for anyone who asks, and he insists he
did not, rumors notwithstanding, ever take erstwhile girlfriend
Mariah Carey to a strip joint.
</P>
<P>
   The conceit of Richmond's piece is his admitted attempt to
shoehorn Jeter into his own personal cosmology, which stars the
23-year-old shortstop as the latest in a line of quietly noble
Yankees _ Mel Stottlemyre, Ron Guidry, Don Mattingly _ who act as
counterweights to the man Richmond clearly sees as evil incarnate:
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond goes so far as to hope that Jeter's innate goodness
will somehow stop the dastardly Steinbrenner from abandoning Yankee
Stadium. It will touch a chord with Bostonians who fantasize about
saving Fenway Park.

   Sure, the last episode of ``Seinfeld'' was a dud, but hey, so
was the entire final season of the show, so it shouldn't have
surprised anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The best reason to keep tuning in during the sitcom's lengthy
swan song was the sprightly malice Julia Louis-Dreyfus brought to
her portrayal of Elaine Benes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as we prepare to embark on the first ``Seinfeld''-free TV
season in a decade, Louis-Dreyfus is getting on with the rest of
her life. She talks about it in the current issue of Movieline, or
rather, she tries to, in the face of a jarring inquisition by
writer Martha Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, I guess, Frankel eschews the puffball questions
and sycophantic stance toward her subject that ensnares most
writers of celebrity profiles. The problem is that Frankel seems to
think that she and her calculatingly ``shocking'' questions to
Louis-Dreyfus are the stars of the story. The effect is simply
annoying, not eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   Better by far is Joe Queenan's amusing analysis of some of the
more preposterous wigs in movie history. Queenan claims that a
character's wig is a tipoff as to whether he or she will perish
before the movie is over; the worse the wig, the cloudier the
character's future.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Queenan writes: ``One highly noticeable thing in wig
movies is that the characters themselves are often stunned by the
wigs they confront. ...Armed with a disorienting pageboy in
`Richard III,' Olivier is able to befuddle his rivals and seize
control of England just by prancing around and fiddling with his
bangs.''

   American Photo celebrates its 20th anniversary with, among other
things, founding editor Sean Callahan's recollection of the last
years of photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White.
</P>
<P>
   A glamorous figure in her prime, Bourke-White was alone,
virtually friendless, and struggling with Parkinson's disease by
the time Callahan was dispatched to her Connecticut house on a
mission of mercy in 1970 by an editor at Life magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The woman known as ``Maggie the Indestructible'' did not ask for
pity. She did accept Callahan's help, however, in finding a way to
use her old photographs as a way to raise money for her medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Because Bourke-White had not spent much time exhibiting her
photographs or making fine prints, her old photos were in poor
condition, according to Callahan. He describes the friendship that
grew between them as he helped her assemble her life's work for a
book (``The Photographs of Margaret Bourke-White'') while he
regaled her with tales of ``Eisie'' (Alfred Eisenstaedt) and her
other colleagues at Life. Her speech hindered by Parkinson's,
Bourke-White was forced to communicate with her eyes. The symbolism
is not lost on Callahan.
</P>

   The use of Ritalin, a drug for treating attention deficit
disorder, has increased by an astonishing 700 percent since 1990,
much of it prescribed for children.
</P>
<P>
   In a thought-provoking essay in the fall issue of DoubleTake,
Lawrence H. Diller, a specialist in behavioral pediatrics, warns
that our ``obsession with performance'' has led to an over-reliance
on Ritalin as a means of ``medicating away'' shortcomings in
parenting, education, and managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Diller writes: ``To give medication for a condition whose chief
trait is the failure to perform up to one's potential _ or to
manage one's life efficiently _ crosses the line, in my view,
between treating a disorder and enhancing a particular aspect of
personality.''

   If you've ever stood outside a burning building and marveled at
those whose sense of duty propels them inside, you shouldn't miss
Rick Bass's terrific piece on firefighters in the September Men's
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Bass tags along with an old high-school buddy who's now a
volunteer firefighter in Texas. His friend once thrived on
disorder, but now he leaves his house in the middle of the night to
join the fight to restore order from blazing chaos. In describing
the changes in his friend and his own reactions to the ``awful
animal'' of fire, Bass emerges with a story equally rich in
you-are-there detail and psychological insight.
</P>
<P>
   He tells us how the insides of a firefighter's nostrils become
caked with carbon during an especially hot fire, and how the
fragments tumble out of their noses for days afterward. He tells
how firefighters trapped by flames can create a ``water curtain''
by cutting a slit in a fire hose.
</P>
<P>
   But Bass also goes deep into the heart of what makes a
firefighter tick: ``that they yearn, have a need bordering almost
on addiction, to feel life deeply sharply. They also want to do
good, for any of a million different reasons.''

 &HT;    CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS FOLLOW IN WAKE OF CLINTON'S WORDS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is drawing on his fabled gift of
gab in his counteroffensive to rescue his administration. But his
efforts to take refuge in popular issues is creating deeper cracks
in his support.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to the credo of Richard Nixon to ``nail down your
base'' first, Clinton has carved out time in the midst of crises at
home and abroad to meet with his most loyal voter groups after his
admission of a sexual liaison with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On the Massachusetts resort island of Martha's Vineyard last
week, Clinton clasped hands with veterans of the civil rights
movement and linked himself to one of the cherished heroes of
racial equality, Nelson Mandela. Under fire for his improper
relations with a 21-year-old White House intern, the president
likened his situation to that of Mandela, who spent 27 years in
prison doing hard labor for leading the opposition to South
Africa's white apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested that he had learned from Mandela how to
forgive ``people you believe have wronged you,'' apparently putting
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in a category with Mandela's
racist tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   If that was a stretch inviting ridicule or outrage, Clinton
emerged temporarily unscathed, with images of a warm embrace by a
group of his most ardent defenders. But he may now be paying a
price, as in a chiding from Clifford Alexander, who was a prominent
black member of three Democratic administrations and former
secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in trouble, and even when he's not, Bill Clinton is
known to play fast and furious with issues of race,'' writes
Alexander in Wednesday's editions of The Wall Street Journal, in
which he lambastes Clinton for portraying himself as being at the
center of the struggle for racial equality and then failing to give
the subject ``concentrated leadership, thought and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's role in his race initiative had been more as a
``TV talk-show host'' than leader, Alexander says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempts to rejuvenate his languishing education
agenda falls into a similar danger zone. Just since his confession
Aug. 17 of the liaison with Lewinsky, the president has made three
visits to schools, including an appearance with First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton at a Moscow elementary school. All the events
stressed his interest in a subject dear to the hearts of his
``soccer mom'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping off in Herndon, Va., on Monday before his departure for
Russia, Clinton met a friendly crowd eager to rally behind ideas
for better schools. However, the visit Monday was marred by one
prominent local ex-supporter who didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply could not bring myself to come and be with Mr.
Clinton,'' said Jane K. Strauss, a Fairfax County school board
member, in an interview after she boycotted the appearance. ``I
can't support somebody who on the one hand says he supports the
rights of women and the protection of women when in fact he is
taking advantage of a young woman who is not much older than my own
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hiding behind schools and children to somehow convince us
that we can believe him and that we can trust in his judgment,''
added Strauss, a Democrat who said she twice voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now even Clinton's education proposals are ``hollow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's unfinished agenda for schools could add to
his credibility problems. Although he vowed a year and a half ago
to make education his top priority for his second term, he has
failed to deliver on most of his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Still undelivered and mired in difficulties are national testing
to raise standards, linking up every classroom to the Internet, and
money to help rebuild crumbing schools. Not only has his plan to
pay for 100,000 new teachers flopped, but a teacher shortage has
grown so acute in some areas that the Bronx school department in
New York has begun importing teachers from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked only in fits and starts on these and other
issues, raising yet more questions as Clinton travels overseas and
beams back messages tailored for American ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have asked to be forgiven'' for the Lewinsky matter, he said
Wednesday in his Moscow press conference, although he has yet to
ask the public formally for forgiveness. He then added that he now
plans to go ``back to work.'' But much of that work will be
restoring his lost credibility.

STATS PROF FINDS FAME AS A WRITER: WHAT ARE THE ODDS ON THAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.  R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amir Aczel, quiet, 50ish, professor of statistics at Bentley
College, was leading the simple academic life until he decided to
write offbeat books. His clear explanation of how taxpayers can
decrease their chances of being audited by the Internal Revenue
Service _ ``How to Beat the IRS at Its Own Game'' _ sold only
fairly well, possibly because most people think they haven't a
prayer of beating the old, unfriendly IRS.
</P>
<P>
   He was already an established textbook author, but that was
drudgery. ``General nonfiction editors have influence on your
work,'' he summed it up, ``but textbook editors tell you what to
do. Writing general books is much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   His premise was simple. The IRS uses probabilities to allocate
its scarce resources, betting that audits of certain kinds of tax
returns will turn up more deliquencies than auditing other types
will. And he spelled out what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   Then Aczel wrote another book, a history of the origin and
solution of the most famous theorem (certainly not the most
important, but the most intriguing) in pure mathematics. And
somehow, ``Fermat's Last Theorem'' spent months on the New York
Times bestseller list. It surely was purchased by some people who
would have trouble passing Algebra 101, but who were intrigued by
the mystery of it all.
</P>
<P>
   If you had tried to sell a book about Fermat to a major New York
publisher, it would have been like selling suntan lotion to a
death-row inmate. ``Fermat's Last Theorem'' was published by a
small press house, and its surprising success brought Aczel a New
York-style contract (from Harcourt Brace) for his latest work, a
history of speculation on life in the universe and a short course
in the statistics needed to set up the problem and calculate the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't set out to write a book about the prospect
of other intelligent life forms in the universe. He wanted to write
a book on polling techniques. He has, on occasion, turned his
business statistics students at Bentley into a polling operation.
``We set up a phone bank at Bentley to predict the outcome of the
'92 election,'' Aczel recalled. They used ``the usual system,
calling random phone numbers in all the states and asking the
person who answers the phone who they voted for,'' he explained.
``But we used a more sophisticated statistical technique to
estimate the margin of error than the commercial pollers do. We hit
it much closer and just as fast as the networks, with a margin of
error of less than 2 percent.'' But nobody wanted a book about
polling.
</P>
<P>
   Quite by accident, Aczel got interested in the techniques of
carbon-dating archaeological specimens. The carbon dates (which
depend on the kinds of radioactive carbon atoms in the sample) are
always expressed as a probability, such as: ``Two thousand years
before present, plus or minus 750 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistic the daters used,'' Aczel continued, ``was not as
powerful as some new ones, and I started recalculating the carbon
dates with a new method _ it happens to be called `bootstrapping' _
and was able to narrow the plus-or-minus by quite a bit.'' And that
got him interested in the island of Santorini, a Mediterranean
caldera, or exploded volcano, with a civilization buried under
volcanic ash, a sort of gigantic Pompeii, and a classic place for
radio carbon dating of everything from food to clothing to human
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Aczel sighed, ``no one wanted a book on Santorini.'' By
this time, three years ago, he was working with an editor at
Harcourt Brace, whom he had found by walking into a Harcourt Brace
office with a copy of ``Fermat's Last Theorem'' and requesting to
speak to an editor. (Writing is like horse racing; track record is
everything.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want a book on polling, she said `no' on
Santorini.'' What she wanted was for someone to pick up a project
that the late Carl Sagan had started. She wanted a book on the
probability of life out there, and here was Amir Aczel, professor
of statistics. The match was made.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, ``Probability 1,'' due out late this month, very
much resembles ``Fermat's Last Theorem,'' which amounted to a
short, clear, history of mathematics from the Greeks to the French
Enlightenment, before moving on to the proof of Fermat's theory.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Aczel starts with the earliest theories, in the
classical Greek era, that suggested that because there were so many
stars out there, surely there was someone else out there. Then,
just to make sure the reader is following the argument, Aczel
supplies a brief, but believable, history of cosmology, the Big
Bang, the formation of galaxies, solar systems, and the beginnings
of life.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for under a hundred pages. ``I think I am in the habit
of explaining the basics, that comes from writing textbooks, and
teaching introductory statistics.'' But that would appear too
modest, since some very bright people are incapable of teaching
elementary statistics to students. It is a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Having summed up the history of the ideas and the scientific
knowledge of the universe, Aczel turned, under his editor's
prodding, to the statistical part, to calculating the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sum it up,'' Aczel remarked, ``it is pretty simple. If
there are an almost infinite number of stars, which is certainly
the case, then even if the chance of life happening by the random
joining of atoms to make up a DNA molecule, or something that works
like replicating DNA on Earth, is almost infinitely small, it still
works out to be almost certain that somewhere out there is
something intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   As he noted, with every better telescope, we find more galaxies,
each with trillions of stars, so the almost infinite number of
planets around this almost infinite number of stars, even when
multiplied by an infinitely tiny chance of life starting comes to
one. And in statistics, one is unity, one is the whole shooting
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probability 1'' includes a brief history and clear explanation
of the whole idea of listening for a signal from space. Aczel is
kind, but not sympathetic. ``I was intrigued,'' he said, ``that
when the federal government stopped funding the listening posts,
the private donors that came up with the money were all computer
people: David Packard, Bill Gates. I wonder what they thought the
first message from outer space was going to be, an order for a
billion PCs with Windows 98?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he concluded, ``we should worry about this planet. I
would be surprised if they got a signal, ever. And what will we
they do with a signal that's going to be from billions of light
years away, which means it is billions of years old? Not much, I'm
afraid.''

REVIVING A MORIBUND BRODERBUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere lately, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the once-popular educational computer game have
languished in the past year as its parent company, Broderbund
Software Inc., lost its way in the competitive field of consumer
software.
</P>
<P>
   But Learning Co. Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which acquired
Novato, Calif.-based Broderbund and its stable of well-known
software titles this week for $290 million in stock, says Carmen is
going places again.
</P>
<P>
   The company Tuesday outlined an aggressive plan to revive Carmen
Sandiego and the rest of Broderbund's best-known software brands _
a strategy that could help it become a billion-dollar player in the
home software market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easier to revive a successful brand than create a
new one,'' said Kevin O'Leary, president of Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the company's new marketing campaign, ``Broderbund
is back,'' is to return the Broderbund name and its portfolio of
software brands ``to the level of performance that the most coveted
equity in the consumer software industry should have,'' O'Leary
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Carmen Sandiego, Broderbund's best-known brands include
KidPix, The Print Shop, Arthur and Family Tree Maker. But the
company's share of the education software market has declined
steadily over the past few years, falling from 11 percent in 1996
to less than 6 percent in the first half of this year. Sales of its
6-year-old Carmen Sandiego brand have also collapsed. Last year, it
sold 176,000 copies. Through the first half of this year, it sold
only 37,500 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Learning Co. has a proven track record that leads
them to believe it can revive Broderbund's software portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has demonstrated that they know how to make
acquisitions, especially ones where there is solid content. And
with Broderbund, there are some really solid brand names,'' said
Steven Frankel, managing director of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Through a string of 14 acquisitions over the last four years,
Learning Co., formerly known as SoftKey International Inc., has
built itself into the nation's largest maker of education software,
with about 33 percent of the market, according to PC Data, a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Learning Co. has the size, the scale and the muscle to
boost what really had been the flagging fortunes of the Broderbund
line, and I think we'll see this work out to be a very synergistic
merger,'' said Stephen Fleming, a San Francisco-based analyst with
BankBoston Robertson Stephens. ``I'm very bullish on the outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's existing brands will get a quick boost under
Learning Co. simply by getting more sales exposure.
</P>
<P>
   As the top maker of education software, Learning Co. can use its
distribution clout to get more retail shelf space for Carmen
Sandiego and the other Broderbund brands, O'Leary said. The company
will also push Broderbund titles through its school and
direct-marketing programs and its international sales channels _
areas where Broderbund has not been as strong.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-quarter of Learning Co's. software revenues are
generated overseas, while Broderbund sells very little
internationally, O'Leary noted.
</P>
<P>
   But the real revival of Carmen Sandiego and the rest of the
Broderbund portfolio depends on how well Learning Co. can mesh its
own software development teams with those of Broderbund to extend
existing product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund had been slow to introduce updated versions of its
most-popular products, which contributed to its decline in the last
year, analysts said. ``They had some good hit products, but they
just got kind of lazy,'' said Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said Learning Co. will accelerate new product
introductions by ``pouring'' popular Broderbund characters such as
Carmen Sandiego into existing technology from Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to start from scratch every time you created a new
product line, it would be cost-prohibitive,'' O'Leary said.
Instead, consumer software companies can add new characters or
storylines to existing development ``engines'' _ the code that
provides the basic technology on which the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company can speed development time and
drastically reduce its costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although layoffs are expected as a result of the acquisition,
O'Leary said it was too early to speculate how many people will
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was completed late Monday, after terms were approved
by shareholders of both companies. The votes were overwhelming,
despite the fact that as a result of Monday's big stock market
plunge, the value of the deal was only $290 million, instead of the
$420 million that had been anticipated when it was first announced
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Tanny, Broderbund's vice president of marketing, took a
philosophical look at the poor timing of the deal for her company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now make our bets with Learning Co. stock and hope that
that goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Learning Tuesday fell 1 5/8 to 16 1/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

   Field hockey star Shannon LeBlanc, a graduate of UMass-Lowell,
has been named the Massachusetts winner and nominee for the NCAA's
Woman of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc, an Amesbury native who now works in the athletic
department at Arizona State, was captain of the field hockey team
at UMass-Lowell for three years and holds the school records for
career points and points in a season. She was also a two-time
Coaches Association Division 2 All-American and a National Academic

   ``I'm in complete shock,'' LeBlanc said in a statement. ``This

   It was the ultimate indeed for Boston-based Lady Godiva when it
won the World Ultimate Frisbee Championships last month by
defeating Japan, 19-10, at the National Sports Center in Blaine,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been walking around saying, `I'm a world champion!'''
said team member Anne Adams of Concord. ``Not many people can say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who has been playing ultimate since 1980 when she was a
student at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., was one of 20
women who capped a perfect week for Lady Godiva. The team went 10-0
during the weeklong tournament, outscoring its opponents, 175-59.
Although it has won the last three national championships, this is
the 12-year-old team's first world title and it follows a
heartbreaking loss to Sweden in the final two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had their sights on this goal for two years,'' Adams
said of the victory. ``In the past, the US had been so dominant,
but when we went to Sweden, we found the rest of the world had
caught up. We trained really hard this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams isn't kidding. For six weeks leading up to the tournament,
Lady Godiva practiced six hours a day every Saturday and Sunday.
The payoff, in addition to the team trophy and gold medal she now
has hanging above her kitchen sink, came when she got home after an
eight-day absence for the championships and her oldest daughter, 3
1/2-year-old Sarah, proclaimed, ``Mom, I call you champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lady Godiva will defend it US crown at the National Ultimate
Championships in Sarasota, Fla., Oct. 22-25.

A SWEEEPING SHAKE-UP FOR BOEING BRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In one of the most sweeping shake-ups of top
management in the 82-year history of The Boeing Co., Ron Woodard,
head of the company's ailing commercial airplane division, has been
replaced with one of the company's brightest stars and a favorite
of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Two other top executives in the commercial group, including
Harry Arnold, executive vice president of airplane development,
also are out as part of the reorganization in which Alan Mulally,
now head of the company's defense and space group, takes over for
Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Several other executives in the commercial group have been
reassigned and still more management changes are expected as
Mulally completes his own team and reshapes a division that caused
Boeing last year to take its first operational loss in a
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes don't stop there. Boeing's defense and space
headquarters in Kent, Wash., is history, eliminated as the company
formed two new units with separate presidents for each. One group,
for space and communications, will be based in Seal Beach, Calif.
The other, for military planes and missiles, will be based in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization leaves about 200 people at the former Kent
headquarters uncertain about their jobs. Most are expected to end
up in other positions within Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   After denying rumors for months that any heads would roll over a
recurring series of production problems that have battered Boeing's
image, its bottom line and its stock price, Chairman Phil Condit
personally asked Woodard, a close friend, to resign and replaced
him with Mulally, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally is generally considered by those inside and outside
Boeing to be Condit's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mulally who directed the development of Boeing's 777.
Since that successful project, the 53-year old senior vice
president has gotten high marks while running the company's vast
defense and space business in the wake of last year's acquisition
of McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Condit's face-to-face meeting with Woodard on Sunday came after
Condit and other executives learned of new cost overruns at the
company's commercial operations in Wichita, as well as a reserve to
cover the overruns, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Condit could no longer protect his friend and decided
Wood-ard had to go, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's board of directors met Monday and, with Woodard
present, accepted his resignation. After adjourning, Condit was
silent about the pending shake-up, but announced the board had
authorized the world's largest aircraft maker to repurchase as much
as 15 percent of its common stock in a bid to boost its share price
from its lowest level in more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives then quietly began preparing to officially
announce the development early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experienced unsatisfactory financial performance with
our commercial airplane operations,'' Condit said in a statement
released before the stock market opened. ``Our expectations are
that commercial airplane operations produce significant,
double-digit operating margins. We concluded there must be
significant changes in the composition of the management team at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said Condit and President Harry Stonecipher would have no
comment other than the official statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher will take over as the company's acting chief
financial officer while a replacement is sought for Boyd Givan.
Givan, whose ouster was apparently sought by Stonecipher and
announced two weeks ago, officially retired Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Woodard, who has worked for Boeing for 32 years
and is widely considered one of the world's best airplane salesmen,
has been offered an unspecified job within the commercial group, a
Boeing spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's considering his options,'' the spokesman said. Both
Condit and Stonecipher personally asked Woodard to stay on in the
new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no expectation that Woodard will take the new job,''
one person close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Woodard who told reporters late last summer, when the
production problems were publicly revealed, that Boeing had only
``stubbed its toe'' as it attempted to crank up production to
record levels in the face of airline demand for new planes.
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts were taken by surprise by the extent of
the commercial division's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, Boeing has taken about $3 billion in charges
related to its assembly line production snags, mostly with the next
generation 737.
</P>
<P>
   There have been calls by many analysts for Woodard's head, and
Condit has been under increasing pressure to make a change. But the
Boeing chief executive continued to stand by Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   That changed more than a week ago with the discovery of the new
problems in Wichita. The problem apparently involves ``a
significant number of parts that were not accounted for on a cost
basis,'' one source said.
</P>
<P>
   The figure could be as much as a couple of hundred million
dollars, but should not change the range of the company's recent
projected earnings, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding another problem might have been the last straw,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street Tuesday, Boeing's shares rose 2 1/8 to close at
33 1/16 as the broader market recovered 288 points from a nearly
513-point drop on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace analyst Wolfgang Demisch of BTAlex. Brown, said Condit
was forced to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shareholders have suffered brutally,'' he said. ``The company
is responding to the distress of the shareholders and holding
people accountable. But the shareholders don't really care who's in
charge, as long as results are achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Demisch said Mulally is well regarded: ``He has more energy than
any two people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts also said Mulally was the best person to replace
Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job with the 777 and perhaps he can now bring
that same magic to the entire commercial group,'' said Peter
Aseritis, aerospace analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this like a baseball team. If the team plays poorly,
you can't fire the players. You fire the manager. And Boeing's
commercial team has played poorly the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do any worse, so why not make a change. Boeing has
totally screwed up. They have lost market share. They have
alienated their customers. How much worse can they do? So why not
change managers and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Two executives are replacing Mulally in the reorganization of
the defense and space group. James F. Albaugh will head the new
Space and Communications Group in Seal Beach, and Michael M. Sears
will head the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems Group in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial group, Arnold, who has been in charge of
airplane development, resigned and Dan Heidt, executive vice
president of airplane components, retired as part of the overhaul,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Thomas Schick, Woodard's deputy, was offered another
position in the group. His new duties are still being discussed and
will depend on whether Woodard decides to stay, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal management information bulletin Tuesday, Boeing
said three executives in the commercial group have been reassigned
to a ``special project'' and will report to Stonecipher ``to
develop an easily understood and highly visible management
reporting system.''
</P>
<P>
   The three are Fred Howard, executive vice president of business
resources; Rick Swindler, vice president of finance; and Molly
MacFarland, vice president of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally's new top management in the commercial group includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Jamieson, who now leads the 737 and 757 programs. He will
have full profit and loss responsibility for the 717, 737, 757,
MD80/90 and MD-11 airplane programs. Dick Pearson, who heads the
Long Beach Division, will report to Jamieson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Morris, who now leads the company's rotorcraft operations
in Philadelphia and Mesa, Ariz., will assume profit and loss
responsibility for the 747, 767 and 777 programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fred Mitchell, executive vice president of airplane programs,
will have responsibility for airplane components and procurement
activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walt Gillette will lead engineering and product development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Carson, who handled business resources within
Information, Space and Defense Systems, will serve as the
commercial group's chief financial officer.

PATRIOTS HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO KEEP DAVIS IN CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Think what would happen if you were able to
rearrange the Broncos. Let's say you took them out of Denver, sent
John Elway to the same retirement ranch that Gary Zimmerman is on
right now, scolded Shannon Sharpe for clowning against the Patriots
in 1996, and completed your makeover by dressing the Broncos in the
garb of the sorry Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Quick question: What would you have?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunate answer: A team that would still have Terrell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   We are well past the introduction stage with Davis by now. On
Monday night, the Patriots will play the Broncos for the fourth
consecutive season. The previous three games have had two
consistent themes: The Patriots have been trounced and Davis has
been permitted to run as if he were in his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the stat that tells you the Patriots haven't beaten
the Broncos since 1968. If in our rearranging game we could go back
to '68, the Patriots would win again and again; Davis wasn't on the
planet then.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the following would be a foolish statement: The
only way to stop Terrell Davis is to tackle him. But that remark
makes a lot of sense to Pete Carroll, who has sat in dark rooms all
summer, watching tapes dated Oct. 6, 1997 _ the last time Davis ran
over his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go back and look at that film and there's a lot of
mistakes happening,'' the coach said Tuesday. ``They're subtle
mistakes, where we get cut off on a block and a hole opens up; not
so much assignment mistakes but just physically not being exactly
where we need to be. And (the Broncos) call for you to be very
precise about your positioning and deployment of your defensive
guys. You can't make up for mistakes on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots probably know that better than any team in the
league. Tuesday, Carroll was told that the Broncos are averaging
170 yards rushing in their last three meetings with the Patriots.
After jokingly saying, ``I'll remember to bring that up about the
running game,'' Carroll said the mission is to stop the Bronco
running game. But there's a catch to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stop it may mean that they get 130,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So can we safely say that Denver is now Davis's team and not
Elway's?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has a $59 million contract,'' said Chris Slade.
``You'd think he has some say in what goes on around there.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Perhaps you have noticed a trace of sarcasm in the
comments of Slade and Carroll. Well, simply put, the Patriots are
annoyed with all the Denver talk. The frustrating thing for them is
that they won't be in a position to silence it _ maybe _ until
Monday night. They also know there is only one way to stop all the
squawking. ``We gotta win it,'' Carroll said. ``That's how you put
it all to rest.'')
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Slade will be one of the men on Terrell
Patrol. He and his teammates know that shutting down Davis is not
like shutting down other great backs. The difference is that the
Broncos run an intricate zone blocking system. Sometimes they go
with the traditional man-vs.-man approach. At others, they will
block an area rather than a man. Davis has the option of running
toward the lane of his choosing. It is the ultimate Door No. 1, No.
2, or No. 3? approach to running.
</P>
<P>
   That's why new starter Chad Eaton believes that the easiest way
to control Davis is to upset the order of the offensive line
because, Eaton says, ``Some of the holes are so big that you and I
could run through them.'' But if commoners were to run through such
a hole, Eaton and Slade and Willie McGinest could floor them with
an arm tackle. Not so with Davis. He is featured in a commercial
that shows him lugging the tire of a sport-utility vehicle around
his waist. Ordinary people don't do that. He doesn't fall to the
turf easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running game is the key,'' Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson
said. ``I've been saying that for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference this year, all the Patriots agree, is that their
defense is better now than it was in October. You will not hear
them talking about any adjustments to Steve Sidwell's scheme. They
do not say anything about needing time to learn and work out the
glitches. They tell you they know what they are doing. They tell
you that they are ready to play. They don't have to tell you the
secret information that is passed among them in team meetings and
on game plans. Loosely translated, the information amounts to this:
Tackle Terrell.

MOST MASSACHUSETTS FIRMS GAIN GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a day makes.
</P>
<P>
   Most public stocks in Massachusetts followed the market's lead
Tuesday, rallying to recoup at least a part of the ground they lost
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Local banks, like Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp.,
and Internet companies like CMG Information Services Inc. and Lycos
Inc. bounced back with mostly solid gains. Other winners on the
rebound: top shelf high-tech companies like EMC Corp., selected
retailers including Talbots Inc. and a smattering of special
situations.
</P>
<P>
   But there were disappointments too. Some stocks, particularly
those that had been trying to recover from previous setbacks or
uncertainty, continued to sink. Tuesday Polaroid Corp., Learning
Co., and Parametric Technology Corp. all slipped a second day.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a question of how broadly stocks rallied. The
Bloomberg Massachusetts index, which includes many smaller
companies, was up 2.05 percent for the day but advancing stocks
outnumbered losers by barely a 3-to-2 ratio. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index gained 3.86 percent and winners swamped losers by better
than 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable company in the state, Gillette Co., has
actually come out of this week's early skirmishes ahead of the
game. It advanced 3 3/4 to to 44 7/8 after just a fractional
decline on Monday. But Gillette shares, which have a total value of
$50 billion, have slipped 28.1 percent from their July high in a
market worried about the company's ability to grow in an uncertain
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts bank stocks were the biggest and broadest group of
local winners Tuesday, recovering at least part of Monday's losses.
Beyond the giants, smaller banks such as UST Corp. of Boston jumped
back.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston actually gained more ground than it had lost on
Monday, but the stock had fallen sharply the previous week on
worries about the company's big business in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But bank stock prices, which are closely tied to the condition
of the economy, could remain volatile as investors continue to sort
out the impact of emerging markets, interest rates and currency
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in the economic slowdown camp for 1999, earnings
estimates are too high as of today and there would be pressure on
these stocks,'' said analyst Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony.
``But if the early estimates for 1999 hold up, bank stocks are
cheap today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Internet stocks, few had been clubbed as hard on
Monday as CMG, an Andover company that invests in start-ups and
helps them grow. Among its success stories: Lycos Inc. and the
recently public Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   CMG was slammed by 23.8 percent in Monday's session because its
future is so dependent on how the stock market welcomes new
Internet businesses it cultivates. CMG's recovery Tuesdaystill left
the stock down 16 percent on the week.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos itself was trimmed by 8 3/16 on Monday but posted one of
Tuesday's best local rallies, gaining back 5 1/16 to 26 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks of every kind had rebounded Tuesday, but
analysts said it might only be a temporary recovery for the
companies known for their boundless promise and paltry profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be characterized as a dead-cat bounce for now,''
said Ullas Naik, a Boston-based Internet and electronic commerce
analyst at First Albany Corp., using the market slang for a brief
stock rebound following a big downturn. ``Right now, it's just a
reaction from the prior day's 500-point (Dow) drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Software services companies, a fast-growing industry that writes
custom programs and provides high-tech support to their corporate
clients, also staged a comeback Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. advanced by 3 7/8 to 36 3/8,
Tuesdayovershadowing Monday's decline of 2 15/16. Keane Inc. of
Boston, down 5 11/16 on Monday, gained back 2 1/8 to 44 1/8.
Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   Many of this week's two-time losers were trying to shake off
problems or doubts. Polaroid, off 7 3/16 to 27 1/8 in the last two
days, is down 44.3 percent so far this year. Investors waiting for
a promised sales recovery read bearish news in Barron's over the
weekend, quoting a Polaroid short-seller.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of software firm Learning Co. have been cut in half since
July as investors worry about slowing demand for the its titles.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric Technology, considered a leader in its software
field, has plunged a shocking 71 percent since it missed earnings
expectations in July. It couldn't buy a break this week, falling in
both sessions by a combined 2 1/32 to 9 29/32.

FUND HOLDERS STAND PAT, BUT CAST WARY EYE ON MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shaken by Wall Street's gyrations but not moved to
jettison their investments, mutual fund shareholders kept a
generally steady footing Tuesday amid the Dow's rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But by many accounts, fund investors, a driving force behind the
Dow's recent gains, appear to harbor an increasingly wary view of
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies reported a flurry of calls from worried
shareholders throughout the morning, with phone traffic subsiding
later as the Dow Jones industrial average rallied 3.8 percent after
Monday's 6.4 percent rout.
</P>
<P>
   Many individual investors hastened to shift money from stock
funds into money market or bond funds, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   A few cashed in and withdrew their investments. Others saw a
buying opportunity and picked up funds focused on large-company
stocks that seemed a bargain after the Dow began the week with its
second-largest one-day point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's rebound, which saw a record 1.2 billion shares
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, appeared to come from
computer-driven trading programs run by professional asset managers
handling money for large institutions, rather than by America's
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions were mainly behind Monday's sell-off, too. But so
were smaller mutual fund firms, executives with large stock option
packages, traders who are market makers in particular stocks, and
some individual investors, according to Laszlo Birinyi Jr. of
Birinyi Associates, an investment research firm in Greenwich,
Conn., that monitors trading patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw twice as much selling in smaller trades (of 10,000
shares or less) as in larger ones,'' Birinyi said. Smaller-sized
trades are usually carried out by smaller investors.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund ownership has more than quadrupled in the past 12
years, as the investing boom has brought Wall Street to Main Street
and helped fuel the Dow's rise. More than 47 percent of all US
households now own at least one fund, while the number of equity
and bond fund accounts has tripled over seven years to 135.7
million, according to the Investment Company Institute. With mutual
funds holding at least 19 percent of all US corporate stock, and
individual investors accounting for more than two-thirds of that
total, market watchers care deeply about how average investors
behave during market swings.
</P>
<P>
   But hard numbers detailing fund investors' trading patterns
often take at least several days to compile. As of yesterdsay, many
firms had not yet counted sales of new funds, cash withdrawals from
funds, and transfers of money from one type of fund to another.
Independent tracking firms will not have estimates on flows until
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a picture is emerging amid anecdotal evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentiment seemed to be that investors were sticking to
their strategies'' and not cashing out of long-term mutual funds,
Fidelity Investments spokesman Scott Beyerl said. While some
investors switched assets from stock funds into less risky money
market and bond funds Monday and Tuesday, and a few pulled out
completely, Fidelity had taken in more money over the past two days
than it had lost, Beyerl said. Still, Fidelity, the nation's
largest fund firm, pressed into service a record 3,700 staffers
Tuesday to man telephones to take calls from concerned investors
and brokers.
</P>
<P>
   At John Hancock Funds, phone calls increased 35 percent Monday
before subsiding to half that Tuesday. Redemptions were slightly
above average, but exchanges of stock fund assets into safer money
market funds were running six times above average, spokeswoman
Susan B. Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Tuesday's market rebound appeared to have been
fueled by institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vanguard Group, withdrawals on Monday from the company's
popular Vanguard Index 500 fund had turned into small positive
inflows Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Financial Services reported continued high volumes
of calls from investors after a brutal day Monday, when calls
spiked by one-third. About 500 investors cashed out of their funds
on Monday, while an equal number shifted stock fund money into more
conservative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Redemptions rose 15 percent above usual levels during the last
two days, according to the company. But the company had sold $80
million to $100 million worth of funds a day over the same period,
spokesman Jerry Potts said.

CHILLING EFFECT SEEN FOR VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five rambunctious years in which entrepreneurs often
boasted of being offered more cash to start up their companies than
they could possibly use, the venture capital business is earthbound
again.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Howard Anderson, the president of The Yankee Group and a
general partner at Battery Ventures in Wellesley, Mass., bluntly
put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``All those companies that end in `-onics' or `-yzx' _ companies
that can't make it through the spellchecker'' _ are going to have
trouble raising capital in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Few among the Boston area's venture capital specialists were
ready to say that the important Massachusetts technology economy is
in imminent trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But amid world financial turmoil and Wall Street chaos, even
optimists among them were admitting the landscape they helped build
along routes 128 and 495, an ever-changing incubator where ideas
grow into companies, is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is basic: Just as the stock market has cooled its
ardor for start-up companies that offer more promise than profits,
so are venture investors taking another look at who will get their
money, and when.
</P>
<P>
   There's still plenty of capital available to back good ideas.
Only the best ideas, however, are going to get that money in coming
months and years. Investors who once had money burning holes in
their pockets are examining proposals more critically. And those
who have been hit hardest have less left to put into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel investors'' _ people who have made millions on earlier
high-risk investments and have enjoyed plowing their profits back
into similar ventures _ are now raising their standards. ``Those
folks probably have gotten hit the most'' in the recent downturn,''
said Robert J. Crowley, executive vice president of the
Massachusetts Technology Development Corp., a venture fund.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, young companies, already embarked on business plans
that count on raising needed cash through public stock offerings
within two or three years, are finding fewer bidders.
</P>
<P>
   High on this list are Internet-based companies, which often can
develop their software cheaply but need big doses of money for
marketing programs that are still slow to deliver revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But with the market's recent gyrations, this crowd, long
accustomed to battling among themselves for investor interest, now
faces new competition as share prices in dozens of still-promising
companies that went public between 1995 and 1997 have fallen to
half or frequently less, than their offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Venture fund managers that know bargains when they see them are
actively shopping for the best of these _ diverting funds that
might otherwise put into early-stage start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, often outspoken where others pull their punches, said
a prolonged market downturn could be especially damaging to a
Massachusetts economy that depends heavily on a continuing stream
of new companies developing and exploiting new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are the new kid on the block, unless you've got
something that is very good, the venture funds are going to say
`take a hike,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following a year that saw $12.7 billion in venture funds plowed
into hundreds of startup companies nationwide, Anderson said the
venture capital industry now expects to invest no more than $12.5
billion in 1998, and about the same in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there will be about one-third fewer start-ups next
year,'' he said. And scores of other companies that might have been
expecting second-round or third-round venture financings to
continue their work ``are not going to be able to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all will fail, he added. Some may be able to sell out to
either competitors or better-heeled companies, in the same way that
West Coast telecommunications companies have been snapping up
Massachusetts startups to build their own empires.
</P>
<P>
   Even entrepreneurs who prove themselves strong enough to grow on
their own may still have to pay an additional price to get the cash
they need, by ceding more control to their investors.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies continue to be the most vulnerable in
this arena, said R. John Fletcher, chief executive at Fletcher
Spaght Inc. of Boston, because they typically generate almost no
revenues during the several years that it takes to develop their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Many venture specialists see rough waters ahead also for
Internet-based companies, which over the past two years have ranked
alongside telecommunications companies as the fastest growing
technology industry sector in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet deals are going to have to show more promise of
revenues'' before they can count on venture capitalists for help,
said Crowley, whose fund gets its money from both public and
private sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies make a great story, but behind them are a lot
more traditional investment opportunities, (firms) where people are
trying to build sustainable companies,'' Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (downturn) has been a wakeup call,'' says David Barry,
senior editor at The Private Equity Analyst, an investor
newsletter. ``Venture capitalists and companies thinking of going
public had better be sure their ship is in fine shape when they do
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Anderson: ``This is going to sort out the wheat from the
chaff.''

   RUSSIA-CLINTON _ MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
wrapping up a two-day summit with President Bill Clinton, said

   RUSSIA-LEWINSKY _ MOSCOW _ Eight time zones from Washington and
behind the thick Kremlin walls, President Clinton could not shake
``Monica-gate.'' Clinton broke his silence on the Monica Lewinsky
scandal to tell the world he had said enough about his mistake and
had no plans to make a formal apology. ``I have acknowledged that I
made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven,
spent a lot of valuable time with my family in the last couple of
weeks and said I was going back to work,'' Clinton said in response
to a question at the closing press conference of his summit with
President Boris Yeltsin. Braced for the questions he knew would
come, Clinton and his White House staff sought to use the world
stage of the U.S.-Russian summit to present the president as a man
too busy to worry further about the controversy that has dogged him
for seven months and raised the possibility of his impeachment.

   HAITI-GROOVE _ MIAMI _ Angered about a comment linking Haitians
to AIDS in a popular summer movie, Haitian-Americans are pushing
for a boycott if they don't get a public apology. In the movie,
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' the main character has an
affair with a Jamaican. When her two sisters question her about it
later, one asks if he used a condom ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.'' The other says ``No, that's Haiti, Miss
Manners.'' Haitians say the dialogue has unleashed painful memories
of a time when the U.S. government branded Haitian-Americans as
AIDS carriers and barred them from donating blood. What hurts
Haitians even more is that the film was written and directed by
blacks. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-JAMAICA _ KINGSTON, Jamaica _ ``Crime's so bad they'll
cut off your arm to get their hands on a nice watch,'' the American
businessman sitting next to me on the airplane warned. It was an
ominous beginning to the start of a four-day trip to Jamaica, an
island that's long conjured up images of peaceful beaches and
picturesque waterfalls. But there was nothing peaceful or
picturesque about the Jamaica I encountered. Driving into the
capital of Kingston from the airport I passed children in tattered
clothes. liquor stores no bigger than closets, and slums that
reminded me of the worst parts of Haiti. Later I learned that
Jamaica, the largest English-speaking island in the Caribbean, is
on the verge of economic collapse. Experiencing an astounding three
years of negative growth rates, Jamaica's economy is performing
worse than any other economy in the hemisphere, even Haiti's.

There are two groups of Serb refugees in the United States. Some
are married to Muslims - being in a mixed marriage makes them
targets for persecution. Others are Serb refugees who were forced
out of the Krajina region of Croatia by Croatian soldiers in 1995.
The Serbs in Belgrade wouldn't take them and instead sent them to
Kosovo, where they are now fleeing. Local resettlement agencies say
Serbs and Muslims live here together peacefully now, but that may
be because they don't ask each other too many questions. (Kurylo,

<P>
   What do normal people feel is the main relief provided by the
end of the Cold War? It is that the danger of nuclear war is off
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ``weapons of mass destruction'' present more and
different things to worry about than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear arms are no longer a paramount concern, but
chemical and biological weapons have come to the fore. For another,
there is less danger of complete annihilation, but more danger of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of lethal weapons will be used
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The points to keep in mind about the new world of mass
destruction are the following.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the roles such weapons play in international conflict
are changing. They no longer represent the technological frontier
of warfare. Increasingly, they will be weapons of the weak states,
poorer countries or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the mainstays of Cold War security policy _ deterrence
and arms control _ are not what they used to be. Some new threats
may not be deterrable, and the role of arms control in dealing with
weapons of mass destruction has been marginalized. In a few
instances, continuing devotion to deterrence and arms control may
have side effects that offset the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, some of the responses most likely to cope with the
threats in novel ways will not find a warm welcome. The response
that should now be the highest priority is one long ignored,
opposed, or ridiculed: a serious civil-defense program to blunt the
effects of WMD if they are unleashed within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most effective measures to prevent attacks within
the United States may also challenge traditional civil liberties if
pursued to the maximum. And the most troubling conclusion for
foreign policy as a whole is that reducing the odds of attacks in
the United States might require pulling back from involvement in
some foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   American activism to guarantee international stability is,
paradoxically, the prime source of American vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly true in the Cold War, when the main danger that
nuclear weapons might detonate on U.S. soil sprang from strategic
engagement in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to deter attacks on
U.S. allies. But engagement then assumed a direct link between
regional stability and U.S. survival.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is less evident today, when there is no globally
threatening superpower or transnational ideology to be contained _
only an array of serious but entirely local disruptions. Today, as
the only nation acting to police areas outside its own region, the
United States makes itself a target for states or groups whose
aspirations are frustrated by U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   When nuclear weapons were born, they represented the most
advanced military applications of science, technology, and
engineering. None but the great powers could hope to obtain them.
By now, however, nuclear arms have been around for more than half a
century, and chemical and biological weapons even longer.
</P>
<P>
   They are not just getting old. In the strategic terms most
relevant to American security, they have become primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the military cutting edge of the strong, they have become
the only hope for so-called rogue states or terrorists who want to
contest American power.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated the American advantage
in a manner that stunned many abroad. Although the U.S. defense
budget has plunged, other countries are not closing the gap. U.S.
military spending remains more than triple that of any potentially
hostile power and higher than the combined defense budgets of
Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along in what some see as a revolution in military
affairs, American forces continue to make unmatched use of
state-of-the-art weapons, surveillance and information systems, and
the organizational and doctrinal flexibility for managing the
integration of these complex innovations into ``systems of
systems'' that is the key to modern military effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever in military history, brains are brawn. Even if
hostile countries somehow catch up in an arms race, their military
organizations and cultures are unlikely to catch up in the
competence race for management, technology assimilation and combat
command skills.
</P>
<P>
   If it is infeasible for hostile states to counter the United
States in conventional combat, it is even more daunting for smaller
groups such as terrorists. If the United States is lucky, the
various violent groups with grievances against the American
government and society will continue to think up schemes using
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Few terrorist groups have shown an interest in inflicting true
mass destruction. Bombings or hostage seizures have generally
threatened no more than a few hundred lives. Let us hope that this
limitation has been for a powerful underlying reason, rather than a
simple lack of capability, and that the few exceptions do not
become more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure reason to bet on such restraint. If terrorists
decide that they want to stun American policymakers by inflicting
enormous damage, low-tech weapons of mass destruction become more
attractive at the same time that they are becoming more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the bedrock of
American war capabilities. They were the linchpin of defense
debate, procurement programs and arms control because the United
States faced another superpower _ one that conventional wisdom
feared could best it in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one cares about the MX missile or B-1 bomber, and
hardly anyone really cares about the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty. In a manner that could only have seemed ludicrous during
the Cold War, proponents now rationalize the $2 billion B-2 as a
weapon for conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using low-tech weapons of mass destruction as an
``asymmetric'' means to counter U.S. conventional power, and how to
protect U.S. ground and naval forces abroad from WMD attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the primary risk is not that enemies might lob some
nuclear or chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships,
awful as that would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to
punish the United States by triggering catastrophes in American
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Would the United States follow through and use nuclear weapons
against a country or group that had killed several thousand
Americans with deadly chemicals? It is hard to imagine breaking the
post-Nagasaki taboo in that situation. But schemes for conventional
military retaliation would not suffice without detracting from the
force of American deterrent threats.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a risk for the United States in setting a
precedent that someone could use any sort of weapons of mass
destruction against Americans without suffering similar destruction
in return. Limiting the range of deterrent alternatives available
to U.S. strategy will not necessarily cause deterrence to fail, but
it will certainly not strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons are not likely to be the ``WMD of choice'' for
non-state terrorist groups. They require huge investments and
targetable infrastructure, and are subject to credible threats by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An aggrieved group that decides it wants to kill huge numbers of
Americans will find the mission easier to accomplish with anthrax
than with a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those who dealt with nuclear-weapons policy
during the Cold War adamantly opposed developing first-strike
options. Today, scarcely anyone looks to that old logic when
thinking about rogues or terrorists, and most hope to be able to
mount a disarming action against any group with highly lethal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As threats of terrorism are taken more seriously, interest will
grow in preemptive defense measures _ the most obvious of which is
intensified intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Where this involves targeting groups within the United States
that might seem to be potential breeding grounds for terrorists,
controversies will arise over constitutional limits on invasion of
privacy or search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the danger remains hypothetical, such controversies
will not be easily resolved. They have not come to the fore so far
because U.S. law enforcement has been unbelievably lucky in
apprehending terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, it is too late to turn off foreign resentments by
retreating, even if that were an acceptable course. Alienated
groups and governments would not stop blaming Washington for their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Security is not all of a piece, and survival is only part of
security. But it is no longer prudent to assume that important
security interests complement each other as they did during the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The interest at the very core _ protecting the American homeland
from attack _ may now often be in conflict with security more
broadly conceived and with the interests that mandate promoting
American political values, economic interdependence, social
Westernization and stability in regions beyond Western Europe and
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not give up all its broader political
interests, but it should tread cautiously in areas _ especially the
Middle East _ where broader interests grate against the core
imperative of preventing mass destruction within America's borders.

<P>
   What do normal people feel is the main relief provided by the
end of the Cold War? It is that the danger of nuclear war is off
their backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ``weapons of mass destruction'' present more and
different things to worry about than during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For one, nuclear arms are no longer a paramount concern, but
chemical and biological weapons have come to the fore. For another,
there is less danger of complete annihilation, but more danger of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War is over and American and Russian nuclear
inventories are much smaller, there is less chance of an
apocalyptic exchange of many thousands of weapons. But the
probability that some smaller number of lethal weapons will be used
is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The points to keep in mind about the new world of mass
destruction are the following.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the roles such weapons play in international conflict
are changing. They no longer represent the technological frontier
of warfare. Increasingly, they will be weapons of the weak states,
poorer countries or groups that militarily are at best
second-class.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the mainstays of Cold War security policy _ deterrence
and arms control _ are not what they used to be. Some new threats
may not be deterrable, and the role of arms control in dealing with
weapons of mass destruction has been marginalized. In a few
instances, continuing devotion to deterrence and arms control may
have side effects that offset the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, some of the responses most likely to cope with the
threats in novel ways will not find a warm welcome. The response
that should now be the highest priority is one long ignored,
opposed, or ridiculed: a serious civil-defense program to blunt the
effects of WMD if they are unleashed within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most effective measures to prevent attacks within
the United States may also challenge traditional civil liberties if
pursued to the maximum. And the most troubling conclusion for
foreign policy as a whole is that reducing the odds of attacks in
the United States might require pulling back from involvement in
some foreign conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   American activism to guarantee international stability is,
paradoxically, the prime source of American vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   This was partly true in the Cold War, when the main danger that
nuclear weapons might detonate on U.S. soil sprang from strategic
engagement in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to deter attacks on
U.S. allies. But engagement then assumed a direct link between
regional stability and U.S. survival.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is less evident today, when there is no globally
threatening superpower or transnational ideology to be contained _
only an array of serious but entirely local disruptions. Today, as
the only nation acting to police areas outside its own region, the
United States makes itself a target for states or groups whose
aspirations are frustrated by U.S. power.
</P>
<P>
   When nuclear weapons were born, they represented the most
advanced military applications of science, technology, and
engineering. None but the great powers could hope to obtain them.
By now, however, nuclear arms have been around for more than half a
century, and chemical and biological weapons even longer.
</P>
<P>
   They are not just getting old. In the strategic terms most
relevant to American security, they have become primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Once the military cutting edge of the strong, they have become
the only hope for so-called rogue states or terrorists who want to
contest American power.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated the American advantage
in a manner that stunned many abroad. Although the U.S. defense
budget has plunged, other countries are not closing the gap. U.S.
military spending remains more than triple that of any potentially
hostile power and higher than the combined defense budgets of
Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along in what some see as a revolution in military
affairs, American forces continue to make unmatched use of
state-of-the-art weapons, surveillance and information systems, and
the organizational and doctrinal flexibility for managing the
integration of these complex innovations into ``systems of
systems'' that is the key to modern military effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever in military history, brains are brawn. Even if
hostile countries somehow catch up in an arms race, their military
organizations and cultures are unlikely to catch up in the
competence race for management, technology assimilation and combat
command skills.
</P>
<P>
   If it is infeasible for hostile states to counter the United
States in conventional combat, it is even more daunting for smaller
groups such as terrorists. If the United States is lucky, the
various violent groups with grievances against the American
government and society will continue to think up schemes using
conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Few terrorist groups have shown an interest in inflicting true
mass destruction. Bombings or hostage seizures have generally
threatened no more than a few hundred lives. Let us hope that this
limitation has been for a powerful underlying reason, rather than a
simple lack of capability, and that the few exceptions do not
become more typical.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure reason to bet on such restraint. If terrorists
decide that they want to stun American policymakers by inflicting
enormous damage, low-tech weapons of mass destruction become more
attractive at the same time that they are becoming more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the bedrock of
American war capabilities. They were the linchpin of defense
debate, procurement programs and arms control because the United
States faced another superpower _ one that conventional wisdom
feared could best it in conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one cares about the MX missile or B-1 bomber, and
hardly anyone really cares about the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty. In a manner that could only have seemed ludicrous during
the Cold War, proponents now rationalize the $2 billion B-2 as a
weapon for conventional war.
</P>
<P>
   What military planners are interested in is how to keep
adversaries from using low-tech weapons of mass destruction as an
``asymmetric'' means to counter U.S. conventional power, and how to
protect U.S. ground and naval forces abroad from WMD attacks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the primary risk is not that enemies might lob some
nuclear or chemical weapons at U.S. armored battalions or ships,
awful as that would be. Rather, it is that they might attempt to
punish the United States by triggering catastrophes in American
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals are far more widely available than nuclear weapons
because the technology required to produce them is far simpler, and
large numbers of countries have undertaken chemical weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Would the United States follow through and use nuclear weapons
against a country or group that had killed several thousand
Americans with deadly chemicals? It is hard to imagine breaking the
post-Nagasaki taboo in that situation. But schemes for conventional
military retaliation would not suffice without detracting from the
force of American deterrent threats.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a risk for the United States in setting a
precedent that someone could use any sort of weapons of mass
destruction against Americans without suffering similar destruction
in return. Limiting the range of deterrent alternatives available
to U.S. strategy will not necessarily cause deterrence to fail, but
it will certainly not strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   One simple fact should worry Americans more about biological
than about nuclear or chemical arms: unlike either of the other
two, biological weapons combine maximum destructiveness and easy
availability. Nuclear arms have great killing capacity but are hard
to get; chemical weapons are easy to get but lack such killing
capacity; biological agents have both qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear weapons are not likely to be the ``WMD of choice'' for
non-state terrorist groups. They require huge investments and
targetable infrastructure, and are subject to credible threats by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An aggrieved group that decides it wants to kill huge numbers of
Americans will find the mission easier to accomplish with anthrax
than with a nuclear explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of those who dealt with nuclear-weapons policy
during the Cold War adamantly opposed developing first-strike
options. Today, scarcely anyone looks to that old logic when
thinking about rogues or terrorists, and most hope to be able to
mount a disarming action against any group with highly lethal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As threats of terrorism are taken more seriously, interest will
grow in preemptive defense measures _ the most obvious of which is
intensified intelligence collection.
</P>
<P>
   Where this involves targeting groups within the United States
that might seem to be potential breeding grounds for terrorists,
controversies will arise over constitutional limits on invasion of
privacy or search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the danger remains hypothetical, such controversies
will not be easily resolved. They have not come to the fore so far

<P>
   In recent years terrorist operations have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Airline hijackings have become rare because hijacked planes
cannot stay in the air forever and few countries today are willing
to let them land, thereby incurring the stigma of openly supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists too saw diminishing returns on hijackings. The trend
now seems to be away from attacking specific targets such as the
other side's officials and toward more indiscriminate killing.
</P>
<P>
   The belief has gained ground that terrorist missions by
volunteers bent on committing suicide constitute a radical new
departure, dangerous because they are impossible to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a myth, like the many others in which terrorism has
always been shrouded. The bomber willing and indeed eager to blow
himself up has appeared in all eras and cultural traditions,
espousing politics ranging from the leftism of the Baader-Meinhof
Gang in 1970s Germany to rightist extremism.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese military wanted kamikaze pilots at the end of
World War II, thousands of volunteers rushed to offer themselves.
The young Arab bombers on Jerusalem buses looking to be rewarded by
the virgins in Paradise are a link in an old chain.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored terrorism has not disappeared. Terrorists can no
longer count on the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies,
but it is clear that among Middle Eastern and North African
countries, some will definitely provide support.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran and Tripoli are less eager to argue that they have a
divine right to engage in terrorist operations outside their
borders. Indeed, the 1986 U.S. air strike against Libya and the
various boycotts against Libya and Iran had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sudan, without fanfare, has become for
terrorists what the Barbary Coast was for pirates of another age: a
safe haven. Politically isolated and presiding over a disastrous
economy, the military government in Khartoum, backed by Muslim
leaders, believes that no one wants to become involved in Sudan and
thus it can get away with lending support to terrorists from many
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Such confidence is justified so long as terrorism is only a
nuisance. But when it becomes more than that, both terrorists and
their protectors come under great international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the past few decades have witnessed the birth of
dozens of aggressive movements espousing varieties of nationalism,
religious fundamentalism, fascism and apocalyptic millenarianism,
from Hindu nationalists in India to neofascists in Europe and the
developing world to the Branch-Davidian cult of Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier fascists believed in military aggression and engaged
in a huge military buildup, but such a strategy has become too
expensive even for superpowers. Now, mail-order catalogs tempt
militants with readily available, far cheaper, unconventional as
well as conventional weapons _ ``the poor man's nuclear bomb,'' as
former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani once called
them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nuclear arms, the weapons of mass destruction
include biological agents and man-made chemical compounds that
attack the nervous system, skin or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have engaged in the production of chemical weapons
for almost a century and in the production of nuclear and
biological weapons for many decades, during which time
proliferation has been continuous and access ever easier.
</P>
<P>
   The means of delivery _ ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and
aerosols _ have also become far more effective. While in the past
missiles were deployed only in wars between states, recently they
have played a role in civil wars in Afghanistan and Yemen. Use by
terrorist groups is but one step further.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s most observers believed that stolen nuclear
material constituted the greatest threat in the escalation of
terrorist weapons, but many now think the danger is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist groups have investigated the use of poisons since the
19th century. The Aum Shinrikyo cult staged a poison gas attack in
March 1995 in the Tokyo subway. Exposure to the nerve gas sarin
killed ten people and injured 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other, more amateurish attempts in the United States and abroad
to experiment with chemical substances and biological agents for
use in terrorism have involved the toxin that causes botulism, the
poisonous protein rycin (twice), sarin (twice), bubonic plague
bacteria, typhoid bacteria, hydrogen cyanide, Vx (another nerve
gas), and possibly the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical agents are not so easy to keep safely in stable
condition, and their dispersal depends largely on climatic factors.
The risk of contamination for the people handling them is high.
Many of the most lethal bacteria and spores do not survive well
outside the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, traditional terrorism rests on the heroic gesture,
on the willingness to sacrifice one's own life as proof of one's
idealism. Obviously there is not much heroism in spreading botulism
or anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Since most terrorist groups are as interested in publicity as in
violence, and as publicity for a mass poisoning or nuclear bombing
would be far more unfavorable than for a focused conventional
attack, only terrorists who do not care about publicity will even
consider the applications of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly speaking, terrorists will not engage in overkill if
their traditional weapons _ the submachine gun and the conventional
bomb _ are sufficient to continue the struggle and achieve their
aims.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to use terrorist violence is not always a
rational one. If it were, there would be much less terrorism, since
terrorist activity seldom achieves its aims. What if, after years
of armed struggle and the loss of many of their militants,
terrorist groups see no progress?
</P>
<P>
   Despair could lead to giving up the armed struggle, or to
suicide. But it might also lead to a last desperate attempt to
defeat the hated enemy by arms not tried before.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Racine's heroes said of himself, their ``only hope
lies in their despair.''

of armed struggle and the loss of many of their militants,
terrorist groups see no progress?

<P>
   Despair could lead to giving up the armed struggle, or to
suicide. But it might also lead to a last desperate attempt to
defeat the hated enemy by arms not tried before.

   Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from
all others for well over half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries might field infantry, submariners or scientific
artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to America's.
</P>
<P>
   Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded
and successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has
fought since World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Air warfare remains distinctively American _ high-tech, cheap in
lives and, at least in theory, quick. To America's enemies _ past,
current and potential _ it is the distinctively American form of
military intimidation. Air warfare plays to the machine-mindedness
of American civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft can direct massive and accurate destructive force at
key points without having to maneuver cumbersome organizations on
land or sea.
</P>
<P>
   When American presidents use air power, they should either hurl
it with devastating lethality against a few targets _ say, a
full-scale meeting of an enemy war cabinet or senior military staff
_ or extensively enough to cause sharp and lasting pain to a
military and a society.
</P>
<P>
   The sprinkling of air strikes over an enemy will harden him
without hurting him and deprive the United States of an intangible
strategic asset.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders at the end of this century indeed have been
vouchsafed with a military instrument of a potency rarely known in
the history of war. But glib talk of revolutionary change obscures
the complexity of truly radical change in the conduct of war and,
worse, its inherent messiness and brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, air power is an unusually seductive form of military
strength, in part because, like modern courtship, it appears to
offer gratification without commitment.
</P>
<P>
   More than one commentator who had reservations about aerial
bombardment in the Persian Gulf War expressed a newfound belief in
its utility as a tool of U.S. foreign policy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Lewis of The New York Times wrote during the gulf
conflict in disgust at the ruin wrought by aerial bombardment: ``We
should never again tolerate anyone who talks about `surgical
strikes.''' After that, however, he developed a keener appreciation
of air power, asserting, for example, that ``a few air strikes in
Dubrovnik'' would have stopped the Yugoslav horrors in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that many individuals came away from the gulf war
with a far healthier respect for air power, believing it had made
all the difference. Indeed it had. Some 52,000 air-to-surface
sorties delivered approximately 210,000 unguided bombs, 9,300
guided bombs, 5,400 guided air-to-surface missiles and 2,000
anti-radar missiles. American forces also hurled more than 300
cruise missiles at the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To what effect?
</P>
<P>
   Of its 700 aircraft, the Iraqi air force lost 33 in the air;
approximately 140 perished in hardened aircraft shelters and more
than 120 were flown to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi air-defense system succumbed within days _ really,
hours _ to an extremely sophisticated attack. It managed to shoot
down only a tiny fraction of the attacking aircraft. Moreover, air
power had completely disrupted Iraqi logistics and immobilized the
Iraqi army.
</P>
<P>
   Although ground action necessarily consummated the final victory
for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as
effortless as a wartime operation can be.
</P>
<P>
   If the claims of air power advocates are correct, the United
States, after the gulf war, acquired a military edge over
conventional opponents comparable to that exercised in 1898 by the
soldiers of Lord Kitchener against the sword-wielding dervishes of
the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after all that, the way to a U.S.-policed world order
might look remarkably smooth. Was the Persian Gulf war a major
departure in the history of warfare and does it point the way to
unshakable American military preeminence?
</P>
<P>
   The war saw the first extensive use of some new technologies.
The F-117 stealth fighter penetrated Iraqi radar safely and
secretly. The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System
detected Iraqi trucks and tanks along highways in Kuwait. An array
of satellites gave unparalleled support to military commanders for
intelligence gathering, map-making, communication, navigation,
meteorology and missile-launch detection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bulk of the work came from much older systems and
mundane technologies such as air refueling.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the weapons used in the Persian Gulf dated back two
decades or more. Air Force B-52 and Navy A-6 bombers had seen at
least 20 years of active service, although they employed newer
electronics. Guided bombs first appeared in the Vietnam War, when
U.S. aircraft dropped 4,000 or so on the Vietnamese communists.
</P>
<P>
   Even modern, first-line fighters such as the F-16 have been in
use for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``military-technical revolution'' sparkled in new
systems, but it drew as much on considerably more mature
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   And the respect it created for unbeatable American power has
not, in nearly a decade, faltered a bit.

   If a terrorist were to strike a U.S. city with a chemical or
biological agent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be
responsible for coordinating the response to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A host of federal, state and local agencies would be mobilized
for the remediation effort, including the U.S. Army's Technical
Escort Unit (TEU). Part of the Army's Chemical and Biological
Defense Command (CBDCOM), the Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland-based TEU has expertise and equipment found nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're organized and equipped to deal with either a
chemical or biological device,'' said Lt. Col. Doug Norton, TEU
commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability to mitigate the effects of a device if
it has already functioned, or to render it safe if it hasn't
functioned. ... We also have the capability to search for a device,
take samples to determine if chemical or biological agents have
been released and, if we locate a device, we have the capability to
remove and transport it to the appropriate lab for
identification.''
</P>
<P>
   At any time, Norton said, a basic chemical and
biological-response team is ready to respond within four hours to
any incident anywhere in the United States. In all, the TEU has 83
military members and 99 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Domestic Preparedness Program, under which
``emergency responders'' from 120 U.S. cities are receiving
training in how to respond to an attack involving chemical,
biological or nuclear elements, is the most visible aspect of the
government's efforts to prepare for an urban nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The training program is an interagency effort heavily supported
by the Defense Department through the Army Chemical and Biological
Defense Command. Essentially a ``train the trainer'' program, the
effort is aimed at policemen, firemen, hazardous materials
handlers, medical personnel and others who would be called upon to
respond to a so-called ``domestic WMD attack.'' It introduces them
to what they need to know and do _ beyond the actions they would
normally take _ to protect themselves while saving others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The training program, as well as the rapid-response team,
springs from requirements in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act to
develop capabilities to aid in the event of a chemical or
biological incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the Army's Technical Escort Unit brings a great
deal to the table. Its members have years of expertise in crisis
management,'' said Jim Warrington, program director for domestic
preparedness at the CBDCOM. ``There's also the Marine Corps'
Chemical Biological Incident Response Force.''
</P>
<P>
   This year $43 million is being spent on the Pentagon's Domestic
Preparedness Program; next year $49 million is set aside for the
effort. ``We anticipate completing the training for all 120 cities
by fiscal year 2001,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial course of instruction in Denver in May 1997,
the original training concept was refined, and by mid-April, 23
sessions had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we've gone into a city, we've fine-tuned the
training,'' Warrington said. ``Usually the training lasts for one
week.'' The instructors include active-duty military and
non-military emergency personnel and Army Reserve teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at precautions in Israel, where recent scares from Iraq
placed the public in a fearful dilemma, a wide range of
countermeasures are either available or under development to
confront even the most horrifying chemical or biological threat.
</P>
<P>
   These include a highly capable passive defense organization
reaching to all levels, with shelters, personal equipment in the
hands of all the population and a highly professional medical
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an experienced pharmaceutical industry can quickly
produce sufficient antidotes on short notice and distribute these
to the population within days. This was done during the most recent
crisis, together with an all-out effort by global purchasing agents
who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

who obtained additional items abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from a terrorist suicide attack is also well known in
Israel. Not much can be done to prevent these attacks other than
constant vigilance and the political resolve to move quickly
against known threats.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such future attacks using chemical or
biological agents cannot be neglected, and effective measures to
give early warning or to initiate countermeasures must be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's early-warning defense system is geared to detect
suicide flyers, remote-controlled drones and converted
crop-spraying aircraft trying to sneak through, but these threats
are considered less likely.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is a highly organized nation constantly on alert
for mass terror attacks, it has large squatter regions surrounding
already densely populated cities, increasing any risk.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that reason will continue to prevail _ not
only in the region known as the cradle of civilization _ but
everywhere.

ZEDILLO PRAISES MEXICO'S ECONOMY DESPITE SETBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A tired, dour-looking President Ernesto Zedillo
urged Mexicans to stay the course and accept his financial and
economic reforms during his fourth state of the republic message.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, there was little good news in Zedillo's speech,
which lasted nearly 100 minutes Tuesday night, and the president
rarely was interrupted by applause in the crowded federal Chamber
of Deputies, where he asked Mexicans to continue working to ensure
a brighter long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his brightest news was that the economy managed to grow
by 5.2 percent despite a year in which oil prices fell by more than
30 percent; world financial markets were rocked by crises in Asia
and Russia; and Mexico was hit with unprecedented natural
disasters. Oil counts for nearly 40 percent of Mexico's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo devoted more time to his controversial bank bailout
program than to any other topic.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout would commit public funds to buying up nearly $62
billion in bad bank debt, staving off what Zedillo termed an
imminent collapse of the Mexican banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has been bitterly attacked by opposition politicians
and faces a rocky road in the upcoming legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has foreseen and informed you that the actions
necessary to return the banking system to health necessarily imply
substantial costs,'' Zedillo said during his televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an enormous cost if you take into consideration the
other uses to which the resources could be put. But with
everything, the cost we foresee is less than the result of allowing
the collapse of the banking system, or simply of having acted
slowly and indecisively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said the federal government didn't have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only responsible path was to take the measures necessary
to resolve the banking problems, as high as the political costs
might be to the government. I did it and I don't regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 3 million Mexicans turned out to vote Sunday in a
non-binding referendum on the bank bailout plan. The referendum was
sponsored by the center-left Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   Early results released by the PRD Monday showed that less than 1
percent of those voting supported Zedillo's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right National Action Party, or PAN, has proposed an
alternative plan it says would lower the bank bailout's cost to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Zedillo seemed to hint at a willingness to
compromise, saying: ``I am confident that with the proposals
presented by the federal government and the political parties
represented in this congress we soon will have a legal mechanism
that will provide the security our banking system needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said falling oil prices prompted three rounds of budget
cuts during the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's federal budget counted on a world oil price of more
than $15 per barrel, he said. Instead, that price has plummeted to
just over $10 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to 1997, more than $3.5 billion will be lost; in
short, about 1 percent of our anticipated gross domestic product in
1998,'' Zedillo said. ``We chose to confront the price drop by
adjusting our spending measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Global weather patterns slammed Mexico hard during the past
year, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Pauline devastated Acapulco and the coast of Oaxaca
last October, killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in
damage to roads, housing and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable El Nino weather phenomenon caused record
droughts in most parts of the country, killing livestock and
cutting harvests. Parched watersheds caught fire and millions of
acres of forest and brushland were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bad news, harsh economic reforms adopted after
the December 1994 peso crisis are paying off, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment and inflation are down, while economic growth is
up. More workers than ever before now are covered by social
security health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 15 largest economies of the world, ours had the second
highest growth rate of gross domestic product,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Mexico's economic underpinnings are sound, the country
still is subject to a shaky global economy that is unlikely to
stabilize in the foreseeable future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo predicted Mexico's economic growth would slow to a rate
of about 4 percent for 1998-1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must build so that the next president has the conditions to
continue improving Mexico's future,'' said Zedillo, whose term ends
in 2000.

   BOEING-DISCRIMINATION (Seattle) Jesse Jones is black; his
superiors at The Boeing Co. are white. Those are two undisputable
facts. Much of the rest is uncertain in a federal court battle
between a black manager and The Boeing Co. that is set to go to
trial in Seattle on Sept. 15. Jones earns $84,000 a year _ a fact
that might make many Americans, most of whom make less than that,
think that he has little to beef about. But he says he has been
shunned by his colleagues, sidetracked into a job he does not want
(director of disaster preparedness), and told by high executives
that his belief he is a victim of discrimination is not real. He's
angry. He wants vindication. Profile of Jesse Jones discrimination

A FEW NASTY FACTS ABOUT OUR MILITARY TOXIC WASTE

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The ecological consequences of the Cold War are extremely
severe. And in terms of deserving the blame, the United States and
Russia share the winning ticket.
 &HT;    Moreover, both our countries, believing that such matters
involved national security, kept this information very secret until
recently.
 &HT;    I have looked at the geography of the post-Cold War toxic waste
sites. I have looked at the fact that military industries are still
operating. I have concluded that the challenge to curb the new
dumping and clean up the old waste is enormous _ economically,
politically, geographically and otherwise.
 &HT;    In the United States, the Rocky Flats Arsenal near Denver,
Colo., has stored for 30 years 125 types of toxic waste. Nerve gas
and pesticides were also processed there. The site has been called
``the most polluted square mile on earth.''
 &HT;    In Dover, N.J., the ground water in one toxic site has more than
5,000 times the permitted levels of trichlorethylene.
 &HT;    Russia has even worse locations. Since 1952, near Lake Karichai
in the Urals, liquid wastes were stored and eventually spilled, and
traces of the waste are now found in the Arctic Ocean thousands of
miles away.
 &HT;    In the Urals, by 1988, thermal energy produced by toxic waste
had resulted in the evaporation of an entire lake. A total of 120
million curies of radioactive waste, two times that released in the
Chernobyl accident, were released. Now that lake has been covered
with a thick layer of concrete.
 &HT;    According to ``Russia's National Interests and Security
Problems,'' a study conducted in 1995-'97 by the Gorbachev
Foundation's Center for Global Programs, of about 100,000 hazardous
production facilities, at least 1,500 nuclear and 3,000 chemical
facilities are particularly dangerous.
 &HT;    In Russia, according to the study, ``the total land area subject
to possible chemical contamination is about 300,000 square
kilometers, with a resident population of about 54 million people.
The most hazardous area is Russia's central region, where 16
million people live in zones subject to potential danger.''
 &HT;    It reports that among the sources of potential environmental
danger, Russia's nuclear complex facilities are of particular
concern. And of equal danger to the accumulated radioactive waste
are the enriched uranium and plutonium from nuclear weapons and
nuclear fuel.
 &HT;    Furthermore, it states, an additional factor to take into
account ``is the radioactivity absorbed by the biosphere from
nuclear tests, accidents and the operation of the nuclear complex.
Most of the highly active waste is concentrated in the regions of
Chelyabinsk and Tomsk Oblasts and Krasnoyarsk Krai.
 &HT;    ``Our scenic harbors host a serious threat posed by spent
nuclear fuel in the reactors of decommissioned nuclear submarines.
At least 75 such submarines are afloat in harbors, with the fuel
still inside. The expenditure needed for modernization,
retrofitting and decommissioning of such equipment could be as high
as 15 percent to 20 percent of Russia's gross national product,
which the country's economy would not be able to afford.
 &HT;    ``An additional threat could be posed by industrial terrorism as
a result of heightened sociopolitical tensions and criminalization
of society, as well as unauthorized tampering with hazardous
facilities during ethnic conflicts.''
 &HT;    These are the extreme examples, but we can also look at the
troubling situation in the former locations of U.S. military bases
in West Germany and old Soviet bases in East Germany.
 &HT;    Clearly the toxic legacy of militarism and the arms race has the
potential to affect _ and already does affect _ the health and the
lives of millions and millions of people.
 &HT;    And as to the environmental challenge beyond the military toxic
legacy?
 &HT;    We know that 1 billion people lived on earth at the beginning of
this century. Today we are perhaps 6 billion people. Imagine the
pressure that is exerted on the resources of our planet, on the
environment, on the biosphere. The pressure is already affecting
the earth's capacity to recuperate.
 &HT;    Moving into the 21st century we have to change our ways of doing
business. Our laissez-faire economic systems are based solely on
the profit motive _ and this does not take into sufficient account
the needs of a healthy society and the environment.
 &HT;    Moving toward the 21st century we must find a way to live in
harmony with nature. We need more modesty in consumption and an
aggressive attitude toward cleaning up the outcome of our past _
and ongoing _ environmental avarice.

 &HT;    PARIS _ Two wounded presidents met this week in Moscow. They
could accomplish little beyond avoiding the embarrassment each
would have felt at calling off their long planned summit.
 &HT;    It is a pity. There are important and urgent issues to be
addressed between Russia and the United States and they are not
getting resolved at lower levels of authority.
 &HT;    Nuclear arms control is at the top of the list. The Start II
treaty which would halve each side's long-range missile warheads
and clear the way for negotiating further needed reductions was
signed by President George Bush before he left office. Ratification
was then stalled in Washington for three years as hostage to Sen.
Jesse Helms' intemperate feud with the State Department, and by the
time the Senate acted Russia's Duma was in no mood to listen to
President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    There's little hope now that the Duma is doing all it can to cut
down Yeltsin and his retread Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
peremptorily fired only four months ago. Both Yeltsin and President
Bill Clinton would like to divert attention to such major issues,
but both are mired in domestic affairs over which they have lost
normal control.
 &HT;    One is mired in tragedy as the Russian economy and society
decompose, the other in farce. But neither one remains a fully
effective leader. The American system with its well-tested checks
and balances makes it somewhat easier for a hamstrung president to
continue to function, and America is still prospering while much of
the world crashes into depression which could drag the industrial
west down too.
 &HT;    But Russia is in grave crisis. It is a mistake to consider its
marginal share in the world economy as reason to brush aside its
woes, and not only because of its undiminished missile power. It
remains a vast, important country with huge potential and it needs
to be a more integral part of the world community if the post-Cold
War period is not to slide into new disasters.
 &HT;    Perhaps too much was put at stake in the role of leaders and
their personal relations during the long years of trying to manage
confrontation. Modern media tend to magnify individuals at the
peak, so that their weakness seems to undermine a whole nation.
 &HT;    But decisions do have to be made in dealing with assorted
threats around the globe _ Iraq, central Africa, Bosnia, Kosovo,
North Korea, to name a few _ and they aren't taken when presidents
are distracted or paralyzed.
 &HT;    Fortunately, there is a consensus among the Western powers to
continue trying to help Russia find its way out of the badly
bungled transition from a communist economy to the market. But
there is a dilemma. Much of the aid so far has been wasted or
stolen, so there is a reasonable demand that further contributions
must have strings of conditionality attached.
 &HT;    The standard International Monetary Fund conditions of slashing
the budget, tightening the currency, privatizing the economy (which
hasn't undercut monopolies, only shifted control to greedy
financiers) are inappropriate or haven't worked, however. More of
the same will produce more of the same-accumulating disaster.
 &HT;    Communist Party Leader Gennadi Zhuganov was right when he said
that the renominated premier offered no coherent program or useful
policies. That was the reason the communists gave for voting
against Chernomyrdin, though their real motive was evidently to
enforce a deal stripping Yeltsin of most of his power.
 &HT;    There needs to be a much more careful analysis of the kinds of
reform Western aid seeks to promote, with an understanding that
monetary maneuvers aren't at the heart of the problem, which is to
get people back to work and to earning purchasing power. The West
cannot interfere in the leadership issue, just as the U.S. wouldn't
tolerate foreign interference in Clinton's travail. But it cannot
avoid interfering on programmatic issues if it is to continue
providing credit. To cut off aid would also be a form of
interference.
 &HT;    It is something of an irony that at the end of a century whose
worst problems were caused by autocratic and dictatorial leaders,
weakness at the top is the problem now for these two countries.
Both Clinton and Yeltsin face recalcitrant, hostile legislatures
and legislatures are inherently poor at statesmanship.
 &HT;    The names of the leaders don't matter all that much, but the
capacity to make and carry out reasoned policies does matter. We
must continue to do what we can to get Russia, and ourselves, out
of our paralyzing binds.

WATCHERS WONDER WHICH RICKY WATTERS WILL SHOW ON SUNDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's first down and the Seahawks hand the ball to Ricky Watters.
There he goes: signing autographs, doing charitable work, joking
with the media, heading toward the end zone, gathering momentum and
adulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Bowl running back appears to be a likeable man with a
sense of humor and urgency who also has the tools of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere he has been, it always reaches fourth down in the
figurative football game. Occasionally, he picks up the necessary
yardage. Too frequently, he gets stuffed at the line and fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday in a wonderfully ironic development, Watters' new
team takes on his old one when the Seahawks visit the Philadelphia
Eagles at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The story line will evolve that afternoon, but the intrigue is
already here. After rushing for more than 1,100 yards in each of
his three seasons in Philadelphia, you would think Watters will be
embraced upon his return, hailed for his contributions, mourned
like a passing hero.
</P>
<P>
   But he will be welcomed back like Shawn Kemp was in Seattle, the
boos and cheers in a pick-em battle over which are more audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``People either hated him or loved him,'' said Joe Altomonte of
WIP, the sports radio station in Philadelphia. ``One guy would say:
`How could you want to get rid of the best player on the team?'
Another guy would say: `This guy sucks. He runs his mouth. Let's
get rid of him.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception?'' said Seahawks linebacker Darrin Smith, who
played with Watters last year in Philadelphia. ``I'm not sure what
it was. I don't think it was positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Try to get a handle on Watters. He is a football at Husky
Stadium in November, slippery and bouncing all over the place. The
truth is more elusive than Watters in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   Perception and reality are oftentimes opposites. With Watters,
they collide.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be a person who means well, talks a good game and
usually backs it up. But then Watters blazes off on an unusual
tangent, prompted by his extreme competitiveness, fiery nature and
healthy ego. He is a big beautiful backyard that requires a lot of
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   For this combustible mix, the Seahawks paid Watters $13 million
for four years, hoping he will produce chunks of yardage instead of
copy for the tabloids. They prefer explosiveness between the
sidelines and nowhere else. It would seem a naive belief that could
be altered as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his very first game for the Eagles in 1995, Watters showed up
as the ballyhooed player who helped the 49ers win the Super Bowl
the year before by scoring three touchdowns against San Diego. He
left Veterans Stadium as a loser in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay beat the Eagles 21-6 and Watters was widely ridiculed
for his flippant response afterward. On a pass play across the
middle, Watters did not stretch out to try for the reception,
fearing head-hunting repercussions from a defensive back. He could
have said he made a mistake and really should have laid himself out
and taken one for the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Watters ran a politically incorrect route, essentially
saying he didn't want to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``For who? For what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an endearing moment. The next day the Philadelphia
Inquirer ran a headline: ``Watters' debut a big disgrace,'' and
columnist Bill Lyon wrote: ``It was the most graceless, clueless,
classless debut by a professional athlete in Philadelphia in
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters apologized two days later, but no one remembers. The
most surprising thing was that the play contradicts Watters'
essence. He normally works hard, even in practice, driven by his
ambition to win.
</P>
<P>
   Watters figures the best chance his team has to win is if the
ball is in his hands. In some circles, that colors him selfish. In
others, it makes him a team player. With Watters, there is
continually a point-counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a highly productive guy and a great player, but I have a
problem with a guy who gets 1,300, 1,400 yards and acts like he
does it by himself,'' said Arizona linebacker Eric Hill two years
ago. ``He's so self-centered, when things go wrong, he's the first
to blame everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is being a winner,'' Smith said. ``Micheal Jordan
never turned down a game-winning shot. It's the same feeling Ricky
has when he wants to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it is an overwhelming feeling. During those years
with the Eagles, Watters touched the ball more than anyone in the
league and yet it was not enough. The situations and plays weren't
right. That led to friction between Watters and offensive
coordinator Jon Gruden, now the Raiders' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   On his weekly TV show, Watters criticized Gruden. During one
game, he made an obscene gesture from the sideline to Gruden in the
pressbox. There was tension between a player and a coach,
divisiveness on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of last season, Watters' role was further
reduced. He became one of three backs in a rotation also featuring
Charlie Garner and Duce Staley. In the last eight games, he nearly
rushed for 100 yards against Cincinnati and Atlanta but was more
apt to trudge for 48 yards on 20 carries like he did against
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the banged-up and otherwise marginally talented offensive
line. But it was legitimate to question Watters too. The Eagles did
not want him anymore. The scuttlebutt is that Watters, never
possessing tremendous outside speed anyway, might be through at 29,
an occasionally over-ripening age for tennis players and running
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People questioned his ability at the end but never his
heart,'' Altomonte said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Eagles and 49ers initially, the Seahawks are infatuated
in the early stages of the relationship. They see him running out
plays in practice, offering leadership, counseling younger backs
Ahman Green and Michael Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very emotional person. That's part of why he's a good
player. He has a passion for winning,'' said offensive coordinator
Bob Bratkowski. ``I can't say anything negative about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratkowski said the Seahawks ran thorough background checks and
made an interesting discovery in the Eagles locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all to a man said: `I want him on my team,''' Bratkowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in 1996 when he led the NFL in yards from scrimmage with
1,855, the Eagles selected him third in the vote for team offensive
MVP behind Irving Fryar and Ty Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Watters' new teammates notice nothing but a warm handshake in
the preliminary bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't brought any of the baggage everybody said he would
bring,'' guard Pete Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Or maybe, as has been known in the past, Watters
appears and then his bags arrive on the next flight, spilling all
over the concourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have matured,'' Watters said. ``(But) I'm still the same
person. I still want to win. I still want the ball in my hands in
clutch situations. ... I'm not going to come in here and be some
prima donna. Like `I'll only do the job if I have the ball.' I'm
going to do the job all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters discussed his years in Philadelphia at training camp but
is now tiring of the topic, declining an interview. He will rehash
the Eagles' years one more time for everyone's consumption this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In Cheney, Watters said that Sunday's game is just one on the
schedule, not more significant than another. He doesn't know why
the Eagles did not want him anymore nor does he care. Regrets? For
who? For what?

TRIAL BRINGS BOEING RACIAL ISSUES TO HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jesse Jones is black; his superiors at The Boeing Co.
are white. Those are two undisputable facts. Much of the rest is
uncertain in a federal court battle between a black manager and The
Boeing Co. that is set for trial in Seattle on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' case, the first to go to trial in what now number dozens
of discrimination complaints against the aerospace giant, will test
not only whether he was discriminated against, but also whether the
company did enough by destroying the power clique behind his ill
treatment that Boeing owes Jones nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Jones earns $84,000 a year _ a fact that might make many
Americans, most of whom make less than that, think that he has
little to beef about. But he says he has been shunned by his
colleagues, sidetracked into a job he does not want (director of
disaster preparedness) and told by high executives that his belief
he is a victim of discrimination is not real. He's angry. He wants
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   His supervisors at Boeing ``did not call me a black jelly bean,
but they certainly treated me like one,'' wrote Jones in a 1996
memo to John Warner, senior vice president. He refers to an
incident that year at Texaco Inc. in which a tape of a high-level
meeting contained remarks that some found to be racist, though
others interpreted as innocuous. The Texaco tape led to the
intervention of affirmative-action campaigner Jesse Jackson, and a
$176 million payout by Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has now taken up the cause of Jones and other African
Americans in two additional lawsuits against Boeing. Jackson has
secured a meeting with Boeing Chief Executive Officer Phil Condit
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spent half an hour with Condit in September 1996. He
remains unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says in a prepared statement, ``We believe Jesse Jones
has been treated fairly and equitably.'' The company concedes that
in Jones' department, security investigations, ``distinct cliques''
pitted former FBI agents against non-agents. The department had
``organizational problems.'' There was ``endemic poor
communication.'' Boeing tackled these problems by moving the key
people out, including Jones' opponents (the FBI ``clique'') and
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   To the company, it was a problem that needed to be fixed. ``We
believe it has been fixed, and without regard to race,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sees the chain of events as injustice against him _ and
that Boeing managers, by fixing an organization without taking
sides in the conflict that damaged it, defaulted on the
responsibility of moral judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they admit that there is a racial problem at Boeing?'' he
asks. ``In 1998? Not in this lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's attorney, Lawrence Hannah of Perkins Coie, argues in
court papers that Jones is trying ``to litigate his life story at
Boeing.'' Jones is offering ``a universe of allegations and
laments,'' Hannah says, that ``transform unexceptional workplace
occurrences, speculation and conjecture into an epic far exceeding
the sum of its parts.''
</P>
<P>
   An epic it is. To Jones, the moral of it is that, in Boeing
management, ``you've got to be white.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is from Fort Worth, Texas. When Jones was 7, just after
World War II, his father left, and Jones was raised by his mother.
He was the first person in his family to graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   According to his statement to the court, Jones' first career was
as a military policemen in the Army. He served two years in
Vietnam, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
In the 1970s he earned a bachelor's degree in law enforcement and a
master's degree in human relations. In 1979, when he'd finished his
20 years and qualified for a pension, he left the Army and accepted
a $22,000 job as a security investigator for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the only African American security investigator in the
Puget Sound shop, and would remain so. Jones says that in the 18
years he was in the department _ fewer than a dozen investigators _
all other investigators or managers were white except for a
Polynesian he hired.
</P>
<P>
   Jones advanced in his career during that time, but not at the
pace he felt entitled to. His bosses repeatedly reached outside his
unit and promoted people over him _ always white men, and usually
former FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Jerry Femling, a former FBI agent, was hired as an
investigator. In 1990 both Femling and Jones were promoted, but
Femling was placed over Jones. Jones testified later that Femling
``harassed and threatened'' him. In 1993 Femling proposed in a memo
``that Jesse Jones be removed from his present position as manager
of Puget Sound Investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was not ousted, but he was awarded no more increases in
his base salary, $69,150, for several years. In 1994, Femling
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Femling's replacement was John Fulks. Fulks had been Jones'
subordinate; he became Jones' boss. Jones resented that. Fulks and
the boss who promoted him, Richard Blay, are both ex-FBI men, and
white.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, Fulks evaluated his new subordinate, Jones,
as ``excellent'' in most categories. ``Jones is very enthusiastic
and gives 100 percent to every task he is assigned,'' Fulks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jones thought he deserved Fulks' job. He also wanted the glamour
assignment of protecting Boeing executives on foreign trips. In
1995 he applied for a passport. But Jones was kept home. Boeing, he
concluded, did not want its executives guarded by black men. His
superiors explained it a different way. Foreign assignments weren't
glamorous, and Jones, who is married with five children, had given
them the impression he didn't want to leave town. Blay would later
testify, ``Because of my responsibilities as director, I felt
obliged to go on such trips. I also had occasion to use John Fulks
because of his FBI experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, Jones filed a formal complaint of
discrimination. He did not file it with the federal or state
governments, but with Boeing's internal equal employment
opportunity office. Where he filed it would turn out to be crucial
because of legal time limits on going back to prosecute
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing began an investigation. Jones says he thought its aim was
to uncover the wrong, and right it. Viola Keith, then Boeing's head
of affirmative action, says in a deposition that a Boeing lawyer
told her he expected Jones to sue, and that the purpose of the
investigation was ``to provide legal advice to Boeing management.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was managed by in-house attorneys and
conducted by Boeing's internal equal employment opportunity staff.
In May or June 1996, Wally Alder, Boeing vice president for support
services, told Jones that ``the investigation found no
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Boeing's human resources department conducted
a second investigation. It also found no discrimination, Boeing
said.
</P>
<P>
   That month, Jones met with Condit, Boeing's chief executive, for
half an hour. ``It felt good being in there with the man,'' Jones
would later say. Condit asked Michael Stewart, vice president for
employee relations, to look into Jones' complaint and resolve it.
Boeing's attorneys would later argue that Condit had little to do
with the issue and was ``akin to an innocent bystander.''
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Fulks completed his annual evaluation of
Jones. The subordinate who in 1995 had been ``excellent'' and
``very good'' in all categories was in 1996 ``adequate,'' ``poor,''
and ``very poor'' in all categories.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was beginning to boil over with indignation.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 24, 1996, memo to Keith, he had asked only that the
company adjust his base salary for missed raises, and watch that he
suffer no more discrimination. But on Sept. 18, after the meeting
with Condit, Jones asked Stewart for a promotion, a pay increase to
$90,000 and ``$500,000 for the way I was treated.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, 1996, he wrote Stewart, ``it took me involving Phil
Condit in order to receive some respect, and still nothing has
happened.'' He wrote, ``My new demand is $1 million and counting as
long as these incidents of retaliation continue.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 29, 1996, he wrote to the senior vice president, Warner,
and upped his demand to $5 million. In a second memo to Warner,
Nov. 14, he compared his case to the ``black jelly bean'' incident
at Texaco Inc. ``The difference being that I have not gone to the
media nor have I informed Jesse Jackson,'' he wrote. ``I do not
plan to sue Boeing, unless all negotiations break down, and then
all bets are off. I will continue to fight for all people of color
in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, 1996, Jones wrote to Warner, ``If our negotiations
fail, I will sue this company and I will win. I think you know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1996, he wrote, ``The new settlement price is $6.5
million. It will continue to go up!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stewart, the vice president delegated to handle the
case, sent his lieutenant, Clark Nebeker, to reconnoiter Jones'
department, security inestigations. On Dec. 20, 1996, Nebeker
reported that morale was ``extremely low'' and that employees were
polarized into ``camps'' _ the Jones camp and the Blay-Fulks camp.
``In the short time that I've had to look at this, I cannot
determine which side carries more credibility,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart presented Boeing's decision to Jones in a meeting in
January 1997 and followed it with a letter dated Jan. 22. Blay
would retire from Boeing. Fulks would be transferred to Florida.
And to Jones he wrote, ``It is also essential to reassign you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had a choice of a job at disaster preparedness with a
$6,350 raise to $77,500, plus a tax-free payment of $25,000, or he
could retire with a package worth $238,000.
</P>
<P>
   The $238,000 was not a settlement offer. Jones could still sue
the company _ but he could not keep his job in security
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Jones protested in writing. The security investigations
department was his career, and he wanted to stay there. But he took
the job in disaster preparedness _ and passed up the $238,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also stated in his letter to Jones that Boeing had found
the security investigations department ``a dysfunctional
environment.'' But he added, ``As we discussed, Boeing's
investigation did not confirm your allegations of racial
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that correct? In October 1996, Boeing had retained attorney
Gloria Flentje of Foulston &AMP; Siefkin, Wichita, Kan., to report on
Jones' allegations and whether he had a legal case against the
company. Flentje's report, like the two before it, was to be for
Boeing eyes only. But somebody photocopied it and mailed it to
Jones. It arrived at his home with a little sticker that said, ``A
gift from Blay.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure wasn't from Blay. Who it was from, Jones says, is still
a mystery. ``Somebody cared about me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jones gave the report to his attorney, John Sheridan of Sherrard
&AMP; McGonagle. Boeing attorney Hannah went to Judge William Dwyer and
tried to have Sheridan booted from the case for using a ``purloined
document'' as a ``road map'' to sue Boeing. Dwyer let Sheridan
stay, but ordered all copies of Flentje's report be given back to
Boeing. Sheridan had to tell the court everyone who had read it,
and each of them had to sign an agreement not to tell anyone what
was in it.
</P>
<P>
   So Jones knows exactly what Flentje concluded. He had her report
in his hand, he says, when he asked Stewart ``point-blank what was
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said Boeing's investigations had uncovered no
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Keith, Boeing's affirmative action officer, heard Stewart's
answer. When Sheridan asked her in depositions whether Stewart had
lied, Hannah instructed her not to answer the question. Since then
Keith has said publicly that Boeing lied and that there was
discrimination found by the company, though she would not comment
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Keith is no longer working at Boeing. While still on Boeing's
payroll, she has been assigned to work at the Urban League in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless her,'' Jones says. ``It was brave what she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah didn't have any hesitation, however, about letting
Stewart answer whether he had lied. ``I did not lie to Jones, at
that meeting or otherwise,'' Stewart said in his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a lie for Stewart to say that Boeing had found no
discrimination? No, argued Hannah. It was a statement about what
Boeing found, and what Boeing found ``was determined by Boeing, not
by Flentje.''
</P>
<P>
   What Boeing found is what management concluded, not necessarily
what its attorney's report said.
</P>
<P>
   In its written statement to the press, Boeing stated: ``In the
course of three EEO reviews, the company never found any instances
of racial discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   But what did Flentje find? In his latest filings with the court,
Sheridan now argues that Boeing can no longer keep the report as a
privileged document, because the company is using its claim of
privilege to cover up lies made under oath.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, 1997, Jesse Jones sued The Boeing Co. and Blay,
alleging racial discrimination, retaliation, negligent infliction
of emotional distress, outrage and defamation. When asked to
provide a list of actionable incidents, Sheridan listed 58 of them.
</P>
<P>
   But by waiting until he did to file a federal complaint, Jones
may have ruled out his most promising claims. Under the federal
statute of limitations, Jones cannot collect damages for actions
before May 2, 1996; under the state statute, not before April 18,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial promotion of Fulks over Jones happened 3{ weeks
before that, on March 24, 1994. Judge Dwyer ruled that the jury can
decide whether the Fulks promotion can be considered, but he also
ruled that most of the earlier claims cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Why had Jones waited? ``I'm not a lawyer,'' he says. ``I didn't
know about the statute of limitations. The company just kept
saying, `Have patience; we're working it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer narrowed the case, throwing out a number of claims,
including that Boeing has a racially hostile work environment.
Jones had planned to call consultant Maria Root to testify on
institutional racism. Root, who earns $250 per hour for her court
appearances, has given testimony in cases involving Boeing, Seattle
City Light, Crescent Foods and the J.C. Penney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing attorney Hannah has asked the court to exclude her.
``Based solely on Jones' untested anecdotal allegations,'' Hannah
argued, ``Root stands prepared to label Boeing a racist
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's ruling focuses Jones' case on more specific incidents _
things that qualify as ``adverse employment actions.'' Jones has to
show that in these actions he was treated differently than people
of other races. Boeing has to explain why it treated him
differently. Jones then has to prove that Boeing's explanation is
factually incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law against promoting an underling over someone's
head. It happens all the time. There is no law against an FBI
clique. There is a law against a white man's clique.
</P>
<P>
   Which was it?
</P>
<P>
   Boeing says it was an FBI clique and a non-FBI clique. Boeing
fixed the problem, it says, by bringing in a new director from
outside the company. ``Tough action'' was taken with Jones'
superiors, the company says. ``The head of security was encouraged
to take early retirement, which he did, and another senior manager
was transferred across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Jones got a raise, and now makes $84,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jones doesn't accept that. ``The company says it's not race;
it's cronyism. Call it discrimination and retaliation. Call it
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, Jones says, he was a white guy, and all the guys
promoted over his head, who got the plum assignments and benefits
for which he was better qualified, were black. ``I would have an
excellent reverse discrimination charge,'' he says. ``The white
community would support me all the way.''

MINT: PROLIFIC AND PERFECTLY SATISFYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This summer I gave in to the mint dominating our
herb garden. Instead of cursing the aggressive plants as they
enacted hostile takeovers of small pockets of soil set aside for
basil, oregano and thyme, I decided to embrace the mint, one sprig
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The results have exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed primarily until now as a traditional accompaniment to
Easter lamb, mint now rates as one of my favorite herbs.
</P>
<P>
   What I have learned, through modest experimentation, is that
mint is a wonderfully versatile herb, one that bestows a unique
personality to fruits, grilled vegetables and seafood as well as
traditional meat dishes.
</P>
<P>
   When I have told friends about some of the different ways I'm
using mint, they tend to look perplexed. No small wonder. Mint is
an herb that grows like a weed, dominating any garden space into
which it is introduced. Besides being both prolific and predatory,
though, mint is also underappreciated and underused.
</P>
<P>
   Few restaurants (except for those featuring Greek, Indian or
Thai cuisine) or home cooks take advantage of the many ways in
which mint can be utilized to make a piquant marinade for fresh
vegetables or as a savory counterpoint to the tartness of lemons
and limes.
</P>
<P>
   Mint is also among the hardiest herbs in colder climates. It is
one of the first plants to awaken each spring, climbing toward the
sun far sooner than most of its brethren. And it is one of the last
of the summer bounty to depart, providing a full four to five
months to experiment with its many uses.
</P>
<P>
   So let us praise Mentha viridis, an herb that should be valued
as dearly as basil or thyme.
</P>
<P>
   It is an herb with a rich and enticing history. In Ancient
Greece, Athenians believed mint to have the aroma of strength, and
they would rub leaves over their arms to bolster their endurance.
Peppermint oil was mentioned by Aristotle as an aphrodisiac, and
the use of wild mint by soldiers of Alexander the Great was
forbidden because he felt it so aroused them erotically that it
took away all desire to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs have also used mint for centuries, partaking of mint teas
as a social drink as well as a virility stimulant. The familiar
after-dinner mints evolved from the ancient custom of concluding
feasts with a sprig of mint to soothe the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Most fresh mint found in supermarkets, like the mint running
amok in my garden, is spearmint. It is a lightly hairy type of mint
with long leaves, less strong and overbearing than peppermint.
</P>
<P>
   Walk along almost any country road, though, and you're sure to
encounter one of its nearly identical cousins, field mint.
</P>
<P>
   For medicinal purposes, particularly soothing teas, the variety
utilized is peppermint.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recipes that showcase how mint can enhance
different dishes:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED EGGPLANT WITH MINT MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   (Serves four)
</P>
<P>
   Two medium eggplants, cut across into one-half-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   One and a half cups mint marinade (see below)
</P>
<P>
   Two tablespoons chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Place the eggplant slices on paper towels and sprinkle with the
salt. Let drain for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry. Place the
eggplant in a bowl. Reserve one-third cup of the marinade and pour
the rest over the eggplant, turning to coat it well. Set aside no
longer than 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a grill or broiler. Grill or broil the eggplant until
browned and tender, about 5 minutes per side. Divide among four
plates, drizzle with the reserved marinade and sprinkle with mint.
Serve.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Three-quarter cup mint marinade
</P>
<P>
   Four red snapper fillets, about eight ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen whole fresh mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler. Pour the marinade into a large, shallow
baking dish. Put the snapper in the pan and lay four mint leaves
over each fillet.
</P>
<P>
   Broil until the snapper is just cooked through, about eight
minutes. Transfer the fillets to four plates and spoon the marinade
over the top. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PASTA WITH FRESH TUNA AND MINT
</P>
<P>
   (Serves four to six)
</P>
<P>
   Six tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   One large onion, peeled and cut into medium dice
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   One pound fresh tuna, cut into one-half-inch thick steaks

   Place four tablespoons of the olive oil and the onion in a large
saute pan. Cook over low heat until the onion is tender, about 10
to 12 minutes. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook
over medium heat, partly covered, until juices thicken and a sauce
forms, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the tuna into one-half-inch dice. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Place the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil
in a separate medium-sized skillet. Turn up heat to medium, add
tuna, and toss until tuna is cooked on the surface but still pink
at the center.
</P>
<P>
   When the sauce has thickened, add the tuna, mint and garlic, and
cook for an additional two to three minutes, or until tuna is just
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the penne in abundant salted boiling water until al dente.
Drain the pasta well. Place in a serving bowl. Add the sauce and
toss gently. Serve immediately.
</P>

<P>
   Two teaspoons grated lemon peel
</P>
<P>
   In small saucepan, combine sugar and lemon juice. Bring to a
boil, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until sugar dissolves.
Remove saucepan from heat; cool about 10 minutes or until
completely cooled. Stir in mint and lemon peel.
</P>
<P>
   Pour mixture over fresh fruit, such as cantaloupe, honeydew,
kiwi fruit, peaches, nectarines, plums and/or strawberries;
refrigerate until serving time.

 &HT;    OUTRAGE ERUPTS OVER 'STEREOTYPICAL' REMARK IN POPULAR SUMMER
MOVIE
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Haitian groups are outraged over what they call a
derogatory remark that links Haitians to the AIDS virus in the
popular summer movie, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing, they say, is that the movie was written
and directed by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed and I feel betrayed by the
African-Americans who are involved with the movie,'' said Marie
Declama, who heads the Association for Haitian-American Development
in Atlanta. ``The remark was totally unnecessary and it only brings
back painful memories for the Haitian people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, 40-year-old divorcee Stella, played by actress
Angela Bassett, has an affair with a young Jamaican man. When her
two sisters press for details, one asks if he used a condom
``because those people have a history of AIDS.'' The other sister
interjects ``No, that's Haiti, Miss Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan,
who co-wrote the screenplay. The Haiti-AIDS reference was not in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians say the remark rekindles the stigma attached to
Haitians years ago when the U.S. government branded them as
potential AIDS carriers and barred them from donating blood.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration removed Haiti from its official
list of high-risk AIDS carriers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of the New York-based
National Coalition for Haitian Rights, was one Haitian who
protested the federal ban on blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assumed Haitians were prone to the virus,'' he said.
``This movie brings back a lot of the pain for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCalla said that he's(CQ) afraid young African-Americans
celebrating McMillan's success will accept the notion that Haiti
and AIDS are synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whether it be on black-oriented radio, in coffee
shops, or even on the Internet, Haitians this week are trying to
figure out how to respond to ``Stella.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have called for a public apology from 20th-Century
Fox, which released the film. Others have asked the studio to
remove the reference from further releases of the film on video and
in foreign markets. Still other groups have pushed for a boycott of
the movie altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Haitians recently gathered at a music store and agreed
to launch a petition drive. In midtown Manhattan, a picket line was
planned outside the Sony Theater on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to mobilize Haitians in Atlanta to write 20th-Century
Fox, and to do anything else they can to protest,'' Declama said.
</P>
<P>
   She said between 7,000 and 10,000 Haitians live in the Atlanta
area.

 &HT;    OUTRAGE ERUPTS OVER 'STEREOTYPICAL' REMARK IN POPULAR SUMMER
MOVIE
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Haitian groups are outraged over what they call a
derogatory remark that links Haitians to the AIDS virus in the
popular summer movie, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing, they say, is that the movie was written
and directed by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed and I feel betrayed by the
African-Americans who are involved with the movie,'' said Marie
Declama, who heads the Association for Haitian-American Development
in Atlanta. ``The remark was totally unnecessary and it only brings
back painful memories for the Haitian people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, 40-year-old divorcee Stella, played by actress
Angela Bassett, has an affair with a young Jamaican man. When her
two sisters press for details, one asks if he used a condom
``because those people have a history of AIDS.'' The other sister
interjects ``No, that's Haiti, Miss Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan,
who co-wrote the screenplay. The Haiti-AIDS reference was not in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians say the remark rekindles the stigma attached to
Haitians years ago when the U.S. government branded them as
potential AIDS carriers and barred them from donating blood.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration removed Haiti from its official
list of high-risk AIDS carriers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of the New York-based
National Coalition for Haitian Rights, was one Haitian who
protested the federal ban on blood donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People assumed Haitians were prone to the virus,'' he said.
``This movie brings back a lot of the pain for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCalla said that he's(CQ) afraid young African-Americans
celebrating McMillan's success will accept the notion that Haiti
and AIDS are synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whether it be on black-oriented radio, in coffee
shops, or even on the Internet, Haitians this week are trying to
figure out how to respond to ``Stella.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have called for a public apology from 20th-Century
Fox, which released the film. Others have asked the studio to
remove the reference from further releases of the film on video and
in foreign markets. Still other groups have pushed for a boycott of
the movie altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Haitians recently gathered at a music store and agreed
to launch a petition drive. In midtown Manhattan, a picket line was
planned outside the Sony Theater on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to mobilize Haitians in Atlanta to write 20th-Century
Fox, and to do anything else they can to protest,'' Declama said.
</P>
<P>
   She said between 7,000 and 10,000 Haitians live in the Atlanta
area.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for 20th-Century Fox declined to comment on the
issue Wednesday. A publicist for McMillan said the author also
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ken Boodhoo, an expert on Haiti at Florida

   CHINA-HOME-BUYERS (Shanghai) _ There seems to be no end to the
number of people eager to buy homes in China's cities, where a
massive conversion of housing from public to private hands means a
revolution in Chinese living standards. This year, millions of
urban families in China are buying homes for the first time. After
years of talking about it, Chinese authorities are finally getting
serious about supporting home ownership, by making mortgages
available in some cases, and by ordering local governments to do
away with state-allocated housing that has been a mainstay of the
Socialist system here. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   TUPELO-UPHOLSTERY (Tupelo, Miss.) _ The Burlington Northern
railroad cuts through downtown Tupelo, Miss., twice, at both ends,
which is a matter of about ten blocks. Standing alone at noon in a
silver shiver of 95 degree August heat on Main Street, you might
not feel like you're at the center of anything, except a train
whistle. But, if you're counting quantity, not quality of sofas,
loveseats and recliners _ is the upholstered furniture capital of
the world. There are over 230 furniture manufacturers within a
fifty mile radius, with over 26,000 employees, producing 50,000
upholstered pieces a day.

</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING-POOL-DESIGN (Undated) _ The reverence most people feel
for the sight and sound of water in the garden doesn't necessarily
extend to the swimming pool. What seems the essence of serenity in
the contemplative setting of the Alhambra, or in Hockney's
aquamarine acrylics, turns garish when suburbia's acrylic pool
liners are viewed from the air. Still, swimming pools endure,
worlds unto themselves and, recently, landscape designers. By Julie
Iovine.

   And
</P>
<P>
   CT-POOL-HOUSE (Undated) _ ``We wanted clean, simple, serene,''
the owner said. ``We wanted to feel the air, the wind.'' And so his
pool-house-without-walls, in woodsy northwestern Connecticut, is no
more substantial than a breezeway with a pavilion at each end. Yet
with its playful evocation of Mies van der Rohe's pavilion in
Barcelona, Spain, and Philip Johnson's glass house in New Canaan,
Conn., it has more impact than the pool, itself. By Elaine Louie.
</P>
<P>
   GARBAGE-CAN-DESIGN (Undated) _ It's the garbage can that got
glamour. Since its introduction two years ago, the Umbra company's
Garbo can, in black, white and translucent colors, has moved from a
best seller at such humble retailers as Linens and Things and Bed,
Bath and Beyond to become a celebrity of the design world. It's
been celebrated in the Italian design press from Domus to Interni,
the Milan-based magazine on whose current cover it appears, and
this fall will get its own ads in Vogue. By Phil Patton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-FRESH-WATER-POND (New York) _ The six teen-agers working on
the new Eib's Pond Community Park on Staten Island did not spend
their childhoods catching tadpoles in rural ponds. Before they
started work on Eib's Pond, few of them had ventured very far into
its 17 acres. Most New York City wetlands are brackish salt
marshes; Eib's Pond (pronounced ``eyebz'') is a rarity: a
freshwater pond. Covering three acres, it is the largest in the
five boroughs of the kettle ponds that were scooped out by the
retreat of the Wisconsin glacier 12,000 years ago. By Mac Griswold.

   NY-HOUSE-BUYING (New York) _ So what if you're about to plunk
down a good portion of your savings _ and have pledged another
chunk of your income for the next 30 years _ on a house or
apartment you now think may have been overpriced? Or maybe it's not
overpriced _ but you think you can't afford it anymore? Or maybe
you just think that with the stock market's woes, you can get it
cheaper? That's where learning to play poker comes in. You've got
to learn when to bluff, when to stay in the game, and, of course,
when to fold. By Tracie Rozhon.

Between May and the unofficial end of summer, Americans chomp down

   UNDATED _ Garry Mauro is on a roll. The latest Texas Poll shows
that he's gained six points in his race to unseat Gov. George W.
Bush, which means that Bush's lead is down to a razor-thin 47
points. Earlier in the campaign, the Texas Poll gave Bush a
53-point lead. Seriously, folks. The 1998 election for governor of
Texas was over a long time ago. It was probably over before Mauro
decided to run. It was certainly over once Mauro hit the campaign

said to my little girl: ``Please, Asha.'' When she finally gave up,

heat to replay history, a time a few years back when many of them
pitched, caught, slammed, stole and ran for the Southwest High
School Raiders. Most of them, still in great shape, meant business,
even if there were other motives for calling this game. The reunion
was in celebration of 24-year-old Monte Pearson, who today will wed

I've seen Guadarrama playing saxophone, whether he was with the
Fort Worth Guitar Army at Billy Bob's last November or Latin
Express at the J&AMP;J Blues Bar a couple weeks ago: He shows up, plays
some great sax, and then is gone, into the night, back to his
9-to-5 gig, which in his case is a midnight-to-noon gig, fixing
laser printers for Xerox, where he has worked for 19 years. By DAVE
FERMAN. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL;

facts. Much of the rest is uncertain in a federal court battle
between a black manager and The Boeing Co. that is set to go to
trial in Seattle on Sept. 15. Jones earns $84,000 a year _ a fact
that might make many Americans, most of whom make less than that,
think that he has little to beef about. But he says he has been
shunned by his colleagues, sidetracked into a job he does not want
(director of disaster preparedness), and told by high executives
that his belief he is a victim of discrimination is not real. He's
angry. He wants vindication. Profile of Jesse Jones discrimination
case against Boeing.

CLINTON TELLS KREMLIN NEWS CONFERENCE HE `REGRETS' AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton, standing next to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin at a Kremlin news conference, on Wednesday defended
his expression of ``regret'' last month for his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and said it was intended to extend ``to all
who were hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake; said that I
regretted it; asked to be forgiven; spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton said, his voice resigned and his mood
somber.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was ``quite encouraged'' by what he said
was the favorable reaction of the American people and world leaders
to his remarks on Aug. 17, just hours after he testified before a
federal grand jury investigating the alleged sexual relationship
with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and the cover-up of the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's acknowledgement of a relationship with Lewinsky that
was ``not appropriate _ in fact it was wrong'' came after seven
months of public denials by the president, his wife and White House
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I misled people, including even my wife. I
deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Kremlin, Clinton was asked about the tone of his speech
on Aug. 17 when he didn't apologize and instead lashed out at
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who is investigating the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship for evidence of perjury, subornation
of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it (the speech) the other day again, and I thought it
was clear that I was expressing my profound regret to all who were
hurt and to all who were involved and my desire not to see any more
people hurt by this process and caught up in it,'' Clinton replied.
</P>
<P>
   As he has previously, Clinton sought to portray the Lewinsky
affair as a private matter to be worked out within his marriage to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my best to continue to go through this
personal process in an appropriate way, but to do my job, to do the
job I was hired to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Starr, Clinton said he believed the ongoing
four-year, $40-million inquiry ``had consumed a disproportionate
amount of America's time, money and resources, and attention and
now continued to involve more and more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``All I wanted to say was I believe it's time for
us to now go back to the work of the country and give the people
their government back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin news conference with Yeltsin was the first
opportunity for reporters to meet with Clinton since his Aug. 17
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who accompanied Clinton aboard
Air Force One as a member of the official U.S. delegation,
upbraided Reuters White House correspondent Laurence McQuillan for
asking one of the two questions about the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American I'm outraged,'' Hoyer, a member of the House
Democratic leadership, told the veteran White House correspondent
who had asked Clinton whether he felt he needed to ``offer an
apology'' and whether he wished the tone of his Aug. 17 address had
been different.
</P>
<P>
   His Kremlin comments represented his third attempt in 17 days to
put the White House sex scandal to rest and quell a political
controversy that imperils his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   During his vacation last month on Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
Clinton interrupted his family retreat to visit a church and tell a
predominantly black audience that he was ``having to become quite
an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that he had learned during the controversy
that he had to ``forgive those we believe have wronged us'' before
he could ``ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former Bush administration Justice Department official
and federal appeals court judge, is expected to report his findings
to the House of Representatives by the end of the month. House
Republicans are gearing up to weigh Starr's findings to determine
whether an impeachment inquiry is warranted by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 17 address, Clinton lambasted Starr, accusing him of
steadily broadening a court-approved investigation into the
Clintons' failed 1978 Whitewater land scheme in Arkansas into a
wide ranging probe of White House operations and his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the
prying into private lives,'' Clinton declared. ``This has gone on
too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had declared in a Jan. 17 deposition in Paula Jones'
$700,000 civil sexual harassment lawsuit that: ``I have never had
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark.,
issued an order Tuesday that she would release the misleading
deposition on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Wright wrote in a one-sentence footnote to her decision that she
had ``concerns about the nature'' of Clinton's deposition in light
of his subsequent admission that he did ``not volunteer
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said her court ``makes no findings at this time regarding
whether the president may be in contempt.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Oh, just shut up
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who behaves as a kind of
personal moral scourge of Bill Clinton, has alerted constituents to
expect an egregiously ugly story about his personal life in Vanity
Fair magazine. Vanity Fair has interviewed several hundred friends,
relatives and associates, and Burton has apologized in advance for
whatever the magazine will have to say about him. Burton suggests
Clintonite poltroons at the root of his problem. Not much of a
surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   Affronted Clintonites and Vanity Fair scoff at the allegation.
What do you expect them to do? There is no reason to rejoice or go
all crestfallen about Burton's plight. Burton once called the
president a ``scumbag.'' That is his right, but it is at a level of
discourse akin to heaving your breakfast into a howling gale.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people around Congress are probably feeling pretty
vulnerable these days. Their sins are presumably no greater than
most American families learn to tolerate and shut up about. But
that is the problem with setting a high moral tone for others.
There is nothing more delicious than gossip about gossipy
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicate that the Burton stuff is mostly the tale
of a lengthily troubled marriage. This may bring off the almost
impossible trick of turning Dan Burton into a sympathetic figure.
Didn't work for Bill Clinton, but, what the hey, it's worth a try.

FRANK TALK, JUST IN TIME FOR YOUR LABOR DAY COOKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day marks the end of high season for hot dogs. Between May
and the unofficial end of summer, Americans chomp down on 880
million franks. And the eating goes on, no matter the season;
yearly, Americans enjoy a total of 2 billion hot dogs. That's about
60 dogs for every man, woman and child. Here are some hotdog
factoids:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   COLONEL MUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans top their dogs with mustard (60 percent). The
youngest among us prefer ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   CHUBBY DOGS
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans choose the full-fat version; only 11 percent of
hot dogs sold in supermarkets are low-fat or nonfat.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO DRESS A DOG
</P>
<P>
   Apply condiments in this order:
</P>
<P>
   1. Wet ones first, such as mustard or chili.
</P>
<P>
   2. Then chunky stuff, such as relish, onion, sauerkraut and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   3. Finally, if you're from Chicago, sprinkle on the celery salt.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DOG DO'S AND DON'TS
</P>
<P>
   DO
</P>
<P>
   Serve sesame seed, poppy seed and plain buns. Sun-dried tomato
buns or basil buns are considered gauche with franks.
</P>
<P>
   Treat hot dogs on buns as finger food. Flatware should not touch
hot dogs on buns.
</P>
<P>
   Lick off andy ketchup/mustard/chili/onions remaining on fingers
after eating.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T
</P>
<P>
   Take more than five bites to finish eating your hot dog. For a
foot-long dog, seven bites are acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Put toppings between the dog and the bun. Always layer
condiments on top of the frankfurter.
</P>
<P>
   Use ketchup if you're more than 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   _ National Hot Dog &AMP; Sausage Council
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``In place of the single hot dog of today, there should be a
variety as great as that which has come to prevail among
sandwiches. There should be hot dogs for all appetites, all tastes,
all occasions. They should come in rolls of every imaginable kind
and be accompanied by every sort of relish, from Worcestershire
sauce to chutney. The hot dog should be elevated to the level of an
art form.''
</P>
<P>
   _ H.L. Mencken, 1929
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE FAMOUS AND THE FRANKFURTER
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth once downed 12 hot dogs and eight bottles of soda
between a doubleheader. He was rushed to the hospital with a severe
case of indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Dietrich said hot dogs and champagne made up one of her
favorite meals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three Seattle Seahawks were fined $1,000 each for
eating hot dogs on the sideline during a preseason game.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A TASTE TEST
</P>
<P>
   Our informal panel of four testers tried a dozen supermarket hot
dogs. All were grilled indoors for the same amount of time and were
served plain, sans bread or condiments. The winners are, not
surprisingly, the premium-brand beef franks:

 &HT;    TEENS KNOW ABOUT POP CULTURE BUT NOT CONSTITUTION
 &HT;    560&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More American teenagers can name all Three Stooges
than know the three branches of government, a witness told a Senate
subcommittee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a appropriations subcommittee hearing, Philadelphia Mayor
Edward G. Rendell released a national survey showing a predictable
gap between teenagers' grasp of pop culture and their knowledge of
the U.S. Constitution. Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 25 percent knew the Constitution was written in
Philadelphia but about 75 percent knew that 90210 was the zip code
of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly three of every four of the surveyed teenagers knew that
the Vice President is Al Gore, while nearly nine out of every 10
knew that the male star of the movie ``Titanic'' was Leonardo
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Three of every four teens knew that Bart Simpson lives in a
cartoon Springfield, but only about one in 10 knew that Springfield
(Ill.) was the hometown of Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only about 2 percent knew that William Rehnquist is Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court while nearly 95 percent knew that Will
Smith played the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About one in five knew there are 100 U.S. senators, while more
than four in five knew there are three brothers in the Hansons
musical group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't view these poll results as an indictment of our
teens,'' cautioned Rendell, recalling that a similar survey a year
ago found that only about 5 percent of American adults could
correctly answer 10 basic questions about the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the surveys and for Rendell's testimony is to
raise money for a $210 million National Constitution Center to be
built in Philadelphia. The mayor is seeking $65 million, spread
over three installments, in federal funds. The museum would tell
the continuing story of the so-called living document in which the
founding fathers set up a government at the Constitutional
Convention of 1787 and through which the nation has operated ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has included a total of $20 million for the project
in its FY 1999 Interior and Education budgets but the House has not
funded the Center. ``It's a continuing battle,'' conceded Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the subcommittee and author of
the original1988 legislation authorizing the National Constitution
Center (NCC).
</P>
<P>
   Specter expressed outrage that some of his colleagues had called
the project ``pork.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bulk of the funding coming from private donors and
state and local governments, Rendell said supporters are aiming for
a groundbreaking ``on the first Constitution Day of our third
millenium, Sept. 17, in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Expected to draw 1 million visitors a year and to connect online
with classrooms and virtual visitors around the world, the center
would change the results of future surveys on constitutional
knowledge, the backers testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no surprise to us that teens know more about pop culture
than the Constitution, but it is shocking that the gap is so
wide,'' said Joseph Torsella, the NCC president. ``Ironically, it
is the very essence of the Constitution that enables such a vibrant
pop culture in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide telephone survey of 600 Americans between the
ages of 13 and 17 was conducted in August by Luntz Research Company
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nearly 60 percent could name Three Stooges (Larry, Moe, Curly
Joe and Shep) while 41 percent could name the three branches of
government (executive, legislative and judicial).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While 35.5 percent could recite the first three words of the
Constitution (''We the People), 72.2 percent knew the three letters
(www) that follow ``http'' in Internet website addresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Just over half picked the century (20th) in which women
obtained the right to vote but more than 9 in 10 knew the band that
celebrates ``girl power'' _ the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Only 1.8 percent knew that James Madison is considered the
Father of the Constitution, while 58.3 percent knew that Bill Gates
is considered the father of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  However, more teenagers (90.8 percent) knew that 18 is the
minimum voting age for president than knew that you have to be at
least 17 to see an R-rated movie without a parent or guardian.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  While about one in three knew that Newt Gingrich is Speaker of
the House, nearly 9 in 10 knew that Tim Allen is the father in TV's
``Home Improvement.''

CAN AMERICA PRACTICE WHAT IT PREACHES ON MORALITY? (For use by

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asha was trying to force me to take a bite of her candy.
</P>
<P>
   I was busy reading and thinking what I might say about this
thing causing my heartache. So I turned away from the red, wet
lollipop and, in that voice I use in response to annoying behavior,
said to my little girl: ``Please, Asha.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finally gave up, she turned to bounce out of the room
and said, ``I love you, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   With my head still buried in James Baldwin's ``The Devil Finds
Work,'' I managed to mumble, ``I love you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, she turned back, looked at me and said, ``Oh,
yeah? Prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I knew this thing that had taken hold of me. For
weeks, I'd been trying to decide what to make of the constant and
diverse chorus of voices talking about morals and morality.
</P>
<P>
   At no other time in history have I seen so many people willing
to dissect and debate the morality of others. Part of me believes
this is a good thing. But I worry about what seems to be a
recurring problem in our judgment: a tendency toward simplicity and
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an anonymous reader called the other day to take
exception to a column I wrote about two teen-age mothers who were
denied admission into the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, there should be no rewards for pregnant unmarried
teen-agers,'' she said. ``It's the parents' fault for not putting
those children on birth control. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The call ended there, and I wondered later if she were sorry for
disagreeing, or sorry for what seemed to me a contradiction. Was
she suggesting that it's OK for teens to be sexually active as long
as they avoid pregnancy?
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this again last Sunday, as I sat in church
listening to a guest minister tell the story of the prophet Elijah.
Afraid for his life, Elijah had sought refuge in the mouth of a
cave, when the Lord came to him and asked, ``What are you doing
here, Elijah?'' It was the same question God asked Adam in the
Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit: ``Adam,
where art thou?''
</P>
<P>
   As the preacher pointed out Sunday, this was not a question of
either of their physical locations, but rather where they were in
their relationship to God. Where are you morally, Elijah? Adam?
America? Prove it.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of all the scandal, the rape and murder and lies that
saturate our lives and our newspaper headlines, and wondered how it
is that, with all the talk about morals, we find ourselves in such
a wretched place.
</P>
<P>
   Now my daughter had transported me with a simple question into
the darkness again, and I realized I'd missed an opportunity to
show my love for her. In effect, to prove the God in me.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Asha returned. This time, I closed my book, set
it down on the table in front of me and gave her my undivided
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Still bouncing, she asked if I'd sell the items from the
brochure she'd brought home from school ``at your work.'' I told
her I'd try.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a really good mother,'' she told me with a wet kiss,
``because you're going to help out.''
</P>
<P>
   As she left the room a final time, I was warmed by her
compliment. Am I really who she says I am?
</P>
<P>
   Only I can answer that. But where are you, America? Prove it.

 &HT;    CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS FOLLOW IN WAKE OF CLINTON'S WORDS
 &HT;    Subs final grafs with 2 grafs to include full Clinton quote.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is drawing on his fabled gift of
gab in his counteroffensive to rescue his administration. But his
efforts to take refuge in popular issues is creating deeper cracks
in his support.
</P>
<P>
   Adhering to the credo of Richard Nixon to ``nail down your
base'' first, Clinton has carved out time in the midst of crises at
home and abroad to meet with his most loyal voter groups after his
admission of a sexual liaison with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On the Massachusetts resort island of Martha's Vineyard last
week, Clinton clasped hands with veterans of the civil rights
movement and linked himself to one of the cherished heroes of
racial equality, Nelson Mandela. Under fire for his improper
relations with a 21-year-old White House intern, the president
likened his situation to that of Mandela, who spent 27 years in
prison doing hard labor for leading the opposition to South
Africa's white apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested that he had learned from Mandela how to
forgive ``people you believe have wronged you,'' apparently putting
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in a category with Mandela's
racist tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   If that was a stretch inviting ridicule or outrage, Clinton
emerged temporarily unscathed, with images of a warm embrace by a
group of his most ardent defenders. But he may now be paying a
price, as in a chiding from Clifford Alexander, who was a prominent
black member of three Democratic administrations and former
secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in trouble, and even when he's not, Bill Clinton is
known to play fast and furious with issues of race,'' writes
Alexander in Wednesday's editions of The Wall Street Journal, in
which he lambastes Clinton for portraying himself as being at the
center of the struggle for racial equality and then failing to give
the subject ``concentrated leadership, thought and attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's role in his race initiative had been more as a
``TV talk-show host'' than leader, Alexander says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempts to rejuvenate his languishing education
agenda falls into a similar danger zone. Just since his confession
Aug. 17 of the liaison with Lewinsky, the president has made three
visits to schools, including an appearance with First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton at a Moscow elementary school. All the events
stressed his interest in a subject dear to the hearts of his
``soccer mom'' vote.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping off in Herndon, Va., on Monday before his departure for
Russia, Clinton met a friendly crowd eager to rally behind ideas
for better schools. However, the visit Monday was marred by one
prominent local ex-supporter who didn't show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply could not bring myself to come and be with Mr.
Clinton,'' said Jane K. Strauss, a Fairfax County school board
member, in an interview after she boycotted the appearance. ``I
can't support somebody who on the one hand says he supports the
rights of women and the protection of women when in fact he is
taking advantage of a young woman who is not much older than my own
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hiding behind schools and children to somehow convince us
that we can believe him and that we can trust in his judgment,''
added Strauss, a Democrat who said she twice voted for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now even Clinton's education proposals are ``hollow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's unfinished agenda for schools could add to
his credibility problems. Although he vowed a year and a half ago
to make education his top priority for his second term, he has
failed to deliver on most of his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Still undelivered and mired in difficulties are national testing
to raise standards, linking up every classroom to the Internet, and
money to help rebuild crumbing schools. Not only has his plan to
pay for 100,000 new teachers flopped, but a teacher shortage has
grown so acute in some areas that the Bronx school department in
New York has begun importing teachers from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked only in fits and starts on these and other
issues, raising yet more questions as Clinton travels overseas and
beams back messages tailored for American ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work and said I was going back to work,'' Clinton
said at his news conference Wednesday in Moscow, in his latest
attempt to close out the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   But he has yet to ask the public formally for forgiveness, and
his statement added one more obstacle to restoring his lost
credibility.

ADDING UP THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF BUYING OR LEASING A PC

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rapid pace of evolution in the personal computer industry
guarantees that today's cutting-edge personal computer will be dull
in about two years. And at the rate computer prices are falling,
better and faster computers will be available in two years _ or two
months, for that matter _ at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a PC buyer to do? Some are turning to personal leases
as a hedge against obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing is not for everyone. Leasing a PC _ in effect, borrowing
it from the manufacturer or a leasing company in return for fixed
monthly payments for a specified period _ almost always winds up
costing more than buying the computer outright.
</P>
<P>
   For entry-level to mid-range PCs, leasing usually costs hundreds
of dollars more. For top-of-the-line computers, the kind many
people will consider leasing, the difference can easily top $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The least expensive way to buy a PC is to pay cash. But for
people who need a computer right away and do not have the cash to
buy it outright, or for those who are sure that they will want to
trade the computer in for a newer and better model in two or three
years, leasing is an increasingly popular option.
</P>
<P>
   Most leases give the customer an option of buying the computer
at the end of the lease, either for some independently established
price (typically the ``Orion Blue Book'' wholesale price for used
computers) or for a fixed percentage of the original contract
price.
</P>
<P>
   But buying the PC at the end of the lease defeats the purpose of
leasing. The customer ends up with an outdated PC that inevitably
costs far more than if the computer had been purchased at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   Financial calculations on leasing are complex, especially if the
computer is to be used for a business. Lease payments can be
tax-deductible in some cases, while the purchase price of the same
equipment can be deductible or depreciated, depending on
circumstances. It makes sense to check with a tax adviser before
deciding.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, however, if you know with certainty that you
are going to want a new computer in two or three years and you are
willing to pay hundreds of dollars to avoid the hassle of selling
the old one, a lease may make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you need a computer today but lack the cash to buy it
outright and do not want to take on a bank loan or credit card
debt, a lease may be the right solution.
</P>
<P>
   But if you entertain even vague thoughts about keeping the
computer at the end of the lease, it probably makes more sense to
buy the computer outright, even if that means extending payments on
a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example:
</P>
<P>
   Joe is a graphic designer and game fanatic who covets a Dell
Dimension XPS R Mini Tower desktop computer with a 450-megahertz
Pentium II system, 128 megabytes of high-speed RAM, a 16.8-gigabyte
hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive, a Zip drive, a 17-inch monitor, 3-D
video and 3-D sound with a subwoofer, a 56 kilobits per second
modem and other frills. Dell's price is $2,699. He has $500 in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Joe knows that in two years he will want something better and
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Dell offers a 24-month lease for his chosen computer at $131 a
month; under the plan, Joe makes no payment for 30 days. His total
monthly payments will be $3,144 (plus tax and shipping).
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the lease, Joe does not own the computer. He can
either return it to Dell (he pays the freight back), or he can buy
it for 22 percent of the original price, which comes to $593.78. If
he buys the computer, his total purchase price will be more than
$3,700.
</P>
<P>
   Joe can lower his monthly cost by taking a longer-term lease
($101 a month for 36 months), but his overall payments, including
the purchase price at the end of the lease _ 15 percent of the
original cost instead of 22 percent, which shows how rapidly PCs
lose value _ will be higher: $4,040.85. Or he can pay to ship the
computer back to Dell and lease a newer system.
</P>
<P>
   If Joe decides to buy the same Dell computer outright by
charging it to his Visa card and paying the cost in the same 24
months, he would almost certainly come out better. According to
figures supplied by Visa International, assuming an annual interest
rate of 16.5 percent and a purchase price of $2,699, Joe would make
24 monthly payments of $132.80 each and would own the computer
outright. Interest charges would be $488.13, making his total
payments $3,187.13 (plus tax and shipping).
</P>
<P>
   He could then sell the computer and put the proceeds toward his
next machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now let us assume that Joe can pay cash for the computer. His
$2,699 (plus the familiar tax and shipping fees) could have been
relaxing in the bank, earning a few percentage points of interest
for 24 months. Given the current paltry level of bank interest
rates, his additional cost of lost interest income, minus the taxes
on his interest income, would be trivial. So paying cash is the
least expensive way to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, of course, Joe would have been much better off if
he had skipped buying the computer altogether and had instead
bought $2,699 worth of Dell stock 24 months ago. It would be worth
more than $40,000 now, based on the midday stock price Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight can be cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is Your Ware, offered by Gateway. In Your Ware,
the customer buys a PC and related services under a 48-month
purchase plan for a monthly fee as low as $50 and has the option of
trading the computer for a new one in two to four years. It is not
a lease; Gateway is financing the purchase, and the customer owns
the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that Gateway promises to buy the used computers
from its Your Ware customers, at any point after the 23rd month and
before the 49th month, for the prevailing wholesale price at the
time, as determined by the ``Orion Blue Book'' only if the customer
applies the money toward another Gateway PC.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Joe decided at the last minute to choose a Gateway
G6-450 computer instead of the Dell machine, which has roughly
comparable specifications but trades a few gigabytes of hard disk
space for a component enticingly called 12MB 3Dfx Voodoo-2 3D
Accelerator with Extreme Gaming. It costs $2,699, the same as the
Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Your Ware program, Joe decides to finance his purchase
for 24 months at Gateway's 14.9 percent interest rate. His monthly
payment is $131, the same as Dells for a machine costing the same
$2,699. But at the end of the two years, Joe owns the Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   He can keep it, sell it or send it back to Gateway, which will
pay him the ``Orion Blue Book'' value and apply the money toward a
new Gateway computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Gateway customer also has to pay shipping fees to return the
computer, and the computer has to be in good shape, with all of the
original manuals and disks.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway reserves the right to reduce the trade-in value below
the ``Orion Blue Book'' listing at its sole discretion, as the
lawyers say, and if the customer does not like the price, Gateway
will return the computer at the customer's expense.
</P>
<P>
   For those concerned about both price and obsolescence, the
Gateway Your Ware plan can cost as little as $35 a month for a
peppy Celeron 333 computer system on a four-year plan. The customer
can choose to trade for a newer Gateway computer between the second
and fourth years, applying the residual value of the older computer
toward the new financing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Your Ware is a clever way for Gateway to lock in customers who
might otherwise switch to different brands in the future. If the
customer is not firmly committed to buying Gateway computers in the
future, however, the end-of-contract buyout probably does not make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   Leases raise many other issues, including the following:
</P>
<P>
   Some leases require the customer to get permission before making
any upgrades, like adding more memory. Any upgrades made to the
system must be removed and the original equipment installed at the
end of the lease. Some leasing programs allow the customer to
upgrade a system for additional fees.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors and printers typically have longer useful lives than
computers, so it makes more sense to buy them rather than lease
them.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to return the computer, you must make arrangements
to transfer your data to a new computer. Some companies will
transfer the data to a new leased machine for a fee, but otherwise
the customer has to figure out how to send back the old computer,
get the new computer and make sure the data and applications move
from one to the next.
</P>
<P>
   There are substantial penalties for early termination of a
lease. Watch for hidden fees.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to ask what technical support is included in the lease.
Make sure you know who is responsible for maintaining the PC and
fixing it if it breaks. If the machine has technical problems, will
the leasing company replace it or pay for repairs? If the machine
is to be replaced, how quickly will you get a new one? These issues
should be spelled out in the lease.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your home insurance policy covers the leased computer
because you are responsible if the computer is stolen or damaged.
Some leasing companies will provide insurance on the leased
equipment for an additional monthly fee.

CAN AMERICA PRACTICE WHAT IT PREACHES ON MORALITY? (For use by

   Asha was trying to force me to take a bite of her candy.
</P>
<P>
   I was busy reading and thinking what I might say about this
thing causing my heartache. So I turned away from the red, wet
lollipop and, in that voice I use in response to annoying behavior,
said to my little girl: ``Please, Asha.''
</P>
<P>
   When she finally gave up, she turned to bounce out of the room
and said, ``I love you, Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   With my head still buried in James Baldwin's ``The Devil Finds

   Technology has always been the dentist's stock in trade. From
high-speed drills to X-rays, the men and women who pull and
preserve teeth have often turned to technology to take their
practice one more step beyond the image of the torture chamber.
It's no surprise then, that dentists are going digital.
</P>
<P>
   Patients will still have to open wide, of course, to have
cavities filled and teeth removed. Some things never change. But
X-ray film may one day be replaced by a wafer-sized sensor that
electronically generates an X-ray image on a chair-side monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The dental mirror may be replaced, or at least augmented, by a
slender fiber-optic tool that uses a miniature video camera to show
incipient trouble spots. And along with the fiber-optic wand may
come a range of computerized devices that inject Novocain, check
the health of the gums and even analyze the bite _ no more chomping
and grinding the teeth on squares of black paper.
</P>
<P>
   The new technologies appear to offer faster treatments, less
exposure to radiation than with conventional X-rays and, in some
cases, less pain and suffering. But patients may pay a premium for
the convenience of some of the new high-ticket equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Some dentists simply refuse to go digital. Dr. Stephen S.
Markow, for instance, who regularly upgrades the equipment in his
Brooklyn Heights office in New York City (the drill, X-ray
equipment and autoclave have all been updated within the past four
years), laughs at some of the new digital technology, particularly
at a $75,000 crown-making machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with the price,'' Markow said. ``It would
mean cutting down on lunches for the next thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Price, who teaches dentistry at Boston University
and often speaks on behalf of the American Dental Association,
urges both dentists and patients to leaven their enthusiasm for
whiz-bang equipment with a healthy dose of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dentists as a group love bells and whistles,'' he said, joking
about his own ``$600 paperweights'': expensive equipment that has
ended up collecting dust on his desk in Newton, Mass., where he
practices dentistry. ``Now I wait and see instead of being the
first on the block to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gordon J. Christensen, a dentist in Provo, Utah, who is the
co-founder of a nonprofit group that tests dental products and
publishes its findings in a newsletter that some practitioners
regard as the dental equivalent of Consumer Reports, urges people
not to accept new equipment solely because it is digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the new computerized devices are to the patient's
advantage,'' he said, ``but dentists and their patients must choose
between what is new and better, and what is just new. Intraoral
cameras and digital radiography, for instance, actually make the
practice faster and, in the end, lower fees as they serve patients
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs to dentists for digital technology vary from a few
hundred dollars, for programs that keep track of patient
medications, to about $75,000 for the computer-operated machine
that produces crowns and other ceramic restorations on the spot,
letting the patient get all the work done in one two- to three-hour
visit to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eugene L. Antenucci, a dentist in Greenlawn, N.Y., is one of
a handful of dentists in the New York area who have the new
instrument for making crowns and inlays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision early in my practice to provide the most
advanced technology that has been proven to work,'' Antenucci said.
``A crown is still a crown, but this machine allows me to do crowns
and other restorations in a one-visit procedure, chair-side with
the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dentist with the crown machine is Dr. Steven David, who
practices in Manhattan and is also a clinical professor at New York
University. ``It does take an act of faith to invest so much money
in one piece of equipment,'' he said, ``but patient volume and
satisfaction soon pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many venturesome dentists are using computers for small jobs,
like scanning X-rays from referring dentists into their databases
to create digital files for patients, sending digital X-rays by
e-mail to show their work to insurance companies and communicating
with one another on the Internet, often using digitized images to
discuss diagnoses and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is going to affect every part of dental
practice,'' said Dr. David A. Whiston, president of the American
Dental Association, based in Chicago, whose membership includes
143,000 dentists. The association will have a program on
integrating digital technology into dentistry, called Taking the
Byte out of Technology, at its October meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first areas of digital dentistry to achieve wide
acceptance will probably be digitized X-rays. Dr. Randolph Todd,
whose Manhattan office specializes in endodontics, like root
canals, has used digital X-rays since 1995. ``The main reason is
low radiation _ about 90 percent less,'' Todd said. ``This is a
substantial patient benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   For digital X-rays, the patient opens wide not for X-ray film,
but for a sensor with a computer chip, similar to the sensors found
in digital cameras. Because the sensor is far more sensitive than
regular film, less radiation is required.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor transmits the data directly to a computer, and a
digital X-ray appears on the screen within seconds. The image can
be manipulated to change the contrast, resolution, orientation and
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of three or four minutes, depending on the type of
processing to do conventional X-rays, it's three or four seconds,''
said Todd, who uses a machine manufactured by Schick Technologies.
``I can see where I'm working, and so can the patient.'' Todd uses
a networked system that allows him to call up X-rays for patients
in any of his five treatment rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, whose center has evaluated digital radiography,
said the quality of its images was about the same as for
conventional X-rays. But he added: ``It's superior for speed, lower
radiation and communication, as the method offers long-term, easily
stored records. It is far more commonly used in Western Europe. I
think there's going to be an explosion of use in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-optic dental cameras are also expected to become more
popular in the United States as they become less expensive and more
familiar. To use the technology, a dentist holds a small
fiber-optic device that looks like a wand and aims it at an area of
the mouth; the image is transmitted to a miniature video recorder.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Patients and doctors look at the image on a computer monitor,
where views may be magnified to many times the original size. The
devices are similar to the fiber-optic tools used by doctors to
view areas of the body that are otherwise hard to see.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Goldstein has used fiber-optic dental cameras for many
years in his busy Manhattan office and says they can pinpoint
problems before they get bigger. ``Often patients feel a sensation
long before a tooth breaks,'' he said. ``This technology allows me
to see things before they get worse. Over a period of time, teeth
with big filings get weak. Cracks start. My ability to see these
cracks early means I can sometimes put a cap on them before they
need a root canal, or fracture and are lost. It's a huge patient
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, too, says the new cameras are important to
dentistry. ``We've been evaluating them for 12 years,'' he said.
``Two or three of them are superb, and they are down in price from
$30,000 to $10,000 for good, $5,000 for acceptable. They are
mandatory for a practice for the dentist and the patient to see
what the problem is. Without them, you are practicing 1947
dentistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other digitized devices are also making their way into dental
offices, including a possible replacement for that fearsomely sharp
piece of steel, the periodontal probe, that dentists use to measure
the depth of any treacherous spaces, or periodontal pockets,
developing between teeth and gum.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kenneth S. Magid, who has a general practice in Harrison,
N.Y., uses an electronic probe that has a flexible tip instead of a
steel one. At the other end is the inevitable cable to communicate
with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   With a standard probe, he said, ``the depth of the pocket
depends on how hard you push _ that means inherent inaccuracy.''
The digital probe is more accurate, he explained. ``The computer
probe always uses the same amount of force,'' he said, ``and it
measures to a tenth of a millimeter, so you wind up with very
repeatable, extremely accurate measurements. And you don't have to
worry about being heavy-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even dentists with high-technology practices may not be pure
technophiles. Goldstein, whose equipment ranges from fiber-optic
dental cameras to digital radiography and lasers, is not
enthusiastic about a new computerized injection system he bought,
although some other dentists think it useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it is is a needle to give an injection under controlled
pressure,'' Goldstein said. ``I sent mine back. It's not as
intimidating as a regular needle _ it looks more like a little pen
_ but my patients didn't like the amount of time it took.''
</P>
<P>
   Many patients worry about that dentists may pass on the cost of
expensive equipment to them, no matter how often dentists reassure
them that they will not need to charge more because the equipment
allows them to do more procedures in the same amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen said larger offices and team practices were less
likely to raise prices after getting expensive digital equipment.
``In a well-run office, auxiliary staff can use much of the
equipment _ for instance, the digital camera _ freeing the dentist
for other jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ross W. Nash, who practices in Charlotte, N.C., said a few
of his charges were related to the cost of equipment but that most
were not. ``We don't charge a premium for digital radiography,'' he
said. ``It's more convenient to use; the X-rays are easier to read;
the time and money they save means they don't cost any more to do
than conventional X-rays. But when we do laser surgery, we charge
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions of cost and value are at least theoretically
answerable in trying to assess the value of new technology. But
there are some benefits that are hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   One of Todd's patients, for example, was so taken with the
images of his teeth that he made them into art. ``I loaded the
X-rays onto a floppy disk for him,'' Todd said, ``and he blew them
up into a poster-sized picture. Up close, the image is all dots,
but as you move back, you can see the tooth. He has it hanging on
his wall.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUPELO, Miss. _ The Burlington Northern Railroad cuts through
downtown Tupelo, Miss., twice, at both ends, east and west, which
is a matter of about 10 blocks. The trailing wail and the
crossings' clanging are as ubiquitous as the bug songs of the
cicadas and crickets that pulse like a fever from the shade trees
and the flowering crepe myrtle.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone at noon in a silver shiver of 95 degree August
heat on Main Street, you might not feel like you're at the center
of anything, except a train whistle. But you would be at the center
of the known upholstered universe.
</P>
<P>
   Tupelo _ if you're counting quantity, not quality of sofas, love
seats and recliners _ is the upholstered-furniture capitol of the
world. There are more than 230 furniture manufacturers within a 50
mile radius, with more than 26,000 employees, producing 50,000
upholstered pieces a day.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not from Tupelo, you are there for one of two
reasons: the upholstery industry or Elvis Presley. Tupelo is his
birthplace, but today furniture is king.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th annual fall Tupelo Furniture Market was held two weeks
ago _ 1.25 million square feet of product lines on display in nine
hangarlike sheds. The wholesale market and its Mississippi
manufacturing base are the resource and last refuge for the mom and
pop retail furniture stores in America.
</P>
<P>
   V.M. Cleveland, a real estate developer from Alabama, conceived
of and built the market in 1987. ``The only way you used to find
out about Tupelo is somebody would say, `Hey, it's the home of
Elvis Presley,''' Cleveland said, sitting at his massive office
desk. ``Now, when you go places, they'll tell you Tupelo is the
furniture market. That's a pretty good feat, because he is a
well-known guy, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' birthplace, a prim, painted two-room white wooden shack
with a big black porch swing, still stands, at the center of a
small park and visitors' center at the end of a short road of
shacks. At 7:30 on a recent evening, a young family circled the
lawn and read the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, an Elvis-furniture cross-over. The
19-year-old Presley was employed for nine months by the Bozof
Company, based in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worked the night shift, making metal dinettes,'' said Albert
Bozof, the owner of the company, which is no longer in business.
``Ninety cents an hour. His mother said she didn't want him working
in a place like that.''
</P>
<P>
   From the swing on the Presleys' porch, the failing light and
gentling heat might have been the summer of 1935, the year Elvis
was born, for all that appears to have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Tupelo today is a city of 35,000. By Wednesday, Aug. 19, 22,000
people had registered to attend the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got some strangers on board! Tell them what to do, Rosie!''
yelled J.R. Pegues, a retired life insurance salesman, to the woman
standing at the back of the Lunch Bunch restaurant, behind the
steam table trays of fried catfish, creamed chicken casserole,
macaroni and cheese, and hush puppies. What to do was to pay four
and a half dollars and load your plate, empty it while you talk
Tupelo, Elvis and furniture, then make another trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You the fellow from New York? I heard about you,'' said Duane
Jones, a junior high school teacher and a shuttle-van driver
working between the highway hotels and the exhibition halls.
Southerners call this kind of surveillance hospitality. Tupelo is
named for a gum tree. Being there is like stepping in gum;
everywhere you go, you stick.
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls Tupelo a ``promotional furniture'' market.
Promotional is a point of price, not style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In upholstery, it would be $150 sofas, which would be a
wholesale price, which would be $299 retail, and up,'' said Harvey
Bailey, the sales manager of Style-Line Furniture, a Tupelo-based
manufacturer that produces roughly 65,000 units annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy come here yesterday who wanted a group for $100,''
said Matt Nicholson, a partner in Magnolia Furniture Industries, a
three-year-old company that employs 20 in Fulton, Miss. ``He didn't
care what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, a young man in a brown necktie and white shirt
sleeves, gestured to a trio of jumbo-size, Dumbo-shaped rolled-arm
furniture pieces grouped like a herd of baby elephants around a
watering hole: Magnolia's Market Special. ``Three-piece traditional
_ sofa, love seat, settee _ $299,'' he said. ``It's got a skirt on
it. A lot of people like that look right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is cheap. And that's why people come to Tupelo.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi is home ground for the regional ``independents''
from largely rural southern states who can't afford the costs of a
trip to North Carolina's lavish seven-million-square-foot October
market at High Point, the more expensive furniture on display or
the minimum orders required by the big companies exhibiting.
Chances are they have no customers at home for the high-end items
either.
</P>
<P>
   The ``majors'' or the aggressive, regional discount chains like
American Furniture, based in Denver, Colo., also shop Tupelo for
bargains at the bottoms of barrels that North Carolina doesn't
build anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This for me is like the garment center in New York used to
be,'' said Morton Seaman, upholstery shopping for Rooms to Go, a
Florida-based chain of 60 furniture stores that his family runs.
(They are the Seamans of the Seaman Furniture Co. in New York,
which the family sold in 1987.) ``High Point is just the fancy
show; this is where it's really done,'' Seaman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about the design leaders,'' said Lester
Craft, the editor in chief of Furniture Today, an industry
publication. ``This is the meat and potatoes, bread and butter,
middle market and mass market furniture we see here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Epperson, a furniture industry financial analyst at
Interstate Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C., said of the
professional wrestle for the industry title: ``North Carolina ships
more dollars. No question, Mississippi ships more units.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnolia Industries' Nicholson said: ``We're trying to upgrade,
every market, but you don't want to forget about the horse that
what done bring you _ is that what the old folks say?''
</P>
<P>
   Based on three days' observation, the horse is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Couples crowded the market. Older couples had grown children
with them _ the next generation of ownership for a store or small
chain of stores that has served its community as a furniture outlet
for generations. While wives chose the important sales features _
styles and fabrics _ husbands debated the number of units to order.
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in Mississippi, the upholstered furniture
industry is family _ buyers and sellers both. Bill Joiner, a former
Panola County deputy sheriff, started the Batesville Warehouse, a
furniture and gift store in Batesville, Miss., 14 years ago with
his wife, Linda, a former insurance company secretary, to put their
children through college. The Mississippi industry was started 50
years ago this month by one man, Morrie Futorian, a Chicago
upholsterer who was lured to Lee County, of which Tupelo is the
seat, with financial incentives by the Community Development
Foundation, an organization of local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Futorian arrived with an innovation: to build sofas and chairs
on an assembly line model like the automobile operations he had
seen in Detroit. He is known in Mississippi as the ``Henry Ford of
furniture.'' His company, the Stratford Company, continues in New
Albany. Futorian died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies today, including big players like Action
Industries, are ``cousins'' _ once or twice removed _ of Futorian's
factory, started by skilled line foremen or sales managers. At
Style-Line's 147,000-square-foot plant, where an assembly line can
push an upholstered piece through, from wood-frame assembly to
plastic shipping bag, in 15 minutes, the lesson is easy to see:
making a sofa is not rocket science. Style-Line was founded 32
years ago by Margie and Billy Anderson, who worked at Futorian's
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people at that point were operating out of their
garages at home, their chicken houses, whatever,'' Mrs. Anderson
recalled. ``We backed a truck up to our door and ran the furniture
right off the line into the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus was in town; it was just a question of putting up a
tent. V.M. Cleveland's original market in 1987 was a
14,000-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
   Today, behind him, on a wall of office bookshelves, is a set of
Elvis Presley figural canisters, a replica of the shack where Elvis
was born and a coffee mug with a reproduction of The Northeast
Mississippi Daily Journal's front page and the headline, ``The King
Is Dead,'' from the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal what he did, as a little old country boy,''
Cleveland said.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur appeared at home in the shadow of Tupelo's
favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my daddy,'' he said, pointing to a photograph of a man
in overalls and six children, hanging below a set of Elvis
Presley's first four Sun label singles. ``He was a fix-it guy, sort
of a shade-tree mechanic. As you can see, we were very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Cleveland moved to the big city _ Tupelo,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Bish, who was at Cleveland's market this year, said, ``We
like the night life here.'' Bish and his wife, Wendy, were shopping
for Lake Road Furniture, their store in Meadville, Pa. ``The only
thing I don't like is the $4.50 rum and Cokes,'' he said. ``Back
home, at our Days Inn, they're $2.70.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from a small town,'' he explained.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 8 a.m. in Seattle, and a commuter looks down at his watch.
The digital pager display tells him that there's been an accident
on his preferred route to work, so he considers an alternative.
What about taking a bus?
</P>
<P>
   To see if that's a good idea, he flips open his palmtop with
wireless modem and sees that the scheduled bus on his route is
running late. Maybe he'll drive after all.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the kinds of decisions being made in the Seattle area
by commuters in an $18 million federal Department of Transportation
pilot project that pits the latest Internet gadgetry against
traffic congestion. The service to alert wearers of Seiko pager
watches about traffic problems has been commercially available
since July 1, and the palmtop service has been available since May.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic problem, as any car commuter can testify, is a tough
one. Traffic has swelled 30 percent in the United States since
1989, according to the federal Department of Transportation, with
50 percent more cars expected on the road by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The department is betting that it can get people to their
destinations more quickly without building new roads if commuters
can use digital equipment to outsmart traffic snarls.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has appropriated $95 million per year through 2004 for
various projects involving what is called intelligent
transportation, like the pilot project in Seattle. Similar pilot
programs are under way in Phoenix and San Antonio, and one is
planned for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Like most software demos, the pilot projects and their Web sites
are Pollyannish and slick. Since the federal government is not
known for being on the cutting edge of technology, there may seem
to be something incongruous about a federal bureaucracy's
sponsoring a Web site that is so complex that it uses the most
advanced versions of Netscape Navigator, 4.06 or the beta version
of 4.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real cultural shift for us,'' said Toni Wilbur, who
administers the four pilot programs for the federal Highway
Administration in Washington. ``We're bridge engineers and pavement
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Wilbur said her mission was to
find practical solutions and prove that traffic software wasn't
``all Buck Rogers pie-in-the-sky stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many of the prototypes of Web pages offering traffic
information to Seattle commuters take advantage of simple devices
built into the highways 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle pilot project features Web sites that display
highway maps with real-time traffic speeds by tapping a data stream
from electronic strips, called loop detectors, under area roadways;
many of them were installed under Interstate 5, which runs through
the Seattle area, in the 1960s to monitor traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The kinds of intelligent traffic systems being studied would fit
in well with the kinds of on-board car computers envisioned by
Microsoft, a partner in the Seattle project, and some car
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Richards, one of the people testing the technology in
the Seattle project, said the Seiko wristwatch received traffic
information collected by the Washington State Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   And bus-tracking software by Fastline for palmtop computers gets
data from King County Metro Transit, which keeps track of Seattle
buses through a network of radio signals sent by each bus to small
receivers on traffic signs along every route. Now the Internet is
making it possible to distribute such information to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle project, dubbed Smart Trek
(www.smarttrek.org/html/projects.html), includes 29 separate
traffic, safety and transit initiatives. In addition to the
pager-wristwatch service and the bus-tracking software for palmtop
computers, a feature called Traffic View is offered by Microsoft at
seattle.sidewalk.com.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smart Trek projects also include Web sites with frequently
updated still shots from more than 200 strategically placed
closed-circuit highway cameras, a local cable television program
called ``Traffic Check'' and Metro bus station kiosks that post bus
arrival times on monitors like those in airports.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Trek has marquee partnerships with Microsoft, Boeing and
Metro Networks, a leading provider of television and radio traffic
reports.
</P>
<P>
   One of its powerful tools is a server designed by electrical
engineers at the University of Washington. Daniel Daily, a
professor of electrical engineering at the university, said he had
become interested in the traffic problem because he was intrigued
by the similarities between highway congestion and the turbulence
in the flow of boiling water in nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Daily knew that the traffic information would have value beyond
his academic pursuits. In partnership with Smart Trek, Daily built
the Intelligent Transportation System Backbone server in Seattle to
collect travel and transit data from the disparate and otherwise
incompatible systems at the state Department of Transportation,
King County Metro Transit and the Washington State Patrol and
organize it into a publicly available standard format.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: the roughly 3,000 loop detectors in the
Seattle area furnish a continuous stream of traffic speed and
congestion information to the State Department of Transportation,
which passes the data on to the Intelligent Transportation System
Backbone server at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the State Patrol may be tracking an accident that
corresponds to a slowdown reported in the traffic data.
</P>
<P>
   The Backbone makes the data from the different sources available
in a single format. A company like Metro Networks can get access to
the data and, in partnership with a digital map maker, Etak, can
offer complete and instantaneous online traffic information to
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies _ like another Smart Trek partner, the Cue Corp.,
a data broadcasting company _ can license that traffic information
and dispatch it to pagers, wristwatches or cars outfitted with an
Auto PC.
</P>
<P>
   By getting in on the ground floor of the Department of
Transportation's technology plans, companies can use the Seattle
project and the other pilot projects as laboratory settings for
developing products.
</P>
<P>
   Daily said he hoped that Smart Trek's distribution strategy
would become a model for intelligent transportation programs in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilbur, the federal Department of Transportation project
leader, said the program included safety projects as well. On July
21, city and state transportation officials began in San Antonio
the Trans Guide pilot program, which features fiber optic video
conferencing between hospital emergency rooms and ambulances in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The project in New York City, called iTravel, has yet to be
officially unveiled, but it will be a $10 million pilot project
covering traffic in the tristate metropolitan area. The project
will focus on trip planning and transit information services rather
than the wireless gadgets that are part of the projects in the
smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   Straphangers, accustomed to being monitored by surveillance
cameras on subway platforms, will no doubt welcome the day that
iTravel turns the tables to let passengers keep an eye on the
subway system.

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have avoided taking infants on airplanes ever since the mashed
peas incident of 1990. On a nonstop flight from Phoenix to New
York, my 11-month-old daughter smeared a handful into the hair of a
sleeping woman in the row ahead. The next three hours were as
suspenseful as any Hitchcock movie; what if the passenger woke?
</P>
<P>
   She slept. But next time I might not be so lucky. Plus, now
we're a family of five, counting the current infant. Air fare to
Arizona to visit my parents in December would cost roughly as much
as a cruise missile. For that kind of money, shouldn't we head to a
tropical resort instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``But you said you wanted to visit your relatives,'' said Diane
Bacigalupo, the assistant manager of Village Travel in Huntington,
N.Y., where I live. She looked up from a screen full of air fares
to see me biting my nails nervously.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I have some idiosyncrasies when it comes to travel.
Could any travel agent know enough about my quirks to create the
perfect itinerary?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I needed to be my own travel agent, a role the Internet
has made possible in recent months with a proliferation of online
sites where travelers can confirm room rates and air fares, book
reservations and read reviews of hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour later, I was at my home computer, ready to pit the
machine against the real-life travel agent. I would start small, by
comparing the cheapest round-trip air fare that Ms. Bacigalupo had
found _ $486 a person, including an $8 travel agent's commission _
to the rates on three Web sites. I logged onto Travelocity
 &UR; (www.travelocity.com) &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Microsoft's Expedia  &UR; (www.expedia. &LR; 
 &UR; com) &LR;   &UR;  &LR; and the Internet Travel Network  &UR; (www.itn.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It took less than five minutes for even a novice like me to
figure out how to compare dozens of possible itineraries by
entering the time and date of the trip, the number of people
traveling together and destinations. But other online features were
worrisome. For instance, Expedia was the only site where I could
specify that I would be traveling with an infant on my husband's
lap. At the other sites, my group was identified as four
passengers. I feared that this could lead to problems later; in the
past, reservations clerks have always wanted to know ahead of time
if an infant was accompanying me.
</P>
<P>
   The three sites rely on different computerized reservations
databases, but each quoted an identical low fare: $478. Such
details as airlines, connections and flight times differed
slightly, but not enough to matter. And I could shave off the $8
commission. But Ms. Bacigalupo had spent an hour listening to me
whine _ er, talk _ about my concerns. Guilt overtook me.
</P>
<P>
   Next, where to stay near my parents' house? None of the sites'
resort or hotel databases had information on the dude ranches that
Ms. Bacigalupo had pinpointed. With her leads, I conducted fruitful
keyword searches at  &UR; www.hotbot.com &LR;  and quickly found encyclopedic
listings at  &UR; www.duderanches.com  &LR; and  &UR; www.ranchweb.com &LR; . I sent
e-mail to the owner of the Kay El Bar Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But before I received a reply, Ms. Bacigalupo phoned: the Kay El
Bar was fully booked. Besides, she pointed out, these dude ranches
were pricey. Would my family get its money's worth? Now that she
mentioned it, I remembered Arizona as being too chilly and windy in
December for long rides in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   After wrestling with these questions for three days, I went on
line again _ and was shocked to learn that I could now fly the same
route on the same days for less money. This time, the three sites'
fares differed, ranging from $442 to $464. I phoned representatives
of the three Web sites to ask why prices were fluctuating. ``The
airlines make one million changes in their inventories every day,''
said Lois Shore, vice president of marketing at the Internet Travel
Network. ``There could be a drop in price, an increase, a change in
time, in routing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the different air fares? Although the sites' databases are
similar, my method of searching was slightly different at each. At
one, for instance, I rquested nonstop flights.
</P>
<P>
   That volatility in price might be a comfort to an unencumbered
solo traveler who could take advantage of last-minute deals. For
those free spirits, the Internet Travel Network has a low-fare
ticker that flashes tempting fares like ``San Francisco to Boston,
round trip $273.'' Just click on the ticker to book the flight.
</P>
<P>
   But I was getting so frustrated that I was ready to mash peas
into my own hair when the phone rang _ Ms. Bacigalupo again. ``Why
don't you fly to Phoenix, stay a night with your family, then fly
from there to the Baja Peninsula?'' she said. ``It's warm and costs
less than a dude ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, I came clean. ``I've been checking out some
online travel sites,'' I admitted. ``So I can also check out air
fares.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 minutes, we tested itineraries simultaneously.
The best fare she found was $1,141. But Expedia quoted $811. Even
odder, when I changed the parameters of my multiple-destination
search slightly to eliminate any mention of Phoenix on the return
trip, Expedia quoted $685 for an identical itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting that rate,'' Ms. Bacigalupo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should I do?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reserve it,'' she said. ``Quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Bacigalupo nor a spokeswoman for Expedia could
explain the disparity. ``It reminds me of a TV show a while back
where they went onto a plane and asked all the passengers how much
their tickets cost,'' said Suzi LeVine, a product manager for
Expedia. ``They were all different.''
</P>
<P>
   But by bypassing Ms. Bacigalupo, who had helped me so much, I
felt as if I had cheated her out of the $32 commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a moral dilemma,'' Ms. LeVine observed.
</P>
<P>
   If so, we are all going to lose in this particular battle of
computers vs. humans. No, I will pay Ms. Bacigalupo the commission
anyway. Technically, the machine won this contest; no wonder Ms.
Bacigalupo said she worried that the Internet's ability to blithely
reshape industries overnight would transform real-life agents into
``dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not. Without help from both quarters, I would have
stayed home.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Monica Tantlinger can see the future. She even
has a computer printout of it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monica got her braces 18 months ago, her orthodontist,
Dr. Michael Theurer, gave her a glimpse of a straighter tomorrow.
He used a new computer-imaging device to show her what her teeth
and jaw would look like after the treatment was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really cool,'' Monica said. ``I was afraid of getting
braces at first, but once I saw what my teeth would look like, I
said, `Let's do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her top braces are off, and she is happy with the results. The
bottom braces will come off soon.
</P>
<P>
   Computer imaging came on the scene for orthodontists and oral
surgeons more than a decade ago, but as the technology has improved
and prices have dropped, more dentists have adopted equipment that
lets patients envision the future.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 8,700 orthodontists practicing in the United States
and Canada, 15 percent to 20 percent have some type of computer
imaging equipment, said Pam Paladin, a spokeswoman for the American
Association of Orthodontists in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the patient has to be aware that nothing is certain.
``This is a potential after look,'' Mrs. Paladin said. ``This is a
representation of how one might look, not a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest technology in dental imaging equipment, made by
companies like Dolphin Imaging and Quick Ceph Systems, both in
California, actually ``morphs'' the picture of the patient's face
to show how braces or surgery will change the jaw, cheekbones and
teeth. A patient is photographed with a digital camera, views the
probable change in appearance on a computer screen and takes home a
printout.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment is becoming so popular that Dolphin Imaging, which
has about 600 clients, has seen a 30 percent to 40 percent increase
in sales of software, computers and service each year for the past
three years, said Chester Wang, director of the company. And Quick
Ceph Systems has sold imaging equipment to about 2,200 practices
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Appel Orthodontix, based in Houston, which manages 130 practices
in 20 states and Canada, has imaging and morphing systems in 10
offices now, but it will have the equipment in 50 offices by the
end of the year and in 90 percent within 12 months, said Dr. John
Vondrak, Appel's chief executive and a former orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average person is highly influenced by high technology,''
said Vondrak, whose company markets to middle-level consumers by
offering payment plans for treatment. ``A picture is worth 1,000
words. And when you show someone what they will look like, you
don't have to sell it. It is the selling of what is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the morphing feature was available, orthodontists used
slower computer systems. They spent up to an hour circling teeth on
a computer screen, then moving them by cutting and pasting. They
would have to call the patient back for another appointment to see
the results.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph M. Pelle, who practices in Denton, Texas, said he
would often spend 45 minutes drawing a patient by hand to show the
expected changes. Now he can make the changes by clicking and
dragging on the image of the patient's face with the Dolphin
Imaging system. Going from a digital photograph to a morphed face
takes about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer changes everything,'' said Theurer, who practices
in Lancaster, Calif., and also has a Dolphin Imaging system. ``I
just put a square around the front teeth and click, and it
straightens the front teeth. You can show the patient how they will
look in silver, gold, clear or colors on their braces. Most of them
sit with their mouth open, just amazed, and say, `That's me, that's
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert H. Kazmierski, in Moorestown, N.J., takes eight
digital photographs of every patient and puts them on the screen.
Patients can see their faces with and without smiles. They can see
the morphed versions of their new looks and leave with color
printouts.
</P>
<P>
   While the prices for imaging systems have decreased, they are by
no means cheap. A total package of equipment would have cost about
$40,000 in the early 1990s; that would cost less than $15,000 now,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   Vondrak said the systems paid off for orthodontists. In his
offices, he said, 40 out of 100 new patients will sign on for
treatment without the computer imaging, while 75 percent to 80
percent sign up after seeing the imaging.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, of course, have to exercise normal caution about
signing up for expensive orthodontic treatments and need to
remember that the computer images are just that: images.
</P>
<P>
   And some orthodontists urge caution for their colleagues as
well. Pelle, who has used the Dolphin Imaging equipment for the
past month, said: ``You have to be careful how you use it. You have
to be careful about what you can do and what you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   People who want free computer-generated pictures of what they
might look like after orthodontic treatment can send color
photographs to Smiles, American Association of Orthodontists, 401
North Lindbergh Boulevard, St. Louis, Mo. 63141-7816.
</P>
<P>
   Each photograph must be a clear, close-up shot showing the front
of the face with a wide smile. Include your name, address and
telephone number. When the image shows up, it will carry a
disclaimer on the back that says, ``This photograph is an
approximation and is not intended to guarantee identical results.''

<P>
   If the World Wide Web ever adopted a theme song, it could do
worse than picking ``I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.''
Searching the Web is the most popular online activity _ and often
the most frustrating. In June, more than half of the top 10
most-visited domains were Web search sites, according to an
Internet metering service, Media Metrix. But how many of the people
visiting those sites found what they were looking for right away?
</P>
<P>
   Not most, according to Karin Rex, whose Pennsylvania-based
company Computer Ease conducts Internet search classes. ``Most
people type in words and get a bazillion hits,'' Ms. Rex said.
``Some of the ones on the first page may pertain to what they're
looking for, but most of them won't.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it ought to be simple. You're looking for
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, you enter those three words, and
assuming it's somewhere on the Internet (and that's a pretty safe
assumption), the search site gives you a list of relevant Web
pages. Right? Not so, Ms. Rex said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll get sites about the Lincoln Continental and vacations
in Gettysburg, and real-estate sites listing addresses. But often,
nothing about Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Sullivan, editor of the Search Engine Watch newsletter,
agrees. His publication and Web site  &UR; (www.searchenginewatch.com) &LR; 
are devoted to monitoring the world of Web searching, and despite
the improvements he has been tracking for the past two years, he
still sees problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten better, faster and easier to use, but search
engines have got a long way to go,'' Sullivan said. ``They're poor
for people who are doing really basic searches. Enter `Disney' or
`travel,' and it's a crapshoot whether they'll get the Disney site
or any good travel sites.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, search sites are unpredictable. One search site could
provide 10 top results of pure gold, while another serves up either
nothing or dross. Why is there a difference in results? Because
there are three basic components of all search engines, and while
there is often a lot of overlap, no two engines are exactly the
same. One element is the index of Web sites or Web pages that your
search roots through; each search site collects its information and
updates its database differently. Each site's search function works
differently, too, and the order in which the results are sorted is
usually based on a proprietary algorithm that no company would be
willing to share.
</P>
<P>
   To make things harder on their visitors, search sites generally
do not do a good job of explaining how they work. Few people
understand, for example, that Yahoo is fundamentally different from
search sites like Hotbot, Alta Vista and Infoseek. Yahoo
 &UR; (www.yahoo.com) &LR;  is not really a search engine but rather a Web
directory, compiled by humans who classify Web sites under headings
and assign descriptive words to them. The others are Web search
engines, which use software agents called crawlers or spiders to
index the contents of individual Web pages, then follow links to
other pages and crawl across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Web directories like Yahoo and Web search engines may look the
same on the surface, but each type of site is good for finding
different types of information. And the first step in creating more
effective searches is picking the right search site for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are doing a general search,'' Sullivan said, ``they
should start off at Yahoo or a Yahoo-like directory like Snap or
Look Smart.'' A directory-style search provides two ways to
research broad topics: dive down through a list of broad topics by
clicking on the appropriate links, or fill out a search box to find
listings.
</P>
<P>
   But directory searches are less effective when looking for
specific information _ things like the author of a book, the
complete text of the Declaration of Independence, or research on
drug treatments for a medical condition. For this kind of
information, search engines like Hotbot and Alta Vista are the way
to go. Because they search an index of keywords drawn by spider
software from millions of Web pages, the chances are greater that
they will find obscure terms tucked away in obscure Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   There's a third kind of search site, one that includes popular
sites like Metacrawler, Ask Jeeves and Dogpile. These sites _ which
go by the intensely techy name of metasearch tools _ don't maintain
any kind of index of their own but instead issue search requests to
whole fistfuls of other Web search sites. When Yahoo, Hotbot, Alta
Vista and the like return their results, the metasearch site
collects them onto a single Web page for display.
</P>
<P>
   Because no two search sites index exactly the same set of Web
pages, metasearch tools give you a wider scope of results _ but
it's worth remembering that more does not necessarily equal better.
What really counts is relevant results that are sorted in a
relevant order. And that's the rub.
</P>
<P>
   Simply picking one of two or three types of sites to search from
is no guarantee of good results. According to Brad Hill, the author
of ``World Wide Web Searching for Dummies'' (IDG most search sites
deliver too much information. ``Search engines do a good job on
indexing,'' he said. But because of that, they deliver more than
you really want.
</P>
<P>
   So when you're faced with several hundred thousand results over
dozens of pages, what should you do? ``Don't go past the first page
of results,'' Hill said. ``If it doesn't have something of
interest, you've probably entered the wrong search string.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people could get much more relevant results with a few
simple tricks for constructing a search ``string'' _ the words you
enter in the search box. The most obvious is to type in several
relevant words instead of just one or two. In general, the fewer
words you enter, the more general your results will be.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But not every search engine returns the most relevant results
first _ which leads to lots of pages about Lincoln Continentals
instead of Lincoln's most famous speech. To give a search engine
more instructions, it helps to master a site's instructions, which
search techies call ``operators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Search operators tell a search engine how to interpret your
key words,'' Hill said. ``Words like `and' or `not,' and quotation
marks can really narrow down search results.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's narrowing the results _ giving fewer, better pages _
that really counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest techniques, like using quotes around a phrase,
help the most people,'' Ms. Rex said. The result of slapping a
couple of quotation marks around two or more words is remarkable.
Type in ``Gettysburg Address,'' with quotation marks, and you tell
the search engine to look for a phrase instead of two separate
words _ knocking irrelevant vacation sites and real-estate listings
out of your top 20 results. And this trick works in many search
sites _ including Yahoo, Alta Vista, Hotbot, Excite and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Not all search sites use the same rules for making better
searches. Most will let you exclude some terms from your results _
which is great if you're trying to search for, say, the gross
national product of Jordan and keep getting sports sites about
Michael Jordan. Exclude the word Michael, and you'll trim a few
hundred thousand irrelevant results right away.
</P>
<P>
   But how you exclude words from a search depends on the search
site. In the regular search forms at Yahoo, Excite and Alta Vista,
for example, you put a minus sign before the word (-Michael). But
in Hotbot, you click on the More Search Options button and select
Must Not Contain in the Word Filter section.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly surprising that many people find Web searching a
confusing and inefficient process. So how are you supposed to know
which rules apply to which search site? Karin Rex includes a simple
piece of advice in lesson one of her Internet search class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read the instructions,'' she says. ``The only way to learn the
inner workings of each site is to read the help files or frequently
asked questions document. Most people don't even realize there are
help files, so they'll never be able to take advantage of advanced
features.''
</P>
<P>
   Sage advice though this is, search sites tend to use jargon
that's not easily understood by the uninitiated. A single mention
of Boolean operators is enough to send many would-be searchers into
a tailspin. (Named for a 19th-century British mathematician, George
Boole, Boolean operators are words like AND, OR and NOT that many
advanced search sites use to make searches more precise.) But in
truth, Boolean logic is not hard to learn _ and in many cases,
search sites label it with easy-to-understand phrasing like
``search for ANY of these terms'' or ``search for these terms as a
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   There are options for sufferers of Boolean anxiety, though. One
site with a novel approach is Ask Jeeves  &UR; (www.askjeeves.com) &LR; .
When you enter a vague query, AskJeeves will throw back a series of
questions. From the single-word query ``travel,'' for example, Ask
Jeeves comes back with 10 possible interpretations of what you
might be looking for, including ``Where can I rent a cellular phone
in a foreign country?'' and ``Where can I get tourist information
about foreign countries?''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to reduce the scope of your search.
Searching the entire Web for a highly specialized piece of
information isn't always the best way. For one thing, many Web
search engines index only Web pages in HTML format, and many Web
pages are generated from databases that search engine spiders can't
penetrate. To uncover information from these databases, you usually
need to use the search engine provided at the database's Web site.
There are literally thousands of these highly specialized Web
search tools across the Web.
</P>
<P>
   So how can you find these specialized search tools? About 3,000
of them are listed at Internet Sleuth  &UR; (www.isleuth.com) &LR;  in
Yahoo-style directories. But unlike Yahoo's directories, Internet
Sleuth's contain only searchable sites and contain the search form
to issue a query right away.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what advice you get, however, you discover the best
search techniques by experimenting. Danny Sullivan of Search Engine
Watch uses all the major search sites frequently, and refuses to
name his favorite site. His reason?
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging the results is subjective,'' Sullivan said. ``If your
friend raves about a site and you don't like it, try another. Use
whatever you find gives you the answers.''

CALLING ON TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD A BETTER HANDCUFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: W.Va., Calif.)   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many police officers will admit, there's no such thing as a
pick-proof handcuff. The engineers and law enforcement officials
who work at developing one are simply outnumbered by the convicts
who spend many hours a day figuring out how to outwit their
restraints.
</P>
<P>
   But now the computer is being put to use to figure out a way to
build a better handcuff and improve upon the ones in use now, which
were basically patented in 1915 and not modified significantly ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Worthey, an engineer at the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, has programmed a device to measure force and torque
levels on individual parts of handcuffs under stress.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has contracted with Touchstone Research
Laboratory of Triadelphia, W.Va. to use the device and software to
find the weakest parts of various handcuffs and recommend possible
improvements to the national standards governing handcuff
production.
</P>
<P>
   The need for such improvements in the current models appears to
be great, especially for police transporting prisoners. In Los
Angeles for example, the trip from jail to court hearings can be up
to 80 miles each way and take several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,000 prisoners moved every day, at least one will likely
get free himself while on the bus, said Dennis Kennedy, a deputy
with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. With only two
officers _ one of them a driver _ per busload of 30 to 50, the
results can be frightening: fights with other inmates, attacks on
officers, and escapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give someone one to three hours to figure how to
violate something, they'll do it,'' Kennedy said. ``They stay up at
night trying to do this. They spend more time at it than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners have figured out ways to use the large staples from
food boxes and other bits of metal to pick the common handcuff, he
said, and they are often able to pry apart the ratchet apparatus of
their cuffs, using the cuffs of nearby prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Worthey wrote software to enable a device called a force torque
transducer to measure the forces necessary both to unlock and to
break handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rare for people to have equipment to record torque, and
it was certainly rare to measure the combination of force and
torque,'' he said. ``We want to find out how strong can it be made,
and are there weak ones out there. We wanted to raise the level of
the engineering discussion, and see what can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Touchstone's report is expected in about six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make little improvements in the formal standard, but
hopefully not make it longer,'' Worthey said, noting that it costs
manufacturers about $50,000 to comply with each new sentence added
to the official National Institute of Justice standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handcuff does a lot with a small number of moving parts.
It doesn't weigh a lot, and police are not ready to give up the
common handcuff and go to something vastly more expensive,''
Worthey said.

TWO JOBS, ONE LOVE: THE SAXOPHONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Guadarrama would love to stay _ really, he would.
</P>
<P>
   But he can't.
</P>
<P>
   This is the common thread that connects every time I've seen
Guadarrama playing saxophone, whether he was with the Fort Worth
Guitar Army at Billy Bob's last November or Latin Express at the
J&AMP;J Blues Bar a couple of weeks ago: He shows up, plays some great
sax, and then is gone into the night, back to his 9-to-5 gig, which
in his case is a midnight-to-noon gig, fixing laser printers for
Xerox, as he has for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere in his travels, you've seen him, whether you
realize it or not.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy up there on the bandstand in bars and ballrooms
with Latin Express or Eddie Miller &AMP; the Heavy Hitters, or doing
the lucrative circuit of country clubs, private parties and wedding
receptions with the RayBans (who know stuff by everyone from Wilson
Pickett to Elton John to Merle Haggard). Or maybe sitting in with
blues band Count Blue or jazzer Johnny Case.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy you used to see in the Cajun band Acadiana, and in
the avant-garde jazz group Picasso's Nightmare in the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy with the trim mustache, carrying himself with quiet
confidence and class and digging into a superb solo that can make
even an oldie like ``Respect'' or ``Oye Como Va'' sound brand-new
and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who, at 40, keeps going on an endless round of
shows and long nights at work, because he loves the music first and
the money second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pager will go off on the bandstand,'' he says over lunch.
He's just finished a shift, and been up since at least yesterday
evening, but he still looks and sounds fresh and alert. (I'd be
passed out, face-first in the appetizer.) ``But it's manageable if
you plan ahead. I've motivated myself to do this; I had a vision of
being versatile enough to play with different bands and do
different styles of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it and I love music; I like to keep my foot in the
environment of music, and that's why it's worth it to me. Right now
my priority band is the RayBans, and Latin Express keeps me in
touch with traditional music and the culture and everything else _
my roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Guadarrama's roots are in a family of musicians led by father
Frank, who played piano and saxophone. All the boys in the family
(Johnny is the youngest of five) were horn players; he was
seriously into the music by age 10, playing ``rancheras'' with his
dad's band and then listening hard to records by John Coltrane,
Dexter Gordon and Cannonball Adderly.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to appreciate music, and the freedom of expression it
gave him. He learned to read charts and to improvise, which is
something he says more players should train themselves to do. He
learned to appreciate the humor of Latin Express leader Leo Saenz,
with whom he has been playing for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   And he learned that making music is its own reward, that it can
be a lifetime love affair as real as the kind two people share _ if
you nurture it and respect it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's not hard, he says _ and exhausting at times.
Because it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have one of those back-to-back weekends, it can seem
endless,'' he says. ``I'll look at my wife and say, `Don't you wish
our life was normal?' And Christine will say, `Your life has never
been normal.' And it's true; it's always been hectic. We get
through it. My music is part of me; and my wife understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, he says, the payoff is so much larger than the
hardships. The money is good _ ``I make sure when I play it's worth
my while,'' he says. But Johnny Guadarrama knows he may well never
get rich, and he may never get beyond the bars and the wedding
receptions, because few do, no matter how talented.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't seem to care _ or, at the very least, to let it
bother him. He loves his work _ and anyone who spends much time at
all listening to music in Fort Worth is the better for it. I know I
am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love music more now,'' he says. ``Musicians are always
learning, but when the fundamentals are mastered, then you can
concentrate on the spiritual and the emotion it takes to make the
music even more beautiful and really express yourself. You can
really focus on the heart. I don't know what I'd do without my
music _ I really don't.''

   CALIFORNIA -- ADS. Two congressional Democrats representing
Orange County are getting a boost from the largest advertising
blitz ever launched by an environmental group. (Working.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   CONNECTICUT -- LIEBERMAN. Despite speculation that he would call
for censure of the president over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman said today that any calls for legislative action
are premature. He said he will give a statement later in the week
about his thoughts on the Lewinsky matter. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   -- SIERRA. The Sierra Club has begun broadcasting issue ads in
support of Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson. (Working.) Maggi
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA -- MILLER. U.S. Rep. Dan Miller Wednesday called on
President Clinton to consider resigning in the wake of his public
admission that he lied to the nation about his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. Williams
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS -- BRIEFS. Column for Sunday. (Working.) Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA -- ROADS. A $2.1 million federal grant for an
experimental road warning system could soon make its debut in
Indiana cars, making driving safer for thousands of Hoosiers.
(Working.) Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   MAINE -- WASTE. The Senate gives final approval to the plan to
ship Maine's nuclear waste from private reactors such as the
defunct Maine Yankee to a site in west Texas, sending the bill on
to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it. Kane
</P>
<P>
   NEW MEXICO -- DONORS. Roughly 70 New Mexico residents doled out
their own money to help President Clinton and the first lady defend
themselves against charges related to alleged White House scandals.
Gorman
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- DEBT. More and more Americans, and Ohioans, are going
bankrupt. On Friday, the Senate is expected to take a step toward
making it harder to erase debt. But the details of the bill and how
it was influenced remain unclear. Story includes positions of
Ohio's congressional delegation. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   -- DEWINE-YOUTH-CRIME. (Re-sent.) How can communities best stem
the rising wave of juvenile crime? The Senate Subcommittee on Youth
Violence -- which includes Ohio Republican Mike DeWine -- held a
hearing Tuesday titled ``Fixing a Broken System: Preventing Crime
Through Intervention.'' Hamilton County Judge David Grossmann
testified. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   -- FEDERAL-FUNDS. (Possible.) Ohio received 93 cents for every
tax dollar sent to Washington in 1997, which is one of the lowest
levels in the last 10 years, according to a report released Tuesday
by the Northeast-Midwest Institute. The state ranks 41st among the
states in per-capita federal spending. Will include county-specific
numbers. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- TURNOUT-DEMS. (Thursday morning, for the WEEKEND.) Political
analysts say that what was originally going to be a challenging
year for Ohio Democrats may turn into a downright electoral
disaster. The key will be turnout, and analysts say the combination
of President Clinton's problems, the inability of Dem Sen. John
Glenn to campaign, and a strong Republican ticket could keep Ohio
Democrats home on Nov. 3. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- CONST. More high school students can correctly
identify the names of the Three Stooges than can properly name the
three branches of the federal government. Armed with similarly
damning statistics about Americans' knowledge of the U.S.
Constitution, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell told a Senate panel
that $20 million of federal money would be well spent on the
public-private effort to build a National Constitution Center on
Independence Mall. Kane
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- NUCLEAR WASTE. Texas senators joined the majority of
their colleagues Wednesday to give their final stamp of approval to
legislation establishing a low-level nuclear waste site in Sierra
Blanca. Brown
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- GOV. Two years ago, with tuxedoed waiters
catering and a steel band entertaining, about 100 people welcomed
the opening of a new Virgin Islands governor's Washington office
with great fanfare. Today, the front door to the office is
sometimes locked during business hours, while telephone calls
frequently go unreturned. Williams
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- SENSENBRENNER. He's the most senior member of the
Wisconsin delegation and has not faced major opposition in an
election since 1978. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairs the
Science Committee and will play a pivotal role in the upcoming
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, as a member of the
Judiciary Committee. (working) Marlin

ROAD TO RECOVERY IS PAVED WITH LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinco. Five. It took five tries, and every ounce of courage I
had, to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Five times, I grabbed my husband's arm and sank my nails deep
into his flesh. Five times, I bit my lip to muffle my agonized
screams, because my children were watching. I could feel the
stitches in my shoulder straining to hold my severed flesh
together. What held the rest of me together, I do not know.
</P>
<P>
   The pain made the Demerol evaporate like sweat on a sidewalk in
hell. On the final attempt, I did it. I managed to sit up in the
hospital bed so that I could dress and go home. It was ``day
surgery'' after all, and there was no room at the inn for the likes
of me. A mere five hours after surgery to repair the rotator cuff
in my right shoulder, I was dismissed with a warning not to drive.
I would have laughed, but it hurt to move.
</P>
<P>
   Every four hours, my husband gave me two pain pills. For three
days, I lay flat on my back and tried to avoid going to the
bathroom. To go to the bathroom, I had to sit up. That action
required using the back and shoulder muscles _ bring on the pain!
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost two weeks, and I can barely raise my right arm
enough to put on deodorant. From the shoulder to the elbow, I have
minimal strength. I'm worryied about my family and my job. I wonder
if I'll ever be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a humbling experience being totally dependent on other
people, isn't it? My mother has fed me soup and wiped my mouth. My
sister combs my hair every day. My father runs errands for me. And
my husband, well, he does everything else. I do as much as I can
for myself, but I'm right-handed, and it was my right shoulder that
was sliced up.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, along with my family, my friends have
demonstrated their love for me in such a magnificent way that even
on my worst days, I can only manage a baby-blue mood. I didn't
expect all of the flowers and cards. And I certainly never imagined
that kind neighbors would bring my family dinner almost every day.
We're eating better now than we did before the surgery. I'm
thinking about getting this bunion removed now.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I start fretting about the future, the phone rings,
and it's someone calling to wish me a speedy recovery and remind me
to take advantage of this time to relax. I've learned a lot about
how to be a true friend during this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're like I was before this happened, and you take
yourself for granted. You have no idea what a difference you can
make to someone who is injured, or ill, or just lonely. Will you do
me a favor? Give that someone a call and share your love. Come on.
Do it now, you've got the time. If I can type this column with one
hand, you can share a word of encouragement. Really, it means so
much. That simple gesture can turn a darkest hour into a shining
moment. Believe me, I know.
</P>
<P>
   Share some love today. It doesn't cost you anything. And that's
good news.

   CHINA-HOME-BUYERS (Shanghai) _ There seems to be no end to the
number of people eager to buy homes in China's cities, where a
massive conversion of housing from public to private hands means a
revolution in Chinese living standards. This year, millions of
urban families in China are buying homes for the first time. After
years of talking about it, Chinese authorities are finally getting
serious about supporting home ownership, by making mortgages
available in some cases, and by ordering local governments to do
away with state-allocated housing that has been a mainstay of the
Socialist system here. By Seth Faison.

   TUPELO-UPHOLSTERY (Tupelo, Miss.) _ The Burlington Northern

not feel like you're at the center of anything, except a train
whistle. But, if you're counting quantity, not quality of sofas,
loveseats and recliners _ is the upholstered furniture capital of
the world. There are over 230 furniture manufacturers within a

liners are viewed from the air. Still, swimming pools endure,

its 17 acres. Most New York City wetlands are brackish salt

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most do-it-yourselfers are willing to tackle furniture
restoration projects because refinishing products are readily
available and the skills needed are easy to learn. They are are
less likely to work on metal objects, like vases, plates or lamps,
because they assume that only experienced artisans can restore
metalware.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there can be difficulties in working with cast iron or
hard steel. But fortunately for the do-it-yourselfer, many
beautiful objects are made of soft metals like brass, copper,
aluminum, pewter, tin.
</P>
<P>
   Removing dents from soft metal is not difficult. The only tools
required are a hammer or mallet and an anvil. Metal smiths use a
hammer with a smooth polished face called a planishing hammer to
tamp metal, but you can use a lightweight (eight ounce) ballpeen
hammer or a wooden mallet. Use these to tap dents in flat pieces
like plates or trays.
</P>
<P>
   For working curved surfaces in vases, kettles or buckets, you
will need a special tool called a bossing mallet. The bossing
mallet has an egg-shaped head made of hard wood. Use it to reshape
curved metal surfaces. Bossing mallets are available through
mail-order suppliers that stock metal-working tools.
</P>
<P>
   The anvil is simply a hardwood surface that supports the piece
as you hammer it. If you are straightening a flat piece, the anvil
can be a plank of hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   For curved surfaces, you will have to shape a hardwood block to
match the contours of the metal piece. To reshape a metal bowl, for
example, you would need to hollow out a wooden block to the shape
of the bowl. Sometimes it takes more time to fashion the anvil than
it does to work the actual metal piece, but if the anvil is not
precise, the piece will be distorted.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioning anvils can be a lot of work, but fortunately there is
another alternative. Many metalsmiths support their work on
sandbag. These bags are made of leather and stuffed with sand. You
can make one by sewing a pouch of heavy cloth, like denim or
canvas, and filling it with sand. Press the work into the sandbag
and gently hammer out the dent. Work carefully because with the
sandbag it is possible to hammer too hard and ''out dent'' the
work.
</P>
<P>
   When the dents are removed, you can proceed to polish the piece.
Start by cleaning off all grease and dirt with a stiff-bristled
brush dipped in kerosene (kerosene is flammable so work outdoors if
possible). If there are any traces of corrosion, remove them with
crocus paper (a paper coated with jewelers rouge).
</P>
<P>
   Most metal surfaces look dull because they are covered with a
network of very fine scratches. Polishing consists of rubbing the
metal surface with fine abrasives until all the scratches are
removed. First, remove any deep scratches with fine emery cloth or
by rubbing them with a paste made of pumice powder and water.
</P>
<P>
   You can polish most metals with commercial liquids, but you get
better results _ a high polish without streaks _ by using a
polishing motor and a buffing wheel. The most useful are cloth
wheels, which are made by sewing pieces of circular cloth (muslin,
cotton or soft wool) together. Mount the wheel onto the motor with
a small screw-on clamp called an arbor.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have a polishing motor, you can chuck the
polishing wheel into a portable electric drill. Set the drill to
its highest speed (for variable speed drills) and mount it on a
stand; this will keep the drill stationary so you can hold the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Charge the wheel with polishing rouge. Rouge is mixture of red,
iron-oxide powder and hard grease that is molded into a stick.
Press the stick lightly against the revolving wheel until cloth
picks up the abrasive. Hold the work against the wheel, a little
below center, keeping it in constant motion, until the surface
acquires a bright luster.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the metal is likely to oxidize and you will have to
polish it again. To prevent this, you can apply a coat of lacquer.
The lacquer will dull the brilliance slightly and it may affect the
color of the metal, but it will coat the metal surface so it does
not tarnish. An easy way to apply an even coat of lacquer is by
spraying the piece with artist's spray fixative (one brand is
Krylon Crystal Clear).

ROAD TO RECOVERY IS PAVED WITH LOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinco. Five. It took five tries, and every ounce of courage I
had, to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Five times, I grabbed my husband's arm and sank my nails deep
into his flesh. Five times, I bit my lip to muffle my agonized
screams, because my children were watching. I could feel the
stitches in my shoulder straining to hold my severed flesh
together. What held the rest of me together, I do not know.
</P>
<P>
   The pain made the Demerol evaporate like sweat on a sidewalk in
hell. On the final attempt, I did it. I managed to sit up in the
hospital bed so that I could dress and go home. It was ``day
surgery'' after all, and there was no room at the inn for the likes
of me. A mere five hours after surgery to repair the rotator cuff
in my right shoulder, I was dismissed with a warning not to drive.
I would have laughed, but it hurt to move.
</P>
<P>
   Every four hours, my husband gave me two pain pills. For three
days, I lay flat on my back and tried to avoid going to the
bathroom. To go to the bathroom, I had to sit up. That action
required using the back and shoulder muscles _ bring on the pain!
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost two weeks, and I can barely raise my right arm
enough to put on deodorant. From the shoulder to the elbow, I have
minimal strength. I'm worryied about my family and my job. I wonder
if I'll ever be the same again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a humbling experience being totally dependent on other
people, isn't it? My mother has fed me soup and wiped my mouth. My
sister combs my hair every day. My father runs errands for me. And
my husband, well, he does everything else. I do as much as I can
for myself, but I'm right-handed, and it was my right shoulder that
was sliced up.
</P>
<P>
   I guess that's the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that, along with my family, my friends have
demonstrated their love for me in such a magnificent way that even
on my worst days, I can only manage a baby-blue mood. I didn't
expect all of the flowers and cards. And I certainly never imagined
that kind neighbors would bring my family dinner almost every day.
We're eating better now than we did before the surgery. I'm
thinking about getting this bunion removed now.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I start fretting about the future, the phone rings,
and it's someone calling to wish me a speedy recovery and remind me
to take advantage of this time to relax. I've learned a lot about
how to be a true friend during this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're like I was before this happened, and you take
yourself for granted. You have no idea what a difference you can
make to someone who is injured, or ill, or just lonely. Will you do
me a favor? Give that someone a call and share your love. Come on.
Do it now, you've got the time. If I can type this column with one
hand, you can share a word of encouragement. Really, it means so
much. That simple gesture can turn a darkest hour into a shining
moment. Believe me, I know.
</P>
<P>
   Share some love today. It doesn't cost you anything. And that's
good news.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Generations of Hollyhocks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. By continually purchasing lots of seeds _ 10 to 15 packs a
year _ and asking for seed of any unusual color I see in other
gardens, I have finally established a group of hollyhocks in a wide
selection of colors: peach, light and dark pinks and reds, and a
maroon that's almost black. Most are singles, but a few doubles
have accidentally been introduced. Will the colors stay true or
eventually blend because of cross-pollination? And are the doubles
likely to dominate the singles?
</P>
<P>
   A. The tall, single forms of Alcea (or Althaea) rosea, commonly
called old-fashioned hollyhocks, are classed as biennials, plants
that bloom and then die the year after they are sown. They
sometimes hang on for three or four years and may occasionally be
propagated by division. But most gardeners assure themselves of an
ongoing supply by letting the plants self-sow, and it sounds as
though you would like to do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds from mixed plantings will not necessarily mimic their
parents. For instance, a pink flower might end up giving you seeds
for red-flowered plants. And the red plant's seeds might give you
pinks or maroons (or both). Similarly, doubles will cross with the
singles, giving you doubles, singles and semi-doubles as well.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the crossings will produce a range of colors and
numbers of petals, so as long as you have a good-size patch, you
should be able to keep a wide mixture by letting nature take its
course. Mixed hollyhocks have been grown in home gardens this way
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Not all strains are equally stable, however, so it pays to be
vigilant. If you notice a particular color or petal style starting
to take over, chances are its genes are dominant. Remove the
dominant types as soon as you see the flowers, or the recessive
colors and forms will eventually be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to improve your chances of a stable mix by
getting seeds from one of the members of the Flower and Herb
Exchange, a project of the nonprofit Seed Savers Exchange, in
Decorah, Iowa. The exchange's 1998 yearbook, which functions as a
catalog, lists mixed-color hollyhocks from 20 different home
gardens in almost as many states, and many of them are described as
having persisted for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the Flower and Herb Exchange is $10; the address:
3076 North Winn Rd., Decorah 52101; (319) 382-5990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Moving Plants &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When we left our Connecticut garden, we took a fair number of
divisions of perennials. Our new house in Delaware is supposed to
be completed in early September, but I am not optimistic. What is
the latest date you would recommend planting the divisions in the
new garden? Is there a point after which it would be better for
them to overwinter in their pots in the garage?
</P>
<P>
   And if the plants are pot-bound, would it be advisable for us to
divide before transplanting? My wife is concerned that the
divisions might be too small to be viable, whereas I would like to
get as large a planting as possible. The plants we have include
hostas, cranesbill, cornflowers, rudbeckia, campanula and
coreopsis.  &QL; 
A. The garden stalwarts on your list should survive nicely as long
as they have six weeks or so for the roots to settle in before the
ground freezes for the winter. Weather prediction is always tricky,
but let's say this means you have until mid-October to plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you notice Halloween sneaking up _ and we are, after all,
talking about house construction _ the keys to wintering over in
pots are allowing the plants to go dormant before stashing them
away, and stashing them in a place where they will stay dormant but
not frozen (32 to 45 degrees, and the less light the better).
</P>
<P>
   Don't divide the plants until spring unless it's absolutely
essential. Even if by some miracle your house is actually ready on
time, the plants should be heading toward dormancy, not being
forced to grow lots of new roots. Division is healthy in the long
run, but it does temporarily weaken plants and is best done when
they will have plenty of time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sunflowers' Toxins &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Please explain how to manage sunflowers in a garden or bed
with other plants, both while they are growing and in subsequent
years after they have grown. What can be done to prevent and
counteract any toxins they may produce?
</P>
<P>
   A. Studies conducted by the United States Department of
Agriculture have proven that sunflowers do secrete substances that
can suppress the germination and growth of other plants, but
fortunately these substances are weakest in the annual sunflowers
most commonly grown. Plants as close as a foot away show no signs
of failing to thrive, and the allelopathic (growth-inhibiting)
effect will not persist in the soil if you remove the sunflower
plants _ roots, seed hulls and all _ after they are finished for
the year. Just to be on the safe side, don't put them in the
compost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Away, You Cats &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I dissuade roaming cats from using my flower garden
as their personal litter box and sunning area?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keeping cats from sunning themselves is about as likely as
keeping the sun itself from rising, so you might as well
concentrate on learning to admire how lovely they are when they are
lolling about.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the litter box problem, work on making sure your
garden does not resemble one. The most important thing is to remove
the main sources of litter-box odor, since cats go where their
noses tell them cats have gone before. Follow up with a commercial
cat repellent, to cover any smells that may have been left behind.
(Don't expect the repellent to perform like Hercules; you really do
have to start by cleaning up).
</P>
<P>
   Once the odor problem is solved, make it hard for them to dig
again by covering any open soil with dark-colored paper or plastic
mulch. This leaves newly planted soil as the only vulnerable area.
Cover it with chicken wire until the new plants have achieved fair
size and can be mulched, and you should have the little dears
thoroughly thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pruning and Burning &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been reading a book on pruning. Several times the
author mentions removing dead, diseased or damaged branches and
burning them. He gives no explanation why burning is necessary. In
these days of recycling and compost making, is there a particular
reason he says this?  &QL; 
A. Even a well-made compost pile may not heat up enough to kill the
disease spores on sick plants, so anything of this sort you remove
should leave the garden permanently. And wood takes much longer
than other compost ingredients to decompose, even when it has been
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Where the law still permits, the easiest way to get rid of this
stuff is to burn it. Fire is a great purifier _ no disease can
survive the heat _ and it reduces huge piles of prunings to small
piles of ash quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If open burning is out, bury any sick material at least a foot
deep, burn it in the fireplace, or send it to the landfill.
Anything that isn't sick can go through a chipper (rentable, if you
don't have one) and can then be used for mulch. Or your town may
have a ``wood dump'' to which it can be taken.

   &UR; Jug Irrigation &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This summer's drought and underwatering may be causing very
poor cucumber and tomato production from my raised beds. For a
simple irrigation system, a friend suggests cutting holes in the
bottoms of gallon water jugs, inverting the jugs, poking the tops
three or four inches deep into the soil six to eight inches from
the stems of the plants, and filling the jugs with water. What do
you think of this method?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not much, I'm afraid. It sounds good on paper, but in
practice you end up with a garden full of plastic jugs. This does
make a sort of sculptural statement but not one that's especially
handsome or space-efficient. As adjacent plantings grow, foliage
covers the jugs, which makes them hard to fill. Dirt falls into
them when you weed. They tend to get deposits of dead bugs, fallen
leaves and other debris, and will eventually support a nice growth
of algae.
</P>
<P>
   And they have the same drawback as all single-point
drip-irrigation systems; plants send roots to where the easy water
is instead of spreading them down and out. This makes for weak,
poorly anchored plants that are overdependent on the irrigation
source. Go away for a week or just plain forget to fill those jugs,
and your plants are toast. Soaker-hose systems take longer to set
up, but they work better in the long run, are less obtrusive and
better for the plants.

   &UR; Name Your Cyberpoison, Whether Worm or Virus &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do a computer virus and a computer worm differ?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Both viruses and worms are purposely destructive bits of
software. Both can wreak havoc on your computer, but there is a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   A computer virus is a program that is hidden within an existing
program. When the infected application is run, the virus code is
activated and copies itself onto other files on your computer. The
effects of a virus can be anything from an annoying message
randomly flashing on your screen to the corruption and destruction
of your files. Viruses are often passed along to other computers
via tainted files exchanged by e-mail or on floppy disks or by
being copied over a network.
</P>
<P>
   A worm is a stand-alone program that replicates over and over,
filling up your hard drive with its wormy self. It can eventually
tax all resources and cause the computer to crash if left
unchecked. Worms are often spread over a network.
</P>
<P>
   There are many antivirus utility programs available to help ward
off viruses and worms; keeping a good, up-to-date version on your
computer may save both your files and your sanity. A great deal of
hysteria is often caused not by actual viruses but by rumors of
viruses or flat-out hoaxes, usually circulated as warnings via
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   A Web page that can help to separate fact from fiction is the
Computer Virus Myths site  &UR; (kumite.com. &LR;   &UR; myths/home.htm) &LR; .

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The six teen-agers who worked on the new Eib's Pond
Community Park on Staten Island this summer did not spend their
childhoods catching tadpoles. Even though they live nearby, few had
ventured very far into the 17 wetland acres, which were fenced with
metal guard rails and filled with the rusted hulks of more than 20
abandoned cars. The park borders some of Staten Island's
highest-density and lowest-income housing, and is within walking
distance for thousands in the Clifton area.
</P>
<P>
   Most New York City wetlands are salt marshes; Eib's Pond
(pronounced eyebz) is a rarity: a freshwater pond. Covering three
acres, it is the largest in the five boroughs of the kettle ponds
that were scooped out by the retreat of the Wisconsin glacier
12,000 years ago. The water level in Eib's Pond, actually a series
of three clay-bottomed ponds linked by wetlands, is replenished
only by runoff and rain, and so varies strikingly from season to
season, making it a home for a wide variety of plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Eib's Pond is named after the 19th-century family that used it
as a watering hole for their livestock. In 1843, Henry David
Thoreau spent the summer nearby. ``The cedar seems to be one of the
most common trees here, and the fields are fragrant with it,'' he
wrote on May 22. He describes gum and tulip trees, native
honeysuckle, meadows red with Indian paintbrush and fence rows
crowded with seedling peach trees. ``The whole island is like a
garden,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Being the kind of ecumenical observer he was (admiring even the
dead fish washed up on Staten Island's shore), Thoreau would
probably still think Eib's Pond was special. Studies have shown
both soil and water to be startlingly clean. Bulrushes, cattails,
cinnamon fern, sassafras and other native plants thrive despite
rampaging exotics like porcelain berry, phragmites and mugwort.
Frogs, fish, painted turtles and muskrats attest to the water
quality. Waterlilies bloom. Blue herons, ducks and snowy egrets
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Because urban wetlands are usually polluted, they are often
handed over to professionals _ engineers, ecologists and landscape
architects. What distinguishes the Eib's Pond project, now in its
second year, is how it offers ecologically sound landscape design
that lay people can use. For the minority youth of this particular
neighborhood, seeing their own designs take shape was empowering.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hood, a professor of landscape architecture at the
College of Environmental Design of the University of California at
Berkeley, explained why there are so few black landscape
architects. ``It's a luxury profession,'' he said. ``If you are
from the projects in Orange, N.J., and the first in your family to
go to college, your career decision is going to be closely tied to
economics. Law or medical school, or business administration _
those are the ways to make big money, not landscape architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, there is low visibility within the field of education.
How many colleges teach landscape or environmental studies as a
profession? Last, there are no role models in popular culture. The
closest we get to a professional profile is the architect in Spike
Lee's `Jungle Fever.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hood went to an all-black college in North Carolina, the
Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, which
had one of the first undergraduate landscape programs in the
country. There he met Charles Fountain, a professor of landscape
design who had received his degree from the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The young Staten Islanders were employed by the Urban
Conservation Corps, the summer jobs program run by the Parks
Council, a nonprofit advocates' group. Eib's Pond falls under the
Parks Council's Green Neighborhoods program, which program director
Sean Andrews said requires strong local partners. In this case, the
partners are the Rev. Hattie Smith Davis, head of the Fox Hills
Tenant Association, and the local community board chairman, George
Caputo, a longtime Eib's Pond fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   A powerhouse of a woman, Ms. Davis is also an honorary member of
the local police force. She runs year-round after-school and summer
programs for more than 100 children, and also teaches baking.
</P>
<P>
   Eib's Pond has always had a system of trails, and secret
entrances on each side. Visitors in the past were evenly divided
between fishermen and drug dealers. Quixotically, however, Eib's
has also been a precious refuge. ``It's a place to listen to
quietness,'' Ms. Davis said. ``When troubled kids ran away from
home, they would head in there. But they'd tell me where they were
going.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Parks Council first appeared, Ms. Davis and the
neighborhood were wary of any attempt to better the pond. Ms. Davis
has a Thoreau-like attitude toward the place: ``At first I wanted
to keep the old cars where they were. The fish had got used to
them, and the birds sat on their tops, just like people get used to
living in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much that's ours,'' she continued, ``and we
wanted to make sure Eib's would go on being ours.'' Concerns abated
when she met Sari Weissman, a student from the Harvard Graduate
School of Design, who came to Eib's Pond last summer, and Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Sean and Sari,'' she said, ``I could see they were
here not to take but to give.'' Besides, she said, her 10-year-old
grandson convinced her Eib's needed some changes. ``Grandma,'' he
told her, ``the fish can't drive the cars, and why can't the birds
be in the trees?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weissman developed the guidelines for the park and hacked
out the first new paths last summer with help from Ms. Davis, local
teen-agers and environmental experts marshaled by the Parks
Council. For seven weeks this summer, a new crew pulled weeds, did
cleanups, and kept journals of their work.
</P>
<P>
   They also attended design workshops and visited and critiqued
other parks. They learned that paths had to be accessible to the
handicapped but that in a protected wetland, paths must follow
existing topographic lines, because the land cannot be graded.
</P>
<P>
   They helped to build and install a redwood bridge and
observation deck with cantilevered seats. To do so, they had to
pour concrete pilings in a swampy bottom. None of them had poured
concrete before, not even Ms. Weissman, but they managed. (Before
the bridge was built, getting across this stretch of marsh had been
an athletic event requiring climbing into and out of an old car
lying in the mud.)
</P>
<P>
   As the team discovered the landscape, they discovered themselves
and their skills. Kadedra Butler became so well known for her
ability with the hoe that the Parks Council gave her the tool to
keep. ``I'm going to carve my name and the date in the handle,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   William Arce captured every flower with his pencil. His caption
for a glowing drawing of a waterlily reads, ``I like this flower
because it brings out the beauty in the wilderness.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshia Dupree admitted that the job was different from what he
had expected. ``I didn't think I'd be planting trees,'' he said.
``I thought I'd be pulling weeds. And birds _ I never knew there
were so many different kinds of exotic birds out there, like that
blue heron. I've started to get people to come to see how it looks,
so they won't be destroying it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the summer, the workers were given their own cedar
trees to plant anywhere in the park. ``I planted mine next to the
first pond,'' Moshia said. ``Now I come down there to water it
because new trees need water. Last weekend there was a whole bunch
of people in the park, children on the bench and all. They said,
`You did this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Moshia, who lives two minutes by bus from the pond, wants to
work in the park again next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you find something that you really like, that you
can keep your mind on,'' he said. ``Who knows? Maybe I'll be a
botanist someday. I already took biology and earth science, and I'm
good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Eib's Pond Community Park will again exhale the fragrance
of Thoreau's cedar trees. ``I see the Bible,'' Ms. Davis said,
describing what Eib's Pond's regeneration means to her. ``Genesis
1:29: He has given us every herb of the earth. These things were
there all the time, but to find them was the revelation.''

`GOV. GARRY MAURO' NOT MOST TEXANS' VISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garry Mauro is on a roll. The latest Texas Poll shows that he's
gained six points in his race to unseat Gov. George W. Bush, which
means that Bush's lead is down to a razor-thin 47 points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the campaign, the Texas Poll gave Bush a 53-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro boasted that he would close the gap as the Nov. 3 election
drew closer; and, by golly, his prediction came true. At this rate,
Mauro might be able to cut the deficit down to a measly 30 or 40
points by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks. The 1998 election for governor of Texas
was over long ago. It was probably over before Mauro decided to
run. It was certainly over once Mauro hit the campaign trail and
started trying to peddle his pie-in-the-sky agenda to the Texas
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   As the Texas Poll poll testifies, voters in the Lone Star State
are much too smart to be taken in by the promise-now, pay-later
malarkey of an old-fashioned tax-and-spend Democrat such as Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate who has no chance of winning enjoys a certain
freedom, of course: the freedom to make wild-eyed promises that he
will never be expected to keep. Among Mauro's more outrageous
promises: unaffordable pay raises and signing bonuses for
schoolteachers, and unachievable changes in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro says that his people have knocked on more than 1 million
doors in his quest to prevent Bush from becoming the first Texas
governor to win election to consecutive four-year terms.
Unfortunately for Mauro, he could knock on every door in Texas and
never alter the undeniable reality of the election: Bush has done
an outstanding job as governor, and Texas voters know it.
</P>
<P>
   So do voters in other states, which is why we keep hearing all
this talk about Bush being a front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's backers have complained that Bush spends too much time
out of the state _ supposedly promoting his presidential ambitions
_ but they should be grateful to all those out-of-state candidates
who have been asking the Texas governor to help them raise money.
If Bush has racked up a 47-point lead while taking time to visit
other states, how breathtaking an advantage would he have if he'd
been campaigning as hard as Mauro has in recent months?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Mauro camp's wish for Bush to spend more time
in Texas will come true after the governor's trips this week to
Illinois, Georgia, Arizona and Colorado. It surely won't be long
before Mauro will be longing for the good old days, when he had the
field more or less to himself.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush spending more time on the campaign trail and Mauro
looking to his pal Bill Clinton for help on the hustings _ well,
there's no telling how devastating the Bush landslide might be.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bush undertook his campaign against incumbent
Ann Richards as the underdog, trailing in most polls by double
digits. The so-called experts were certain that Richards'
popularity was so overwhelming that she would breeze to
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But Richards' popularity was based on her status as a celebrity,
not her performance as governor. She was the state's official
stand-up comic, regaling Texans with folksy witticisms and scathing
wit; she attempted to defeat Bush by insulting him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in the polls is a different story. This governor is
popular because he has done what he promised to do when he asked
voters to support him back in 1994. He is popular because he has a
vision for the state and he has demonstrated the ability to achieve
it.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro constantly accuses Bush of being out of touch with
ordinary Texans, but it is Mauro who is out of touch. Bush promises
limited government intrusion into the lives of Texans; Mauro
promises more state interference in education and health care. Bush
promises an era of personal responsibility; Mauro promises
ever-increasing dependence on the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Mauro camp says the Texas Poll is flawed. Could be.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead might be bigger than the poll says it is.

STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING? BLAME YOUR BIORHYTHMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You oversleep and walk in late and unironed for your Big
Meeting, plus you're limping from tripping over the curb on the way
in. Mama said there'd be days like this, and now she can call up a
Web-based biorhythm calculator on her laptop and warn you ahead of
time _ all in good fun, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The pseudoscience of biorhythms, sometimes thought of as on a
par with astrology _ except that the fault, dear Web surfer, lies
within you instead of with the stars _ has been around for a
century, and the Internet offers many sites that will let you plot
your own. All you need is a birthdate and a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Two popular sites with biorhythm calculators are Web-O-Rhythm
(www.qns.com/html/weborhythm) and Life Sines (www.lifesines.com),
but there are plenty more out there. Just do a search for
``biorhythms,'' and you'll probably score a few hits for sites
offering similar programs for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that biological rhythms affect emotions, alertness
and readiness to mate, among other things, was developed from about
1897 to 1932 by medical doctors in Paris, Berlin and Vienna,
Austria, as well as Philadelphia and other cities. The basic
biorhythm chart has three undulating lines crossing a horizontal
line. The wavy lines represent the physical, the emotional and the
mental, or intellectual, cycles of a person over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
   On a basic biorhythm chart, which is based on one's birthdate,
the physical cycle lasts 23 days, the emotional cycle 28 days and
the mental cycle 33 days. The first half of each cycle, falling
above the chart's horizontal line, is considered to be positive,
while the second half, below the line, is thought to influence
those particular aspects negatively.
</P>
<P>
   The days on the chart when each cycle crosses the line are said
to be ``critical.'' When two or more cycles hit the same critical
day, bad things will happen, believers say, but these days are easy
enough to predict, supposedly, with the aid of mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual curves are generally plotted as sine waves of the
appropriate length,'' said Jeff Jetton, a programmer with a
biorhythm program for the Pilot (www.mindspring.com/ jetton/pilot).
``Who said you'd never use trigonometry again?''
</P>
<P>
   While certain circadian rhythms (like digestive timetables, the
sleep-wake cycle and hormone activity) have been shown to exist in
all sorts of organisms, the human biorhythms described above are
thought by most scientists to be mere whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons cited is that natural rhythms in living
organisms approximate regular cycles but vary in exact cycle
lengths because of environmental and other factors and could never
maintain the rigidly precise period lengths described in the
biorhythm hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific papers addressing biorhythms, but not supporting the
biorhythm concept, have been published in The New England Journal
of Medicine and The Journal of Safety Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I haven't come across any experimental evidence,
which is not to say that there isn't any out there, so I remain a
skeptic,'' Jetton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it's a fun theory,'' he added, ``and very useful for
giving an excuse for locking your keys in the car or blowing off
your workout.''

   DOW-MAIN _ Major U.S. market averages got out to a surprisingly
robust start in Wednesday's trading session. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is up 48 points and the Nasdaq 20 points.

   NORTHWEST-LAYOFFS _ Northwest Airlines laid off 27,500 employees

   OPTIONS _ A good part of the new wealth created in Austin in the
1990s has been tied to the stock market, much of it to the
incredible rise in Dell Computer's stock over the past four years.
But not every technology company has created a huge base of wealth
workers. At VTEL, for instance, the stock price has dropped well
below the option excercise price for many workers. For the time
being, at least, those options are worth zero. (Ladendorf, Austin

   DAY-TRADERS _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ If any investor can stand up to
the gut-wrenching swings of this week's volatile stock market, it's
a day trader like Andy Friis. He is one of a new breed of investor
who earns his daily bread by squeezing fractional profits from each
share he buys and selling as a stock rolls in one direction or
another. (Pounds, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SILVER-LINING _ Domestic stock markets' free fall Monday and
partial recovery Tuesday proved that at least one cliche has some
cachet: The dark cloud over the markets does indeed have a silver
lining. On Monday, when the market fell a staggering 512 points,
veteran money managers figured, hey, it's a buying opportunity. The
lurking bear produced some pretty good bargains in solid companies.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reverence most people feel for the sight and sound of water
in the garden doesn't necessarily extend to the swimming pool. What
seems the essence of serenity in the contemplative setting of the
Alhambra, or in Hockney's aquamarine acrylics, turns garish when
suburbia's acrylic pool liners are viewed from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Still, swimming pools endure, some strong, worlds unto
themselves and, recently, landscape designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about pools is how completely they are
about artifice,'' said Michael Van Valkenburgh, a landscape
architect and a professor of landscape architecture at Harvard
University. ``There's nothing that could be less of nature than a
swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``natural'' in pool design today might mean anything
from a bathhouse with a Darth Vader flying-insect force field to
concrete lava rocks and simulated waterfalls (favored by new luxury
hotels) to an invented pool-as-pond with imported,
wild-at-the-edges prairie grasses. Even shade has become a modifier
of pool design, says James van Sweden, a landscape architect in
Washington, as people forgo deep tans for a cancer-free pallor.
</P>
<P>
   In Bel Air, Calif., at the home of the interior designer Rose
Tarlow, a pond-like pool in a wooded clearing is the visual
equivalent of the meditative mantra ``om.'' On one of those steep
and prickly California slopes made famous during mud slides, it
seems as untouched as if Tarzan and Jane had just stumbled upon it.
``Rose told me she wanted it to look like it has always been there,
like you just happened upon it in a forest,'' said Los Angeles
landscape designer Edina Weinstein. ``My first reaction was, `Oh,
sure.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a large circle, the pool is 20 feet in diameter and
comes within eight feet of the climbing slope. Standing hard by is
a pagoda-shaped pavilion providing shade, where Ms. Tarlow can read
and paint. At 10-by-10-feet square, it is made of plaster with
small holes in it to encourage climbing vines. An extravagantly
peaked roof made of 17th-century slate tiles that Ms. Tarlow
brought home from England insures the pavilion's status as a folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like those turquoise pools,'' Ms. Tarlow said. ``I
like large pools that don't fight the landscape.'' Achieving the
just-excavated look took a herculean effort: far from fighting the
landscape, the pool and pavilion are trying hard not to succumb to
it. Their small pad of land required retaining walls worthy of a
fortress to protect it from the slippery slope. Disguising those
walls with local plant materials ``that looked like they came from
where we are, not Connecticut,'' became Ms. Weinstein's main
challenge. ``A natural California hillside in August is not a
beautiful sight,'' she said. ``There aren't enough nutrients in the
soil to go for the overplanted look.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weinstein's solution was to encourage and embellish on such
natives as pine, oleander, the bushy silver berry and the vinous
clematis. She was also careful to select plants unappealing to the
many deer that roam the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The pool itself lies almost even with the ground. Ms. Tarlow
envisioned greenery overrunning the coping and obliterating the
edge between water and earth. The landscape designer suggested
creeping thyme as ground cover but that would necessitate stepping
stones _ or shoes _ to negotiate the walk from bathhouse to pool.
Going barefoot is elemental to the illusion Ms. Tarlow had in mind,
and so grass covers the ground around the pool, which is approached
along a rustic processional of railroad ties as steps, with sod
risers.
</P>
<P>
   Pools don't always get so much attention. Landscape
Architecture, the industry magazine, hasn't written about them in
years, says its editor, Anne Powell. van Sweden, author of
``Gardening With Water'' (Random House, 1995), estimates that fewer
than 40 percent of the more than 400 gardens he has designed
include pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pools used to look like bathtubs sitting out there,'' he said.
``And they're unsightly in winter with those covers.'' When he does
design swimming pools he draws inspiration from ``the utter
naturalness'' of a tropical garden pool in Rio de Janeiro designed
by Roberto Burle Marx, which was made by damming a river. He finds
that the swimming pool as pond or lily pool has become more popular
than pools with the so-called infinity edge, where water
overflowing the coping seems to melt into the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone wants a circular pool with a negative edge and
the lawn right up to the coping,'' said van Sweden, who warns
homeowners finnicky about keeping their pools clean to think twice
about this leaf-prone variety.
</P>
<P>
   For a pool that he designed in Bedford, N.Y., van Sweden nestled
a 75-foot-long irregular oval pool into a natural outcropping of
rocks along a wooded site. His coping is covered with fountain
grass that doesn't shed but helps to soften the pool's edge. A pool
house designed by the architectural firm Shope Reno Wharton takes
up the cause of nature with a twist: for supports the designers
used rough-hewn stone columns with a gray slate roof inspired by
the 19th-century park structures of Frederick Law Olmsted. ``Ever
since I had skin cancers removed I've been interested in making
sure that the pools I design get plenty of shade,'' van Sweden
said.
</P>
<P>
   What his clients really want, van Sweden confessed, is a
pond-like pool at least 50 feet across the middle _ large enough to
do laps, its bottom painted a mottled midnight blue. Of his latest
pool commissions, van Sweden said, ``I find a single lane marker
across the bottom like a zipper looks great _ and very stylized.''

   It's the garbage can that got glamour. Since its introduction
two years ago, the Umbra company's Garbo can, in black, white and
translucent colors, has moved from a best seller at such humble
retailers as Linens and Things and Bed, Bath and Beyond to become a
celebrity of the design world. It has been celebrated in the
Italian design press from Domus to Interni, the Milan-based
magazine on whose current cover it appears, and this fall it will
get its own ads in Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a heady trip for a humble object of high-impact virgin
polypropylene that retails for $10 or $12. With nearly a million
copies of Garbo and its smaller sister Garbino sold, Umbra is
offering the cans in 17 new colors this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The name was important to the can's appeal. It was born in a
brainstorming session, said Paul Rowan, who founded and runs the
Buffalo, N.Y.-based Umbra with Les Mandelbaum. The name Toss was
tossed about. The ideas of romantic curves and Hollywood were
raised. Then a salesman, whose name no one remembers, pronounced
the word Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Karim Rashid, 38, who was born in Cairo, grew up in
Britain and the United States, studied in Italy and worked in
Canada, Garbo has an international following. Rashid calls his
style ``sensuous minimalism,'' and the lines of, say, the metal
salt and pepper shakers and candlesticks he designs for Nambe
suggest a similar fluidity.
</P>
<P>
   But Garbo's shape also grew from Rashid's scrupulous study of
the markets and methods of the waste-container business. When he
travels, he visits malls and grocery stores to see competing
products _ the less expensive, the more closely he looks. He visits
factories to makes himself an expert on the molding methods that
create Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Garbo's sensual shapes come less from any natural model
than from the methods of the factory floor. The shape began with
Pilot Fineliner drawings in Rashid's sketchbooks and progressed
through images rotated, spun and varied on the computer, where
Rashid does most of his work. The shapes are deceptively simple. A
circle is pulled up and out to form the walls. At the top, ``the
saddle, or butterfly cut, makes it look elliptical,'' Rashid said,
and provides a natural place for the ``negative space'' of handles.
``It's a play on geometry,'' he added. The rounded interior bottom
also makes for easier cleaning, a detail Rashid is proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Garbo is almost a cartoon of how to make an easy-to-mold shape.
It's a model of the means of its own manufacture _ of little
interest to the buyer who sees simply graceful forms but of much
interest to the guys at the factory _ and to Rowan. When he speaks
of Garbo, he exudes pride in its sales, but there was even more
satisfaction in his voice when he said, ``the productivity of the
tool is very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Rashid has one worry about Garbo: that its success will
overshadow his work in furniture (at Totem, a store in Manhattan's
Tribeca) and lighting. ``I'd hate to think it might be like a hit
song that ends up on VH1 15 years later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garbo was joined by the smaller Garbino after Umbra found that
Japanese and some European buyers considered the five-quart-plus
version too big. Now, Garbino outsells Garbo. Just arrived are
Garbanzo, a swing-top kitchen garbage can, and Garbowl, a fruit
bowl with lines similar to the original.
</P>
<P>
   But people like Garbo so much they use it for other purposes.
Umbra now describes it as an alternative storage medium. A worker
at Umbras Buffalo factory uses Garbos as horse feeders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it used in Soho galleries as an umbrella stand,''
Rashid said. People put flowers in it. And customers find that
Garbino, with its round bottom full of ice, functions well as a
Champagne bucket.

 Matt Resnicoff, a former senior editor at Musician magazine, is a
writer, producer and guitarist based in New York.  
 By MATT RESNICOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To play the guitar _ and to play it well _ do you have to learn
music theory? According to Sabina Skalar, a developer of the eMedia
guitar-education course reviewed below, the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want all this difficult stuff thrown at
them,'' Ms. Skalar said in a breathless rush that I might have
dismissed as hucksterism if she weren't also a first violinist with
the New York City Ballet orchestra. ``If you're just into the
enjoyment of music, you can live your whole life without learning
the theory.''
</P>
<P>
   As a lowly scribe, I was tempted to hold my tongue rather than
debate with a professional. And yet, as a guitar student whose
initial fear of music theory resulted in years of frustration, I
was rankled by her pessimism about fledgling guitarists.
</P>
<P>
   The argument, after all, was coming from a woman whose career
(and presumably her greatest joy) hangs on her ability to glance at
a piece of written music and give it life through her instrument.
Are we guitarists not entitled to the same pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   Despite its occasionally brutish role in rock, the guitar is a
complex and unforgiving beast that many introductory methods have
attempted to tame through oversimplification. But saying that music
theory encumbers students is like suggesting that learning a
foreign language does not really require knowing what the new words
mean, as long as you can form them with your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a huge gulf between truly learning the guitar and
merely acquiring the muscle memory necessary to reproduce sounds
heard in most of the popular songs we know.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, some of the following guitar programs feed the
hope that you can play immediately, and they even make good on the
promise by demonstrating how to operate the instrument on its most
basic level. Some avoid the fast path, covering admittedly tedious
studies like sight reading and ear training.
</P>
<P>
   Others fall prey to the use of chord dictionaries, which offer
diagrams or photos of the guitar neck being gripped this way or
that to form a given chord, often without indicating that there are
countless other colorful ways to voice such chords.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of this software succumbs to the lure of a system
known as tablature, a bane of guitar education, used by magazines
like Guitar, that hawks hit songs on fingering-by-the-numbers
grids. While tablature can be an aid, it is more often a crutch for
the able-minded and can hobble the process of decoding passages by
ear, transcribing them and eventually grasping why they were played
that way in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the guitar should be taught any less
methodically than other instruments is precisely what has corrupted
its evolution and promotes its misuse in popular music.
</P>
<P>
   This is no stylistic bias. I started as a rock player and love
rock dearly, but I cannot in good conscience recommend any CD-ROM
without an accompanying text like Mick Goodrick's ``The Advancing
Guitarist,'' a book to shatter the imprisonment of chord ``grips''
if ever there was one.
</P>
<P>
   Using the best of these programs with unfailing patience, you
can begin a fruitful relationship with this perplexing instrument.
Despite its occasional clumsiness, the computer gives ample
leverage in taming the beast, although processor speed alone can't
accelerate the process.
</P>
<P>
   One sage teacher, Joe Diorio, once offered the best bromide to
anyone hungering for proficiency on the guitar. ``It doesn't come
when you're ready,'' he said. ``It comes when it's ready.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Lighthearted Approach, But a Solid Information Base &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GUITAR 101/THE FENDER METHOD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (G-Vox Interactive Music; $39.99; Macintosh and Windows 95.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most introductory guitar software, Guitar 101 does not
throw a folio of familiar songs at you until after you've completed
an extensive, well-paced tutorial on the basics of music theory and
the physical aspects of playing. That includes everything from the
definitions of sharps and flats to the proper methods for holding
and fingering the guitar without unnecessary physical tension.
</P>
<P>
   The program has several virtual classrooms, with periodic visits
from the teacher who designed the course, a sort of
Stratocaster-toting Wilfred-Brimley-meets-Max-Headroom character
seen only on a television monitor. Exercises and quizzes conclude
each section.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an introductory sequence that comes off like an
infomercial for Fender guitars, Guitar 101 is quite approachable,
even in showing how hard-won music knowledge will support any style
of playing.
</P>
<P>
   Though more extravagant graphically than the average tutorial,
the visuals seem incidental (each ``new'' classroom simply
rearranges the furniture of the previous chamber, and for some
reason a clock perpetually reads 3:20).
</P>
<P>
   The program has a few weaknesses: Spoken and written text often
reiterates points made by a woefully underused tour guide, the
brilliant Los Angeles guitarist Carl Verheyen.
</P>
<P>
   The guitar neck is explored through well-designed ascending and
descending drills. Preprogrammed accompaniments actually harmonize
and ``musicalize'' the most rudimentary open-string exercises,
allowing the simplist exercises to feel like actual music-making.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying ``band'' _ admittedly a stiff lot of simulated
hacks _ manages to get progressively hipper in its support as the
work intensifies. Because it's less dependent on tunes and relies
on intriguing musical subtleties like these, this fine CD is for
players seeking more complete control of the guitar from their
first lesson on. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Lots of On-Screen Options And a Band to Back You Up &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLAY GUITAR WITH ROSS BOLTON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Play Music Inc.; $49.95; Windows 95, 98 and NT.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The merits of the CD-ROM as a surrogate music instructor are
best seen in this program's interface, which adds unlikely
conveniences to such computer inevitabilities as small-screen video
clips bordered with written music and tiny on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the windows themselves can be moved, so the screen can
be organized to taste. The videos, which include demonstrations of
chord forms, melodic passages and technical advice, can be shuttled
in real time like a VCR, allowing for an examination of the
teacher's fingerings.
</P>
<P>
   The options for viewing the program's animated guitar neck are
panoramic: Dots dancing on the fretboard can be seen from overhead,
from directly across, from a birds'-eye view and even from the
vantage of a lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle frills aside, Play Guitar excels at putting forth pivotal
music fundamentals, but here again, the features are nearly
unprecedented. In the performance videos, the instructor's guitar
can be muted so you can practice the material backed by a band of
real musicians rather than synthesized digital accompaniment. A
loop feature lets you select with precision those passages within
the section that you wish to hone.
</P>
<P>
   A formal practice mode ends each section, and a virtual mixing
console allows complete control over the blend of the background
music. In on-screen text, underlined words, when clicked, fly you
into a glossary of terms defined through voice-overs, staves and
sound samples.
</P>
<P>
   This is also one of the few CD-ROMs available that does an
adequate job instilling the concept of triads and the idea that a
common chord ``grip'' is but one voicing, or arrangement of notes,
that characterize a given chord.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this understanding, you maintain a good chance of
escaping the prison of rote finger motion that locks so many
players into always playing chords in the same way. A personal
history menu shows you the topics you have already covered, which
really helps in a program with so many lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Two gripes here: Traditional staff notation is used in only
parts of the program and is inexplicably absent on far too many
screens. And the discussion of changing keys is based on a device
known as the capo, which is basically a clip that depresses all the
strings at a chosen fret, freeing the player from that pesky
musical skill known as transposing. Until a capo is invented for
the cerebrum, the device cannot be mentioned responsibly in a
beginning guitar course. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Well-Paced Music Tutorial &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GUITROPOLIS: AN ADVENTURE IN LEARNING TO PLAY THE GUITAR  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Alfred Publishing; $49.95; Macintosh and Windows 3.1 and 95.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As if navigating Superlocrian scales and fingering complex
chords were not enough strain on an aspiring guitarist, Alfred
Publishing offers an instructional game in which students must
simultaneously learn the basics of playing and conquer a virtual
city. In some ways, to navigate the surreal Guitropolis is to see
the actual vagaries of the musician's life: tune an instrument
incorrectly and a geeky music-store clerk jeers and goads; seek
admission to a record mogul's office and be rebuffed because you
haven't mastered your sight reading.
</P>
<P>
   In its attempt to superimpose slick game graphics onto
interactive educational features, Alfred has created a lighthearted
but respectable course providing a solid base of musical
information. The game aspects overwhelms their own purpose at
times, as with the virtual tuning, which replicates the process
about as accurately as a skiing program simulates chapped lips.
</P>
<P>
   Some games make their point effectively: after two hours of
shooting savage airborne alien quarter notes, you'll never forget
how many beats there are in a measure. But such exercises are more
likely to induce carpal tunnel syndrome than excessive practicing
on a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the user will naturally yearn for liberation
from the tyrannical test-and-reward methodology that governs
Guitropolis, the package also thoughtfully includes a no-frills,
nongame version of the instructional method. There is also an
online guitar tuner and a rudimentary chord reference.
</P>
<P>
   Each lesson is distilled into informative screens and exercises,
which eventually allow for practice of rock, metal, country and
jazz chord progressions, Although traditional staff notation is
fully integrated, I can't envision Juilliard adopting Guitropolis
just yet. Classicists are partial to Asteroids. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good Program for Beginners, Though Short on Notation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EMEDIA GUITAR METHOD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volumes 1 and 2 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (eMedia Corp.; $59.95; Macintosh and Windows 3.1 and 95.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A beginners' program emphasizing folk and rock, because these
styles are based in simple, fixed chords strummed in varying
rhythms, the eMedia 1 course focuses its strongest portions on
right-hand techniques. It explains how the pick is held and
dissects the system of rests and pick strokes that propel this
music.
</P>
<P>
   Each concept uses relatively well-known songs as a reference,
and a recorded version can often be run at fast or slow speeds.
On-line videos demonstrate individual topics with a warm, if static
demeanor; ``talk'' buttons offer gentle encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, eMedia 1 completely avoids the use of traditional
staff notation in lessons on melody, and it fails to define the
function of notes within common chords. It also neglects to mention
the fundamental harmonic and structural role of chords in pop and
blues. While these may indeed lie beyond the course's intended
scope, a hint here and there would undoubtedly lay some groundwork
to help students in further study.
</P>
<P>
   When the course does offer alternatives to grips, it scarcely
names the new chords or the notes that create them.
</P>
<P>
   Both eMedia volumes are song-based. An on-screen recording
feature allows you to lay down chords or melodies and play along
with them. Chord inversions are introduced but not explained
adequately, and no distinction is made between the qualities that
make a chord major or minor.
</P>
<P>
   The eMedia 2 CD-ROM offers a choice of tablature
(fingering-by-number grids) or standard musical notation, therefore
correcting some of the missteps of the first volume. The level of
playing is high, particularly in the classical tunes and a
late-period blues-rock offering from Jeff Beck.
</P>
<P>
   To tackle the material offered in eMedia 2 is a significant
accomplishment, and the program ably sets the student on the right
path.

 &HT;    Stock market still beats Social Security
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEW! Good thing Americans haven't yet convinced Congress to
invest their Social Security taxes in the stock market. Look at the
hit they'd have taken!
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the line we expect to hear in coming days from
the detractors of Social Security privatization. They'll point to
the market's gyrations _ Monday's 512-point loss and Tuesday's
288-point gain _ and say market volatility and sudden, unexplained
drops are exactly why Americans shouldn't tie their retirement
hopes to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't disagree more. Wall Street's troubles give us no
reason to back away from our support for allowing Americans to
invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in stock and bond
markets. They'll still do far better than they would under Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious risks associated with investing in the stock
market, as Monday's drop proved. The U.S. economy is not
recession-proof, nor can it be insulated from foreign financial
crises such as those in Asia and Russia. The history of business
cycles shows recessions follow economic expansions, like the
eight-year run we've just experienced.
</P>
<P>
   But neither is Social Security risk-free. Every time Congress
cuts benefits, raises the retirement age or increases payroll
taxes, your Social Security ``investment'' takes a dive. Since
1950, payroll taxes have climbed 1,200 percent. Benefits have
increased by only a third as much. Guess who eats the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, over the long haul, even accounting for drops like
those we've seen recently, private markets provide far better
returns than Social Security. From 1926 to 1996, stocks averaged an
annual return of 10.89 percent _ despite the Great Depression,
World War II, Vietnam, Watergate, the oil crisis and the market
crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, meanwhile, provides a negative return for
millions of Americans, and a paltry return of 2 or 3 percent for
single-income families with children. Private markets, even with
declines like Monday's, will beat Social Security every time. The
market's worst long-term performance, a 3.36 percent return from
1929 to 1948, beats expected returns from Social Security. Over the
course of a working career, about 46 years, the market's worst
performance (from 1929-1974) generated a 7.32 percent return.
Social Security doesn't come close.
</P>
<P>
   If Monday's decline scares you away from privatizing Social
Security, consider the accompanying chart. It shows how far the
market would have to fall to match the low level of return from
Social Security for a low-wage worker.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, privatizing Social Security doesn't mean every
American must ride Wall Street's roller coaster. Americans could
choose a level of risk that fits their situation: Workers nearing
retirement could choose risk-free T-bills, while 25-year-olds could
bet on risky stocks. The current system provides no such
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fool's game to point to a blip in time, like Monday, and
make long-term financial decisions affecting millions of Americans'
retirement. Despite the drop, and subsequent free falls that are
sure to come, investing in equities over the long haul remains a
wise choice _ as millions of working people have shown by retaining
their 401(k) investments. Monday's drop shouldn't slow the drive
toward privatizing Social Security.

 &HT;    KUWAITIS WARILY WATCH U.S. POLICY ON IRAQ, QUESTION ITS
INTENTIONS
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait _ Billboards in this modern, rebuilt capital
warn the people of this tiny, oil-rich nation not to forget their
POWs -- the more than 600 thought to be held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   A few bombed-out buildings downtown still stand like incongruous
war memorials amid the gleaming towers of the sterile city.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's citizens are keenly aware that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein still rules and blusters just beyond the border of their
two countries, posing a constant threat to Kuwait's 1.8 million
people. And, they closely followed recent reports that the United
States is allegedly changing its strategy for keeping Hussein in
check.
</P>
<P>
   But they take comfort in the 3,500 U.S. troops out in the
deserts protecting their cities. Also, many in Kuwait are just
tired of the annual Saddam-inspired crises.
</P>
<P>
   They have played host to Hussein's invasion and then Desert
Shield, Storm and Sabre. They stocked up on gas masks when last
year's Desert Thunder looked like another war-in-the-making. Their
newspapers report on the ongoing ``Intrinsic Action'' exercises
that keep American and Kuwaiti troops in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that, unless the United States is serious about
knocking Hussein out of power, they would rather avoid the huge
military build-ups that have raised regional blood pressures in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like they are in for a quieter United States, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Compare today to last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Hussein closed the door on United Nations weapons
inspections in eight of his palaces. The U.S. aircraft carriers and
troops of Desert Thunder swooped into the region. With American
officials saying that diplomacy will not work without the threat of
force, the build-up continued until a U.N. agreement diffused the
crisis in February.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hussein went further in cutting off all new
inspections. But the United States has not increased its forces in
Kuwait. Instead, it awaits action from the U.N., which is holding
Iraq under the weight of crushing economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis look on with concern, but also a case of what might be
called build-up fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very much sure about the solid position of the United
States vis-a-vis Iraq,'' said Sulaiman Majed Al-shaheen(CQ),
under-secretary of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a
recent interview with Cox News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our friends in the United States realize . . . that when
Saddam Hussein says a word, we find that there is an alert, a
warning, the moving of carriers to the gulf. Suddenly, we find that
everything becomes so calm,'' Al-shaheen said. ``That game costs
that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides that, there is the accusation, whether it be right or
wrong,'' he added carefully, ``that the United States comes to the
(Persian) Gulf only to show and not to take actions.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Al-shaheen said, unanimity on the U.N. Security Council
will ensure that Iraq is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   He does not hold the United States responsible for removing
Hussein, and said he is not worried about reports that the United
States is going for a lower-profile policing of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Those reports gained momentum last month after Scott Ritter,
leader of one of the U.N. inspection teams, quit his job, while
accusing the United States of taking the teeth out of the program
that is supposed to find and destroy Hussein's chemical and
biological weapons ``of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's comments prompted Congressional criticism, with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sounding out about a ``weak
response'' to Hussein's latest violations and Senate leaders saying
they would investigate the Clinton administration's policy.
</P>
<P>
   But, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright denied
discouraging inspections or that the United States' overall policy
has changed. The U.S. goal, she said is still to keep economic
sanctions on Iraq until it gives up its weapons and until Hussein
complies with other U.N. requirements, including the payment of
reparations for war damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been different tools used at different times,''
said a state department official. ``We're not being as militaristic
this time . . . this time we're not playing his game, we're playing
our game.''
</P>
<P>
   February's crisis was diffused when U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan traveled to Baghdad and secured an agreement with Hussein.
But, there had clearly been little support in the Arab world for
U.S. military action and France and Russia, members of the security
council, were hesitant. With this latest defiance, Hussein seems to
have snubbed all those countries and Annan -- not just America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. troops patrol and train in the desert, which
sometimes reaches a baking 140 degrees. Officials say the current
contingent is enough to strike Hussein, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great experimentation ground for new ideas,'' said Sgt.
Brian Goodknight(CQ), 42, who is based in Atlanta and supplies the
training equipment. ``We know we have to employ heavy combat units
to answer the threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Collins, an expert in political military studies at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said
the new policy emphasis does not mean the United States has given
in to Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, a retired U.S. Army colonel, said U.S. policy has
been poorly spelled out by a president distracted by a domestic
scandal and a host of other foreign policy problems -- from North
Korean missile testing to the Russian economic and political
crisis. That will make allies doubt the strength of America's stand
against Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Clinton administration should work harder to
unseat Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   That would sit well with many Kuwaitis. They are fond of
Americans and grateful for their war effort -- the Kuwaiti
government built the new $30 million U.S. embassy as a gift and
named a luxury apartment building after former President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But, many say that America is using the Hussein threat to keep
its troops in the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States wanted to get rid of Saddam, they could
with one finger,'' said Khaled Al-hassan(CQ), a 31-year-old Kuwaiti
soldier headed with his wife for a vacation in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks President Clinton is mainly interested in keeping oil
prices low, and pre-occupied with both Monica Lewinsky and Saudi
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hamani Al-khatan(CQ), 25, said that seven years after
the Iraqi invasion, she does not like to dwell on Hussein's
continued threat.
</P>
<P>
   But while she and her country have moved on and rebuilt their
prosperous daily lives, despite him, she said ``my mind works all
the time. In the heart and mind, we have a problem.''

CLINTON DEFENDS COMBATIVE COMMENTS IN SEX SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A weary President Clinton on Wednesday dismissed
critics' suggestions that he no longer is an effective leader and
defended his combative Aug. 17 address to the nation as an
expression of ``profound regret'' to all who have been hurt by the
sex scandal overshadowing his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned aside an opportunity to issue a formal apology
for misleading Americans about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and offered a somewhat revisionist view of his nationally
televised address last month.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit-ending news conference with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, Clinton faced reporters for the first time since
acknowledging to the nation that he had an inappropriate
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have stepped up their calls for Clinton's
resignation as Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr wraps up an
investigation into allegations that Clinton lied in sworn testimony
and obstructed justice in trying to conceal the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was no longer as effective as he should be, Clinton
said: ``No, I've actually been quite heartened by the reaction of
the American people and leaders throughout the world about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show a majority of the American people dislike Clinton's
personal conduct but don't want him ousted as president because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent 13 days on vacation at Martha's Vineyard with
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea for what
aides described as a healing session for the family. The first
lady, portrayed as hurt but committed to her marriage, accompanied
the president to Russia and left Wednesday for Northern Ireland
ahead of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he felt the need to issue a formal apology and if
he regretted the tone of his national address, Clinton sidestepped
the question. He said he had recently reread the four-minute
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound
regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved and my
desire not to see anymore people hurt by this process and caught up
in it,'' Clinton said. He appeared to be extending his regrets to
others, such as Lewinsky, who reportedly was hurt that she received
no apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to say was that I believe it's time for us to now
go back to the work of the country and give the people their
government back and talk about and think about and work on things
that will affect the American people today and in the future,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also disclosed, for the first time, that Clinton
has discussed the scandal, in general terms, with world leaders,
whose names were not revealed. The leaders reportedly offered words
of support and encouragement that Clinton and the United States
will maintain an international leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton told the nation that his answers, in a
deposition in the Paula Jones harassment case, denying a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky were legally accurate but misleading. He
expressed regret for misleading Americans, but did not ask
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical
lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am
solely and completely responsible,'' Clinton said in his nationally
televised address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my public comments and my silence about this
matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my
wife. I deeply regret that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Aug. 17 address came hours after he testified before
Starr's grand jury via closed-circuit television from the White
House. During the address, Clinton appeared angry and combative as
he attacked Starr for continuing the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Aides had hoped the national confession would allow Clinton to
put the issue behind him. However, many critics believed it fell
short of a sincere apology and Democrats on Capitol Hill have
distanced themselves from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complain the scandal is overshadowing the issues they
want to highlight in their quest to reclaim the House from
Republican control. Led by Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, many
Republicans have called for Clinton's resignation even before
receiving Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton indirectly addressed the issue last week when, on a
break from his vacation, he spoke at Union Chapel on Martha's
Vineyard to mark the 35th anniversary of the civil rights March on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you know, I'm having to become quite an expert in this
business of asking for forgiveness,'' he told a racially diverse
audience that had warmly embraced him. ``It gets a little easier
the more you do it. And if you have a family, an administration, a
Congress and a whole country to ask you, you're going to get a lot
of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Clinton had addressed the issue of
forgiveness, saying he learned anew that in order to get it, one
must give it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had anticipated questions about Lewinsky because it was
his first meeting with reporters since the television speech.
However, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., one of five members of Congress
traveling with Clinton, cornered the Reuters reporter who asked a
Lewinsky question and, waving his finger, said ``Speaking as an
American, I'm outraged.'' He said the media should ``drop its
obsession'' with Lewinsky because Americans don't care.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee will consider calling impeachment
hearings once it receives Starr's report. &QL;

 &HT;    PARENTS RACE THE CLOCK IN FIGHT TO FREE DAUGHTER FROM PERUVIAN
PRISON
 &HT;    With Rick McKay photos placed in the International folder on the
Cox Server.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Sept. 6 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The kind of call any parent would dread woke Rhoda
Berenson from a deep slumber one Friday evening in early December
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The woman on the other end said she was from the U.S. State
Department. Berenson's daughter, Lori, had been arrested in Peru.
The charge, she thought, was terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A second call -- this one even more disturbing -- came three
days later over a crackling line, 4,000 miles away, from a panicked
Lori.
</P>
<P>
   She said only four things: The charges were ``preposterous.''
She needed a lawyer. She wanted shoes and underwear. And, her
American Express card must be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was all some kind of misunderstanding,'' explains
Rhoda Berenson, 55, speaking in the patient tones of someone who's
told the story before. ``That the U.S. government would quickly
sort it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 998 days ago, as Berenson's number-minded husband,
Mark, quickly makes clear during an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the lives of the gregarious, middle-class college
professors has had more intrigue than a James Bond movie.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter was indeed arrested Nov. 30, 1995, at the tender
age of 26. She was accused of being an upper-echelon member of the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, or MRTA, a violent Marxist
group that was reputedly planning to kidnap members of Peru's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons hired two attorneys: Thomas Nooter, who
successfully defended a suspect in the World Trade Center bombing,
and Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But it did little good.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons call the secret military trial that followed their
daughter's arrest ``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to challenge evidence or cross-examine witnesses, Lori
was found guilty of treason on Jan. 11, 1996 by a hooded judge she
never saw.
</P>
<P>
   Their hazel-eyed baby who grew up to sing and play clarinet was
sentenced to life in the notoriously grim Yanamayo prison, perched
on a wind-swept plain high in the frigid, inhospitable Andes of
southeastern Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that powerful people have raised concerns over
a flawed judicial system: President Clinton, former President
Carter, and, most notably, Peru's former prime minister, Javier
Valle Riestra.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that a hard-nosed Peruvian president has, so
far, been unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori paints a disturbing picture of the
woman he calls ``Comrade Lucia,'' a rebel mastermind who helped run
the safe house where guerrillas had trained for their attack on the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons admit that their daughter had become somewhat of a
stranger as she stumbled toward adulthood, but insist she is not,
and never was, a terrorist, even if she had associations with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the New Yorker was part of a terrorist body or
simply a left-leaning do-gooder is no longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The burning question today is whether Lori received due process
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Berenson's plea for a new trial in a civilian court was
turned down by the Supreme Military Tribunal on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Their last and only hopes are an appeal before the Organization
of American States, or that a more-conciliatory Peruvian government
will have a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   At stake: nothing less than their daughter's life.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Helene Berenson was raised along with an older sister,
Kathy, in a spacious but nondescript apartment in the Gramercy Park
section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   She was a straight-A student at the LaGuardia High School of
Performing Arts, who often volunteered at soup kitchens and blood
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Lori was everything a parent could hope for.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to study anthropology at the prestigious
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which led to two study trips
to El Salvador at a time when Central America's civil wars were in
full swing.
</P>
<P>
   She became keenly interested in the roots of conflict, poverty
and inequality, so much so that she dropped out of school in 1989
to move to Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   She also became increasingly distant from her family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to her parents were sporadic, arriving every month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed she would eventually go back to school,''
Rhoda Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lori moved to Peru in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   She obtained accreditation letters from two left-leaning U.S.
publications and told her parents that she hoped to write about the
effect of widespread poverty on Peruvian women.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture the Berensons have of their daughter through
letters and phone calls --observer, traveler, journalist -- is very
different from the one that emerged after Lori's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian authorities say they have evidence of a 1994 meeting in
Ecuador between Lori and rebel leader, Nestor Cerpa Cartolini --
who helped invade the Japanese ambassador's house in Lima and died
when it was retaken in April 1997 -- and that it was on his orders
that she agreed to help attack the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say she never knew the man.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial was secret, it's hard to make an independent
assessment of any of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What has become clear, however, is that Lori may have been her
own worst enemy during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the proceeding, Lori was led before television
cameras to make a public statement, which is customary in terrorism
trials. Her eyes looked wild; her hair unruly. Shouting, she
appeared angry and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a crime to worry about the subhuman conditions in
which the majority of this population lives, then I will accept my
punishment,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons say her appearance was a set-up, that the
government riled Lori by holing her up with a wounded inmate prior
to her appearance. She had no comb, and was forced to yell because
there was no microphone.
</P>
<P>
   But it was like waving a flag before a bull: the judge gave her
life, even after prosecutors requested a 30-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Lori was convicted under a special judicial system created by
Fujimori in 1992 as part of his crackdown on terrorist groups such
as MRTA and Shining Path.
</P>
<P>
   Peru holds some 4,000 political prisoners accused of supporting
various rebel groups, in turn accused of having killed more than
30,000 people since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   With a 97 percent conviction rate, the system's been criticized
by human rights groups around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori's trial didn't meet international standards,'' said
Carlos Salinas, a spokesman for Amnesty International in Washington
D.C. ``Lori was never allowed to put on a proper defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Lori bides her time in a 6-foot by 10-foot cell in one of
Latin America's harshest prisons. Just last month, the Paris-based
International Federation for Human Rights demanded the facility be
closed due to inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   At 12,000 feet, the Yanamayo prison rarely gets above 40
degrees, a temperature made worse by the icy winds that whip off
Lake Titicaca. Meals, and a bucket of ice-cold water daily, are
disbursed through a hatch in the cell's door. Lori sleeps under
eight blankets, and is allowed outside only an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   At least once a month, either Mark or Rhoda Berenson makes the
4,000 mile, two-day trek to the prison -- located some 525 miles
southeast of Lima -- where they're allowed an hour with their
daughter, who's always separated from them by a screen. Each trip
costs $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   They generally bring more than 60 pounds of food and toiletries
with them at a time, and through the months they've learned the
idiosyncracies of prison guards: No pen caps or shoe laces; shampoo
must be poured into clear, plastic bags so it is visible.
</P>
<P>
   Once the guards forced Mark Berenson to unwrap hundreds of Halls
cough drops so that they could be inspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people usually count the grapes we bring in,'' he said.
``You never know what they're going to make you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Berenson said that during her most recent visit, on Aug.
22, she received a note from her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe in violence. I have never been a member of
the MRTA. I do believe in the ideals of justice and equality,'' it
read in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, say the Berensons, it's not her spirit -- but her
physical health -- that has them so worried.
</P>
<P>
   Lori has chronic laryngitis and talks in a raspy, Lauren
Bacall-like voice. She once had strep throat for seven weeks. She
suffers from digestive problems and her hands are swollen and
discolored.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Berenson's high-profile campaign to get their
daughter a new trial has taken on new urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeal before the OAS could take from two to seven
years,'' Mark Berenson said. ``We don't have that long, because
Lori doesn't have that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Berenson, who says he's 56 going on 100, recently left his
job as a statistics professor at Baruch College, where he has
taught since 1964, to devote more time to Lori's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only 168 hours in a week and I need to concentrate all
of them on Lori,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, the Berensons e-mail updates on Lori's case to more
than 1,000 groups and individuals. Every three months, they mail
updates to another 1,000 or so people.
</P>
<P>
   This summer they led dozens of activists in protesting Fujimori
as he arrived at a Manhattan hotel; this week they'll start calling
members of Congress to ask them to limit U.S. aid to Peru, which
totaled $104 million last year, unless Lori's case is reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The determined couple whose only previous protests have been
against the Vietnam War admits that a series of sudden ups and
downs have left them on an emotional roller-coaster this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In June, then-Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra suggested a
pardon for Berenson. But, Fujimori swiftly rejected that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Peru have said that Fujimori's dug in his
heels and that little movement in this case is expected until he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to some recent political maneuvering, Fujimori, who
won a second-term in 1995, may seek a third term in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Berensons, it looks like they may be the
ones who will have to dig in their heels. And they say they're
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider my daughter a hostage, and, as a father, I'll do
all I can to free her because I'm frantic,'' Mark Berenson said.
``She's the first thing I think about when I wake up, and the last
thought I have before going to sleep.''

<P>
   The Burlington Northern Railroad cuts through downtown Tupelo,
Miss., twice, at both ends, east and west, which is a matter of
about 10 blocks. The trailing wail and the crossings' clanging are
as ubiquitous as the bug songs of the cicadas and crickets that
pulse like a fever from the shade trees and the flowering crape
myrtle.
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone at noon in a silver shiver of 95 degree August
heat on Main Street, you might not feel as if you're at the center
of anything, except a train whistle. But you would be at the center
of the known upholstered universe.
</P>
<P>
   Tupelo _ if you're counting quantity, not quality of sofas, love
seats and recliners _ is the upholstered-furniture capital of the
world. There are more than 230 furniture manufacturers within a 50
mile radius, with more than 26,000 employees, producing 50,000
upholstered pieces a day.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not from Tupelo, you are there for one of two
reasons: the upholstery industry or Elvis Presley. Tupelo is his
birthplace, but today furniture is king.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th annual fall Tupelo Furniture Market was held two weeks
ago _ 1.25 million square feet of product lines on display in nine
hangarlike sheds. The wholesale market and its Mississippi
manufacturing base are the resource and last refuge for the mom and
pop retail furniture stores in America.
</P>
<P>
   V.M. Cleveland, a real estate developer from Alabama, conceived
of and built the market in 1987. ``The only way you used to find
out about Tupelo is somebody would say, `Hey, it's the home of
Elvis Presley,''' Cleveland said, sitting at his massive office
desk. ``Now, when you go places, they'll tell you Tupelo is the
furniture market. That's a pretty good feat, because he is a
well-known guy, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvis' birthplace, a prim, painted two-room white wooden shack
with a big black porch swing, still stands, at the center of a
small park and visitors' center at the end of a short road of
shacks. At 7:30 on a recent evening, a young family circled the
lawn and read the plaque.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, an Elvis-furniture cross-over. At 19, Elvis
was employed for nine months by Bozof Co., based in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worked the night shift, making metal dinettes,'' said Albert
Bozof, the owner of the company, which is no longer in business.
``Ninety cents an hour. His mother said she didn't want him working
in a place like that.''
</P>
<P>
   From the swing on the Presleys' porch, the failing light and
gentling heat might have been the summer of 1935, the year Elvis
was born, for all that appears to have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Tupelo today is a city of 35,000. By Wednesday, Aug. 19, 22,000
people had registered to attend the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got some strangers on board! Tell them what to do, Rosie!''
J.R. Pegues, a retired life insurance salesman, yelled to the woman
standing at the back of the Lunch Bunch restaurant, behind the
steam table trays of fried catfish, creamed chicken casserole,
macaroni and cheese, and hushpuppies. What to do was to pay four
and a half dollars and load your plate, empty it while you talk
Tupelo, Elvis and furniture, then make another trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You the fellow from New York? I heard about you,'' said Duane
Jones, a junior high school teacher and shuttle-van driver working
between the highway hotels and the exhibition halls. Southerners
call this kind of surveillance hospitality. Tupelo is named for a
gum tree. Being there is like stepping in gum; everywhere you go,
you stick.
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls Tupelo a ``promotional furniture'' market.
Promotional is a point of price, not style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In upholstery, it would be $150 sofas, which would be a
wholesale price, which would be $299 retail, and up,'' said Harvey
Bailey, the sales manager of Style-Line Furniture, a Tupelo-based
manufacturer that produces roughly 65,000 units annually.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Nicholson, a partner in Magnolia Furniture Industries, a
three-year-old company that employs 20 in Fulton, Miss., said: ``I
had a guy come here yesterday who wanted a group for $100. He
didn't care what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson, a young man in a brown necktie and white shirt
sleeves, gestured to three jumbo-size, Dumbo-shaped rolled-arm
furniture pieces grouped like baby elephants around a watering
hole: Magnolia's Market Special. ``Three-piece traditional _ sofa,
love seat, settee _ $299,'' he said. ``It's got a skirt on it. A
lot of people like that look right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This is cheap. And that's why people come to Tupelo. Mississippi
is home ground for the regional ``independents'' from largely rural
Southern states who can't afford the costs of a trip to North
Carolina's 7-million-square-foot October market at High Point, the
more expensive furniture on display or the minimum orders required
by the big companies exhibiting. Chances are they have no customers
at home for the high-end items either.
</P>
<P>
   The ``majors'' or the aggressive, regional discount chains like
American Furniture, based in Denver, also shop Tupelo for bargains
at the bottoms of barrels that North Carolina doesn't build
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This for me is like the garment center in New York used to
be,'' said Morton Seaman, upholstery shopping for Rooms to Go, a
Florida-based chain of 60 furniture stores that his family runs.
(They are the Seamans of Seaman Furniture Co. in New York, which
the family sold in 1987.) ``High Point is just the fancy show,''
Seaman said. ``This is where it's really done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Craft, the editor in chief of Furniture Today, an
industry publication, said: ``We're not talking about the design
leaders. This is the meat and potatoes, bread and butter, middle
market and mass market furniture we see here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Epperson, a furniture industry financial analyst at
Interstate Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C., said of the
professional wrestle for the industry title: ``North Carolina ships
more dollars. No question, Mississippi ships more units.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson of Magnolia Industries said, ``We're trying to
upgrade, every market, but you don't want to forget about the horse
that what done bring you _ is that what the old folks say?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Based on three days' observation, the horse is loved.
</P>
<P>
   Couples crowded the market. Older couples had grown children
with them _ the next generation of ownership for a store or small
chain of stores that has served its community as a furniture outlet
for generations. While wives chose the important sales features _
styles and fabrics _ husbands debated the number of units to order.
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in Mississippi, the upholstered furniture
industry is family _ buyers and sellers both. Bill Joiner, a former
Panola County deputy sheriff, started the Batesville Warehouse, a
furniture and gift store in Batesville, Miss., 14 years ago with
his wife, Linda, a former insurance company secretary, to put their
children through college. The Mississippi industry was started 50
years ago this month by one man, Morrie Futorian, a Chicago
upholsterer who was lured to Lee County, of which Tupelo is the
seat, with financial incentives by the Community Development
Foundation, an organization of local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Futorian arrived with an innovation: to build sofas and chairs
on an assembly line model like the automobile operations he had
seen in Detroit. He is known in Mississippi as the ``Henry Ford of
furniture.'' His company, the Stratford Company, continues in New
Albany. Futorian died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies today, including big players like Action
Industries, are ``cousins'' _ once or twice removed _ of Futorian's
factory, started by skilled line foremen or sales managers. At
Style-Line's 147,000-square-foot plant, where an assembly line can
push an upholstered piece through, from wood-frame assembly to
plastic shipping bag, in 15 minutes, the lesson is easy to see:
making a sofa is not rocket science. Style-Line was founded 32
years ago by Margie and Billy Anderson, who worked at Futorian's
plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people at that point were operating out of their
garages at home, their chicken houses, whatever,'' Mrs. Anderson
recalled. ``We backed a truck up to our door and ran the furniture
right off the line into the truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus was in town; it was just a question of putting up a
tent. V.M. Cleveland's original market in 1987 was a
14,000-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
   Today, behind him, on a wall of office bookshelves, is a set of
Elvis Presley figural canisters, a replica of the shack where Elvis
was born and a coffee mug with a reproduction of The Northeast
Mississippi Daily Journal's front page and the headline, ``The King
Is Dead,'' from the day he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal what he did, as a little old country boy,''
Cleveland said.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur appeared at home in the shadow of Tupelo's
favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my daddy,'' he said, pointing to a photograph of a man
in overalls and six children, hanging below a set of Elvis
Presley's first four Sun label singles. ``He was a fix-it guy, sort
of a shade-tree mechanic. As you can see, we were very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years ago, Cleveland moved to the big city _ Tupelo.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Bish, who was at Cleveland's market this year, said, ``We
like the night life here.'' Bish and his wife, Wendy, were shopping
for Lake Road Furniture, their store in Meadville, Pa. ``The only
thing I don't like is the $4.50 rum and Cokes,'' he said. ``Back
home, at our Days Inn, they're $2.70.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from a small town,'' he explained.

NEW TITLE ON THE CUTLASS EDGE OF SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn.)   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When your dramatic palette is limited, pirates are a fairly good
bet. As long as you stick to the accepted ``Treasure Island'' ideas
about how they're supposed to dress (earrings, tattoos, beards,
rough-hewn prosthetic limbs) act (crude, jolly, brutal) and speak
(``Yarrrr!!!!''), you can swashbuckle your way through a story
without too much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, swashbuckling is a theater of broad
gestures, and sword-fighting spectacles on the high seas can
succeed on the basis of sheer kinetic energy. It worked when silent
films made the transition to sound _ directors didn't really know
what they were doing with dialogue, but Errol Flynn and Basil
Rathbone sure looked great dueling on the mast. And audiences loved
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it is with interactive drama. Three-dimensional modeling and
animation software is just barely good enough to make
character-driven games. But no one knows how to direct them. So
it's time for pirates again, this time from Cyberflix of Knoxville,
Tenn., the developer of last year's best-selling mystery adventure
set aboard a doomed ocean liner that shall remain nameless.
</P>
<P>
   This year's nautical title is Red Jack: Revenge of the Brethren,
a computer-animated tale of villainous betrayal, supernatural
curses and buried treasure. It's a coming-of-age story, of course.
With a love interest. And sword fighting. And cannonballs. And
sharks. And rum.
</P>
<P>
   The object is to uncover the traitor, revenge the great fallen
pirate, dig up the gold, get the girl and sail off into the
Caribbean sunset. It's a classic pirate yarn, driven forward by the
player's interaction with its motley cast of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of these characters would as soon slice you up
for bait as talk to you. But dialogue is an option, although a
multiple-choice format constrains the discussion. A conversational
menu consisting of (a) ``What curse?'' (b) ``Where's the map?'' or
(c) ``Can I join your crew?'' does not yield a great deal of
psychological insight. But then, these are pirates, and pirates
aren't expected to be complex, articulate or bright. All they
really need are a few colorful phrases and flamboyant gestures.
</P>
<P>
   And virtual actors are getting very good with body language. You
can see them breathe. They can do all sorts of complex things with
their eyebrows and the corners of their mouths. You can see subtle
shifts in stance and facial expression as these characters make up
their minds. You can see them in a state of distrust, or doubt, or
barely contained anger. These puppets are really starting to learn
how to act.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, the puppeteers are learning how to manipulate a more
complicated set of strings. For digital characters, the
interpretation usually done by actors becomes the director's
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I become a choreographer,'' said Steven McBride, a character
animator who studied movement at the American Repertory Theater and
now works as Cyberflix's in-house dramaturg. ``I'll set every
single dance step so you can see how they're thinking _ there might
be a blink, a grimace or the raising of a brow just prior to their
utterance. That's the difference between theater and dealing with
animated characters. You have to go from the outside in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' McBride said. ``I kind of dug back to a really
old set of theories _ Francois Delsarte. He basically developed a
system which lent itself well to gestural work. If you see a
character whose elbows are away from the body _ like, you see this
with a lot of football players, where their elbows are way out from
the body _ it shows a confidence. I guess the reason Delsarte's
been ridiculed so much is because obviously a theater or acting
based on gestures will lend itself to melodrama _ it's all
external. But it's very handy when you're flipping from the voice
actors to these digital puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems counterintuitive that this highly technological medium
should lean so heavily on 19th-century dramatic techniques. But
when actors aren't sentient, the Method doesn't cut any ice. It's
no accident that the most compelling characters in the virtual
world are silent or minimally vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Mario and Lara Croft are the digital world's Charlie Chaplin and
Mary Pickford _ they are operating in a medium that has yet to find
its technological feet. And until computer games can muster truly
powerful artificial intelligence, natural language capability and
digital voice synthesis, their characters will be marionettes
attached to strings of gestural instruction code.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some Stanislavskian programmer will be drilling
digital actors to tap into their demons. But for the moment, we
have swashbuckling digital pirates. Delsarte's ghost is rattling
the machine. And somewhere, Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are
smiling.  &QL;

WALL STREET JITTERS AND THE HOME DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About to buy a place to live, and the stock market's
roller coaster ride is giving you indigestion? (And a smaller nest
egg?) Or perhaps you're the victim of mid-deal panic? To close or
not to close, that is the question.
</P>
<P>
   Buying property these days is like playing a hot game of poker.
Two months ago, you were loaded. But in the last six weeks, some of
you have lost almost all of your gains for the year, and others are
under water.
</P>
<P>
   So what if you're about to hand over a good portion of your
assets for a down payment and to pledge another chunk of your
income for the next 30 years on a house or apartment? Maybe now you
think you're paying too much for it. Or maybe you think that with
the stock market's woes, you can get it cheaper through strategy:
using the seller's possible panic to drive the price down.
</P>
<P>
   No one has reported falling real estate prices _ only stable
ones _ but potential buyers are already asking their lawyers when
and how to bargain more. The phrase ``going for the jugular'' has
been used by aggressive bargainers more than once in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the experts are advocating reneging on deals in the
face of stock-market volatility. It all depends on your sense of
the market _ and how much you love the property. But they say there
is almost always a way out, if you want or need one, up to the very
day of the closing.
</P>
<P>
   To the experts _ real estate lawyers _ buying a place is a
series of choices, a series of times to walk away from the table.
As the process evolves from first sight to closing, getting out
gets more difficult. But be careful, said Thomas Higgins, a partner
in a midtown firm. ``There's a downside to coming in and acting
like a rug merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   One man buying a $2 million apartment on Central Park West
recently got cold feet, agents familiar with the deal said. He got
out the expensive way: he left his $200,000 deposit behind. That's
always an option.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Siegler, head of co-op practice at Stroock &AMP; Stroock &AMP;
Lavan, said that most real estate contracts these days have a
clause that protects the buyer against liability beyond his
deposit. Although some sellers want to force a buyer into going
through with the deal _ or paying damages _ that's usually not in
the cards.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously, giving up the deposit is a costly option _
especially for a would-be buyer whose portfolio isn't what it used
to be. But it might not be necessary. The loss of a major chunk of
your assets from the stock market may excuse you from a deal if you
show proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, a lot of people don't have to worry about getting
out of a deal,'' said Mark Zimmerman, a midtown real estate lawyer.
``When the bank approving the mortgage, or the co-op board, takes a
look at a vastly changed financial statement, they may take the
decision out of your hands. They'll turn you down.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest, who are feeling queasy and want to know what
their options are, the lawyers give the following advice, depending
on what stage of the transaction you have reached.
</P>
<P>
   STAGE 1: BEFORE THE CONTRACT IS SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   If your offer has been accepted, but the contract has not been
signed by both buyer and seller, you can get out of the deal by
telling your lawyer to stop the process. ``The best way to get out
of a deal in the midst of a turbulent market is by not getting into
one,'' said Eric Davis, a real estate lawyer in New York and New
Jersey. Davis advises patience. It's unlikely that prices will rise
now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you still love the apartment, or the brownstone, or the
country cottage, Stage 1 is probably the WORST time to renegotiate
the price, Higgins said. ``At this stage, if you already have
agreed on a price, if you start backtracking, the seller, who can
still get out of the deal, may say, `Why would I want to deal with
this person?' _ and pull out of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to wait until . . .
</P>
<P>
   STAGE 2: AFTER THE CONTRACT IS SIGNED
</P>
<P>
   When drawing up a contract in these volatile times, try to
convince the seller to accept as many contingencies as possible:
ways to get out of the deal with your deposit returned intact.
``Make sure your lawyer puts in enough exit clauses _ a mortgage
contingency, an inspection contingency,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   One man was buying a $300,000 three-story Colonial-revival house
in Montclair, N.J., Higgins said. He had a structural, or
inspection, contingency. If an inspector found any problem he
deemed to be structural, the buyer could get out of the deal. But
the man didn't want to get out of the deal. He wanted to
renegotiate. So when the inspector found a crack in a main beam _ a
crack that had been there for decades _ he got about $15,000 worth
of concessions, including a price reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But there is risk. The seller may challenge the report, although
lawyers agree that when a hitch comes so late in the process, the
seller will usually give in or _ if the object is really to get out
of the deal _ let the buyer out and look for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   If would-be buyers are confronted with substantial losses in the
stock market, the loss of a job or some other major event, they
will probably not get a mortgage commitment and, if there is such a
contingency, will get the deposit back.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City co-ops, there is another contingency: the buyer
must pass the board. Every lawyer and real estate broker has
stories of buyers with cold feet deliberately blowing the board
interview. Siegler told of one couple who ``dressed
inappropriately, like in jeans'' for the formal meeting. They were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said that ``legitimately, if someone has suffered big
losses, when they tell the board, the board will probably be
uncomfortable enough to reject them.''
</P>
<P>
   STAGE 3: GETTING OUT AFTER THE DIE IS CAST
</P>
<P>
   What if you want to get out after the contract is signed, the
mortgage has been granted and (in New York) you've passed the board
interview? Now you're in trouble. Most lawyers agree that almost
the only way to get out at this stage is by forfeiting the deposit.
Zimmerman, the lawyer, said that at the closing you must sign an
affidavit certifying that your financial position is the same as it
was when you filled out your loan application.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've just lost a million in the stock market and mention
this at the closing, you may get out of buying the apartment,'' he
said. ``The bank will probably take away their mortgage. But unless
you have enough left to take out your checkbook and write a check
for the whole amount, you'll probably kiss your deposit goodbye.''

THROW ANOTHER PIZZA ON THE BARBY!  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You're the master of the grilling universe. You
conquered the Weber long ago. You own three different barbecue
aprons given to you by grateful family members, and in the back
yard you are armed at all times with an array of long-handle
specialty tools. You are fluent in hickory chips, starter chimneys,
grilling baskets and the instant-read thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, grilling veterans, to a new frontier: grilled pizza.
America's favorite meal-on-a-crust has landed on the mainstream
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Trust us. This is going to be a major hit at your Labor Day
get-together or at tailgate parties. It just takes a little
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the beauty part: You can make grilled pizza in many ways
from scratch, with frozen dough or with dough made in your bread
machine. You can even use a premade baked pizza shell. Or _ stretch
that boundary even further _ bake a premade fresh pizza on the
barby.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
From the ground up &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with scratch, because in many ways it's the most
delicious, creative and satisfying. The recipes for Pizza Dough and
Grilled Pizza Margarita are adapted from ``Cucina Simpatica,'' a
1991 cookbook by the pioneering couple who invented grilled pizza,
a couple of Rhode Island restaurateurs named Johanne Killeen and
George Germon. Their Al Forno restaurant in Providence is the
original home of grilled pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The dough is not complicated. You can make it up to 24 hours
ahead of time and let it rise the first time in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled Pizza (Bread Machine Version) is from Laura Brody, who
adapted a Killeen-Germon recipe for her ``Pizza, Focaccia, Flat and
Filled Breads from Your Bread Machine: Perfect Every Time.'' Brody
says grilling pizza takes a little practice and patience, and don't
worry about making perfect circles of crust. It's free-form time.
</P>
<P>
   Her bread-machine dough can be made up to three days ahead of
time, stored in a large plastic bag in the refrigerator, or frozen
for up to three months, then defrosted still wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   You can grill almost any pizza dough as long as it is rolled out
very thin, she notes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Buy dough, top it yourself &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy frozen dough to grill. Count on letting it thaw
in the refrigerator for at least one day. Italian delis often sell
frozen pizza dough.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Furano, who co-owns Guido's Deli in Mesa, Ariz., with his
cousin Mark Guido, says grilling pizza is not too hard. He points
out that you can do grilled meats, then the dough, then combine the
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally do whatever you want to grill,'' Furano
said. ``A grilled chicken pizza with a pesto sauce is fabulous. Or
use fresh mozzarella. There are a lot of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal favorite combination is grilled chicken pizza with
roasted red peppers and pesto. Are you hungry yet?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Prefab crusts &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rummaging around in the supermarket will yield a number of
prefab pizza crust choices. The latest ones we've seen are
individual-size discs packaged several to a box, perfect for
teenagers to top and shove into the toaster oven. Donna Rodnitzky's
``The Lowfat Grill'' suggests using tandoori-style naan, a type of
Indian bread (look for it at Asian stores), for crisp
individual-size pizza bases to grill. They crisp up well, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bobolis have become so popular that some stores have their own
house brands. A couple of grill marks on any of these pizza bases
adds a lot of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't set them on fire. The key to pizza-grilling success
is to keep an ever-watchful eye on it. Pizzas heat very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe for Grilled Mexican Pizza is from LHJ Online, the Web
site (www.lhj.com) of ``Ladies Home Journal'' magazine. (Check out
the ``Inside the LHJ Kitchen'' area for the RecipE-mail service
that sends a new recipe every day.)
</P>
<P>
   This pizza uses a packaged 12-inch thin crust, topped with an
avocado-lime juice mixture and tomatoes, pepper-Jack cheese, bacon
and sliced green onions. Of course, you could put these toppings on
your own homemade crust, if you wish. Or switch those toppings onto
a Boboli.
</P>
<P>
   Your mouth is watering now, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
On the grill &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owner Patrick McAvoy of Take Me Bake Me, which specializes in
ready-to-cook-at-home meals In Phoenix, has started barbecuing
ready-made pizzas as well as ready-made lasagnas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several ways to do it,'' McAvoy said. ``Our way is
different. We take the fresh dough, which is on a thermal platter,
and put that right on the grill. That's one way. You can also
parbake them, then grill them straight up; or use a pizza stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The two keys to grilling ready-made pizzas are a lid for the
grill and indirect heat. Because ready-made pizzas are already
loaded with toppings, it's trickier to move them around. You also
can't put them directly over the fire.
</P>
<P>
   With a dual-burner gas grill, McAvoy recommends turning both
burners on high and then putting the lid down for about 10 minutes
to preheat. Turn one of the burners off, and turn the other down to
medium (about 425 degrees). Put the pizza on the thermal platter
over the turned-off burner. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes.
That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbecue works like a convection oven,'' McAvoy said.
``The key is no peekies. You peekie, you let the heat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaming is also a bad thing. If you set the thermal pan, which
includes cardboard in its composition, right over direct heat, it
will catch fire. McAvoy's granddaughter learned this the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   To grill pizza with charcoal, build the fire on one side and put
an aluminum pan on the other side. The area over the aluminum pan
becomes the cool side.
</P>
<P>
   Parbaked pizzas are much easier to transfer, although you still
don't want to roughhouse them, McAvoy says. To parbake a loaded
ready-to-go pizza, put it on a pizza screen, which has holes in the
bottom to let air crisp up the crust. Put your pizza in a
425-degree oven for three to five minutes, then pull it out. The
outside should be set, and the crust won't rise much more, if at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it cool off,'' McAvoy advised. ``Then you can take it and
grill-mark it and barbecue it the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pizza stones also can be used on the barbecue grill to ensure
that crisp crust. However, you must be careful not to put it on a
hot grill, McAvoy cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put it on a cold grill and fire it up,'' he said.
``You put it on a hot grill, it's going to crack. It has to be
heated up.''
</P>
<P>
   We believe other ready-made pizzas in deli cases, such as the
ones in Trader Joe's stores, could be barbecued per McAvoy's
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled pizza allows endless options for personal expression.

</P>
<P>
   Pizza Dough
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 cup olive oil for brushing and drizzling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 cups shredded Fontina cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Pecorino
</P>
<P>
   Romano cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups canned or fresh tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch basil
</P>
<P>
   To prepare Pizza Dough. Place the olive oil and a brush in a cup
with a pour spout, and assemble all the topping ingredients on a
platter to take to the grill.
</P>
<P>
   When dough is ready; divide it into 4 equal pieces. On large,
oiled cookie sheet, spread and flatten 1 piece of dough with your
hands or a rolling pin into a 10- to 12-inch free-form round, 1/8-
inch thick. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle;
the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even
thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Place dough on grill rack 3 to 4 inches above heat. Within a
minute the dough will puff slightly, underside will stiffen, and
grill marks will appear. Using tongs, flip the crust over.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter
one-quarter of garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon
one-fourth of tomatoes over the cheese. Do not cover the entire
surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with
1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Using tongs, rotate pizza frequently for even browning, checking
underside often. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the
cheese is melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with
about 8 basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired. Repeat
with remaining dough and topping ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Work Time: 10 minutes plus about 2{ hours rising time for dough.
Total time about 20 minutes per pizza plus about 2{ hours rising
time for dough.

Pizza Dough &QL; 
(From ``Cucina Simpatica'' by Johanne Killeen and George Germon)
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fine-ground white cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Dissolve yeast in the warm water with sugar. After 5 minutes,
stir in salt, cornmeal, whole-wheat flour and oil. Gradually add
all-purpose flour, stirring with a wooden spoon until a stiff dough
has formed. Place the dough on a floured board, and knead for
several minutes, adding only enough additional flour to keep dough
from sticking.
</P>
<P>
   When dough is smooth, transfer to a greased bowl. To prevent a
skin from forming, brush top of dough with additional olive oil,
cover bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in warm place, away from
drafts, until doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punch down dough. Knead
dough several times on lightly floured board. Return dough to bowl;
cover and let rise 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Punch down dough. If sticky, knead in a bit more flour. Use to
make pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can mix this and let it rise the first time in the
refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Bring to room temperature before
final rising and shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Makes enough dough for 4 12-inch pizzas.

Grilled Pizza with Bread-Machine Crust &QL; 
(From ``Pizza, Focaccia, Flat and Filled Breads from Your Bread
Machine'')
</P>
<P>
   For the dough:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely ground cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water, plus 3 or more additional teaspoons if necessary
</P>
<P>
   To finish the pizza:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mixed fresh herbs, such as basil, thyme, oregano and
chervil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded soft cheese, such as fontina
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   6 oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, cut into quarters
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place all the dough ingredients (yeast, flour, cornmeal, salt,
olive oil, water) in the machine, program for Dough, Basic Dough,
or Manual, and press Start, adding the extra water if necessary to
make a soft dough that forms a relaxed yet discrete ball.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat a gas grill or start a charcoal fire. Place the rack 3
to 4 inches above the coals. At the end of the final cycle,
transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface and use your
hands (or a rolling pin) to push and flatten the dough into a rough
10- to 12-inch circle without a lip. Or divide the dough in half
and make 2 smaller circles. This is a free-form pizza(s); don't
make yourself crazy trying to get the circle(s) perfectly round. An
even thickness is more important than an even edge.
</P>
<P>
   Lay the dough on the grill and let it cook for 1 minute, or
until it puffs slightly and the underside stiffens and grill marks
appear. Use a wide spatula or tongs to turn it over and place it on
the side of the grill (off the direct heat). Quickly brush the top
with half of the 3 tablespoons of oil and distribute the garlic,
herbs and cheeses over the top. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and
finally drizzle on the remaining oil. Slide the pizza back to the
middle of the grill and continue cooking; rotate the pizza to
assure even cooking. The pizza is done when the cheese has melted,
about 5 to 6 minutes. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 to 3 large servings or several more appetizer servings.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Instead of heavy sauces or lots of cheese, keep
toppings light and fresh for grilled pizzas, says Chris Bianco of
Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix. Think of it as a flatbread with
toppings.
</P>
<P>
   Just olive oil, rosemary and salt on a piece of grilled pizza
dough makes a wonderful appetizer. Or you can add two or three
tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs or two or three teaspoons of
dried herbs to pizza dough before cooking. You also can add roasted
garlic to the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some pizza toppings you won't find on a big chain's

HANDLE PIZZA DOUGH WITH TLC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Start driving down the road to grilled pizza:
</P>
<P>
   - To prevent the dough from sticking, be sure the grill is clean
and then brush oil on the grill and the dough, says Chris Bianco of
Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   - When using fresh dough, roll or pat it out by hand. Make it
thin and even with no rim. The thinner it is, the crispier it will
be. You can move rolled discs of dough to the grill on cookie
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   - The dough will rise if it is outside in the heat for any
amount of time. So, you might want to start with your pizza dough
on the cold side, suggests co-owner Pete Furano of Guido's Deli in
Mesa. Note: Refrigerating dough, covered, will retard rising.
</P>
<P>
   - Whole-wheat pizza dough works well on the grill because it has
less protein and is a bit less stretchy, Bianco says.
</P>
<P>
   - Smaller individual pizzas about as big as your palm are easier
to handle at first, Bianco suggests. They are easier to turn, less
likely to tear or develop holes and convenient to eat. After a few
of them, you should be able to handle a bigger 10-inch pizza
easily.
</P>
<P>
   - Have all your ingredients ready. Bianco suggests shredding
cheese on the finest holes of the grater so it will melt more
readily and chopping ingredients finely, except such things as
Gorgonzola crumbles or fresh greens.
</P>
<P>
   - Meats such as sausages and heartier vegetables such as
mushrooms should be cooked ahead, because the cooking time for the
pizza is so brief, Furano notes.
</P>
<P>
   - If your grill can be moved up or down, crank it up four or
five inches over the hot fire before you start. Turn one side of
your gas burners off so you have a hot side and a cool side to work
with. If you have a charcoal fire, put a disposable aluminum pan on
one side of the coals to block the fire and serve as the cool side.
</P>
<P>
   - Transferring the dough to the grill can be tricky, because
once it has landed on the hot grids it's going to stay in that
position until the bottom stiffens and you can turn it. Use both
hands to pick up each disc from the platter and put it on the
grill. Go slowly and you'll get the hang of it.
</P>
<P>
   - Bubbles may appear on the top of the dough as the bottom
heats. If you want, you can mash them down with a spatula.
</P>
<P>
   - Use tongs to lift the disc of dough and peek at the bottom.
When the grill marks are dark enough for you, flip it over, brush
the top side with olive oil, and keep peeking underneath at the
grill marks to ensure the dough doesn't burn.
</P>
<P>
   - Avoid charring by paying attention. Keep checking the dough
for grill marks. Slide the dough onto the cool side when necessary.
Pizza dough or Boboli crusts can go quickly from dark brown to
burned.
</P>
<P>
   - When both sides are marked, pull the disc onto the cool side
and sprinkle on some or all of the toppings, such as cheese or
things that are important to heat.
</P>
<P>
   - If you add cheese, put the lid down briefly to melt it and
attain the smoky flavor, Furano says. This should take about four
minutes. Otherwise, you don't have to put the lid down.
</P>
<P>
   - Use tongs to slide finished pizzas off the grill onto a
serving platter or individual plates.
</P>
<P>
   - If you're making several pizzas, it's useful to have a helper
who can sprinkle on additional ingredients after you've done the
crusts and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   - Have your guests assembled and ready to eat, because grilled
pizza is at its best right off the grill. However,grilled pizza is
still delicious when served at room temperature or reheated hours
later. &QL;

   The Microsoft Muse
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to dominate world markets. High-level intrigue.
Manipulation of the justice system. Executives talking about
``killing'' competitors.
</P>
<P>
   These are the general themes of two new books inspired by the
business dealings of Microsoft Corp. And only one of them is
classified as fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulterior Motives,'' by Daniel Oran, a former Microsoft
programmer, is the story of murder and political intrigue at a
Seattle-based software giant named Megasoft. The book (Kensington,
$22.95), which hit stores last month, focuses on the political
ambitions of Megasoft's power-hungry chief executive, who will stop
at nothing in his effort to dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
   Oran, 33 years old, is the one-time inventor of the Start button
on Windows 95, but several years ago traded his programming prowess
for a pen. He said he based his character loosely on a mix of Bill
Gates and Ross Perot. So, does Megasoft wind up taking over the
world?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to give away the end,'' said Oran, who lives in
Cambridge, Mass. ``Let's just say he's thwarted.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any confusion, that's the work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction book, ``The Microsoft File: The Secret Case
Against Bill Gates,'' (Times Books, $25.95) came out just this
week. It purports to take readers into the ``inner sanctum'' of
Microsoft, to show that its top executives manipulated markets and
crushed competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Wendy Goldman Rohm, a writer who has covered the
high-tech world for over a decade, relies on discussions with
Microsoft employees and competitors, internal documents from
Microsoft, and private e-mail messages between Microsoft
executives, including one in which a vice president writes to Gates
that they have to be prepared to ``kill'' the competition,
(speaking figuratively, of course).
</P>
<P>
   Her conclusion: Microsoft set out to crush competing operating
systems with the aim of establishing an absolute monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rohm's publisher concedes that in some cases the author
quotes sources who requested anonymity, which critics of the book,
including, not surprisingly. Microsoft, may seize on as a reason to
dispute its conclusions. ``It makes things dicey,'' said Will
Weisser, publicity manager for Times Books, a division of Random
House, referring to the anonymous quotes. ``But she stands behind
them and we stand behind her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dicey'' isn't the half of it, according to Microsoft.
``Bookstores will want to position this book in the fiction
section,'' said a company spokesman, Greg Shaw. He said Ms. Rohm
gave Microsoft little opportunity to present its side of the story.
``It's one-sided,'' he said. ``It's a rehash of tired
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Someone Says Nice Things About Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Under the word ``Monopoly'' in the dictionary, Richard McKenzie
and William Shughart don't believe there should be the Microsoft
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's activities have not hindered competition in the
software market, the two economists write in the fall issue of
``Independent Review: A Journal of Political Economy,'' which is
published by the Independent Institute, a nonprofit research
organization in Oakland, Calif. McKenzie and Shughart conclude, in
fact, that it is the Justice Department, not Microsoft, that is
``squelching competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair write that Microsoft cannot afford to restrict output
and raise prices, as a monopoly would be expected to do, because
competition would immediately jump in to take away the business.
Further, they say it is illogical for Microsoft to raise prices for
its operating system, because then it could not attract customers
to its Internet browser, which is bundled with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its market pricing and product development do not square with
those of a monopolist,'' write McKenzie, a professor at the
University of California at Irvine, and Shughart, a professor at
the University of Mississippi. Their article can be found on the
Independent Institute's site at www.independent.org.
</P>
<P>
   No Paper Chase
</P>
<P>
   Applicants hoping for admission to the Sloan School of
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had better
know their way around the World Wide Web. If not, the admissions
staff will not be admitting them; in fact, they won't even look
over their applications.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Sloan is apparently the first graduate business
school to accept only applications submitted over the Internet.
Sloan officials said their motive in mandating online applications
was not so much to ensure that applicants would be tech-savvy as to
save space and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our traditional application process, we printed and mailed
30,000 applications,'' Rod Garcia, Sloan's director of admissions,
said in a statement available on the Sloan Web site
(web.mit.edu/sloan/www). He called the new system a ``significant
step'' in eliminating ``all the paper waste and postage and mailing
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The online application program, effective for the fall class of
1999, works through a process called Grad Advantage
(www.gradadvantage.org). Developed by John Pyrovolakis, an MIT
graduate, the process allows an applicant to set up a
password-protected folder and fill out the forms a little at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   He or she can submit the final application when ready and use
the basic information to apply to some of the other 40
participating graduate schools, without having to retype the data.
</P>
<P>
   At least one part of the process still is old-fashioned.
Decisions on applications will be sent through regular mail,
meaning applicants still will have to sweat it out by the mailbox
for the good (or not so good) news.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Small Book Publisher
</P>
<P>
   What do you get when you cross the printing press with the Palm
Pilot? The answer is Peanut Press, a fledgling publisher with a
novel idea for presenting the printed word.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut Press, based in Sudbury, Mass., is signing up
partnerships with mainstream publishers to make their books
available for the Palm Pilot. Among others, Peanut Press has
reached an agreement with Tor Books, publisher of such successful
science-fiction authors as Vernor Vinge and Orson Scott Card.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of presenting books on a PDA _ Puny Digital Assistant _
may itself sound like a bit of science fiction, but there already
are several Web sites that provide public-domain books for
downloading into the Palm Pilot. Peanut Press is trying to build on
that by going after books not yet in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reichelt, who co-founded Peanut Press along with fellow
computer scientist Jeff Strobel at the beginning of 1998, said the
books would be for sale for downloading ``this fall.'' He insists
there is plenty of room on the Palm Pilot screen to display text in
a readable fashion. ``It's the width of a magazine column,''
Reichelt said. ``Your eye can take it in quickly; it's an awful lot
of fun to read books.''
</P>
<P>
   The screen may get more reader-friendly still. The new Palm
Pilot, code-named ``Razor'' thanks to the fact that it will be only
1/3 inch thick, is slated to be able to support a new color LCD
screen. The new models, which are due out in November, reportedly
will have 4 megabytes of memory and a rechargeable lithium-ion
battery.
</P>
<P>
   So what's up next for the ever functional Palm Pilot: software
that will enable it to go out for groceries, wash the family dog,
and baby-sit the kids?

CHEAP PC'S: Winners and losers 
By Kirk Ladendorf  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.: The company that makes the operating system for
90 percent of the world's PCs sells more software as more computers
are sold. The price of the software does not vary with the cost of
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Online service providers: More new computer users means more
online connections to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers: They can buy more computer for less money than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.: Still the biggest, strongest company in electronics
hardware, but its fat profit margins may be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Component makers: Makers of video cards, audio cards and
hard-disk drives already are moaning about having to live with
lower prices and skinnier profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Inefficient PC makers: Those companies that can't drive down
costs are going to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers: With margins cut to the bone, big retailers like
CompUSA are going to have to make money on peripherals, service and
warranties.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer: It and a few other giants will cut costs to the
bone and sell more machines. They can still make money on high-end
server computers and services.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer: The company may have the lowest costs in the
industry, and it sells its machines for far more than the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   Small clone makers: They will continue to sell lots of machines.
Many consumers and small businesses still like the close contact
and personal service that clone makers can provide.

Dell prices PCs for performance, profits 
By Kirk Ladendorf  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. says it doesn't sell
sub-$1,000 personal computers because its customers don't want
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the company's public response to the cheap PC trend.
Privately, a high-level Dell executive says the company doesn't
want to be in the low-end PC market. The company sees little profit
in bargain-priced computers, and it intends to avoid the segment as
long as it can.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dell has targeted knowledgeable buyers who want
high-performance computers for high-end computer games, image
processing, desktop video conferencing and processing computer
video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it can avoid the consumer price wars, analysts say, but
sooner or later the battlefield will shift to Dell's
bread-and-butter _ computer sales to big businesses and government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is extremely vulnerable in this space,'' said analyst Tom
Rhinelander of Forrester Research. ``They are going to have to
fight it out in the corporate space the same way the industry has
been fighting it out in the consumer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Round Rock company will continue to try to hone
its direct sales method to squeeze out as much overhead as
possible. That allows the company to turn its inventory quickly and
to offer the latest technology, often before its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That also means that Dell moves to higher-performance computers
faster than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials acknowledge that the sub-$1,000 market is
sizable, but they hope that today's customers for low-end computers
graduate to higher-priced systems when they buy their second
computers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell has prospered as other PC makers have been buffeted
by the switch to sub-$1,000 computers. Compaq, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard have blamed lower PC revenues in recent quarters on
the cheap computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell tested the market for low-cost computers in the early 1990s
when it tried to sell them through the king of discount, Wal-Mart,
and four other chains. After four years of disappointing profits,
Dell retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dell sells higher-cost server computers to Wal-Mart. The
nation's biggest retailer uses the servers to let customers see and
hear samples of videos and compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has not totally ignored the trend toward lower-cost
machines. Last Monday, the company said it was making computers
using a version of Intel Corp.'s Celeron chip. That PC, a Dell
Dimension model, would sell for about $1,399, including a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The lower price means the average price of a Dell computer will
continue to drop. The average cost of a Dell PC has fallen from
$2,700 a year ago to $2,400 now. In the same time, the average cost
of a PC sold in a store dropped from $1,424 to $1,141.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials say the company is more competitive on the
low-cost end than it may appear.
</P>
<P>
   They note that most Dell home systems include a 17-inch color
monitor. Most low-cost system prices don't include the monitor,
which retails for $300 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also ships its base-model desktop units with 64 megabytes
of dynamic random access memory, compared with 32 megabytes for
many competitors. More memory can speed computer performance for
handling some information-intensive software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' says David Hood, Dell's vice president and
general manager for the home systems business, ``is that PCs at
every price deliver more performance for the dollar than ever
before. The challenge for consumers is to look behind the pricetag
and understand if the PC's technology will keep up with their
current and future needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Dell is far more insulated than nearly any
other computer maker from the low-cost computer trend, because of
its large base of business customers and performance-hungry
consumers who are willing to pay more for high-performance
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate customers tend to prefer name brands and
well-established service relationships when they buy computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also is increasingly relying on sales of server and
high-end workstations to bolster its profit margins. In its fiscal
year that ended in January, enterprise systems, as the company
calls them, accounted for 11 percent of the company's $12 billion
in sales. So far this year, server computers account for 12 percent
of Dell's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But if the low-end price segment continues to grow, analysts
say, Dell eventually will have to join the fray as business
customers start becoming more interested in low-cost machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is enjoying higher profit margins because they are
playing on the high-end of the market,'' said analyst Cody Acree
with Southwest Securities. ``You are not going to be able to sell a
corporate PC for $2,500 and a consumer PC for $1,000, and they both
do essentially the same thing. Eventually, the corporations balk at
that price difference, or your competitors go to your corporate
customers.''

Lower-price PCs put pressure on industry 
By Kirk Ladendorf  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mark Martich set out to replace his 6-year-old
home computer this spring and wound up in the middle of the biggest
trend to hit the personal computer industry in years.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a PC for $499.
</P>
<P>
   While it wouldn't meet the demands of gamers or graphics
designers, the machine does what Martich wants: word processing,
Internet browsing and handling a small database of business
contacts. He may also use the computer in a sideline business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a box that was pretty much all I needed,'' said Martich,
a sales manager for a truck dealership. ``I'm not a computer geek,
but when I priced it out, I couldn't find any holes.''
</P>
<P>
   His new PC _ purchased from N.C.S. (formerly The Neighborhood
Computer Store), a small store in Austin _ didn't include a monitor
(he already had one) or a separate video accelerator card, which
can speed graphics software performance.
</P>
<P>
   PC buyers like Martich, motivated more by price than by the
flashiest technology, represent an industry turning point,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sub-$1,000 PC is as important to the computer industry as
the invention of the Model-T Ford,'' which brought the automobile
into the mass market, said analyst Michael Gale, director of brand
management for the IntelliQuest market research firm in Austin.
``It becomes a non-geek buy. Any human being can buy a computer
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reshaping the whole industry,'' said Tom Rhinelander,
an analyst with the Forrester Group of Cambridge, Mass. ``We are
going to look back to the Windows 95 launch (in 1995) as the height
of the PC world, because people cared about something as stupid as
an operating system and were willing to pay high prices for
computers. That hobbyist mentality is no longer what drives the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale and other analysts say this shift may be permanent. Once
buyers have experienced low prices, they are unlikely to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   The change is already causing problems in the PC industry, and
the problems could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers competing in the market of PCs that cost under
$1,000, such as Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston, have reported
weaker profits, as have chip makers such as Intel Corp. and
chip-equipment makers such as Applied Materials Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers have demanded lower prices from suppliers in
order to keep their sales prices down. The tough stance on prices
is affecting component suppliers throughout the industry, ranging
from chip makers to manufacturers of hard-disk drives and video
accelerator cards.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Applied began laying off 2,000 workers around the
world, including 600 in Austin, Chief Executive James Morgan put
part of the blame on sub-$1,000 PCs. In fact, the healthiest
company in the personal computer industry, Austin-based Dell
Computer Corp., has avoided selling ultra-low-cost computers
because executives are skeptical that they can be profitable. But
Dell has adjusted to the trend, introducing a new Dimension model
last week with a base price of $1,399.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dell's reluctance to get into the low-end market, some
analysts believe PCs are following the pricing pattern common in
consumer electronics such as televisions, CD players and VCRs.
While expensive, fancy-featured versions are still available,
prices fall for more basic models with fewer bells and whistles.
Forrester Research projects that low-cost computers will lure 21
million first-time buyers into the personal computer market in the
next five years and will boost computer use in the United States
from an estimated 43 percent of households today to about 60
percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Research from Forrester shows the relationship between the cost
of a PC and market penetration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, just 13.8 percent of PC sales were in the sub-$1,000
category, with the bulk of sales in the $1,000 to $2,500 range.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, PCs costing less than $1,000 will account for 34.3
percent of the market and another 35 percent will be in the $1,000
to $1,500 range, according to Forrester's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The $499 that Martich paid is at the low end of the price
spectrum. But the average price of PCs sold to individual consumers
by retailers dropped by $501, to $1,141, between January 1997 and
June 1998, according to ZD Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The average price paid by business buyers, $1,396 in June, had
declined by 15 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for chips and other components are lower because of a
production glut and softening of demand created by the Asian
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important factor is what experts call the software
gap. Throughout the roughly 20-year history of the PC,
more-complicated software has always kept users hungry for more
power.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system was
a prime example. Many users bought more powerful computers to
handle the demands of the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the pace of improving performance in computer
hardware has far outstripped software advances. Experts say there
is little new software that would compel an average computer user
to buy a more powerful machine.
</P>
<P>
   Some users _ engineers, technical workers and those wanting to
play the most advanced games _ will continue to require the most
advanced computer available. But most users won't have to pay
premium prices for blistering performance.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Henry, a former top product development manager for IBM
and Dell Computer, now fervently supports the part of the industry
developing new low-end basic PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's company, Centaur Technology of Austin, designs the
WinChip, an Intel-compatible processor chip that is made by
Integrated Device Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The chips sell for between $40 and $65, compared with processors
made by Intel Corp. that can cost hundreds of dollars each. Tens of
thousands have been shipped to computer makers in China and other
developing countries. Others are used by no-name clone makers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Henry believes today's low-end machines are a precursor to even
cheaper computers in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dealing with guys who are planning sub-$500 computers for
Christmas and sub-$300 computers by early next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Very low-cost machines like the one Martich bought have been
available mainly from small manufacturers, which typically have low
overhead, buy components as cheaply as possible and publicize their
wares only in small newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   N.C.S. is emblematic of some small clone makers in Austin and
around the country. The business, begun by John Hankins and his
father, Allen, moved from their homes to a small modular building
at 512 E. Oltorf St. a year ago as customer demand grew.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap PCs are becoming more available in mainstream stores.
</P>
<P>
   Micro Center, a chain of 13 computer stores based in Columbus,
Ohio, this month began selling a $399 computer under the Power Spec
label. On Thursday, PrecisionTec LLC, a maker based in Costa Mesa,
Calif., introduced its Gazelle machine for the same price, for sale
over the Internet through Egghead.com and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices don't include monitors, which usually start at
about $150. But they expand a growing sub-$500 market. Millenium
Electronics Inc., for example, in March began selling a $499
machine under the Laguna label at Sun TV &AMP; Appliances Inc. and
Frye's Electronics stores, based in California.
</P>
<P>
   PC makers have shown that they can sell millions of low-cost
computers. What hasn't been shown is whether they or their
suppliers can make much money in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., an industry giant that helped popularize
the low-cost machines to gain market share, says it re-engineered
its design and assembly processes to make a profit on low-end
machines. But analysts doubt that Compaq is making much profit on
the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales growth has slowed as lower-cost PCs have
become more popular. In the second quarter, Compaq's product sales
totaled $5.8 billion, only a subpar 6 percent more than it sold in
the same quarter the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, computer executives put on a brave face about
potential profits from their low-end models. Privately, they
confess that the industry is under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of the sub-$1,000 space is creating a lot of
havoc in the industry,'' said one marketing executive, who asked
not to be identified because he did not have permission to speak
for his company, a sizable PC maker. ``It's a thorny issue that we
are dealing with every day. The PC market is ugly and a battle.
It's not a fun business.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can't make money on the sales side, PC companies are
trying to save money on the supply side.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are insisting that makers of chips, hard-disk drives
and video cards cut their prices to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel, the most powerful and profitable chip maker, has cut
jobs and costs this year to cope with slowing revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has led the industry in making faster, more
powerful chips, was late entering the sub-$1,000 market. Only last
week did Intel bring out a new version of its lower cost Celeron
chip that analysts say can compete with those offered by AMD and
National Semiconductor's Cyrix unit. The first Celeron, released in
April, had disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, Intel's largest rival in the low-end PC business, has found
good news and bad news in that segment.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which employs more than 4,000 people in Austin, is selling
more of its Austin-made K6 microprocessors than ever, but at prices
well below its original asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of AMD's hottest chips, the K6-2 300-megahertz model,
dropped from $220 each to $120 between early June and early July,
according to the Piper Jaffray securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   AMD lost $64.6 million in the second quarter. Company officials
say they need to see higher processor prices in order to return to
profitability soon.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mike Feibus with Mercury Research in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
says the industry will take time to sort out out the new rules of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next 18 months there will be a lot of flailing while
the industry figures out what to do and how to adjust,'' he said.

FIRM FINDS NEW WAY TO USE NET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As the Internet has gone mainstream, tales of how
people are putting it to use are getting more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Take what happened at New Vision International, a $200 million
Tempe, Ariz., company that distributes nutritional supplements
around the world via a network of 700,000 salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the week of Aug. 9, and all was looking good. The company
was humming along. Plans were being finalized for a
company-sponsored convention in Las Vegas. About 3,000 distributors
and others were expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mother Nature took over. A monsoon storm dumped so much
rain on Tempe one night that the roof of the company's
50,000-square-foot warehouse and headquarters building collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Stock was damaged, and the company's computer system _ the heart
of its communications with its distributors _ went down with the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Employees worked all night to bring order back to the sudden
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Jason and BK Boreyko, who co-own New Vision,
immediately expanded their World Wide Web site, describing the
damage and cleanup efforts and reassuring distributors that orders
would be filled _ albeit a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site at www.new-vision-intl.com and at www.nviworld.com
also provided important last-minute details to the thousands of
people headed to the Las Vegas convention, which was held in late
August.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, New Vision went far beyond that important
content, adding interesting first-person accounts of what happened
as the storm hit. For example:
</P>
<P>
   New Vision employee Mike Tucker: ``I was sitting in my office,
just across from the computer room, and the ceiling began to shake.
I remember we had just installed a new air-conditioner above the
computer room and thought it might be off balance. Thinking nothing
of it, I walked around and sat back down again. My eyes widened
when the walls began to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Myra Richman said, ``They would definitely
be out of business if it wasn't for their ability to update
everybody via the computer and the Internet.'' &QL;

Doggone it, that's funny
</P>
<P>
   Our recent contest that invited readers to write in with their
examples of how things would have gone if God had used a PC for
creation has prompted several people to send in related humor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one reader sent in a list of 20 reasons why dogs
don't use computers.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the funnier (and cleaner) examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ They can't stick their heads out of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to read the monitor with their heads cocked to one
side.
</P>
<P>
   _It's too difficult to ``mark'' every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   _Involuntary tail wagging a dead giveaway when they visit porn
sites.
</P>
<P>
   _Three words: Carpal Paw Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   _Can't help attacking the screen when they hear ``You've got
mail!'' &QL;

   Q: The IBM Aptiva PC I bought last summer came loaded with
Microsoft Works (oxymoron!). I've been using it in my job as a
consultant, but it isn't easy to make labels, create databases and
perform mail merges. I am thinking about replacing Works with Word
or Office. Which would you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: To be fair, Works isn't a heavy-duty program designed for
business use. It's just an integrated suite that includes a basic
word processor, database and spreadsheet. It will do the things you
require but not as well or as efficiently as a full-fledged office
suite.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Word by itself won't solve your problem. You need to
get the Professional Edition of Microsoft Office, which includes
Word as well as Access, a really good database program. You also
might consider two other options, the professional version of the
Corel WordPerfect Suite or the Lotus SmartSuite. They also have all
the weapons any consultant could ask for. Personally, I'd probably
opt for the Microsoft suite because it's so widely used. You can
send a Word document by e-mail and be fairly confident that the
recipient also will have Word.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Windows PC with Netscape. When Macintosh users send
me graphics files as e-mail attachments, I can't use them. I can't
save the files, and Netscape won't open them in its mail program.
And sometimes, the attachments just come as garble inside the
message itself. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Macs use a different method than PCs to encode e-mail for
transmission across the Internet. However, newer versions of
Netscape are equipped to decode the Mac system, which is called
BinHex. So under normal circumstances, you should be able to open
and read attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Netscape tell me that your symptoms suggest that
the attachment either was improperly coded by the sending computer
or was corrupted during its trek through an Internet gateway.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution is to ask senders to use MIME _ rather
than BinHex _ if their e-mail program supports it. MIME is the
standard Internet protocol and the method used most often in
sending messages between PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, you might try asking the sender to
manually encode the graphic using UUencode before attaching it to
the message. They'll need a special utility for that, and you will,
too, because you'll have to decode the graphic when it arrives.
Fortunately, Uuencoding utilities are widely available as
shareware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter has a 486-DX running at 33 megahertz with 8
megabytes of RAM and a 700-Mbyte hard drive. It's running Windows
3.1. Would this system support Windows 95 or Windows 98? And if
not, would you recommend upgrading or would you recommend a newer
system?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, your trusty old machine is too underpowered for
Windows 95 or Windows 98, both of which need a Pentium-class chip
and at least 16 megs of memory to perform adequately. To bring your
system up to par, you'd have to add memory, upgrade the chip, get a
bigger hard drive and add a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   A total face-lift like that would run at least $600. You'd
probably be better off just buying a new system. For $800, you
should be able to find one with a 266 MHz chip, 32 megs of memory,
a 4-gigabyte hard drive and a 24x CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend of mine is producing a newsletter and brochures for
a community group and wants to make some backup files. However,
documents like the newsletter are too big to fit on a floppy disk.
The person doesn't have a Zip drive. So what are the options,
besides splitting the newsletter into five different documents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to compress the document using a zipping
utility. I was able to take a 2-Mbyte newsletter created on
Microsoft Publisher and get it down to less than 500,000 bytes by
using Zip-IT, a $39.95 program from Quarterdeck. The amount of
compression will depend on the kind of files you're dealing with _
some graphical images can be reduced by more than 90 percent! If
you're looking for a good shareware zipping program, try WinZip, a
perennial favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &QC;  &LR;  Create a Startup Disk for Windows 95 or
Windows 98. If your hard drive fails, you can use the disk to start
your computer, diagnose and fix common hard disk problems. Go to
the Windows Control Panel, open the Add/Remove Programs icon, tab
over to Startup Disk and follow the instructions.

PHONE COMPANIES CREATE TRAFFIC JAM ON ROAD TO INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next high hurdle for the personal computer industry is
keeping many a chip maker and computer manufacturer awake at night,
because after 15 years of building ever faster and more powerful
machines, the wizards of silicon increasingly find themselves at
the mercy of local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle is the capacity of a channel to carry signals from
one point to another, known as bandwidth. The channel in question
is the local telephone network, and as the future of computing
comes to rest more and more with the Internet, the phone companies
represent a serious bottleneck. No matter how much faster the
microprocessors and memory chips, no matter how much more efficient
the architecture of the machines, the finest computer technology
dead-ends with the phone jack in every consumer's wall.
</P>
<P>
   Computer technology gave us the Internet; telephone technology
gave us the World Wide Wait. The reason for this is rooted in vast
differences between the two industries.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing in microscopic distances, the chip makers have grown
accustomed to improving performance continually and exponentially
by finding ways to reduce the lengths of paths that electrons must
travel within silicon wafers while at the same time multiplying the
number of paths within the chips and between components. The net
result has been an enormous increase in bandwidth _ and in power.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.'s 8088 microprocessor, the brains of the original
IBM PC, could carry out about 750,000 instructions per second and
ran at a speed of 8 million cycles per second, or megahertz.
Today's Intel Pentium II processor can carry out 855 million
instructions per second at a speed of up to 450 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not moved so fast in the world of telephones. True,
digital switches and fiber optic cables have greatly expanded the
total number of calls that can be placed at any one time. But the
capacity of the typical phone line in a typical home is virtually
the same today as it was in the 1960s. Only so many electrons can
be squeezed through a copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry has long struggled to compensate for this
weakness. The first breakthrough came in the late 1970s when Ward
Christensen, an engineer with International Business Machines Corp.
and an early personal computer enthusiast, invented an
error-correction technology and released it to the public domain.
Until then, modems _ devices that enable computers to communicate
over telephone lines by converting digital signals into sounds on
one end of the call and from sounds back to digital signals at the
other end _ were largely useless because phone lines were so noisy
that the receiving modem often failed to differentiate signal from
noise.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, modem makers have made enormous strides in error
correction and in pushing ever more information through standard
phone lines. First the Hayes Corp. and later USRobotics led the way
in accelerating data transmission from 300 bits per second in the
early 1980s to 1,200, then 2,400 and on up to today's 56K modems,
which can theoretically receive 56 thousand bits per second.
</P>
<P>
   But 56K modems are limited by federal telephone rules to 53
thousand bits per second. And the erratic quality of local phone
service limits them even more.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a state of the art USRobotics 56K modem (now made
by the 3Com Corp.) can achieve a speed no greater than 26,400 bits
per second in many of the most densely populated areas of the East
Coast, including big parts of Manhattan and New Jersey, because the
local phone company, Bell Atlantic, has not upgraded its cables and
switches to the demands of high-speed data. In fact, in many
instances, it has installed technologies that compress bandwidth in
order to carry more voice calls, which coincidentally reduces the
capacity of its lines to carry data calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic customer service representative informs an
inquiring consumer that the company is not obligated to carry
high-speed data calls, so unless the customer is willing to buy a
special modem and fork over a hefty installation fee plus high
monthly charges for an ISDN (integrated services digital network)
line, he or she will be living with a maximum speed of 26,400 bits
per second, or less, for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Bell Atlantic, like the other local phone
companies, says it cannot keep up with the demand as families order
separate lines for children, fax machines and modems. Critics
respond that this says more about the corporate culture of a
regulated monopoly than it says about the nature of telephone
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the computer industry knows that pointing fingers
accomplishes nothing; at the end of the day, a lot of computer
power is still dammed up behind the modem. So the industry has
begun wooing the local phone companies with incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The carrot is a standard for ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber
line), a technology that offers simultaneous voice and data calls
at speeds up to 8 million bits per second over standard copper
wires. This technology and other flavors of digital subscriber
lines have been around for a long time, but the phone companies
have quarreled bitterly over a standard.
</P>
<P>
   So earlier this year, Compaq, Intel and Microsoft helped to form
the Universal ADSL Working Group and anointed a standard known as
G.lite (the period is pronounced ``dot''). Yet the phone companies
have not yet ratified G.lite, so the first modems will not be
available until at least well into next year, and it could take
decades for this technology to reach all American homes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the stick: building specific circuitry, known as ethernet,
into its machines to allow them to connect directly to cable modems
without a special installation. The most recent example of this is
the Apple iMac, a home-market computer that has built-in ethernet
circuitry. Ethernets are the standard networks used in businesses,
but the only use for such technology in the vast majority of homes
is to connect the computer to the phone companies' most dangerous
competition in data bandwidth _ cable television companies that
offer high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case that fails to get the local phone companies'
attention, Microsoft's chairman, William Gates, earlier this year
invested $1 billion in the Comcast cable television network, one of
the most aggressive marketers of cable modem services, while the
Bells' progenitor, AT&AMP;T, is buying TCI, the nation's largest cable
television operator and the largest stockholder of At-Home, the
leading cable modem service.
</P>
<P>
   If the local phone companies fail to make ADSL widely available
soon and at a competitive price, the computer industry is poised to
quickly embrace cable or other alternate channels. And many of
those channels will one day offer local and long-distance phone
services.

U.S. FAULTS DEPOSITIONS OF MICROSOFT'S EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a court document made public Tuesday, the
Justice Department accused top executives of the Microsoft Corp.,
including its chairman, William Gates, of ``an astonishing lack of
recall'' when they were questioned under oath for the government's
antitrust suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion, plus several pieces of new evidence to support
the government's case, were submitted to federal District Court
here as part of the Justice Department's response to Microsoft's
request that the case be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives who are stated to be the author of documents claim
not to remember writing them,'' government lawyers wrote.
``Executives who are the stated recipients of documents claim not
to remember receiving them. And both authors and recipients claim
not to know what the documents mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's new evidence was gathered by the Justice
Department in recent weeks in preparation for the trial, which is
set to begin on Sept. 23. It includes allegations that Microsoft
tried to bully several competing companies that until now had not
been mentioned in court proceedings. Among them are Intel Corp.,
Apple Computer, Real Networks, which makes video and audio software
for the Internet, and Intuit Corp., maker of Quicken accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the depositions of Microsoft executives, which are still
under way, the government said that Gates ``displayed a particular
failure of recollection,'' even though ``he is placed at the center
of key events by numerous documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief provides the first look at the government's view of
the depositions of senior Microsoft leaders in recent days. The
questioning was to have been taken in public, but an appeals court
accepted Microsoft's request that the depositions proceed in
private. Gates' three-day deposition is to end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said of the government's
lawyers: ``It's unfortunate that they have lost faith in the
substance of their case and have resorted to this kind of name
calling.'' He noted that Gates receives hundreds of pieces of
e-mail every day and so cannot be expected to remember every one of
them, especially those dating back several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief also accuses Gates and other
Microsoft executives of ``attempting to rewrite history'' in their
pretrial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust suit, filed in May, accuses Microsoft of trying to
persuade or force a competitor, Netscape Communications Corp., to
give up part of the market for browsers, the software used to
navigate the World Wide Web. It also accuses Microsoft of illegally
integrating its browser, Internet Explorer, with the Windows
operating system and then claiming that the browser and Windows
were never intended to be separate products.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the government says that effort has now gone so
far that Microsoft executives no longer even utter the word browser
``except when they slip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although browser is a term used throughout Microsoft's
documents and licenses, the industry literature, and even in the
dictionary Microsoft publishes for software professionals,'' the
brief says, ``in the interest of Microsoft's litigation arguments
it becomes a nonword. Witnesses claim they don't know what a
browser is. What used to be browsers are now simply `bits of
browsing technologies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also says that Microsoft's alleged effort to reduce or
eliminate competition from Netscape ``is part of a pattern that
includes similar discussions'' with other companies, including
Apple and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case say that the Justice Department
intends to use this new evidence to show that the initial evidence
offered to support its claims against Microsoft is standard
practice for the company. Some of the new evidence has been the
subject of news articles in recent weeks, but this is the first
time the Justice Department has indicated that it intends to use
the allegations as evidence in the trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 89-page brief charges that Microsoft tried to persuade Apple
``to withdraw its `QuickTime' software from competition with
Microsoft's `NetShow' software.'' Both products are used to receive
audio and video information from the Internet. The brief said that
Apple refused the request and added that Microsoft also tried to
coerce Apple to stop offering Netscape to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft makes a version of Internet Explorer for Apple's
Macintosh line of computers. Since Apple computers use the Mac OS
operating system, not Windows, the government argues that
Microsoft's dispute with Apple demonstrates that the browser is
obviously a stand-alone product, not a fundamental part of the
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's determination to restrict the support and
distribution of Netscape's browser by Apple is particularly telling
since Apple represents the main alternative to desktop PCs running
Microsoft's Windows,'' Justice Department lawyers wrote. ``Whatever
the relevance of Microsoft's arguments about why it wanted Windows
users also to use Internet Explorer, those arguments cannot apply
to Internet Explorer use by Apple users.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges concerning Real Networks are not as well defined
because some information in the document was deleted before it was
made public, and the department declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks, whose chief executive, Robert Glaser, is a former
Microsoft executive, also makes software that enables personal
computers to receive radio-style audio and television-style video
over the Internet. The government brief asserted that Microsoft
tried to ``coerce Real Networks'' to get out of the multimedia
software business and to withhold its technology from Microsoft's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Intuit, the brief said, ``Microsoft succeeded in
getting Intuit to agree not to support Netscape, but only after
tying Intuit's access to valuable placement on the Windows desktop
to Intuit's agreement to abandon Netscape.'' The ``desktop'' is the
Windows main screen.
</P>
<P>
   The government also asserted that Microsoft pressured Intel into
agreeing that it would no longer write software intended to enhance
the performance of Intel's microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   To all of this evidence, Murray said: ``In every case, the
government is misrepresenting Microsoft's business relationships
with other companies. We meet with hundreds of companies to make
them aware of our technology plans and to promote the tools in our
operating system and to insure that our products and their products
work well together. Microsoft has never tried to divide any market,
period.''

 Computers head list of back-to-school supplies for today's college
students  
 By Mark Clothier   
 c. 1998 Cox News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next to deciding whether to go to class on a regular basis,
picking a computer to use at college is one of the biggest
decisions a student makes.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of college students, responding to a poll
commissioned by Sprint, named the computer the most important
back-to-school item. It ranked ahead of calculators, stereos and
televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking help buying a computer often encounter a barrage
of confusing and conflicting advice. But most experts agree that
you should buy as much computer as you can afford. But, with prices
falling by the day, that may be more computer than you'd imagine.
</P>
<P>
   As a starting point, most students can spend $1,400 and get a PC
that should be more than adequate. A 15-inch color monitor will run
about $300 more.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an IBM-compatible PC, Brian Carr, assistant
director of the Georgia Tech bookstore, recommends buying at least
a 266 megahertz Pentium processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and a 2
gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintosh users, Carr recommends the iMac, with a 233
megahertz processor, 32 megabytes of RAM and a 4 gigabyte hard
drive. In both cases, he recommends a 56k bps modem.
</P>
<P>
   Carr says to buy the most machine you can, but hold off on
software purchases until you see what discount packages your school
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Tech junior Divya Gupta followed that advice and bought a
top-of-the-line IBM-clone when she started school two years ago. If
she had to do it over again, she would spend a little less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look for the best deal and don't get suckered into what's
the best thing out there,'' said Gupta, a third-year mechanical
engineering student from Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's best isn't what's necessary for school. You don't need
anything too extravagant and you don't need a top-of-the-line
model,'' she said. ``You just need something that processes fast
enough and that has a decent modem, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Dell Computers recommend checking with your
university or college before buying a computer. Most schools post
minimum technology recommendations on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   They also advise reading computer reviews in newspapers and
industry magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the company backs up the machine with a warranty and
enhances your tech knowledge with toll-free, 24-hour-a-day support.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech is one of the few local colleges with minimum
technology requirements. Emory University, like most schools,
limits itself to making recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cabot is in charge of computer support for Georgia Tech.
She said the school lets students know the minimum computer
requirements by mail and with postings on Tech's Web site by May.
</P>
<P>
   Tech also requires a standard suite of software programs. This
year's list includes Microsoft Office 98, Adobe Pagemill and
Symantec Cafe and costs about $325.
</P>
<P>
   Each year the selection changes slightly. A committee reviews
and posts any changes by March 1, Cabot said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta, 20, said she uses her computer to read course syllabuses
online, to get homework assignments and then check her answers. Her
PC also serves as a telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big help,'' she said. ``I was like, `Wow. This is
really going to be handy.'''
</P>
<P>
   A self-described pre-college tech-novice, Gupta became
well-versed enough to install a second hard drive when the software
she downloaded from the Web clogged up the first. It took her about
a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a computer and you have to use it, you tend to
play around with it, talk to people and you learn to make things
work. You get less intimidated by technology by having the
computer,'' she said. ``But still, I would never have dreamed I
could have done it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEW AND HOT
</P>
<P>
   What's new _ and expensive _ this year in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   400 megahertz Pentium processors The extra speed lets you handle
3-D graphics, digital photographs and video editing more quickly
and, thus, more practically. And Intel recently introduced a 450
megahertz chip.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium II technology for notebook computers Some of the hottest
notebooks are now just as powerful as desktop machines.
</P>
<P>
   56k modems You can download bit-laden text, graphics and image
files via the Internet much faster.
</P>
<P>
   Digital versatile discs or DVD This technology makes it possible
to run full-motion movies and high-end games on the computer.

Bass Hall so far: an opening dud, a stunning silence 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazing and memorable moments have occurred since the Nancy Lee
and Perry R. Bass Performance Hall opened in May. I have attended
orchestra concerts, a solo recital, a chamber music concert, an
opera, a ballet and ``Phantom of the Opera.'' The most thrilling
moment was hearing the Fort Worth Symphony in its first rehearsal
in the new hall in April.
</P>
<P>
   As the orchestra rehearsed that great monument of 20th-century
music, Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a whole new world opened up
for the ensemble. Perfection is still in the distance, but the
clarity and resonance in the string sections, the ease with which
the winds and brass found their balance, proved that wonderful
possibilities await.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the opening gala _ the variety show with
Carol Burnett and Frederica von Stade _ was an ill-conceived event,
the main benefit of which was to show what shouldn't happen in the
Bass Hall. New York-based producers, apparently totally ignorant of
orchestral acoustics and confident in the lack of sophistication of
Fort Worth audiences, proved that the hall can be used
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   On the amazing, unforgettable side, there was that moment during
Van Cliburn's concert with the Fort Worth Symphony, when 2,000
people saw the world's most famous pianist faint and fall flat on
his back on the floor next to the piano. Dead silence followed _
proving that this hall can be totally quiet, with no outside noise.
No one dropped a pin, but you could have heard it if someone had.
</P>
<P>
   Building a multipurpose hall was a risk _ maybe not so big a
risk as spending twice as much money to build a separate opera
house and orchestra hall, but a risk nonetheless. The verdict is
nearly but not totally complete, pending the results of the next
few seasons, particularly in ballet. But so far, we can be fairly
confident that Bass Performance Hall works.
</P>
<P>
   We'll know better as the years pass just how much the minor
inconveniences _ the bottleneck at the entrance on the ground
floor, the maze of stairs and halls _ really disturb the audience's
experience, and if the carefully engineered acoustics advance Fort
Worth as a cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its multi-use design, Bass Performance Hall appears
to be a better symphonic facility than some dedicated orchestra
halls _ including the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas.
Acoustician Christopher Jaffe's innovative adjustable ceiling is
more than just an expensive gimmick; the room picks up just the
right range of frequencies from the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Even the noisier sounds of a wind ensemble came off with clarity
and resonance in a performance by the Texas Wind Symphony. When a
gargantuan chorus joined the Fort Worth Symphony for Orff's
``Carmina Burana,'' the sound was appropriately velvety and lush.
The only problem I noticed with orchestral sound was when I sat in
the upper balcony, where the volume was noticeably lower. That part
of the hall is not for the hard of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   New York Times columnist Frank Rich, referring to the long run
of ``Phantom of the Opera'' at the hall, had a legitimate point
when he questioned the appropriateness of presenting ``one of the
aged road tours'' in a new cultural center. But the Broadway
musical (or in this case, the West End musical) is an important
20th-century art form, and Bass Performance Hall proved to be a
worthy venue that can preserve a reasonable degree of intimacy
while presenting a lavish production. It's a huge improvement over
the larger venues _ such as Fort Worth Convention Center and Fair
Park Music Hall _ where Broadway touring companies traditionally
appear, and where the sense of connection between the audience and
the actors is often lost.
</P>
<P>
   For solo recitals, an artist with lots of charisma and physical
power _ such as Van Cliburn, who presented the first solo recital
in the hall _ will come off grandly, as will a high-quality chamber
ensemble such as the Ying Quartet, which broke in the hall for
chamber music. Less powerful performers, however, may not
communicate so effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Because a room this large and grand demands a large personality
and musical excellence, it should be an appealing venue for the Van
Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2001, allowing the
artist with the big heart and big sound to show to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   The hall's elegance should also enhance the Cliburn's position
on the competition circuit. The comment once made to me by the head
of another major competition, that the Cliburn holds its opening
rounds in a room not much better than a high school auditorium,
will no longer be true.
</P>
<P>
   For opera, the situation is similar. The grandeur of the room
itself enhanced without detracting from the lively, attractive sets
for the Fort Worth Opera's production of Puccini's ``La Boheme.''
Very good voices will thrive in Bass Performance Hall, but the
less-than-great should be prepared to have every weakness exposed.
Careful casting will be essential for the opera in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet is the big question mark so far. The all-important visual
balance suffers toward the side seats; friends who sat in the
balconies tell me they heard too much stage noise during the Fort
Worth Dallas Ballet's presentation of Balanchine's ``Jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the quality of the acoustics will be pretty well
settled in the next two or three seasons, it will take longer to
tell about the architecture. Will David Schwarz's nostalgic
evocation of the past be a sore thumb and an anachronism in a
lively urban center? Or will it be a perfect symbol of respect for
the past and vision for the future? Time will tell.

 &HT;    COLUMN: The new world disorder
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new economic system has emerged in the past decade, founded on
computer technology, fueled by information, held together by an
almost religious belief in the sanctity of free markets and driven
by a deep disdain for centralized government, safety nets and any
other restraint on competition and personal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're going to see whether it holds together in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not quite the ``new world order'' that George Bush
envisioned in the late '80s. That phrase suggested a tidy little
arrangement of national governments working in unison for the
betterment of all. What we have today is something very different.
It is a new world ``disorder,'' in which countries have given up
control of their currencies to international markets and control of
their economies to international conglomerates and trading
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Business has embraced that theory as well, downsizing its work
force, outsourcing its functions _ ``re-engineering,'' as the
best-selling business books call it. Like governments, they have
sacrificed stability and control in return for flexibility and
speed. The companies that embraced the new chaos most fully have
been rewarded by skyrocketing prices on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   That new system has produced unprecedented wealth and
prosperity, particularly in the United States. Many of the
challenges that seemed so daunting in the '70s and '80s _ the
Soviet Union, unemployment, inflation, welfare reform, the federal
budget deficit _ have fallen away, swamped by the productive power
of capitalism unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   The new prosperity has also seemed to suggest that the old rules
of economics could perhaps be rewritten. In the past, capitalism
had always created inefficiencies that tended to go undetected in
the heady flush of prosperity, accumulating until they brought on a
recession. This particular expansion has gone on for so long,
however, that some economists and politicians began to voice the
heretical notion that the business cycle had been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, they mused, the combination of global competition and
instant communication were eliminating inefficiencies even as they
were created, never allowing them to accumulate to the point of
forcing a recession. Maybe, they thought, this golden age was going
to go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as it turns out, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, a rolling series of crises has exposed the
structural weakness of Japan's banking system, the mindless
extravagance that fueled Asia's ``little tigers,'' the incompetence
and corruption at the core of the Russian economy and perhaps now
the unrealistic valuations of the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that in a world in which everything's connected,
everything matters. The global economy is a system much like the
global climate, in which the beating of a butterfly's wings in
Chile could potentially touch off a hurricane in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   That butterfly can take many forms, political and social as well
as economic. We replaced a postwar system containing one very large
instability _ the possibility of nuclear war between superpowers _
with a system of many instabilities, smaller but capable of
reinforcing one another, playing off one another, compounding one
another.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the Cold War, it would have been unthinkable for
communist North Korea to fire a missile over Japanese territory.
The consequences of such an act would have been enormous. As it is,
the Korean launch Monday simply added to a growing sense that the
world is unraveling, that too many of those little instabilities
are flaring up at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In another contribution to that air of instability, the
president of the United States, greatly weakened by scandal, is
meeting in Moscow with the greatly weakened president of Russia.
The collapse of the Russian economy has produced a serious
political crisis, raising the risk that the Russian people will
soon abandon their experiment with democracy and instead seek
protection in a strong-armed government that promises to restore
national glory and self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   A similar risk haunts much of the globe, exacerbated by a
fundamental conflict between the ground rules of the new economy
and the demands of human instinct.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy has been constructed on the premise that
government guarantees of security and protection must be avoided
because they discourage personal initiative. In times of crisis,
however, that premise cannot be sustained politically. It is human
nature for people in trouble to seek security and protection and to
be drawn toward those who promise to provide it. That is how men
such as Hitler and Lenin came to power in the first half of this
expiring century, with disastrous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Russia and elsewhere are caught in a
dilemma. If they cannot provide their citizens with some assurance
of protection and assistance, they risk being replaced by people
who will. But providing that assurance will make economic recovery
much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of crisis, it is also human instinct to withdraw, to
seek a smaller, less threatening sphere in which to operate. It is
true of nations as well as individuals. In past economic crises,
that instinct has driven governments into isolationism as nations
try to insulate themselves from the troubles of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a global economy built on free trade and open
markets, a reversion to isolationism, particularly by the United
States, would erode the very foundation of our past prosperity.
Fending off that instinctive urge to withdraw will require strong
political leadership, and at the moment that is precisely what we
lack, not just in the United States, but also in Russia, Japan,
China and other important nations.
</P>
<P>
   In times of trouble, we seek a world that is comprehensible,
that offers some sense of control, that makes us feel less
vulnerable. And as we've seen, that's not the world we've created.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER TESTS LAW ON ENCRYPTION CODE  
 WEB COMPANY RIDES INITIAL-OFFERING WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Booher was hardly surprised last month when two agents
from the Department of Commerce knocked on his door in Silicon
Valley and handed him a federal subpoena. He had been expecting it
ever since he first made his data-encryption program available on
the Internet in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is investigating whether Booher's
software, which is called Secure Office and is intended to protect
the privacy of computer files by scrambling the data, violates U.S.
export law. The rules require Americans who distribute encryption
software internationally to obtain an export license; making
software available on the Internet is considered international
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Booher acknowledges that few people have downloaded the software
from his Web site at www.filesafety.com. But achieving a large
number of users was not his goal.
</P>
<P>
   Booher, a software engineer at Phase Metrics Corp. in Fremont,
Calif., who wrote the encryption program in his spare time, said he
posted the program to challenge the export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption has been a hotly debated issue in Washington lately,
with the Commerce Department, the FBI and other agencies arguing
that powerful data-scrambling programs put high-technology
espionage tools in the hands of criminals, spies and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But Booher is among the software developers who contend that
their right to write encryption code is protected by the First
Amendment and that the technology is already easily available
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether this stuff is going to exist,''
Booher said, ``but who will develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monika Wasiewicz, the Commerce Department agent in charge of the
case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Booher was supposed to testify to a federal grand jury in San
Jose, Calif., last week, but the session was canceled because too
few jurors showed up. Booher's testimony is supposed to be
rescheduled for this week.

   Web Company Rides Initial-Offering Wave
</P>
<P>
   For any curious observer of the business world who sits before
Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com in Dallas, the most pressing
question is not the state of media on the Internet or the future
direction of his company, which transmits audio and video
programming over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The question is probably: What was going through his mind on
July 16 as he watched the stock price of his company shoot from $18
to $74 before settling at $62.75, the best first day for an initial
public offering in history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, this is really, really cool,'' he remembers
thinking as he sat in the New York offices of Nasdaq and watched
the numbers ticking higher and higher. By the end of that first
day, the company's valuation exceeded $1 billion, and his personal
net worth _ on paper, at least _ rose to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been married, but I guess that feeling I had that
day was similar to what a groom would feel at the altar,'' Cuban
said. ``I've never been the No. 1 draft pick for the NFL or NBA,
either. Actually, that's probably even closer to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 40, was making the rounds in New York last week with his
business partner, Todd Wagner, 38, after the so-called quiet period
when principals in newly public companies are not permitted to
publicly discuss the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting week to be touring Wall Street. By the end
of last week's widespread market carnage, shares of Broadcast.com
were trading at $44.375, down $6.625 on Friday alone. That was
still well above the company's offering price but off more than 29
percent from its first-day close.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he remained inspired by his vision of the mythic
``94-year-old lady'' who may have bought shares at $74. ``I want to
make her look like a financial genius,'' he said.

L.A. AREA SUFFERS LACK OF HIGH-TECH SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ENRIQUE RIVERO   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few months ago, San Fernando High School social
studies teacher Marco Torres sent his students on what he knew
would be a likely wild-goose chase.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was simple: Find a local computer store and buy a
3.5-inch computer diskette. He wasn't surprised that the students _
who live in suburban San Fernando and neighboring Pacoima _ came
back empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to go to Encino (an affluent suburb northwest of
downtown Los Angeles) or any other community, you won't have any
trouble finding this stuff,'' Torres said angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Torres' assignment for his students is a lesson in retailing
economics. The major consumer electronics retailers go where the
money is, or where it's perceived to be. But Torres is one of a
growing group of people in the northeast San Fernando Valley who
are trying to teach those same retailers that their community has
both the space to build large stores and the disposable income to
spend at them.
</P>
<P>
   These Northeast Valley advocates have jumped on this issue
because of the importance personal technology will be in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to expose our community to skills that are
important ... and unless we jump on this bandwagon, our community
will continue to decline,'' said Torres, who is also the education
technology consultant to the schools feeding into San Fernando
High. ``Once we do that, then businesses can say, Look at this
community. This is a hard-working community in touch with
technology. Let's tap into that.''
</P>
<P>
   The region's lack of consumer electronics retailers is
accentuated by the abundance of those same retailers in other parts
of the San Fernando Valley. ``We look for good, viable retail
centers,'' said Pam Colangelo, a spokeswoman for Brisbane,
Calif.-based The Good Guys ``That's what other retailers are
looking for as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the small independents are rare in the Northeast Valley.
One of the few is Fiesta Electronics and Furniture in San Fernando,
which does indeed sell computers _ but only a few, only by catalog
and only no-name brands, said owner Victor Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't sell products like 3.5-inch diskettes. For that,
he sends customers to the few nearby general merchandise stores
that carry computers and computer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Sam's Club and Office Depot _ for the East Valley,
they're the ones that sell most of the computers and they have a
lot,'' he said. ``If someone wants to see them, we send them to
Office Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the relative scarcity of consumer electronics stores in the
Northeast Valley? It's economics and, perhaps, land availability,
according to economists and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's driven plain and simple by economics,'' said Richard
Giss, a partner with the trade retail services group at Deloitte &AMP;
Touche LLP. ``Consumer electronics is a typically big-ticket item
and you will see those stores located in areas convenient to
demographics that indicate that it has a population that can pay
those prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hoffman, executive director of the Mid Valley Chamber of
Commerce said the East Valley was developed long before giant
electronics stores began looking for vacant lots upon which to
build.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this side of the Valley seems to have been built up
first,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers also may perceive that older urban areas are poor and
unsafe, and have little disposable income. That's a costly
miscalculation, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los
Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of bucks to be made in areas like the Northeast
Valley if retailers take the time to learn those markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers _ especially national chain retailers _ don't quite
get what goes on in major urban areas,'' he said. ``They see areas
that most people would see as distressed and avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the savvy retailer, you can do well for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   One part of the Northeast Valley that's trying to change things
is the city of San Fernando, where the only big general
merchandisers are branches of J.C. Penney, Sam's Club and Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Schmidt, project manager for the Greater San
Fernando Chamber of Commerce, the area has a stable population of
about 300,000 people with a median annual household income in the
high $40,000 range _ just the kind of demographics that he said
should act like magnets to more retail chains.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some have inquired about opening stores in the city,
said Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   But available land is scattered, fragmented and configured in
such a way that makes them unsuitable for the chains, developers
and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   So to attract more major retailers, the city is designing a
downtown specific plan that in part involves shifting San Fernando
Road to create four large lots that could accommodate big box
stores that would draw shoppers from in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is actually looking at this as an opportunity to
redesign its downtown area and capture the consumers that we have
in the San Fernando area,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-30-98 0126EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the San Fernando market study suggests that
electronics discounters may not be good targets for a downtown
revitalization project because of those retailers' ``bias for mall
and high-visibility (freeway) locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, obviously, disagrees that the area around his high
school wouldn't be a good location for a consumer electronics
store. He cites studies that show the northeast population has had
little exposure to personal technology and say it's a fertile field
for the right retailer.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last year showed that only about 4 percent of the
school's approximately 4,600 students have computers at home _ and
most of them are either in the magnet program or have older
siblings in college.
</P>
<P>
   And the school has one of the worst computer-to-student ratios
in the state _ 1-to-118, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, students and the community as a whole have fewer
opportunities to be exposed to a technology that is becoming an
increasingly important part of life, both at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our school is a microcosm of our community _ this is a ...
working-class community that is not exposed to technology in the
way that white-collar communities are,'' Torres said. ``And because
of this lack of exposure, there is no interest in finding out the
importance of information technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our community, information technology is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   What the area really needs, said Fiesta's Ceballos, is a store
that specializes in computers _ somewhere where customers can find
trained professionals who can answer any and every question they
have about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone who specializes (in it) and we don't
have anyone like that,'' he said. ``You have to know what you're
doing _ that's another reason why we don't carry them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some changes afoot in the Northeast Valley, though.
For example, the commercial development at the old General Motors
site in Panorama City is expected to include an Office Max. And
Ceballos himself plans to start carrying computers and equipment in
his store in a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have someone install them in the home; they're
going to be trained and I think it's going to be better for the
people,'' Ceballos said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a simple trip to a major electronics retailer remains
a major headache for Northeast Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Young, for example, has had to travel out of her hometown
of Panorama City to purchase her family's dishwasher, video camera,
radio equipment, computer software and other electronics.
</P>
<P>
   She's not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that type of shopping in Panorama City. There's
no way, there's nothing here,'' she said.

 &HT;    WHILE CLINTON AND YELTSIN TALK, RUSSIAN CRISIS GROWS DEEPER
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-LEWINSKY-0903.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The summit of few expectations produced few results.
</P>
<P>
   Two politically wounded presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill
Clinton, concluded two days of talks Wednesday with Russia sliding
deeper into trouble and America powerless to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by questions about the Monica Lewinsky affair, Clinton
departs Moscow for Northern Ireland on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves behind his ailing friend Yeltsin headed for another
confrontation Friday with the Communist-dominated parliament over
the appointment of a new prime minister and the future course of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a concluding news conference at the majestic and gilded
Catherine's Room in the Kremlin, a grim-faced Yeltsin predicted
``much blood, sweat and tears'' for his anxious country. As he
spoke, the ruble was falling to new lows and the one of the world's
largest nuclear powers approached the end of a second week without
a full-time government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always emerged victorious from the most dramatic
trials. I am sure we will from this one as well,'' Yeltsin told
reporters following his meetings with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist opposition urged Yeltsin to find a new, compromise
candidate to lead the government, vowing to again reject acting
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in a vote scheduled for Friday
in the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, a former prime minister dismissed by Yeltsin
earlier this year and widely blamed for helping to create the
current economic crisis, was decisively defeated in a first vote in
the Duma on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who appointed Chernomyrdin after firing the previous
five-month-old government on Aug. 23, has vowed to stick by him.
Yeltsin also reappointed several Cabinet ministers by decree,
including the defense and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin can present his candidate for prime minister three
times, according to Russia's constitution. If rejected on a third
vote, the president must dissolve the Duma and call new
parliamentary elections within three months. Yeltsin would then
rule by decree, and with an interim government, until the new
parliament is seated.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a risky game of brinkmanship for both Yeltsin and
the parliament. Resentful Russians have watched their spending
power slashed in half in recent weeks as the ruble went into
free-fall. The Central Bank cut the official rate to 12.8 rubles
per dollar on Wednesday -- half what it was worth three weeks ago
-- while on the street it was trading as low as 15 to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin is half-dead, the government is paralyzed, and we
are on the verge of a paralysis of legislative power as well,''
said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. ``A lack of government
would inevitably lead to bandits and criminals taking over power.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov and more than 20 other opposition leaders met privately
with Clinton on Wednesday at the U.S. ambassador's residence in
Moscow, Spaso House. The president encouraged them to find common
ground with Yeltsin to form a government and fix the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't predict that future with any certainty, but we can
say we've done everything we can do ... to make that more hopeful
outcome a reality,'' said White House spokesman Michael McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also repeated the theme that marked his appearances in
Moscow: urging Russia to remain on the road to democracy seven
years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the opposition figures, including the
Communists and other factions from across the political spectrum,
stated that Russia would not revert to Soviet-era policies. No one
is against reforms, they said, but no one in the current crisis can
do much to advance them.
</P>
<P>
   But some parliament members warned Clinton of social unrest if
the situation in Russia deteriorates further.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Lebed, a regional governor and former army general,
said the revolt was possible in the disgruntled, ill-paid army.
Lebed, a presidential candidate in 1996 who still aspires to the
job, said he told Clinton that Russia was more insecure than the
period leading up to the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance with Yeltsin at the Kremlin, Clinton pledged
that America would stand behind Russia and he promised to pursue
new international financial aid to help pull the country out of
crisis -- but only if Moscow pushed ahead with market reforms and
its commitment to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country that rebuffed Napoleon and Hitler can surely adjust
to the realities of the global marketplace,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is scheduled to receive a $4.3 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Sept. 15, part of a $22.6
billion bail-out package announced in July. But IMF officials in
Washington said Tuesday that the loan may be delayed until October
or beyond as it monitors Russia's reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials conceded that Russia, with no
government, has devised no comprehensive plan to deal with its
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is very much in their court. We do not have any new
or additional aid or plan in our pocket,'' said a senior
administration official.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, the two presidents agreed to disagree on the
expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe, a move Russia views with
alarm and which Yeltsin called on Wednesday ``a historic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The only tangible results of the summit were two quickly
arranged accords on arms control, including an agreement to
eliminate some of their stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium. But
the Russian domestic turmoil pre-empted Clinton's main aim:
attempting to convince the Duma to ratify the 1993 START II treaty
to reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summit was a total political show. Clinton needed to show
he is abreast of the situation in Russia, that he is not distracted
by the Monica Lewinsky affair. And Yeltsin needed to show that even
if he is not popular in Russia, that abroad he is loved and treated
well,'' said Viktor Kremenhyuk, a political analyst with the
U.S.A.-Canada Institute, a Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia's economic and political problems occupied much of
the summit, senior Clinton administration officials said the
Lewinsky affair was never discussed between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his first formal news conference at the Kremlin
since his televised Aug. 17 address, was confronted with questions
from reporters about his ``inappropriate'' relationship with the
former White House intern.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Cheap PCs intriguing, but you probably won't purchase one  
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been expecting grocery stores to start selling computers in
the checkout line any day now. They'd be stacked up somewhere
between copies of the National Enquirer and boxes of Good 'N Plenty
and would cost about the same.
</P>
<P>
   After all, everyone says computers are dirt cheap these days.
And you don't have to go any further than this newspaper for proof.
Just look at the ads. You'll find computers _ brand new ones _ for
as little as $400 or so. I can remember when a person paid that
much for a modem.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices are real. But they can be misleading, too. I'm
not saying the stores are trying to deceive you. What I am saying
is that _ once you get in the store _ you may find that the bargain
basement PCs aren't for you.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. Last weekend I went shopping for a new computer.
I finally got tired of using a PC that sounded like a washing
machine filled with rocks and soft drink bottles. It was scaring my
cat. Besides, the old machine was way too slow.
</P>
<P>
   While it is powerful enough for word processing, browsing the
Web and checking e-mail, it is showing its age. The once-gigantic
1-gigabyte hard disk now seems tiny. The 256-color video card is
something of an antique. The 125-megahertz processor speed (that's
not a typo, the 125 megahertz is the result of an Overdrive chip)
seems way too slow now.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a shopping trip to replace that PC that I discovered a
truth that can only be learned at the cash register: For someone
who needs a relatively powerful PC, prices haven't really changed
much.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who know me _ either through this column or
face-to-face _ understand I'm not exactly a free spender. With cars
and computers, I tend to wait as long as I can before replacing
what I own. I think there are still some good miles left in my Nash
Rambler, but my computer is on its last legs.
</P>
<P>
   I went shopping with the notion of picking up a new PC for $500
or so. After all, I've been earnestly assuring you that most of us
don't need a state-of-the-art machine.
</P>
<P>
   But being a TechnoBuddy doesn't make a person immune to the sort
of raw hunger for power that hits folks in a computer store. Before
long, I was rationalizing with the best of them. I told myself
those inexpensive computers weren't much more powerful than the PC
I wanted to replace.
</P>
<P>
   I told myself I was looking for a machine that would have some
chance of being useful for three or four years. And yet I didn't
want to pay top dollar for the fastest chip around. The machine
needed more RAM memory and a much bigger hard drive, and it needed
one of the new 100-megahertz motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. There was one other thing. The new machine needed to
be powerful enough to play computer games. The old machine just
wasn't powerful enough for modern games. Lately I've been getting
this powerful hankering to kill space aliens. It's a plain and
simple fact that the most demanding computer programs these days
are games.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up buying a 350-megahertz Pentium II machine with an
8-gigabyte hard disk and 64 megabytes of RAM. That's not the
fastest machine on the market, but it should be powerful enough to
play most of the games that have been collecting dust on my
bookshelf. And since it uses the new 100-megahertz bus _ the bus is
the circuitry that moves data on the motherboard _ I should be able
to upgrade the machine as new chips come along.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of machines like that to choose from. And the
price spread for PCs with these specifications was real familiar:
It ranged from about $2,000 for brand-name machines down to $1,300
for no-name PCs. That's identical to the prices I saw the last time
I bought a PC. What I'm trying to say is that while there may have
been some really big changes in computer prices lately, human
nature is still pretty much the same.
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting that the $500 machines will get you into the store
but that you won't go home with one.

PC voice recognition: Last word still elusive 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it is something left over from the film ``2001,'' but I
have always felt rather self-conscious talking to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, since publishers are claiming great strides
recently in the advancement of voice recognition systems, I am
talking to mine on a regular basis these days. The results are
mixed, at best.
</P>
<P>
   I have several new systems to test; the one we'll examine today
is L&AMP;H Voice Xpress Plus, a program confined to dictating text and
formatting commands to Microsoft Word 97 or 98, or the considerably
less elaborate word processor contained within the program.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if Voice Xpress is representative of the breed,
computer dictation programs have indeed made great strides over the
past few years. It will not only record your words, but you can
dictate formatting changes, manipulate menus and almost entirely
eliminate the use of the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with a head-mounted microphone, with one
earpiece, in case for some odd reason you want to hear your voice
played back to you. It's comfortable enough, although it interferes
annoyingly with the ingestion of food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   First come the mechanical issues of setting up the software,
which attaches itself like a leech to Microsoft Word, and getting
the microphone adjusted and calibrated. Then the user must
``enroll'' in the program. This is simply a curious way of saying
you have to teach the program to understand your voice.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a simple matter. It consists of uttering 416
statements, mostly witty aphorisms, until the program understands
all or at least most of it. It can take awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with my review of any voice recognition program is
my voice. It has been likened to that of Burl Ives with a toad in
his throat. I tend to mumble, and whistle at ``ess'' sounds. Even
my wife often can't understand me.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, once I opened Word the old-fashioned way, I used
the voice recognition program to open the File menu. From there, I
used voice commands to open a story. Amazingly, it all worked.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Xpress runs significantly behind your dictation; it takes
awhile to figure things out. If, for instance, you dictate ``Mary
had a little lamb'' and the program decides you said, ``Mary had a
little ham,'' you simply tell it to ``delete last word'' and then
try again. If you can't get it to understand, then you can go into
spelling mode.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often it fails to recognize I am giving editing
commands and not dictation, but that may be my fault. Anyone who
enunciates so poorly that a program came up with ``Thelma'' when
the phrase was ``the movie'' shouldn't be too critical.
</P>
<P>
   Working carefully, I can generally create a sentence every five
minutes or so. At that rate, I fear I won't live long enough to
create the Great American Novel, or even an average American novel.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't believe programs like this are really intended for
people with two good hands for typing. Regardless of how much you
dislike typing, you'll find getting comfortable with Voice Xpress
more trouble than it's worth unless you're in Rex Harrison's vocal
league.
</P>
<P>
   But for those with physical problems that make it difficult or
impossible to type, a voice recognition program, and especially one
that allows the manipulation of a standard word processor in a
virtually no-hands mode, could be a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   Before drawing any final conclusions, we'll look at a couple of
more commonly available programs of this sort.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER TESTS LAW ON ENCRYPTION CODE  
 WEB COMPANY RIDES INITIAL-OFFERING WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Booher was hardly surprised last month when two agents
from the Department of Commerce knocked on his door in Silicon
Valley and handed him a federal subpoena. In fact, he had been
expecting it ever since he first made his data-encryption program
available on the Internet in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is investigating whether Booher's
software, which is called Secure Office and is intended to protect
the privacy of computer files by scrambling the data, violates U.S.
export law. The rules require Americans who distribute encryption
software internationally to obtain an export license; making
software available on the Internet is considered international
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Booher acknowledges that few people have downloaded the software
from his Web site at www.filesafety.com. But a big number of users
was not his real goal.
</P>
<P>
   Booher, a software engineer at Phase Metrics Corp. in Fremont,
Calif., who wrote the encryption program in his spare time, said he
posted the program to challenge the export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption has been a hotly debated issue in Washington lately,
with the Commerce Department, the FBI and other agencies arguing
that powerful data-scrambling programs put high-technology
espionage tools in the hands of criminals, spies and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   But Booher is among the software developers who contend that
their right to write encryption code is protected by the First
Amendment and that the technology is already easily available
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether this stuff is going to exist,''
Booher said, ``but who will develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monika Wasiewicz, the Commerce Department agent in charge of the
case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Booher was supposed to testify to a federal grand jury in San
Jose, Calif., last week, but the session was canceled because too
few jurors showed up. Booher's testimony is supposed to be
rescheduled for this week.

   WEB Company Rides Initial-Offering Wave
</P>
<P>
   For any curious observer of the business world who sits before
Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com in Dallas, the most pressing
question is not the state of media on the Internet or the future
direction of his company, which transmits audio and video
programming over the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The question is probably: What was going through his mind on
July 16 as he watched the stock price of his company shoot from $18
to $74 before settling at $62.75, the best first day for an initial
public offering in history?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, this is really, really cool,'' he remembers
thinking as he sat in the New York offices of Nasdaq and watched
the numbers ticking higher and higher. By the end of that first
day, the company's valuation exceeded $1 billion, and his personal
net worth _ on paper, at least _ rose to $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been married, but I guess that feeling I had that
day was similar to what a groom would feel at the altar,'' Cuban
said. ``I've never been the No. 1 draft pick for the NFL or NBA,
either. Actually, that's probably even closer to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 40, was making the rounds in Manhattan last week with his
business partner, Todd Wagner, 38, after the so-called quiet period
when principals in newly public companies are not permitted to
publicly discuss the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting week to be touring Wall Street. By the end
of last week's widespread market carnage, shares of Broadcast.com
were trading at $44.375, down $6.625 on Friday alone. That was
still well above the company's offering price but off more than 29
percent from its first-day close.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he remained inspired by his vision of the mythic
``94-year-old lady'' who may have bought shares at $74. ``I want to
make her look like a financial genius,'' he said.

PATENTS: INTERNET SEARCH SYSTEM; BRA FOR WOMEN AFTER HEART
SURGERY;  DETECTING FAKE VIDEOTAPES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching the Internet is inevitably an exercise in information
overload.
</P>
<P>
   Type a single word and you are likely to get thousands of hits,
only a handful of which are pertinent to your actual field of
interest. Adding an extra search term can often make things worse _
instead of narrowing your search, you can end up with even more
hits.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you could pose a question to the search engine in
plain English, in the same way that you might pose a question to
the research librarian at your local library? And what if the
search engine could understand the question, and respond to it
precisely, just as an all-knowing librarian would be able to reach
for the right book on the reference shelf?
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Dahlgren, a computational linguist, and her colleague,
Edward Stabler, contend that they have built exactly such a search
engine, which they recently patented.
</P>
<P>
   The system, dubbed Inquizit, is based on natural-language
searching, which means that it retrieves and stores information in
much the way that people talk.
</P>
<P>
   The system is built in part on a set of principles Ms. Dahlgren
laid out in her 1988 book, ``Naive Semantics for Natural Language
Understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We model the way people interpret the meanings of a word _
through context,'' Ms. Dahlgren said. ``We search on meaning by
using grammar and structure and semantics. Every word has
associated with it a set of beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Ms. Dahlgren said, a query such as ``What kinds of wood
are bats made of?'' would probably yield documents having to do
with baseball bats and hickory.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a query using identical key words with vastly
different meanings _ ``Do bats live in the woods?'' for example _
would yield documents about species of bats that live in trees.
</P>
<P>
   But don't other search engines, like Ask Jeeves
(www.askjeeves.com), already rely on natural-language retrieval?
Ms. Dahlgren says no.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these pseudo-natural-language searches, you write the
sentence and they throw away the little words and then do a
standard Boolean search, possibly with some statistics thrown in,''
she said. ``But they are essentially all pattern matchers. Since
they don't actually figure out what the query means, they end up
with enormous over-retrieval.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent visit to the askjeeves.com site, the query
``What kinds of wood are bats made of?'' turned up 10 sites,
including three devoted to the actor James Woods, two that sold
golfing equipment, and encyclopedia entries on ``bat,'' ``bats''
and ``wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The query ``Do bats live in the woods?'' turned up six hits,
including a site selling softball and baseball equipment, a site
that features major-league batting-average records, and a link to
the Death Clock site, ``the Internet's friendly reminder that life
is slipping away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dahlgren acknowledged that others, like Microsoft, are
trying to develop true natural-language programs. But she said the
difference between her approach and that of Microsoft was that she
and Stabler had hand-built their vast linguistic dictionary _ an
undertaking that took nearly 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is trying to write dictionaries automatically by
searching machine-coded dictionaries,'' she said. ``We actually
built the dictionary by hand, as opposed to throwing a machine at
the problem so we wouldn't have to sit down and write up all these
linguistic rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment on Inquizit's technology and on
Ms. Dahlgren's assessment of its own approach.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Inquizit has been financed by an Army research grant,
private investors and ``sweat equity,'' according to Ms. Dahlgren.
So if Inquizit has discovered the Holy Grail of search engines, why
hasn't it been gobbled up yet by a Microsoft or Yahoo?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to companies whose names you would recognize,''
said Taylor Hawke, director of marketing for Inquizit. He said that
the company planned to license its technology but that it was
considering setting up its own Internet search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Inquizit, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., received
patent No. 5,794,050.
</P>
<P>
   Bra for Women After Heart Surgery
</P>
<P>
   Mary Whisman had open-heart surgery a few years ago, as did her
daughter and her daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that women have this terrible problem that men
don't have,'' Mrs. Whisman said. ``Store-bought brassieres push
terribly on the place where they put the wire in after they open up
your sternum.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Whisman has patented a brassiere for postoperative
open-heart-surgery patients.
</P>
<P>
   Its main feature is a roll of soft padding that sits underneath
the breasts, and keeps the bra from pressing directly against the
sternum area. The bra, which opens in front, holds each breast in a
separate cup and features wide, padded straps, according to Mrs.
Whisman.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whisman, who lives in North Vernon, Ind., said she hoped to
license patent No. 5,782,670.
</P>
<P>
   System to Detect Fake Videotapes
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a way to verify whether those videotapes of alien
spaceships are authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Brothers, of Branford, Conn., has patented a video-camera
encryption system that uses Global Positioning System satellite
receivers to encode videotape with the time and place it was taken.
The tape is then played back on special equipment that decodes and
displays information about the time and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of UFOs, you would be able to know whether the
tape was doctored in any way,'' Brothers said. ``Of course, that
doesn't stop anyone from staging an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Brothers, who is seeking to license patent No. 5,799,083, said
the technology had more pedestrian applications, such as
documentation for insurance purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

HELP WANTED: TOP EXECUTIVES FOR NEW-MEDIA START-UPS

 By JANET STITES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lon Otremba has a rare advantage among top executives
in New York City's Silicon Alley high-technology industry: a track
record as an executive who took an Internet company from ground
zero to a respectable public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the original management team of the online publisher
Cnet, Otremba is now the chief operating officer of Iname, a
start-up that offers permanent and personalized e-mail accounts. In
an industry that has very little history and thus a dearth of
experienced, successful executives, he is already on Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of experienced managers in technology industries is
especially acute in New York. Unlike Silicon Valley, Northern
California's hotbed of high-technology start-ups, or Dallas, the
hub of the telecommunications industry, Silicon Alley has only a
handful of executives who have actually built a company from the
ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an ongoing problem to attract senior
management and build a board,'' said Michael Flannery, president of
the New York-based executive search firm Redwood Partners. Although
successful initial public offerings by a handful of Silicon Alley
companies have made the industry more attractive to experienced
executives and have thus eased the problem a bit, more recent
start-ups are still struggling to find and lure top managers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tiny pool of second-generation entrepreneurs,
recruiters must turn to the corporate world, he said, and gamble
that an executive hailing from an established corporation can drive
a start-up to success.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery, who also manages a small venture capital fund and is
in need of managers for his own portfolio of companies, says there
is no sure formula for determining who can make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough call,'' he said of finding the right executive.
``I really put them through the drill. I take them down the road,
painting a picture of what it's like to run a start-up; making
payroll; constantly raising capital; building a model. I watch
their facial expressions. Sometimes, after I'm finished they say,
`You're right, Mike. I don't want to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The executive candidate is gambling, too. When Otremba joined
Cnet in 1993, for example, he was leaving a comfortable position as
publisher of PC Magazine, a Ziff-Davis publication.
</P>
<P>
   In his job at Ziff-Davis, he could see the Internet coming, so
when Cnet's founders, Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie, approached
him with their idea for a company that would produce television and
Internet programming about computers, he understood the potential.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with his proven track record in traditional publishing,
his high marketability and a wife and two children to consider,
Otremba, who was then 36, had a lot of options. In addition, the
job would require him to commute weekly to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt the idea was a good one,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``Still, I had to do a lot of soul-searching to decide
if it was the right time to join a start-up. Finally, I realized I
wouldn't be starving if the whole thing imploded.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside was an equity stake in Cnet and the opportunity to
create a corporate culture and be part of a technology revolution.
On the other hand, he had to create the company from scratch and
sacrifice many amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big deal for me when I could arrange for car service
to the airport, when I got my corporate credit card and could hire
an assistant,'' he said of the growth of Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   Otremba stayed with Cnet three years, until he was fully vested,
helping take the company from 10 employees to 600. Then he was
ready to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``People read the registration statement, so they knew exactly
when my vesting was up,'' he said. ``I started getting calls
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Otremba was commuting weekly from New York to San
Francisco, so when he ran into the founders of the New York-based
Iname, he was ready to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was available for a second run while it was still early'' in
the development of the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting firms have recognized the challenge and are setting
up special efforts to find executives for new-media start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Among those specializing in Silicon Alley companies is Cara
Erickson, a partner at the search firm of Accord Group/Johnson,
Smith &AMP; Knisley who has placed executives for companies like
Chicago-based Classified Ventures and Microsoft Corp. She is now
seeking a chief executive for the online financial news service
TheStreet.com, whose founder, James Cramer, already runs a hedge
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation is often not the issue, Ms. Erickson said, because
the industry has matured enough that many start-ups, particularly
those with solid venture backing, can compete with the high-end
salaries of the established corporate world and are not deterred by
the price tag for seasoned executives.
</P>
<P>
   But finding the right executive can take time. Ms. Erickson says
she looks for problem solvers who fit into the management team
puzzle _ that is, a chief executive, chief financial officer and
chief operating officer who complement each other in skills and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to find one person with all the elements
necessary to help build a company,'' she said. ``You have to look
at the management team as a whole. If you have a CEO who has never
taken a company public, then you need to have a CFO who has.''
</P>
<P>
   Start-ups often find themselves in a chicken-and-egg quandary.
Without good management they cannot find financing, but without
financing, they cannot afford good executives.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Lisa Church, who turned down the opportunity to
run a start-up to take a lower-level job at a more established
company.
</P>
<P>
   Like Otremba, Ms. Church found herself in New York City with a
unique resume that included helping to build a technology company
from the ground up. As vice president of marketing and new-business
development for Advent Software of San Francisco, she was
responsible for building the company's East Coast presence.
</P>
<P>
   She joined Advent, which specializes in portfolio management
software, in 1985 when the company had six employees and sales in
tens of thousands of dollars. When she left last year, the company
employed more than 300, and revenues were approaching $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that it was time to move on, Ms. Church took stock of
her opportunities while observing and, eventually, participating in
the evolution of Silicon Alley. She spoke seriously with several
Alley companies and came close to joining a New York software firm
as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But she turned down that opportunity to join Decalog, a
Boston-based, Israeli-backed software company, as vice president of
North American sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lure of the new-media business is that it's a new
technology and a new industry,'' Ms. Church said. ``It's fun and
exciting, but there are the financial realities of life. I've got a
family and a mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, she took the Decalog job because it
promised to be equally exciting, but more stable. ``The company's
just more established,'' she said, adding that she still hopes to
work with a start-up in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists face similar decisions in finding the right
company, said Ed Sim, senior vice president of the venture-capital
firm Dawntreader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight of the 10 companies we speak to need management,'' Sim
said. ``Part of the deal has to be we can either bring in a new CEO
or COO to complement the founder. We get resumes in every day, so
the tricky part is to identify the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   What his group can offer potential executives is ``the wealth
factor'' and a long-term relationship with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them that if the company doesn't work out for market
reasons, we'll drop them in another one of our companies,'' Sim
said. ``So then it's a portfolio risk versus a single company.''
</P>
<P>
   Among an executive's biggest fears when contemplating joining a
start-up, he said, is failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, a company might fail through no fault of the CEO,''
he said. ``We mitigate their fear by pointing out that every
company is developing an Internet strategy, so their experience
will be invaluable, that it's still early, and people like wounds
and scars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some executives who emerged from start-ups are intrigued
but ultimately put off by culture shock when stepping into the
world of Silicon Alley start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peter Kestenbaum recently resigned as director of
North American field marketing for Sun Microsystems after 13 years
with the company. Having joined Sun a year before the company went
public, he was already familiar with the grueling hours and
guerrilla tactics of start-up life. And having witnessed the birth
of Silicon Alley, he decided that the time was perfect to try some
start-up companies on for size.
</P>
<P>
   His first experience was less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was in shorts and sandals,'' he said. ``There was no
receptionist, so I just wandered to the back looking for the person
I was there to meet. But the clincher came when I went to use the
bathroom. There I was, standing in my $1,000 suit, and the urinals
were filthy. It was like a gas station. I thought, `I can't do
this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kestenbaum has decided to look for a position with a more
established company.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest part of finding the right executive is
finding someone with a passion for the product, not just the money.
</P>
<P>
   Otremba agrees: ``When you join a start-up it's like joining a
family. All the stock options in the world don't amount to anything
if the business doesn't interest you. There has to be a passion.''

ANALYSIS: SIGNS SHOW `WINTEL' AXIS IS BEGINNING TO WOBBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Everywhere around Silicon Valley these days,
there seem to be signs that the so-called alliance between
Microsoft Windows and the Intel chip, the so-called Wintel duopoly,
may be unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades, the fortunes of Intel Corp. and of
Microsoft have been inextricably bound as the two companies have
come to dominate the hardware and software hemispheres of the
personal computer world.
</P>
<P>
   But recent disclosures from documents obtained by the Justice
Department and the states as part of their investigation into
Microsoft's business practices show the deep frustration felt by
Intel executives in the face of pressure applied by Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is changes in computer technology and the explosive
market growth of new consumer electronics products that may be
working to drive an even deeper wedge between the two companies.
And if the two partners do become estranged, it may be Intel that
feels more pain.
</P>
<P>
   Two other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices and National
Semiconductor, have already been giving Intel fits in the growing
market for microprocessors for personal computers that sell for
less than $1,000. And increasingly, the computer industry's growth
is shifting more rapidly than had been expected toward consumer
electronics devices like cellular telephones and hand-held personal
digital assistants _ markets in which neither Microsoft nor Intel
wield much influence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft's interest in cracking the consumer
electronics market is adding to the strains in the Wintel alliance,
as the software maker quietly but actively courts new would-be
competitors of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Microsoft signed a deal with a Japanese electronics
giant, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., to use Microsoft's
Windows CE as the software for a multimedia microprocessor chip
that Matsushita is preparing for consumer audio and video products
like television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Silicon Valley grapevine is full of chatter about
Transmeta Corp., a secretive Santa Clara start-up company that is
financed in part by a Microsoft co-founder and board member, Paul
Allen. Transmeta officials declined to comment, but one conjecture
is that the company is planning a new processor chip that would
capitalize on software like Microsoft's Windows CE or Sun
Microsystems' Java for use in new generations of hand-held
computers and phones.
</P>
<P>
   The twin threat of Matsushita and Transmeta seems representative
of a rapidly eroding influence for Intel, the world's largest
semiconductor manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that termites nibble away at the roots of
giant trees, and suddenly they fall over,'' said Richard Doherty,
president of Envisioneering, a computer-industry consulting firm in
Seaford, N.Y. ``This is a termite-level pincer move against
Intel.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Intel has been standing still. The company has
chosen to replace its aging X86 microprocessor architecture _ the
286, 386, 486 and Pentium series of chips that have been the
company's cash cow for more than 15 years _ with a new family of
microprocessors that would be restricted to the very high end of
the computer industry's price range, where PC chip competitors may
be unwilling or unable to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The potential flaw in that strategy is that, increasingly, the
industry's newest technologies and market opportunities are
occurring among lower-priced devices in which Intel has
traditionally had little to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently did the chip maker seem to acknowledge this
handicap by scrambling to acquire the Digital Equipment Corp.'s
Strongarm microprocessor, a chip that has both low power
consumption and high performance and is intended for cellular
phones and hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Yu, who heads Intel's microprocessor business, said in an
interview recently that the company was aware of its potential
vulnerability but believed that the acquisition of the Strongarm
technology would protect it against attack from below.
</P>
<P>
   Still, widespread resignations by key members of the Strongarm
design team since Intel acquired the business in February indicate
that the Intel Strongarm effort may be in some disarray.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some analysts see a chance of Intel's eventually
finding itself stranded at the upper end of the computer market
while the industry heads in other directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC business is moving downstream while the cellular phone
makers are moving upstream,'' said Andrew Allison, a computer
industry consultant and publisher of RISC Management, an industry
newsletter. ``They're going to collide with a big bang.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And the new universe created by this big bang, some experts
predict, will be very different from the world according to Wintel.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent deals reached by the major makers of digital
cellular phones to add computer features to products, neither Intel
nor Microsoft has played a role. The European cellular phone
producers Nokia and Ericsson have teamed up with Psion, a British
maker of hand-held computers. In the United States, Motorola
recently acquired Philippe Kahn's Starfish Software and Qualcomm
has struck a deal with Palm Computing.
</P>
<P>
   Another big market opportunity could be for new types of
portable computing devices that may eventually replace many of
today's notebook, laptop and desktop PCs. And that is where
Transmeta may prove to be an interesting wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1995 by David Ditzel, a former
computer architect at Sun, who as a graduate student at the
University of California at Berkeley helped pioneer a type of chip
technology called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC _ an
approach that Intel fended off by sharply increasing the
performance of its X86 chips.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel is unusually tight-lipped about what he has planned and
about rumors that Transmeta's well-financed efforts may result in a
new hardware platform for Microsoft's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have anything to say right now,'' he said.
``Others have tooted their horns too early in the past, and we're
trying to avoid that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But word that Ditzel's chips may run Microsoft software has
shocked many a Silicon Valley techie, because Transmeta is now best
known as the company that employs Linus Torvalds. Torvalds is the
programmer who created the increasingly popular _ and free _ Linux
operating system, which has become an icon of hipness for the
technically adept who typically scorn all that Microsoft stands
for.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Transmeta would employ Torvalds to help
design a system that would benefit Microsoft is akin to heresy for
many engineers in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a little like hiring Luke Skywalker and then
turning the whole organization over to Darth Vader,'' a hardware
designer remarked.
</P>
<P>
   But for the longtime partners of the Wintel alliance, it could
simply be a further sign that the force may no longer be with them.

MORGAN STANLEY WILL OFFER RESEARCH TO TRADERS ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has decided to sell access
to research by its top-ranked team of stock analysts to customers
of its Internet service, Discover Brokerage Direct.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which the company plans to announce this week, will be
the first time that any of the major brokerage firms has given
same-day access to research to customers who do not pay full
commissions for their stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   The price difference for such trades can be enormous. Discover
Brokerage will charge $14.95 for a trade that Morgan Stanley's
full-service brokers might charge as much as $3,600 to make.
</P>
<P>
   Discover Brokerage, which is ninth in the online brokerage race,
wants to win business by emphasizing the resources of its larger
parent. Morgan Stanley's research team was rated second to Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. in the annual poll of big customers by Institutional
Investor magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The online discount service will not offer the full range of
search that is available to Morgan Stanley's full-service
customers.
</P>
<P>
   For $19.95 a month, Discover Brokerage customers can specify up
to 20 companies they want to follow. They will receive an e-mail
notification within about an hour of the time the firm has changed
its recommendation about those companies' stocks or has published a
new report. They can also read summaries of the new reports online.
</P>
<P>
   Customers also have the option to follow 40 companies for $34.95
a month. Initially, Discover will offer online research for 400
companies but it plans to increase that to about 1,000 companies by
the end of the year. Customers can change their list of stocks once
a month.
</P>
<P>
   But online customers will not have access to the full reports
nor can they see the firm's list of recommended stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommended list is traditionally a mainstay of the retail
broker,'' said Thomas O'Connell, an executive vice president of
Discover Brokerage. ``To distribute it away from them would not be
right.'' He said that Morgan Stanley wants to keep a clear
distinction between the two services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to replicate everything in the full-service
channel and do it at a discounted price,'' O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   The other firms that have tiptoed into offering some research
online have not provided same-day access to their Internet
customers and have typically placed various other limitations on
the offerings. Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette lets only those
customers with more than $100,000 in their accounts read its
research. They can read reports on all the companies the firm
covers, but one or two days after they are published. That delay is
critical, because a rating change by a top-ranked analyst can send
a stock soaring or tumbling, depending on the point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest full-service firms _ Merrill Lynch and the
Salomon Smith Barney unit of Travelers Group _ do not offer
separate Internet trading at a discount. But Salomon does have an
arrangement to distribute summaries of its research to customers of

   Earlier this year, Charles Schwab pulled back from a plan to
provide delayed access to reports from a number of big brokerage
firms. Those reports would have been provided by First Call, a firm
that sends the reports electronically to institutional clients. But
the plan was tabled after the brokerage firms complained, and
Schwab now says it is working on a new plan to offer research from
several brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley's choice to charge a separate fee for its
research is likely to inhibit people from using the service, said
K. Blake Darcy, the chief executive of a competing online service,
DLJ Direct. ``People on the Internet believe that information
should be free or close to it,'' he said. He said that research has
proved to be only a modest attraction for those DLJ customers who
qualify for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half the people who could don't use it at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stock research is a draw for a group of customers that
some firms find attractive, said Julio Gomez, the founder of Gomez
Advisers, a firm that follows online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investment bank research has been among the most coveted
services, not for the day trader, but for the serious investor who
fancies themselves in the mold of Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch,''
Gomez said. He said that such customers now represent about 30
percent of the online market.

U.S. MAY SEEK TO EXPAND EVIDENCE IN MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government and 20 states suing Microsoft Corp. are planning
to ask a federal judge to admit new evidence in their major
antitrust case against the software maker, according to a person
close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The request could be made as early as Monday when the Justice
Department and states are scheduled to reply to a Microsoft motion
requesting that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson reject or pare back
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times reported Sunday that the new accusations would
be made Monday. But the person close to the investigation said that
the government and states had not yet reached final agreement on
what fresh evidence to include, and that they would discuss the
matter Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The move to bolster the antitrust case comes as federal and
state investigators deposing Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman,
decided that they needed an unexpected third day to interrogate
him. The Gates deposition, taken in private, began on Thursday and
Friday. The third session is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday at
the Microsoft corporate campus, outside Seattle, where the first
two sessions were held.
</P>
<P>
   In his videotaped testimony, Gates, according to a person who
was informed of Gates' replies, has hewed to the company's line
throughout the case, denying any wrongdoing in its pursuit of the
market for software used to browse the Internet _ the main focus of
the case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, this person said, Gates denied any knowledge of
attempts to persuade or force Netscape Communications Corp., an
Internet pioneer, to divide the market for browsing software. The
government and states contend that Microsoft proposed a collusion
pact, which was rejected by Netscape, during two meetings in June
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, federal and state investigators have been pursuing
allegations against Microsoft beyond those in the antitrust case
they filed last May. Broadly, the investigators are inquiring
whether Microsoft used its market muscle to try to limit
competition in segments of the emerging market for Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   In that investigation, the government and states have been
examining Microsoft's dealings with several companies including
Intel, Apple Computer and Real Networks. The investigators are
looking for evidence that Microsoft might have prodded these
companies into curbing their own work on Internet-related software,
or tried to get them to limit support for Netscape, Microsoft's
main rival in Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, the government and states can include new
evidence in their case, but only if the fresh evidence meshes
closely with charges already in the complaint. ``Putting new
evidence that fits into the established framework of the case is
not unusual at all,'' one person close to the case said. ``The
purpose of the discovery process is to find new evidence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson must make a determination on what new evidence can be
permitted before the trial, which is scheduled to begin on Sept.
23. Microsoft advisers say the effort to put additional evidence
into the case shortly before the trial shows that the government
and states are desperately scrambling to strengthen their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department and the states are casting around,
trying to figure out what they are going to do with their case,''
said Charles Rule, a partner of Covington &AMP; Burling in Washington
and a former senior official in the Justice Department, who is an
adviser to Microsoft. ``They seem to be arguing that Netscape
somehow fits into this larger tableau that they are trying to
paint.''

 WASHINGTON: Web sites. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton's top adviser on Internet issues, Ira Magaziner, said on
Thursday that the administration was working ``to get its own house
in order.'' Magaziner also noted that unlike the private sector,
government agencies are bound by the Privacy Act to protect
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are privacy principles being followed,'' Magaziner said.
``And we are taking steps to ensure that government agencies are in
fact in a more visible way confirming that.''
</P>
<P>
   Government departments and agencies _ but not the White House _
must comply with the Privacy Act, which establishes controls over
personal information collected by the federal government. The act
requires that each agency that maintains records on individuals
inform the person whose data are being collected, by notifying the
individual of that fact either on the form that is used to collect
the information or on a separate form that the person can keep.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Schwartz, a policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a Washington advocacy group, said, ``When they collect
specific information about people, they have to give notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a technical violation of the law,'' he added. ``They
should be posting privacy policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The security of online information obtained by them is crucial,
said Kathryn Montgomery, executive director of the Center for Media
Education, a nonprofit organization has been pushing for
legislation to protect both adults and children on line
</P>
<P>
   ``Where government is concerned,'' Ms. Montgomery said, ``we
need to be very, very careful about data collected on line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Montgomery also emphasized that she saw a clear
distinction between commercial and noncommercial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``One issue,'' she said, ``is whether we would make a
distinction between commercial enterprises that are collecting
data, selling it and coming back with exploitive personal
advertisements, and noncommercial uses of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the White House has taken a hands-off
approach to Internet commerce, saying that industry should police
itself on issues like consumer privacy. In that arena, the
administration has encouraged online merchants and marketers to
post clearly how the information they collect from consumers is
used and to adopt mechanisms to enforce stated privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the FTC has the most prominent privacy policy
of all of the federal Web sites. The agency declined to comment on
the lack of clearly posted policies by other agencies, saying its
jurisdiction _ and its survey _ covered only commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, who helped
write a report on federal Web site privacy policies a year ago,
said the government ``generally has been better'' than the private
sector in keeping private information confidential. And most
government Web sites that take applications for things like
volunteers and disaster relief, he said, do post privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a question of whether all sites in general that
collect personally identifiable information should have privacy
policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the administration, Schwartz said, ``They should lead by
example.''

CONSULTANT IS SUED FOR EXPECTED COMPUTER MALFUNCTION IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Baker Inc., a large apparel retailer, is demanding that
Andersen Consulting reimburse it for the cost of a computer system
installed nearly 10 years ago because the system is expected to
malfunction in the year 2000, officials at the consulting firm said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To try to ward off a possible lawsuit by J. Baker, Andersen
asked a Massachusetts court on Friday to rule that the consultants
had met all their contractual obligations when they installed the
merchandising system for the retailer. The installation was
completed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The case is significant because it is one of the first that
tries to blame consultants or computer vendors for installing a
system that will not recognize dates after Dec. 31, 1999 _ the Y2K
problem. If such a suit succeeded, it could expose Andersen
Consulting, the world's largest consulting firm, as well as dozens
of other consultants and computer companies to billions of dollars
in liability.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Jackson, a spokesman for Andersen Consulting, said the firm
had repeatedly tried to resolve the matter with J. Baker. The firm
decided to ask the court for a declaratory judgment, he said, after
Baker hired a law firm to work on the matter for a fee contingent
on any final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``J. Baker is unreasonably demanding reimbursement for a system
they used successfully for nearly a decade,'' Andersen said in a
written statement. ``We felt there was no choice left but to ask
the court to help resolve this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Baker did not return telephone messages left for
them on Friday and Sunday. But according to the consulting firm,
the company is arguing that it would have insisted in 1989 that the
system be ready for the year 2000 if the consultants had then
brought up the subject. The consultants say any such claim by Baker
is groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completely stand behind our work, will defend our position
and fully expect to win this case,'' the consulting firm's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker officials had approved of the computer's design when it
was installed, Jackson said. And they even agreed to praise the
project's success to other companies considering whether to hire
Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, based in Canton, Mass., owns hundreds of retail stores
around the country, including the Casual Male Big and Tall chain.

FEW FEDERAL WEB SITES OBSERVE U.S. PRIVACY GUIDELINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to online privacy, it seems that the
Clinton administration has not been practicing what it preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the administration's sites on the World Wide
Web post the kinds of privacy guidelines that the Federal Trade
Commission recently criticized businesses for failing to post, and
none of the administration's sites offer the special protections
for children that the government recommends for commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even the White House Web site does not meet the standards
recommended by the FTC and endorsed by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the White House site collects e-mail addresses _
and in some cases, home addresses _ through links that allow
visitors to send electronic messages to President and Mrs. Clinton
and Vice President Al Gore and Mrs. Gore. Yet, it does not provide
any notice about how that information will be used by the White
House. Nor does the site ask visitors to its special children's
pages to consult their parents before divulging personal
information, as the administration has recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FTC released a survey of commercial Web sites along
with a report that was highly critical of industries that gather
information online and, without notifying the visitors to their
sites, use or sell the data for marketing purposes. The report's
findings, particularly with respect to children, prompted the FTC
to recommend that Congress pass a law requiring that online
businesses and Web site operators obtain parental permission before
gathering e-mail addresses or other information from children under
the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike operators of commercial sites, federal agencies do not
collect or sell personal data for marketing purposes. The issue,
critics say, is more one of leading by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of practicing what they preach,'' said
David Banisar, senior policy analyst and staff counsel at the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, a public interest research
group in Washington. ``They have been pushing notice and consent,
and they can't even do it themselves. They really have a dismal
record on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Banisar also pointed out that while the White House might not be
using the information for marketing purposes, the data could be
transferred to the Democratic National Committee or used for other
political ends.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has endorsed child-protection legislation
that was introduced in response to the FTC report. It has also
endorsed new self-regulation guidelines and enforcement procedures
recently proposed by the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of
businesses and associations that seeks to foster privacy
protections. Those guidelines call for all Internet businesses to
clearly post policies concerning the use and collection of personal
information, and they require Web site operators to obtain parental
approval before gathering data from children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the administration's support for these measures,
the White House Web site collects information from children without
parental notification. Within a special children's section on the
site, a White House tour led by cartoon caricatures of the ``First
Pets,'' Buddy the dog and Socks the cat, ends with an invitation to
send e-mail to President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic form asks for the sender's name, age, e-mail
address, grade at school, the school's name and, from those
visitors who want a response, a home postal address. The site does
not advise children to ask their parents before divulging that
information.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has an area
for children, like that of the White House site, that offers the
opportunity to send an e-mail message, yet does not display a
privacy policy or request that children seek parental permission
before giving out e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Web site provides links to 70 Web sites of
federal agencies, Cabinet departments and White House offices and
commissions. Of those 70 sites, only 12 had posted privacy policies
as of Friday afternoon. That amounts to 17 percent of the sites
surveyed, only slightly better than the 14 percent of commercial
sites that, according to the FTC's report, had clearly posted
privacy policies earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, the vice president's office and Mrs. Clinton's
press office did not respond directly to questions about the Web
sites' lack of a posted privacy policy. But administration
officials stressed that in May, Clinton ordered the Office of
Management and Budget to conduct an agency-by-agency review to
ensure that new technologies were not violating the Privacy Act or
otherwise eroding privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget said the
agency was drafting guidelines for federal Web sites.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ It's early in the lunch hour but dozens
of customers are already waiting for a table outside the Couve Flor
restaurant. The Couve Flor is one of Rio de Janeiro's most
successful restaurants, serving more than 600 people daily and
twice that on weekends. Diners are attracted by its wide selection
and tasty dishes.
 &HT;    But the popular Rio eatery has another important ingredient
that's packing in customers: it is one of a growing number of
``comida por kilo'' restaurants that charge not by what a customer
orders but how much he or she eats. It's a concept that has spread
throughout the Brazilian restaurant industry since the early 1990s,
mostly near office buildings and urban commercial zones. ``It's a
virtual fever,'' said Couve Flor owner Jair Pinto, who converted
his Italian restaurant to per kilo style in 1993.
 &HT;    In fact, some are doing so well that they have become the major
competitor of fast-food franchises such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut
and Kentucky Fried Chicken. In recent months, several fast foods
franchises have slashed their prices including McDonald's by 18
percent and Bob's, a Brazilian hamburger chain, by 5 percent. ``Per
kilo is definitely taking some of our business,'' says Marcelo
Barbosa, who manages a Bob's outlet at the Rio Sul shopping mall.
 &HT;    Typically, per kilo restaurants offer a buffet of hot and cold
dishes and a scale near the cash register where plates are weighed.
Many are small operations that are open Monday-Friday only during
lunch time, the most important meal of the day. At the low end,
these restaurants provide several hot dishes, including the
standard Brazilian fare of rice, black beans, spaghetti and beef
for between US$5 and $7 a kilo. At the high end, restaurants like
Couve Flor, located in the trendy Jardim Botanico neighborhood,
offer 20 hot dishes, 23 salads and 37 desserts at a cost of $13.50
a kilo. Diners are typically executive secretaries and businessmen
who don't worry much about the higher cost. Customers are attracted
not only to the idea of paying for the amount they eat but the
variety of foods, including non-greasy items such as salads and
vegetables. ``I like to eat light, but with a la carte restaurants,
you never know what you are going to get or how much food to
expect,'' says Rio secretary Fernanda Marsena. ``With per kilo, you
see what you are going to eat and control what you put on your
plate.'' Weighing food in restaurants began in 1990 after
then-President Fernando Collor de Mello froze all savings accounts
over $1,000 for 18 months as part of a radical attack on inflation.
That and other austere economic measures caused massive layoffs in
which some of the newly unemployed were given buyouts by their
firms. Many then opened per kilo restaurants to attract customers
who could no longer afford to spend much on a meal.
 &HT;    Around half of Sao Paulo's 32,000 restaurants, and a fifth of
Rio's 14,000 restaurants now charge by the kilo, according to
restaurant unions of both cities. Marsena says most of her
colleagues prefer per kilo restaurants and constantly exchange
information about the best places. In fact, except for an
occasional handbill or billboard, owners typically spend nothing on
publicity campaigns, and, instead, rely on recommendations.
``Word-of-mouth is the most effective type of marketing,'' added
Sergio Teixeira, marketing manager for Antarctica beer and ardent
per kilo devotee. ``It reflects one's personal opinion and not paid
propaganda, which can be deceiving. That's why good per kilo
restaurants do well.''
 &HT;    In Sao Paulo, Vienna Express is currently the nation's largest
per kilo franchise with 60 outlets. In Rio, Couve Flor has branched
out with three restaurants and plans to open another in a new $200
million amusement park.
 &HT;    Specialty foods franchisers are jumping on the band wagon: The
58 store chain Amor aos Pedacos now offers desserts by the kilo,
while Guillerme Ferreira, the president of Arby's of Brazil,
predicts that the next wave of franchises will be per kilo chains,
which are already appearing in the nation's shopping malls. In
doing so, says Katia Francischi, spokeswoman for the Association of
Brazilian Franchising, they have become a force in the market:
``Per kilo is changing the corporate behavior of Brazilian
franchises.''

 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ It's early in the lunch hour but dozens
of customers are already waiting for a table outside the Couve Flor
restaurant. The Couve Flor is one of Rio de Janeiro's most
successful restaurants, serving more than 600 people daily and
twice that on weekends. Diners are attracted by its wide selection
and tasty dishes.

PAYOFF POTENTIAL FOR HIGH TECH GREAT, BUT IT'S EASY TO GET BURNED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DEBORAH ADAMSON   
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The numbers are staggering in their simplicity:
Anyone who put $10,000 in Microsoft stock in 1986 would have $2
million now.
</P>
<P>
   Bought $10,000 worth of Amazon.com a year ago? It's worth
$84,300 now. Waited until Jan. 1 to buy America Online? Your
$10,000 is now worth $31,271.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, technology stocks, especially
Internet companies, are hot. Despite last week's sell-off,
technology stocks remain the darlings of the investment world and
as alluring to Wall Street as the apple was to Eve.
</P>
<P>
   But the tech world can bite back.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, shareholders of MRV Communications saw their
holdings fall 14.8 percent in Thursday's big sell-off and then 52.6
percent on Friday when the company announced quarterly earnings
wouldn't be as strong as first believed. MRV makes
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one example. Shares of Shopping.com lost 67
percent of their value from Monday through Friday last week; shares
of computer chip maker LSI Logic Corp. have lost 59 percent of
their value in a year.
</P>
<P>
   So how does one find the golden stock amid all the dross? Here's
advice from mutual fund managers, analysts and professional
investors who make a living trying to distinguish the real gold
from fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 1 _ Look for a fast-growing market and pick out its
leading companies.
</P>
<P>
   The market's revenues should be growing in double-digits, and
the higher the growth rate the better, said Peter Rogers, director
of technology research at Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co., a San Francisco
investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   One such market, he believes, is the communications sector,
which includes the Internet, wireless and digital switching
equipment areas.
</P>
<P>
   Look for companies whose own growth rates are outpacing the
market overall. That means they are grabbing market share, Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a company's product sets the standard for the industry,
such that other products and services have to be compatible with it
and it would cost a ton to switch to another system, you've got a
possible winner, according to the book ``The Gorilla Game: An
Investor's Guide to Picking Winners in High Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Microsoft did. It set the standard for PC operating
systems first with its MS-DOS and then Windows, defeating Apple and
IBM's OS/2 system.
</P>
<P>
   In communications equipment, Cisco, Lucent, 3Com and Ascend are
the choices of Gerard Hallaren, co-manager of the $1.1 billion
Invesco Strategic Technology Fund in Denver, whose 10-year average
annual return is 21.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the software and data services market, he likes America
Online and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 2 _ Consider slower-growing industries, but pick out
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mature markets, investors can find a winning stock if
the company has innovative new products or services.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rogers said the graphics software sector is a $3
billion market that is barely expanding. But an innovative company
called Visio has grown an average of 70 percent a year since 1995,
taking business away from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 3 _ Determine whether the market's growth rate can
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Is the market's expansion a short-term deal _ such as the Y2K
service sector _ or will it continue to grow? Is the rate of growth
of new users increasing?
</P>
<P>
   The market's potential must be broad-based, its growth expected
to spin forward into the future. One such area is the Internet, as
technologies, services and products continue to support and expand
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 4 _ Once a promising company is identified, examine its
product cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The company must continue to introduce new, innovative products
relatively quickly, Rogers said. Don't pick companies that depend
on just one product without much in the way of innovation. That
makes them vulnerable to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet companies that don't have traditional products, an
important yardstick is their ability to attract visitors, said
Derek Brown, an Internet analyst at Volpe Brown Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top tier companies like Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos had enormous
run-ups (in their stock prices) because they are the leading
aggregators of consumers online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also look at the strength of the company brand
and the value of its distribution partnerships, said Brown, citing
Disney's investment in the search engine Infoseek and NBC's
interest in Cnet, a network of news and technology Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   However, not everyone agrees with this strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, which is doubling traffic every 100 days, is still
in its early stages and promising companies today might not be the
leaders tomorrow since the landscape changes quickly, said Michael
Murphy, author of ``Every Investor's Guide to High-Tech Stocks and
Mutual Funds'' and editor of the California Technology Stock Letter
in Half Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone remembers successful companies like Cisco, but they
forget about the scores of losers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turf is littered with them,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rapidly changing Internet sector, early winners may be
pushed out. He cites First Virtual Holdings, whose online payment
system generated initial excitement. But when the paradigm of
paying over the Internet changed, the company lost favor. Its stock
is now at $2 from an initial public offering price of $9.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-31-98 0121EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of good ideas out there, and sometimes investing
in a good idea works out,'' Hallaren agreed. ``But this is a very
competitive world, so we concentrate on companies with good
fundamental revenue and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's law: Wait until a company achieves good sales and
profit growth, then invest in them.
</P>
<P>
   Tip No. 5 _ Evaluate the company's competitive position, its
financial strength and the quality of its management.
</P>
<P>
   Find out how well the company stacks up against its rivals,
Rogers said. Does it have dominance? Or is it barely keeping ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Also, buy into a company if its sales and pretax profit growth
rates are at least 15 percent a year each, Murphy said. In
addition, companies should spend at least 7 percent of revenues on
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   That's because intellectual assets _ such as patents and
technical knowledge whose values are not listed on the balance
sheet _ not brick and mortar, are key factors in the success of a
technology company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the stock's price-to-earnings ratio,
which measures the relative expensiveness of a stock, Hallaren
prefers the price-to-sales ratio _ market capitalization divided by
sales in the prior four quarters. The higher the ratio, the higher
the expectation of a bright future for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have two companies with the same P/E, both are in the
same industry, but one is priced at five times sales and the other
at two times sales, the one with five times sales is a much more
efficient company,'' Hallaren said.
</P>
<P>
   Price-to-earnings still matter, but quality takes precedence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to buy good things, not cheap things,'' he said.

CONSIDER SHIFTING FROM AUTOMATIC TO MANUAL IN UPDATING PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about the various software packages
designed to ``automatically'' update the software and drivers on a
PC? Two that I am familiar with are Cybermedia's Oil Change and
IMSI's UpdateNow. How automatic is automatic? Do you have to
manually download and run a lot of executable files, or does the
software do it all for you? Are driver updates so common that you
would be updating almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both of the programs you mention work by first scanning your
computer to see what's on it. They check both for the applications
you have _ everything from word processors to Web browsers to games
_ and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   After that's done, the programs contact a server on the
Internet. The server has a list of applications, drivers and
current updates. The programs then check this against what was
found on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any updates available to you, you'll be alerted and
given the chance to download the ones you need. Once they are moved
to your computer, one of two things happen: You can let the
retrieval program install the update for you or you may have to do
it yourself. Whether it's automatic depends on whether the
publisher of the update has made it that way.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a lot of different programs on your computer, you
probably could find a new update to snag almost every day. Software
constantly is being improved, updated and patched, and grabbing
updates over the Internet makes distribution of these fixes easy
for both users and developers. But only some of them could be
considered crucial updates.
</P>
<P>
   More and more programs have this update capability built into
them. For example, all of Quarterdeck's titles come with UpdateIt,
which automates the downloading and patching of that company's
programs. Symantec's similar technology is called LiveUpdate.
Windows 98 also has an update feature.
</P>
<P>
   The services you mention charge an annual fee for access to the
update database. Frankly, unless you don't want to mess with
downloading and installing software at all, it's cheaper and even
more effective to do it yourself. That's because these servers
don't have all programs on them. And you may be offered software as
an ``update'' that's actually a demo for a program a publisher
wants you to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Think self-service. Just bookmark the Web sites of the makers of
the software and hardware on your computer and visit their support
areas regularly _ say, once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you clear the commands from Run in the Start Menu of
Windows 95? When I click the arrow at the Run command on the Start
Menu I have a list of 24 commands. Most of them are ones I have
previously typed in. Many were typed wrong and did not work, so
there is no use having them in there. I have looked in a number of
those 2-inch-thick books on Win95 that ``tell all'' but have found
nothing about this problem. Also, I have not found any tech help
people or experts in Houston that know how to do this.
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to do this is to use the TweakUI, one of the
PowerToys for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Get TweakUI at www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/. Install it,
and then go to the Control Panel, where you'll find the icon for
TweakUI. Doubleclick it, then look for the tab marked Paranoid.
From there you'll be able to clear the Run command, as well as
several other places where past commands are stored, including the
Documents list and the Internet Explorer history list.

   ``C.S. Lewis: Writer, Dreamer, and Mentor''
</P>
<P>
   By Lionel Adey
</P>
<P>
   Eerdmans, $22
</P>
<P>
   ``The C.S. Lewis Readers' Encyclopedia''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Jeffrey D. Schultz and John G. West Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Zondervan, $22.99
</P>
<P>
   For many writers, heaven would be not only having your books in
print 35 years after your death but having books written about you
as well. But then again, the reason that C.S. Lewis can claim those
honors is that he took the idea of heaven more seriously than many
writers do.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Adey, however, approaches Lewis not as a man of faith but
as a man of letters. ``We have ... to my knowledge no book on Lewis
as what from childhood he set out to be, a maker and reader of
books,'' the Canadian scholar says in ``C.S. Lewis: Writer,
Dreamer, and Mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   Carefully considering his subject as a literary
historian/theorist, critic, novelist, essayist, correspondent,
pleader and poet, Adey says that the Chronicles of Narnia
``constitute a body of fiction worthy of their immense and
sustained readership.'' The novels ``most deserving of survival''
are ``Till We Have Faces'' (a retelling of the myth of Cupid and
Psyche) and ``Perelandra'' (the second book in Lewis' ``space
trilogy'').
</P>
<P>
   Adey covers a great deal of ground that will be alien to those
familiar only with Lewis' religious books. (Adey's own theology is
basically indiscernible.)
</P>
<P>
   For those who really want to expand their Lewisian horizons to
the Utter East and back again, there is ``The C.S. Lewis Readers'
Encyclopedia.'' Beginning with a biographical sketch, this volume
of 400-plus pages _ edited by Jeffrey D. Schultz and John G. West
Jr. _ contains entries on everything from Lewis' intimate
associates to his major (and minor) works, to his letters to
various publications.
</P>
<P>
   Although obviously a work of respect and love, the ``Readers'
Encyclopedia'' generally avoids overt adulation (indeed,
contributor Marvin D. Hinten forthrightly notes the difficulty of
some of Lewis' academic writing). The photographs depict Lewis'
family and early editions of his books; curiously, there is no
picture of Joy Davidman Lewis (the author's wife before her death
in 1960) and no entry devoted to her 1955 book, ``Smoke on the
Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of ``The C.S. Lewis Readers' Encyclopedia'' will
commend it to fans, trivia buffs and students of the author's life
and work.

   ``The Inclusive Language Debate''
</P>
<P>
   By D.A. Carson, $13.99
</P>
<P>
   Baker/Inter-Varsity Press UK
</P>
<P>
   D.A. Carson's latest book? ``Gender Fender-Benders: When the
Worlds of Language, Feminism and Translation Collide.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, not really, although that sums it up pretty well. ``The
Inclusive Language Debate'' (the real title) reacts to a 1997
controversy involving a proposed edition of the popular New
International Version of the Bible. The dispute focuses on whether
words such as ``person'' or ``humankind'' (or the use of plurals or
``you)'' are sometimes preferable to ``man'' and other
male-oriented words when translating passages that apparently apply
to men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is hotter than you might think, and Carson's basic
message is: It's not that simple. The Illinois writer is more
critical of the inclusivists' foes than of the inclusivists (at
least in this case), arguing that the practice often makes for more
accurate translation.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing as it does with linguistic technicalities, ``The
Inclusive Language Debate'' requires close attention, but Carson
works his territory well and produces a sensible and readable work.

   Erin O'Donnell elbowed her way into the crowded field of solo
female contemporary Christian music acts with her debut effort,
1996's engaging ``A Scrapbook of Sorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the elbows have given way to feet. With
``Scratching the Surface,'' O'Donnell climbs above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not elbows or feet that make O'Donnell stand out.
It's her beautifully clear voice, the songwriting talents of
husband Brad O'Donnell, and the pair's willingness to take chances.
Combine that with a liberal dose of musical maturity since the
initial release, and you get one of the most pleasant releases of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to this album is like opening Christmas presents. Each
song is like a brightly wrapped package, and there's a neat,
unexpected surprise in each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of This,'' the first cut _ and first radio hit _ contains
a classic pop hook, but it's driven by strings. Other songs
emphasize piano, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, a bass track
and horns. The title track begins with a muted vocal over
synthesizers, which gives way to guitars and drums.
</P>
<P>
   Brad O'Donnell's lyrics also are fresh and original. They are
not overtly about Christ, but definitely written from a Christian
perspective toward life's twists and turns.

 LOW-COST, COOL iMAC A HIT WITH FEW FLAWS  
 By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1998 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get two obvious things out of the way first.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Apple Computer's iMac is the coolest-looking computer
around. Apple has done a wonderful job of designing something
that's both very functional and aesthetically pleasing. It's also
given the company a great marketing opportunity, which has given
birth to a wonderful slogan: ``Sorry, no beige.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, the iMac does not have a floppy disk drive, and yes,
that's a big mistake. The floppy is not dead yet, and Apple's done
a disservice to buyers of the iMac by forcing them to spend extra
cash for an external, removable drive.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is to Apple what the K-car was to Chrysler. It's the
product Apple is counting on to pull it permanently out of trouble.
It seems to be working _ iMacs are moving off the shelves at a
feverish pace. Apple's future hasn't looked this bright in years.
</P>
<P>
   It is also Apple's play for the low-cost, consumer market. At
$1,299, it's not as cheap as some Windows-based PCs, but it has the
benefit of being better designed and easier for novices to use.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple offers ``no beige'' for the iMac, it doesn't offer
any other colors, either. Its translucent, teal-and-white case is
all that's available. It looks nice in most decors, so long as the
carpet isn't fire-engine red and the walls aren't painted plum.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is incredibly easy to set up, partly because the
monitor is built into the case. Plug the power cord (it's
translucent, too) in the back. Open a small door on the right side
to connect the keyboard, phone cord and any network cables if you
have them. Plug the mouse into a port on the side of the keyboard.
Push the power button on the keyboard, and that's it _ the iMac is
ready to rock.
</P>
<P>
   On initial power-up, the iMac walks you through a series of
set-up questions, determining if you are on a network and whether
you want to set up Internet access. While the Net access assistant
isn't quite as friendly as the Internet wizard found on Windows
95/98, it greatly simplifies this process for Macintosh owners.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is basic Mac OS 8.1. Don't expect any
software surprises; what's new here is the hardware design. But the
Mac OS is better integrated with the Mac hardware than Windows is
with the Intel architecture _ you can't beat the Mac for
plug-and-play _ and the Mac's user interface is simpler. Given that
the market for this machine includes novices and home users, basic
may be better.
</P>
<P>
   With its 233-megahertz PowerPC G3 chip and 32 megabytes of
memory, it's a relatively fast computer, performing basic tasks,
such as launching programs and switching between them at speeds
comparable to Windows machines with similar specifications. If you
work with graphics-intensive programs, it will outrun most
Windows-based machines, but don't expect miracles for day-to-day
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac uses two kinds of connections for hardware. There's a
built-in Ethernet port for connecting the system to a network, and
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, ports. There are no serial nor SCSI
ports, which means any devices you connect to this will have to use
USB connections, or go through an adapter. Because USB is
relatively new, there are not yet a lot of USB-based products,
though many are promised from manufacturers. Adapters are available
in the $50-$60 range.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac comes with a 56K modem _ I couldn't get it to do better
than 33.6, which apparently is a common complaint among many new
iMac owners _ and a 24-speed CD-ROM drive. Two small,
mediocre-sounding speakers are built into the front of the case.
The built-in, 15-inch monitor is an excellent display.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the iMac's floppy-free concept: it's definitely an
idea way ahead of its time. Apple argues the floppy is dead, and
raises this question: ``When was the last time you used your floppy
disk drive?'' They say that most software today comes on CD-ROM,
and that most data files are bigger than the floppy's 1.44-megabyte
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe hyper-geeks who are comfortable burning their own CD-ROM
disks think the floppy is dead, but most home users still rely on
the format. What about children working on Macs at school who want
to bring their efforts home on floppy disk?
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, there's no removable-disk standard that's
taken the floppy's place. Consumers can choose from a variety of
formats _ 100-megabyte Iomega Zip drives, LS120 SuperDrives,
Syquest's 1- and 1.5-gigabyte SparQ drives and Sony's upcoming
high-density floppies. The Zip drive has a bigger installed base,
but it's by no means a standard.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to buy an external drive, you'll have to pay about
$90 for a USB-based floppy, which is ridiculous for a consumer
machine. If you decide to move up to a larger format, such as the
LS120, you'll pay $120 and more.
</P>
<P>
   If its designers were going to insist on leaving out the floppy,
Apple should have made an external floppy an option in the $30
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lack of a floppy drive, my only serious complaint
about the iMac has to do with its mouse. The design is, frankly, an
abomination. The mouse is flat and round, like a pancake. It's
uncomfortable to use in a long computing session. And because it's
perfectly round, you've got no tactile sense of where the ``top''
of the mouse is pointing. After a while, I find that I've lost the
mouse's orientation and must adjust it. Fortunately, because it's a
USB-based mouse, it's easy to replace. Companies like Logitech that
make mice are going to make a killing.
</P>
<P>
   (At first, I thought this was just me, so I asked some of the
artists at work who are longtime Mac users to give it a try. They
hated it, too.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are the owner of an aging Mac at home, such as one of the
older Performa models, and you've been waiting for Apple to create
a compelling new consumer offering, you need wait no longer. The
iMac is a must for you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of the millions of people who have yet to take
part in the personal computer revolution and have not yet learned
how to use a computer, the iMac is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a novice Windows user who hates hassling with the
quirks and shortcomings of that operating system _ and if you don't
have a large investment in applications software _ the iMac is
worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm a Windows kinda guy, it feels very good to be able to
once again recommend a Macintosh to certain readers. Thanks, Apple.

PRETTIER GRAPHICS WITHOUT TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The graphics on some Web pages are distorted.
Is there something I can do to make them clearer? I can't even read
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blurred
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BLURRED: Well, I always try to sober up a bit before I
begin surfing.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, your display settings are probably wrong.
Web graphics are usually designed from a palette of at least 256
colors. If your computer is only displaying 16 colors, the graphics
are going to look like bad photocopies of somebody's hindquarters,
which, incidentally, I wish you people would stop mailing me.
</P>
<P>
   If you have enough video memory to display more colors, changing
your settings will make everything look better. In Windows 95/98,
right-click on an empty spot on the desktop and pick Properties
from the menu that appears. On the Settings tab is a box showing
available color settings. Make the change, then do a restart.
</P>
<P>
   If that box only shows 16 colors, you either don't have enough
video memory or you don't have the right display driver, the little
program that tells your display what it's capable of. If you have a
name-brand PC, go to the manufacturer's Web site and download the
correct driver for your model. If you have a clone or a junker,
you'll have to figure out who built the motherboard or video card,
then hope the manufacturer has a download site.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What is pipe cache?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Dark
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DARK: Isn't that something crackheads need to get high? I,
of course, know nothing about such things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``pipeline'' cache is a different matter altogether.
Pipelining is the continuous flow of instructions to the processor
chip. While the chip is working on one instruction, another is
already in the pipeline, sort of like in the assembly line at GM,
unless those parts plants go on strike again.
</P>
<P>
   A cache is a chunk of memory dedicated to holding that sort of
data temporarily, making it rapidly accessible to the
microprocessor. Think of it as a waiting room for your data. Stuff
may be coming in or going out too fast for some component to handle
it, so it waits temporarily in the cache until it can be processed.
Generally speaking, microprocessors can handle data much faster
than regular memory can deliver it. Cache memory serves it up
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Level-1 (or L1) cache memory is built into the microprocessor
and delivers its load more quickly. PowerPC chips use L1. L2 is
usually on a separate chip, but still faster than regular RAM. And,
as with everything else in computing except the price tag, the
bigger the number, the better. Most current PCs have 512K caches.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't you sorry you asked? Most people just ignore all those
numbers and get the computer than runs fastest in the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Are you in favor of forcing computer
administrators to speak English?
</P>
<P>
   Englishmajor\Nnamelesscorp.mad
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MAJOR: Yes. I also fervently believe that pigs can fly, and
the only reason they don't is a lack of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Computer geeks are no different. They too often live in their
own little world of bits and bytes, falling into an arcane patois
of their own making that only their ilk understand, seeing no
compelling reason to leap out of their trees. But if you take one
out to the ballgame, buy him some nachos and pump a few beers in
him, you'll find he's pretty much the same as any other human, and
can even speak your language if pressed. But if he starts yapping
about pipeline cache while McGwire's up to bat, just pop him one in
the schnoz.

 Por JACK EPSTEIN 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brasil _ Apenas es la hora de almorzar, pero ya
decenas de clientes esperan por una mesa en el exterior del
restaurante Couve Flor, uno de los restaurantes mas exitosos de Rio
de Janeiro: sirve diariamente a mas de 600 personas y el doble de
esa cifra los fines de semana. Su variada seleccion y sus platos
sabrosos atraen a los comensales. Pero el popular restaurante
carioca tiene otro importante ingrediente que seduce a los
consumidores: es uno de muchos restaurantes de ``comida por kilo''
que no cobran por lo que piden los clientes sino por la cantidad
que comen. Es un concepto que se ha extendido en el sector
gastronomico brasileno desde principios de los anos 90,
principalmente cerca de los edificios de oficinas y de las zonas
comerciales urbanas. ``Practicamente es una fiebre,'' afirma Jair
Pinto, dueno del Couve Flor, que convirtio su restaurante italiano
al concepto de la comida por kilo en 1993.
 &HT;    En realidad, a algunos les va tan bien que se han convertido en
grandes competidores de franquicias de restaurantes de comida
rapida como McDonald's, Pizza Hut y Kentucky Fried Chicken. En los
ultimos meses, varias franquicias de comida rapida han reducido sus
precios, entre ellas McDonald's, que los bajo el 18 por ciento, y
Bob's, una cadena brasilena de hamburguesas, que los redujo el 5
por ciento. ``La comida por kilo nos esta quitando algun negocio,
sin duda,'' dice Marcelo Barbosa, administrador de un
establecimiento Bob's en el centro comercial de Rio Sul.
 &HT;    En general, los restaurantes de comida por kilo ofrecen un bufe
de platos calientes y frios, que se pesan junto a la caja
registradora. Muchos son centros pequenos que abren de lunes a
viernes, solo a la hora del almuerzo. En el segmento de menores
ingresos, estos restaurantes sirven varios platos calientes, como
el plato tipico brasileno compuesto por arroz, frijoles negros,
espagueti y carne, por un precio entre US$5 y US$7 el kilo.
 &HT;    En el extremo de mas nivel economico, restaurantes como el Couve
Flor, situado en el elegante barrio Jardim Botanico, ofrecen 20
platos calientes, 23 ensaladas y 37 postres, a un costo de US$13,50
el kilo. Los comensales suelen ser secretarias ejecutivas y hombres
de negocios a los que no les preocupa el precio mas alto. A los
clientes no solo les atrae la idea de pagar por la cantidad que
comen sino tambien la variedad de los platos, entre ellos comidas
sin grasa como ensaladas. ``Me gusta comer ligero, pero con los
restaurantes a la carta, nunca se sabe lo que uno va a recibir ni
que cantidad de comida le van a servir,'' dice Fernanda Marsena,

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brasil _ Apenas es la hora de almorzar, pero ya
decenas de clientes esperan por una mesa en el exterior del
restaurante Couve Flor, uno de los restaurantes mas exitosos de Rio
de Janeiro: sirve diariamente a mas de 600 personas y el doble de
esa cifra los fines de semana. Su variada seleccion y sus platos
sabrosos atraen a los comensales. Pero el popular restaurante
carioca tiene otro importante ingrediente que seduce a los
consumidores: es uno de muchos restaurantes de ``comida por kilo''
que no cobran por lo que piden los clientes sino por la cantidad
que comen. Es un concepto que se ha extendido en el sector
gastronomico brasileno desde principios de los anos 90,
principalmente cerca de los edificios de oficinas y de las zonas
comerciales urbanas. ``Practicamente es una fiebre,'' afirma Jair
Pinto, dueno del Couve Flor, que convirtio su restaurante italiano
al concepto de la comida por kilo en 1993.
 &HT;    En realidad, a algunos les va tan bien que se han convertido en
grandes competidores de franquicias de restaurantes de comida
rapida como McDonald's, Pizza Hut y Kentucky Fried Chicken. En los
ultimos meses, varias franquicias de comida rapida han reducido sus
precios, entre ellas McDonald's, que los bajo el 18 por ciento, y
Bob's, una cadena brasilena de hamburguesas, que los redujo el 5
por ciento. ``La comida por kilo nos esta quitando algun negocio,
sin duda,'' dice Marcelo Barbosa, administrador de un
establecimiento Bob's en el centro comercial de Rio Sul.
 &HT;    En general, los restaurantes de comida por kilo ofrecen un bufe
de platos calientes y frios, que se pesan junto a la caja
registradora. Muchos son centros pequenos que abren de lunes a
viernes, solo a la hora del almuerzo. En el segmento de menores
ingresos, estos restaurantes sirven varios platos calientes, como
el plato tipico brasileno compuesto por arroz, frijoles negros,
espagueti y carne, por un precio entre US$5 y US$7 el kilo.
 &HT;    En el extremo de mas nivel economico, restaurantes como el Couve
Flor, situado en el elegante barrio Jardim Botanico, ofrecen 20
platos calientes, 23 ensaladas y 37 postres, a un costo de US$13,50
el kilo. Los comensales suelen ser secretarias ejecutivas y hombres
de negocios a los que no les preocupa el precio mas alto. A los
clientes no solo les atrae la idea de pagar por la cantidad que
comen sino tambien la variedad de los platos, entre ellos comidas
sin grasa como ensaladas. ``Me gusta comer ligero, pero con los
restaurantes a la carta, nunca se sabe lo que uno va a recibir ni
que cantidad de comida le van a servir,'' dice Fernanda Marsena,
secretaria de Rio. ``Con la comida por kilo, uno ve lo que va a
comer y controla lo que se sirve.''
 &HT;    El concepto de pesar la comida en los restaurantes comenzo en
1990, despues que el entonces presidente Fernando Collor de Mello
congelo todas las cuentas de ahorros por encima de US$1.000 durante
18 meses, como parte de un ataque radical contra la inflacion. Esa

 New Robotics Tap the Mind, Help the Heart  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heart bypass operations that require a deep chest incision could
soon be done with no more than a skin cut.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists unveiled yesterday a new robotic device, developed by
a Peninsula firm, that will allow doctors to perform the complex
operation by slipping a pencil-size instrument through a small cut
and controlling it remotely.
</P>
<P>
   The devicewas among a host of new robotic technologies,
including artificial muscles and robotic Legos, which SRI
International in Menlo Park showed off yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was part of a promotion for the robotic Legos,
which SRI helped develop. The toy, called Lego Mindstorm, is being
rolled out next week.
</P>
<P>
   SRI, a not-for-profit research center spun off by Stanford
University in the 1960s, has been the birthplace of some of Silicon
Valley's most important innovations, including the modem, the mouse
and liquid-crystal display technology.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old center has created technology behind such
wind-ranging products as household laundry detergent,
high-definition television, a medicine for malaria and a
telecommunications system for the hearing impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has been building robots since the 1960s, when a
roomful of computers was needed to operate a single robot costing
millions of dollars. Now, SRI is building sophisticated robots like
a mine-detection robot that can be mass-produced for as little as
$2,500, said S. Venkat Shastri, senior research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the institute's work is independent. Other research is
conducted under contract for government or commercial clients. In
the past few years, the institute has been spinning off businesses
with commercial potential. Total revenues from all ventures top
$300 million.
</P>
<P>
   One spin-off, Intuitive Surgical of Mountain View, is working on
a new surgical technique based on technology developed at SRI that
makes it possible for doctors to use minimally invasive surgery for
complex operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't cut you open with this technology,'' said Joel
Jensen, program manager at SRI. ``Instead of making a big incision,
the surgeon just pokes a tubelike instrument between the ribs.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike current instruments, which are hard to manipulate,
so-called telepresence instruments mimic the movements of the
surgeon's hand.
</P>
<P>
   SRI's device looks like a video arcade game. The surgeon sits at
a console, looks at a 3-D image and grasps the control handles.
Watching the screen, the doctor manipulates the surgical
instruments quickly and precisely _ just as in conventional
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Several tests of the new cardiac surgery were performed this
year, and Intuitive Surgical is in the process of applying to the
FDA for approval to market the system commercially.
</P>
<P>
   While Jensen performed mock surgery in one corner of the room,
Roy Kornbluh used electrical impulses to make an artificial
butterfly's wings flap.
</P>
<P>
   Kornbluh, a research engineer, is part of a team making
artificial muscles that work like real ones. Eventually, the
muscles may be used in prosthetic hands and other limbs, but
scientists currently are working with U.S. defense agencies on a
more unusual kind of project: building robotic bugs.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs _ cockroaches, mainly, and some butterflies _ could be
used as tiny spies, infiltrating enemy territory unnoticed,
Kornbluh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to pay attention to a butterfly fluttering
around you? Probably not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs use artificial muscles made from rubber and electrodes
and controlled by a microprocessor. They can carry tiny cameras or
microphones and send data back to military officials, transmitting
information about hostage situations, pictures of buildings,
battlefield terrain or even enemy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The bugs represent the newest generation of robots at SRI.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects include a robot called Magpie being used by Osaka
Gas of Japan to inspect gas lines. The same technology could be
used to inspect sewer lines, Shastri said, acting as ``remote
roto-rooters.''
</P>
<P>
   SRI is also developing robots that look for hidden land mines,
Shastri said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on display was a simple robot-building kit developed by
SRI, MIT and Lego that will be mass produced and sold in stores,
starting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Lego Mindstorm, the $200 kit contains all the
equipment _ microprocessor, CD-ROM, 727 Lego pieces, light and
touch sensors and two motors _ needed to build a robot that can
walk across a table, wink, and deal cards. Kids can program the
robot to do other things as well.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists see the kit as a tool for learning and creativity:
Kids learn simple programming and problem-solving and get to put
their ideas into action.

PRESIDENTS' FROLICS WITH WOMEN WHO WERE NOT THEIR WIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Long before Bill Clinton strayed off the marriage
reservation, presidents and presidents-to-be frolicked through
affairs with women who were not their wives or who were other men's
wives.
</P>
<P>
   Not all such liaisons were consummated. But some were torrid
anyway, and all were memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Take this example:
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was warm. The sofa was soft. We held each other
close, closer. ... Wouldn't it be wonderful if this were the day we
conceived a baby _ our very first time. Ike was very tender,
careful, loving. But it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   So wrote Kay Summersby, an English woman who served four years
during World War II as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's driver and,
according to her memoirs, the woman he loved.
</P>
<P>
   Although they talked about having a child, Summersby explained,
she and Eisenhower never consummated their love because his
inability to do so. He may have been too stricken with guilt to
perform the sex act because his wife of nearly 30 years, Mamie, was
waiting in Washington for his return from war.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Harry Truman told a biographer that Ike had written
to Gen. George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff, saying he
wanted to get a divorce and marry Summersby. In reply, Truman said,
an irate Marshall threatened to bust Ike out of the army if he ever
did such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   When Ike returned from Europe in 1945 to succeed Marshall as
chief of staff, the affair ended. He later became president of
Columbia University, supreme commander of NATO forces and in 1952 a
successful candidate for president on the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Ike's relationship with Summersby never became
a public issue although there was some gossip about it because the
two had been photographed together many times.
</P>
<P>
   Summersby had written a book when the war ended about her
service with Ike without even hinting at romance. Then, in the
1970s, when she was dying of cancer and he was already dead, she
wrote her second book, ``Past Forgetting: My Love Affair with
Dwight D. Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the father of our country had his amorous longings for
another man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Young George Washington cared deeply for Sally Fairfax, who was
married to his friend and neighbor, George William Fairfax.
Washington confessed his love in a letter to her written in 1758,
when he was 26 years old and engaged to marry Martha Custis, who
became his wife.
</P>
<P>
   As the drive for American independence gathered momentum, the
Fairfaxes remained loyal to George III and eventually returned to
England.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Thomas Jefferson was dispatched to Paris to
succeed Benjamin Franklin as American minister to France. There,
the 43-year-old widower from Virginia met and fell in love with an
English woman named Maria Cosway, 27, whose husband painted
miniature canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson and Mrs. Cosway spent many engrossing hours together,
and when she and her husband left Paris for London, Jefferson was
devastated. For some time thereafter, he and she kept up a
correspondence in which they spoke of their love for each other.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, historian Fawn M. Brodie, author of ``Thomas Jefferson:
An Intimate History,'' claimed that the letters exchanged between
the squire of Monticello and Mrs. Cosway were missives of such
ineffable tenderness that they constitute the most remarkable
collection of love letters in the history of the American
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Brodie was one of the historians who claimed that Jefferson
shared his bed for many years with Sally Hemmings, one of his
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jackson, who was elected president in 1828, and his wife
Rachel were excoriated as adulterers because they had married in
1791 thinking her divorce from her first husband, Lewis Robards,
was final. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   When Robards learned that they were living together as man and
wife, he sued her for divorce, charging them with adultery since
legally she still was Mrs. Robards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson and Rachel Robards were married legally in
1794, the adultery charge hounded them the rest of their lives.
Jackson contended that it contributed to her death in December
1828, shortly before his first presidential inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   At her burial Jackson said: ``I can and do forgive all my
political enemies. But those vile wretches who have slandered her
must look to God for mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half century after Jackson left the White House,
Republican opponents of Democratic presidential nominee Grover
Cleveland, a bachelor, converted his sexual escapade with one Maria
Halpin into a chant:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma, Ma, Where's my pa?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone to the White House, ha, ha, ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland and Halpin had produced a son, and he later affirmed
her claim that he was the father of the boy and agreed to pay child
support. Reports of his relationship with Halpin made for lurid
headlines in the 1884 presidential election _ which he won.
</P>
<P>
   Warren G. Harding is another president famous for his sexual
encounters. For many years before his nomination in 1920 Harding
had an affair with Carrie Phillips, the wife of one of his Ohio
friends. To avert scandal in the election, the Republican National
Committee sent the Phillipses on a voyage to Japan, paid them
$20,000 and then allocated modest monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   Harding's best-known affair was with Nan Britton, a worker in
his campaign who was 30 years his junior. After his death in 1923,
she claimed he was the father of her daughter and unsuccessfully
sought money from his estate. She then wrote a best-seller entitled
``The President's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, we have learned that Franklin D. Roosevelt had
a long-standing romance with Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd and that John
F. Kennedy enjoyed the sexual favors of Marilyn Monroe and numerous
other young women.
</P>
<P>
   So in the future, as we consider the qualifications of
presidential candidates, maybe we should also invoke the French
saying _ ``cherchez la femme'' (look for the woman).

 A Software Survivor, Symantec's CEO Says the Thrill Isn't Gone  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gordon Eubanks started cranking out PC software way back in
1975, singer Paul Simon ruled the charts with his hit ``Still Crazy
After All These Years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 23 years later, as chief executive of Symantec Corp.,
Eubanks still is grinding out anti-virus software and, hopefully,
quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many (computer) people from the '70s or even the
'80s who are still around,'' Eubanks reflected the other day,
citing a tiny club that includes Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, Eubanks didn't invite me to his Cupertino
headquarters to stroll down memory lane. He was flogging Symantec's
new product, a $100 software suite called SystemWorks that includes
a slew of utilities to prevent disk crashes, repair system glitches
and cure viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks is a great source, one of the rare execs who is both
candid and accessible. So of course, I was happy to listen. But as
I sat there thinking this sounded like the software equivalent for
new-formula Metamucil, I wondered: How does Eubanks feel after all
these years on the job?
</P>
<P>
   At 51, he's forced to compete with the likes of 43-year-old
Network Associates chieftain Bill Larson, who has boundless
ambition and a seemingly insatiable appetite for buying smaller
anti-virus and software utilities firms.
</P>
<P>
   So as politely as possible, I asked Eubanks whether the thrill
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He blinked, like he couldn't understand why I'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a job like this, you're the steward of something more
important than yourself,'' he said. ``It isn't about making the
most money, it's about creating jobs and creating value for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Having survived the '70s and '80s, when many software firms
flopped because they made ``cool'' rather than ``useful'' their
watchword, Eubanks is fanatic about the corny notion of giving good
value.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks insisted that his customer-care formula would repel the
onslaught of Network Associates and other barbarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can provide customers with a superior value, we're
betting we take more share from our competitors than from
ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Young blood: &LR;  Stephan Schambach is software's latest
wunderkind. At 28, he is chief executive of Intershop
Communications, a San Francisco firm that sells the software used
by companies like Hewlett-Packard and Electronic Arts to run their
electronic-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry of young studs, Schambach has an added
distinction. He and co-founders Wilfried Beeck, 38, and Karsten
Schneider, 34, are natives of what once was East Germany who caught
entrepreneurial fever after the Berlin Wall fell.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in his office overlooking Multimedia Gulch,
Schambach explained how Intershop's e-commerce software was a
byproduct of his first business _ selling and installing PCs in
Jena, in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to phone in orders to his supplier, Schambach got tired
of waiting on hold. A self-described technology freak, Schambach
used a NeXT workstation, Steve Jobs' spectacular hardware failure
of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But even in failure, NeXT spawned one insanely great thing: The
World Wide Web was developed on NeXT computers, and Schambach was
one of the first to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   So in his spare time, Schambach wrote a program to put his
supplier's 20,000-product inventory into a Web page. He offered to
sell the software to his supplier in 1994. When they refused, he
offered to give it away to save the aggravation of ordering by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   When the supplier again refused, Schambach decided to start
Intershop. In 1996, he got $1 million in seed funding from one of
Germany's two venture capital firms and flew to San Francisco to
locate his new company in the heart of Net country.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he employs 100 people in San Francisco and another 150 or
so in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Intershop went public on the Neuer Markt, Germany's
version of the Nasdaq, where investors valued it at $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schambach smiled as he told me the punch line. About the same
time Intershop was going public, his old supplier, the one that
wouldn't take his software for free, sold itself to a larger firm
for about one-ninth of Intershop's market cap.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be young, rich and enjoy such revenge!
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; No exit? &LR;  How does Silicon Valley cook up so many companies
and create so many jobs? Insiders cite three reasons: lots of smart
entrepreneurs, plenty of early stage money to back startups, and a
stock market receptive to new offerings, giving financiers and
execs an ``exit strategy'' _ that is, a way to get rich quick.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries have the brains, and some are developing
Valley-style venture funds. What has been lacking is stock markets
to buy up shares in young firms to create this exit path.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I think the Neuer Markt, which has listed some two

 AMD's New Chip Can't Catch Intel  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its race to keep up with Intel, Advanced Micro Devices will
unveil a faster version of its K6-2 chip Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But AMD's 350 megahertz chip already is lagging Intel's 450 MHz
Pentium II processor, which was announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they're making good progress with the K6 and
ramping up the clock speed,'' said Linley Gwennap, editor of
Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ``That's good news
for AMD, but Intel keeps running faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dana Krelle, vice president of marketing for AMD's computer
products group, conceded, ``We are not quite able to match them all
the way up the line, but we're closing the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which is based in Sunnyvale, has been Intel's biggest
thorn, pioneering the chips for personal computers that sell for
under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel of Santa Clara, the world's largest chipmaker, now
concedes that it was late in recognizing the importance of the
low-cost PC and this week unveiled a new version of its inexpensive
Celeron chip.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a lower-priced chip, Intel won't match AMD's prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same performance level, AMD is 25 to 30 percent less
expensive,'' Gwennap said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's 450-MHz Pentium II, for instance, will sell in volume to
PC-makers for $669, while AMD's 350-MHz chip is selling in bulk for
$317 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Krelle said AMD will have a 400-MHz chip out later this year.

 &HT;    Trying for photo of Roop.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and ELLIOT JASPIN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ It started out as a straight trade, tools for
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Roop, a man worn thin by manual labor, offered up his
electric saw to the pawn shop clerk at a suburban strip mall along
Route 1 in Fairfax County. Outside in a battered pickup truck his
longtime companion, Cassandra Stewart, waited patiently. She needed
the money he would get for his saw to pay for medicine to ease the
pain of a chronic pancreas condition.
</P>
<P>
   But as Roop counted out the money he got for pawning his saw,
another problem loomed. A few months earlier Stewart had run out of
medicine and Roop had pawned his prized shotgun. If he didn't use
$8 from the money he got for the saw to meet his monthly payment on
the shotgun, he would lose the gun forever.
</P>
<P>
   Roop is puzzled. It's not supposed to be like this. It's
supposed to be like it was for his father, a blue-collar worker who
worked his way up to foreman, bought a house, raised a family and
prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a greedy person,'' Roop said. ``I'm just trying to
make a living. And I'm willing to work from daylight to dark. But I
just can't seem to get a toe hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Roop works full-time as a heavy equipment operator. At 33 he has
worked all of his adult life. He is up every morning at 5 o'clock
bursting to start work. In the afternoons, he is calling the office
every few minutes lining up a job for the next day. Until recently
Stewart worked too at a supermarket. But despite today's Tiffany
economy, men like Paul Roop are finding it harder to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Roop and Stewart, with whom he has lived since 1994, are part of
what the U.S. Department of Labor classifies as ``the working
poor.'' They are two of the nearly 7.4 million Americans who live
near the official poverty level _ $10,850 a year for couples,
$16,450 for a family of four _ but make too much to qualify for
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse, economists say the ranks of men like Roop are
growing. When economists look at the U.S. economy they see a giant
poker game where a few have won most of the chips while everyone
else at the table is scrambling to win a hand just to stay in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter century, the incomes of those making more
than $100,000 have increased 30 percent while those making less
than $25,000 have seen their incomes shrink by 21 percent,
according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,
a nonprofit group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite unprecedented economic growth, including the lowest
unemployment and inflation rates in decades, the poverty level of
the United States has remained almost immune to improvement in the
past decade. Today, 36.5 million Americans, 13.7 percent of the
population, live in poverty, even with modest wage gains in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent gain in wages is a welcome reversal of long-term
wage decline, but most working families are still playing
catch-up,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the nonprofit
Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the gap between the haves and have-nots can be
seen all too clearly along this ragged stretch of Route 1 where
Roop is literally going into hock.
</P>
<P>
   Route 1 cuts through the eastern edge of Fairfax County, one of
the richest counties in the United States. Between 1990 and 1996,
Fairfax County residents with annual incomes exceeding $100,000
increased an astounding 11.21percent, from 16.39 percent to 27.60
percent, according to Claritas, an economic research firm. But its
middle and working classes have not reaped the economic benefits
that its wealthier residents have.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Seay, owner of the pawnshop where Roop brings his
possessions, knows this only too well. Seay boasts that business is
so good in Fairfax County he only has to work two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   While statistics are difficult to come by, Professor Robert
Johnson of the Credit Research Bureau at Georgetown University
estimates that the number of pawnshops like the one Seay operates
have doubled in the last 10 years. And most of that growth, he
says, is in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in pawnshops that cater to people like Roop has been so
phenomenal that five chains are now listed on either the New York
Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   And along with pawnshops have come check cashing outlets. Roop,
for example, cannot scrape together enough money to open a checking
account. He cashes his payroll checks at a check-cashing outlet for
a 2 percent fee. He pays his bills with money orders, 25 cents each
at a local convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four months, he has been operating heavy equipment
for Driggs at $13.50 an hour, with no benefits. He gets between 30
and 37 hours of work each week, sometimes not enough to cover his
meager living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Before the job at Driggs, he worked for 13 years at Dyna
Electric, getting $15.50 an hour making traffic lights, a job he
had held since dropping out of high school. But he was laid off
last December, two weeks before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra has applied for a $7-an-hour job at a nearby Food Lion
grocery store, but her health and job history _ a series of
part-time and entry-level jobs _ have hindered her prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and politicians argue over why such a vibrant economy
would at the same time increase the ranks of the working poor. They
cite the decline of unions, the erosion of the minimum wage, the
shift from manufacturing to service jobs, the globalization of the
economy through trade and immigration, technology's demand for
skilled workers, tax policies that favor the rich over the poor and
changes in family structures.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the economic and policy chatter in Washington
matters much to Roop. Every cent he and Stewart spend has
consequences. Even a 60-cent candy bar poses a budget dilemma.
That's why pawning his shotgun was such a sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The .410 shotgun from Montgomery Ward was not expensive. And it
reaped only a $40 loan from the pawn shop. But to Roop, it was
special, a gift from his parents on his 15th birthday , and he had
used it to bag his first deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But medicine is more important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now with five $10 bills from pawning the saw, should he pay $8
to the pawn broker to hang on to the shotgun another month?
</P>
<P>
   He hands back one of the $10 bills to the pawn clerk. ``I don't
want to lose it,'' he would explain later. ``To me, it's worth a
million dollars.''

 Oracle Has Big Plans Online  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison has seen the company's
future _ and it is on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The database giant's chairman yesterday unveiled Oracle Online,
a plan to allow customers to lease Oracle programs and space on its
computers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Oracle, the plan is key to its battle to challenge
Microsoft's dominance of the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's future is based on the idea of Windows
everywhere,'' Ellison said at a press conference. ``We think that
will never happen. We think it will be the Web everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the world's second-largest software company, is trying
to shift more computing from the desktop to the Web, which Ellison
says is cheaper, easier to manage and more efficient for customers.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Oracle is readying new versions of its
database software and its application server that are able to
handle the traffic and demands of Web computing.
</P>
<P>
   With Web-based computing such as the Oracle Online scheme,
applications would be debugged, upgraded and maintained on a
central server instead of on each personal computer, and users
would access them using a Web browser, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about a massive paradigm shift,'' Ellison said.
``We're betting very heavily that's how the world will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft responded yesterday by chiding Ellison for
``apparently being consumed with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile we remain entirely focused on our customers, and
we'll see who builds the best technology,'' said Greg Shaw, a
spokesman for the Redmond, Wash., software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison said Oracle expects to introduce Oracle Online soon, but
he did not specify an exact date. Oracle Online is aimed at
small-and medium-size businesses that would otherwise have to buy
expensive hardware and set up complex computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not have to install software. All you would have to
do is log onto Oracle Online, and we'd do it all for you,'' Ellison
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his typically ebullient style, the 54-year-old executive
detailed ways other companies could customize Oracle Online. One
example would be a ``Yahoolike service'' for doctors, in which
physicians log onto a secure Web site containing such data as
patient records, billing information and pharmaceutical
information. Doctors could go to the same site to use a software
program that would do their accounting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors want to figure out how Windows NT works. They want to
figure out how your body works,'' Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Oracle Online service would be an industry
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jaw was on the ground. I haven't seen anything like it,''
said Juliana Nelson, an analyst at International Data Corp. in
Mountain View. She said the success of Oracle Online will depend on
its pricing, which wasn't divulged yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson called Ellison's focus on Web computing ``dead on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry was saying they're making a bet (on Web computing). I
don't think it's a bet. It's happening,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Web computing ``is the best possible positioning for them to
assume in their battle with Microsoft,'' said Merv Adrian, an
analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's event at Oracle headquarters was designed to show
off the newest version of its application server, a crucial piece
of the company's Internet strategy. The program acts as a
go-between that makes it easy for users to pull database
information and programs off of a central server. Oracle said its
Application Server 4.0 can handle 10 times more data and 10 times
more users than previous versions.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle 8i, the newest version of Oracle's database, is due out
by Christmas, said Mark Jarvis, senior vice president of worldwide
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The database, Oracle's first to adopt the popular Java
programming language, is designed to ``do everything to set up
electronic commerce,'' Jarvis said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You log onto the Internet one day, and it's blazingly fast; no
more World Wide Wait. Pulling up Web pages is instantaneous. Your
e-mail soars by more quickly than you can read it. Information is
at your fingertips with hardly a pause.
</P>
<P>
   A dream of the future? No, it's the Internet of yesterday: no
graphics, no fancy software, simply unformatted text in an
80-character-by-24-line window.
</P>
<P>
   With a few bits of knowledge in hand, you can gain access to the
World Wide Web, your e-mail, terabytes of file archives and other
Internet resources using telnet, a piece of Internet technology
that has been aged to perfection over the last 30 years. It's fast,
efficient and less subject to the vagaries of regularly changing
bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Telnet is a method of typing text on your own computer which
gets sent over the Internet to another computer, either at the next
desk or on the next continent. Through text commands, just like
those found in MS-DOS, you can operate this other computer.
</P>
<P>
   This can amount to something as simple as listing the files in a
directory or as complex as reading e-mail or Web browsing _ all
without pictures, buttons or clicking.
</P>
<P>
   Working over the Internet, telnet connects a computer using a
program that runs on, for example, a PC with Windows 98, to another
machine that can handle several users at once, like a mainframe or
a server computer. (The server is typically running the Unix
operating system, but Microsoft Windows NT and other computer
systems can handle telnet as well.)
</P>
<P>
   After connecting, you can execute programs on that separate
machine, just as if you were typing on a keyboard directly
connected to that machine.
</P>
<P>
   To run a program, type the command and hit enter; this is why it
is called a command-line interface _ as opposed to the graphical
user interface, with icons and mouse movements, that describes both
the Macintosh and Windows operating systems. The server runs the
software you specify and displays the results. There are no images.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, let's say you are on vacation overseas, with your
laptop far behind, and you want to read your e-mail. Find any
computer with an Internet connection, no matter how slow, and you
can connect to your Internet service provider or your company's
computer with little fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people still use telnet every day around the world
to handle their e-mail, write software, search library collections
and create documents _ all without a graphic in sight.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, telnet is often favored by programmers and the
visually impaired. Speed is also a benefit: because it is
text-based, even the slowest possible connection still seems perky.
</P>
<P>
   Telnet was developed in the early 1970s, when the collection of
networks that would later come to be called the Internet first
allowed university researchers to connect to machines all over the
country by directly dialing into a modem connected to those
machines. Telnet evolved as a way to operate those distant machines
while taking advantage of the nascent network.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and military personnel were the original audience;
many computer scientists still rely on it as their primary tool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telnet's original purpose was to mimic older machines that had a
single function: sending and receiving text through a wire
connected directly to a mainframe computer. The first of these
devices, the teletypewriter, or tty, was just a typewriter and a
roll of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Later advances brought a monitor-and-keyboard combination called
a video-display terminal, or VDT, but users still exchanged only
text. Graphics required too much computer horsepower, and the
connection speeds were far too slow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not every server or mainframe will allow someone to telnet in.
Some corporations and other institutions have firewalls, or
software that acts as a protective barrier between machines inside
the institution and those outside. These firewalls often prevent
outside users from using telnet via the Internet if they are
outside of the corporate network. Secure versions of telnet that
exchange encrypted information may be used in these cases.
</P>
<P>
   So why use such an ancient mechanism, aside from the geek appeal
and the desire to impress friends and colleagues with your
technical elan? For one thing, it works almost everywhere; for
another, a text-only connection can be extremely fast. There are
also some services you can't gain access to any other way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many libraries spent a lot of money in the 80s and early 90s
providing dial-up connection and telnet access to their catalogs
and related information. Most of those services remain active and
updated _ and not on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Public Library, for instance, maintains a full
searchable catalog via telnet at spl.lib.wa.us. Seattle library
patrons can also request books on line and have them transferred to
branches near them throughout the city, or get put on a waiting
list for the next available copy.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has long maintained a telnet service
(locis.loc.gov) for searching its vast information base and now
offers the same searching on the Web (www.loc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   With some ISPs, you can use a Web browser called Lynx after
establishing a telnet connection. Lynx is a program that runs on
the computer you connect to, and it retrieves the Web pages you
request and displays only the text from those pages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You navigate by using the arrows keys and the Tab, Enter and
space keys to move around and select links on the pages. Many Web
sites offer text-only versions of their sites, which are somewhat
easier to navigate with Lynx.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telnet may be quaint. But even though text-only telnet surfing,
e-mailing and word processing can be an odd experience on this
ever-more-graphical Internet, it can make a pokey connection into
Niagara Falls. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to Do It &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting the telnet software
</P>
<P>
   Windows: Windows 95, 98 and NT have a stripped-down version of
telnet software that is installed along with the built-in Internet
software. From the Start menu, select Run. At the prompt, enter
``telnet'' and hit Enter.
</P>
<P>
   More elaborate telnet programs are available as freeware or
shareware, or commercially. Dave Central, an index to resources on
the Web, lists 47 telnet programs
(www.davecentral.com/telnetclnt.html). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh: NCSA Telnet, formerly the most widely used telnet
program, has not been updated since 1995. Better Telnet, a more
recent adaptation of that original software, is available free from
Sassy Software (www.cstone.net/rbraun/mac/telnet). For other
choices for Macs, see www.macatawa.org/mthomas/telnet.html. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecting via telnet is simple: enter the full name of the
remote machine or its Internet Protocol (IP) number. For example,
subscribers to Panix, a large Internet service in New York, connect
to either panix.com or 166.84.1.66; the name and address are
interchangeable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before using telnet to connect to a machine, you need a user
account on that server computer. Getting a user account is like
getting a room in a hotel; you can wander the halls at will, but
without the key to your suite, you can't get in to use the phone or
watch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Many ISPs used to include these accounts as part of the service.
Few nationwide providers now offer it, but many regional ones still
do. You can also get an account at a nonprofit community network or
local ``freenet.'' These free or inexpensive accounts often include
limited telnet access to run software like Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   With an account, you connect and enter your user name and
password as prompted. Some systems provide a menu of programs or
services. Others connect you directly to the equivalent of an
MS-DOS prompt, at which you type the name of the software, like
``lynx.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bit of warning: many servers, for security reasons, set off
internal alarms when someone connects via telnet, even when the
server computers automatically rebuff the attempt. To avoid a
problem, or even prosecution, connect only to services you signed
up for, or publicly advertised ones like library catalogs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A nice test drive for your newfound knowledge that does not
require a user account is the Library of Congress catalog. (Note
that many parts of the catalog are unavailable late at night and in
the wee hours.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Always press Enter after typing in text at each step below.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Connect to the Internet in whatever way you normally do (or
none at all if you're always on line). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Start your telnet program (this varies depending on your
software). If you're given a chance to select a ``terminal type'' _
the kind of old hardware that telnet will behave like _ select
vt100, which acts as a standard least common denominator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Enter the name of the Library of Congress Information System
server, locis.loc.gov. (Different telnet programs prompt you for
the name in different ways: in the built-in Windows telnet program,
select Connect from the File menu; in NCSA Telnet for Macintosh,
select Open Connection from the File menu. In either program, enter
locis.loc.gov in the field labeled Host Name.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Text will appear on the screen, giving you access to
different collections. Enter 1 to browse the library's catalog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. At the next screen, enter 3 to search books catalogd since
1975. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. The library's catalog has many somewhat cryptic commands, but
here is a sample search to get you started. Below the ``ready for

POOLSIDE POETRY, HIGH-TECH HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (sidebar with SWIMMING-POOL-DESIGN)  
 (bl)  
 By ELAINE LOUIE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   We wanted clean, simple, serene,'' the owner said. ``We wanted
to feel the air, the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   And so his pool-house-without-walls, in woodsy northwestern
Connecticut, is no more substantial than a breezeway with a
pavilion at each end. Yet with its playful evocation of Mies van
der Rohe's pavilion in Barcelona, Spain, and Philip Johnson's glass
house in New Canaan, Conn., it has more impact than the pool,
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Framed like a picture _ or a mirror _ the pool is edged in wide,
rosy flagstone and set in a crisp lawn. It faces a prairie meadow
of wild grasses, black-eyed Susans and ruffs of Queen Anne's lace
and reflects the pool house, the design of Elizabeth Demetriades, a
Manhattan architect, and her associate, Patrick Walker, a designer.
The pool and two surrounding acres are the work of Ken Smith, a
Manhattan landscape architect.
</P>
<P>
   The client and his wife, who prefer anonymity, have a 1968
Normandy-style brick weekend house but are modernists at heart.
Four years ago, the client called the architects separately and
told them what he wanted. The house and pool were to be on a
hayfield next to but hidden from the tennis court. The house was to
be self-sufficient, a spare yet friendly machine for leisure, where
the family could listen to Frank Sinatra (the adults) or the Blues
Brothers (the pre-teen-age daughters), grill steaks and watch
television.
</P>
<P>
   Who needed a main house? This was to be a pool house of earthly
and technological delights, airy yet sheltering. The enemies were
the gnats and mosquitoes and occasional summer squalls.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Demetriades designed a paradox: an open structure that also
defies insects. The trick? Screens that, with a press of a button,
roll down from the ceiling on three sides. (The fourth side, the
kitchen, has sliding aluminum doors.)
</P>
<P>
   The pool house is an homage to high-tech, but imbued with a
little poetry. From the main house, the approach is down a path to
a slanting retaining wall of stuccoed concrete, and then down 12
steps to the pool house, itself. The structure is silver gray, with
roof and siding of aluminum and zinc-coated steel. Ms. Demetriades
painted the poles and beams orange, like ``urban primed steel,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion on the west, shaped like a wedge, is the changing
room and bath, where translucent glass provides privacy while
letting light filter in. The changing room opens onto an outdoor
shower.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite pavilion, which houses a kitchen, is predictably
state-of-the-art. On a wall is a tiny screen, activated by touch.
It's a control center for this minimal house, regulating a network
of lights and four zones for music: there are amps by the pool,
under the roof, at the tennis court and by the barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The client asked Smith to point the pool to the unobstructed
south, so that it would reach toward the open sky. Smith calls the
pool and garden American Zen. ``It has the basic emptiness about
it, connecting the sky and the water,'' he explained. ``When you
look out, it seems very simple, very open, very infinite.''
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity is ``deceptive artifice,'' said Smith, who made
sure that the water was the same natural shade of the sky on any
given day by making the pool out of speckled gray concrete. ``If
you have a white-bottomed pool, like in California, the water looks
turquoise, and if you have a black-bottom pool, you get a mirror
effect. But if you choose medium-gray, the water looks like the
sky. It looks blue.''
</P>
<P>
   If simplicity was his mandate, what could be more artless than a
prairie meadow of wildflowers? But these flowers haven't been
randomly chosen. They are white shading into cream and canary, part
of a golden palette that contrasts with the water and sky. ``Reds
and purples would muddy the place,'' Smith said. So, he planted
thousands of black-eyed Susans, day lilies, tiny white asters and
feathery native grasses the color of wheat. Goldenrods were already
in the field, and the stalks of Queen Anne's lace were a
serendipitous gift of nature. ``They blew in,'' he said. They are
late bloomers, flowering from June to September, and so extending
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   To divide the pool from the rest of the property, Ms. Smith
created a viburnum hedge and a discreet handmade fence. Woven from
two-inch copper flashing and set into a redwood frame, it is
weathered gray, with only a few patches of copper glinting with the
original sheen.
</P>
<P>
   The client is so delighted that he wants Smith to design another
project for his 20-acre property. What does the man who already has
a tennis court and a pool want?
</P>
<P>
   A one-hole golf course.

   ``Blast From the Past''
</P>
<P>
   By Kinky Friedman
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster
</P>
<P>
   254 pages; $23
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE KINKSTER: A cigar-chomping Texan, Friedman was a
contemporary of the ``outlaw'' country movement of the early '70s,
which included Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Kinky also hung
out with Bob Dylan and penned tunes such as ``They Don't Make Jews
Like Jesus Any More.'' He turned to writing pop-culture-laden
mysteries years ago; all feature him in the starring role as a
gumshoe/singer/songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE BOOK: This latest take on the ol' Kinkster-on-the-case
formula is sort of a prequel to the others: Our hero is knocked out
and transported back to the decadent '70s, when he did lots of
cocaine, drank lots of Irish whiskey, slept on friends' couches,
scraped together a meager living playing New York clubs, and
generally was a down-but-not-out country singer.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT? Well, it has to do with what appears to be a vengeful
ghost. Noted radical Abbie Hoffman makes several appearances.
Gunshots are fired, an apartment is blown up, and there is much
drinking and a bit of breaking and entering before the whole thing
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   CAN I READ IT QUICKLY? Like, on a beach? Yes. Friedman's style _
peppered with wry humor and phrases like ``take a Nixon'' (used
whenever one has to go to the bathroom) _ is breezy.
</P>
<P>
   YEAH, BUT DO i WANT TO? Well ... yeah. But ``Blast'' is not
Kinky's best book: The plot is not exactly robust. Kinky is locked
into one style, and he doesn't veer from it, although one feels
that perhaps he should.
</P>
<P>
   Those who love the guy _ mainly folks over 30 who remember him
from 'way back when _ will devour this book. Those who have never
read him before may be better off starting with ``Greenwich Killing
Time'' to see what all the fuss is about.

   ``Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton''
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Wood Middlebrook
</P>
<P>
   281 pages, Houghton Mifflin, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHOR: An English professor at Stanford, Diane Wood
Middlebrook last wrote a biography of poet Anne Sexton. The genre
seems to be her forte; her research here is impeccable, especially
for a subject who left behind no written account of why she chose
to live her life the way she did.
</P>
<P>
   BILLY TIPTON, THE WOMAN: Born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma
City in 1914, Tipton lived her life as a man when she became aware
that a woman couldn't make a career as a jazz musician in the
Midwest. The secret wasn't revealed until a doctor's exam upon her
death in 1989. Even her five ex-wives and adopted children were
surprised to learn that their Billy was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   HOW'D SHE DO IT? The restroom door was always locked, the
bedroom lights always off and her torso bound, which she blamed on
rib damage from a car accident when she was young. She wouldn't let
her lovers touch her. Still, one wife claimed Billy was the best
lover she ever had.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNFOLDING: Middlebrook starts with Tipton's home life,
telling of her eccentric parents (her father was an inventor and
airplane enthusiast who would take the 6-year-old Dorothy on
daredevil wing walks).
</P>
<P>
   The most fascinating section chronicles the transformation from
Dorothy to Billy, and relates life in the misogynist jazz age. The
book is illustrated with photographs, some of which tell more than
anything the author could explain.
</P>
<P>
   PRONOUNS, PRONOUNS: Pay attention to the use of ``he'' and
``she.'' The author frequently interchanges them, using each as it
pertains to the aspect of Tipton's life being discussed at the
time.

 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet may be the world's largest confessional. Its
paradoxical combination of anonymity and intimacy provides fertile
ground for admissions that might never be aired in ``real'' life.
</P>
<P>
   Even when real names are known, the medium _ a step removed from
physical contact and thus, perhaps, from perceived consequences _
somehow evokes a closed-curtain, hush-toned closeness that draws
people out in occasionally astonishing ways.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who frequents a newsgroup, e-mail discussion group, or
chat room will eventually be privy to a confession _ of a lie, a
vice, or even a crime. In a recent dramatic example, a regular
participant in a Net support group for alcoholics admitted that he
had killed his daughter in North Dakota, and was arrested after
several members notified the police.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the man, Larry Froistad Jr., was given a 40-year
sentence with 10 years suspended as a result of a plea agreement in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   There are also Web sites that display or collect confessions. In
these sanctuaries, the act of confession is emphasized. The
audience is secondary. Take Confess.net (www.confess.net). At this
simple, spare site with its somehow soothingly straightforward
address, only the confession of the last visitor is displayed until
a new one is added. No identifying data are required, and the site
has no other content. This is the confessional as streamlined
application.
</P>
<P>
   Tane Langton, a New Zealander and web designer now living in
Prague, says he posted the site a few months ago for no other
reason than ``it's the kind of thing I'd like to use myself because
it's anonymous and public at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   A site that alternately allows all archived confessions to be
viewed is being collected as part of ``Surpu Masu,'' an event that
will take place Friday at the Burningman art festival in the Black
Rock Desert of Nevada. Surpu Masu will involve the burning of a
13-foot wooden ``sacrificial scapegoat'' stuffed with printouts of
the sins confessed to the Web site
(www.serv.net/jmurphy/anunaki/sm.html).
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle resident, Wally Glenn, one of the site's creators,
describes it as ``a mix of ancient mythology and a bit of
showmanship'' that borrows liberally from Sumerian, Chaldean, and
Semitic cultural symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite extreme of the public nature of Glenn's site is
The Ten Nines (www.fred.net/turtle/journal/tellme.html), a personal
confessional, for lack of another term, on the homepage of a
Baltimore computer consultant who goes by the online handle ``The
Turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's name is taken from John Brunner's cult sci-fi novel
``The Shockwave Rider,'' which describes an untappable, untraceable
phone confession line reached by dialing the number 9 ten times.
</P>
<P>
   The Turtle's version of The Ten Nines provides an open text box
where visitors can type a confession to him and him alone, but the
results are not posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Turtle does keep his own open Web diary called ``My Head
Talking'' that is linked to The Ten Nines. As a result, visitors
may feel they can use him as a ``disinterested sounding board,'' as
he puts it, because he's so open about his own life.
</P>
<P>
   While he won't quote directly from any of the dozens of postings
he says he's received, he says ``it's pretty amazing the range of
things that people will say when they're pretty sure that no one
can throw it back in their face. People have confessed to crimes.
People have told me stories of infidelities, revenge, fetishes and
perversions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may be reluctant to take the Turtle at his word, since
there's no way to review the messages he's received. In fact, that
goes for the confessions that are openly posted at various other
sites; there is no way to tell a true confession from a false one.
</P>
<P>
   But surely cabdrivers and bartenders, favored confessors of the
pre-online era, would confirm that people will tell strangers the
most amazingly personal things. With the ease _ and sense of
removal _ provided by technology, is it any surprise, as Glenn
says, that ``people want to confess and will use whatever means
possible''?

IF THE SHOE FITS _ OR NOT _ I'LL BUY IT

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shoes are covered in purple-and-white checked cloth, flecked
with little purple and green flowers; they have impossibly pointed
toes and lavender stiletto heels, one of which the cat has chewed.
Circa 1955. I call them my ``I Love Lucy'' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   I paid $2 for them 14 years ago at a garage sale, and since then
have had them on my feet for perhaps three hours total, possibly
because the pain involved is akin to that of childbirth. (Possibly
because they are purple.) Still, I hang on to them just in case
they someday miraculously fit.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I have a thing for shoes. So did Cinderella. So did
Dorothy. (Ruby slippers, anyone?) So do a lot of other women. So
many that a Fort Worth publisher this week introduces ``Shuz: Your
Complete Guide to What's Underfoot'' _ the first magazine dedicated
to shoe freaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer to call them shoe enthusiasts,'' editor Stacy Girard
said diplomatically. ``Shuz,'' published by Magnolia Media Group,
hit newsstands this week with the first of its twice-yearly issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has either been, `I don't get it' or `Oh my God!
I've got to have a copy!' '' Girard said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the average American woman owns 30 pairs of
shoes and that women's shoes are a $15 billion-a-year business,
it's a wonder that no one has thought of this before.
</P>
<P>
   But Girard notes that not even the fashion mags such as
``Vogue'' devote much space to shoes; models are often photographed
barefoot. This may owe much to the fact that a 6-foot-tall model
can rarely wedge her foot into one of those tiny size-5 samples.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the area of clothing, shoes may be the great
equalizer: Most of us will never look like Cindy Crawford, but we
can have her shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like trying on a bathing suit, where you have to look
at yourself, and maybe you don't like what you see,'' said Lori
Vargo, a staff psychologist at Temple University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your feet don't change as dramatically as the rest of your
body,'' she said. ``Shoes are just like the perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers figured that out a long time ago. There are many, many
stores devoted solely to shoes, but hardly any that sell, say, just
sweaters or tube tops. Part of that is due to the practicality of
shoes:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has to wear them.
</P>
<P>
   They're inexpensive; you can find great shoes for less than $50,
and even the best designer shoes cost far less than the best
designer dresses.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to unzip or unbutton anything to try them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something to the fact that people can be
serviced hand and foot, if you will,'' said Steve Lunder, vice
president of marketing for Dexter Shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone has to wait on you. It's a quick and easy purchase.
You can go in and find a shoe and be out very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to a true shoe lover, that misses the entire point.
The thrill is in the hunt _ in the feel of the leather or the
suede, in the shape of the heel or the cut of the upper.
</P>
<P>
   I have friends who can't pass a shoe window without pausing to
look; others who keep their many dozens of shoes neatly labeled in
their original shoe boxes; others who buy basically the same shoe
over and over, only with this heel a little higher, that buckle a
little smaller, or in patent leather instead of suede.
</P>
<P>
   That this obsession applies mostly to women is largely due to
the vagaries of fashion. Men have fewer options. They need black
dress shoes, maybe brown ones. A pair of casual shoes. Athletic
shoes. Maybe hiking boots or work boots. Sandals, if they're daring
or young.
</P>
<P>
   Women _ well, women need shoes to go with short skirts and long
skirts; for work, for formal occasions. For jeans, for casual
pants, for dress pants, for shorts. Pumps, sandals, loafers, boots;
high heels, low, in-between. There's a
</P>
<P>
   good reason most of us own at least 30 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   But if 30 is average, how many is too many? After I took
inventory last week, I began feeling like a shoe junkie.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the 10 pairs in my take-to-Goodwill stack, or the
sandals I wear only to water the lawn, or the aerobics shoes I
store in my trunk in case of, well, an aerobics emergency, I own
... 43 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not that many,'' Lunder said encouragingly. (Sure, but
this comes from a man who owns perhaps 20 pairs _ the average man
owns well under 10.)
</P>
<P>
   Um, but 19 pairs are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, when you're looking at the shoes, you see the subtle
differences,'' he reassures me.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a theory that is similar to the theory behind golf _
that the reason people like golf so much is that they always have
the potential to hit that perfect shot,'' Lunder says. ``It's the
same with shoes. There's always that potential that you'll find the
perfect pair of shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly explains why I once felt compelled to buy a pair of
purple-and-white stilettos, but still, just looking at those shoes
makes me happy. To a shoe enthusiast, that's enough.

BRITS SHOW TRUE LOVE FOR BROADWAY AT THE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Hearing a Broadway musical in Britain can be sort
of like serving up bangers and mash at an East Texas barbecue. No
matter how artfully the thing is done, you may well lose something
in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   Happily for British actors Lynn Redgrave and Patrick Stewart,
that was never the case. Redgrave became hooked on American
musicals as a child, when her famous father, Michael Redgrave,
would bring back sheet music and recordings from his frequent
Broadway trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a great fan of American musical theater,'' she
recalls. ``He worshiped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up under quite different circumstances, in England's
gritty industrial north, Stewart says he and his brother used to
sing snatches of musicals together while sitting up in the bed they
shared as boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all of my experience of American musicals probably for
the first 35 years from the movies,'' says the actor probably
best-known as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of TV's ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation.'' &UR;  &LR; ``So I was brought up with `Carousel,' `Oklahoma!'
`Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,' not to mention all those Doris
Day movies, Tab Hunter and so on, `An American in Paris,' `Singin'
in the Rain'.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend at the Hollywood Bowl, as part of a musical bill
that Redgrave jokingly dubs ``Brits on Broadway,'' she and Stewart
will perform selections from Broadway classics ``Camelot,''
``Sweeney Todd'' and ``The King and I.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the ``Broadway With Fireworks'' programs that the
Bowl typically uses to close out its summer seasons with a bang.
Earlier in the evening, conductor John Mauceri will lead the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra through suites from ``Ragtime,'' The Lion
King,'' ``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago,'' plus the Entr'acte from ``The
Sound of Music.'' The orchestra will wrap up with Jule Styne's
overture from ``Gypsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Redgrave can cite several breakthrough youthful encounters with
Broadway. She remembers getting the sheet music for Irving Berlin's
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and later seeing Chita Rivera in ``West
Side Story'' when that musical swept London's West End.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s through the early 1960s, Broadway musicals
expressed postwar America's buoyancy and drive, while setting new
standards for dancing, subject matter and plain old-fashioned
spectacle. At the same time the Broadway musical was basking in its
golden age, British musicals of the time ``were all tennis
rackets'' and romantic high jinks, Redgrave says.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that when Redgrave was in New York City in 1966 to
publicize ``Georgy Girl,'' the comedy-of-manners film that launched
her movie career, she asked Columbia Pictures to get her tickets to
see Angela Lansbury in ``Mame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just adored it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Britons of his generation, Stewart developed his first
mental pictures of America from movies _ which, as often as not,
meant Astaire and Rogers hoofing their way up a spiral staircase,
or Technicolor MGM fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my impressions of America came from movies, or maybe a
copy of the Saturday Evening Post that I'd managed to get my hands
on,'' he says. ``So until I was a little older and saw movies by
(Elia) Kazan and (John) Cassavetes, my image of the United States
was that it consisted of white picket fences and tree-lined
streets, or else the Wild West, plains and mountains and oceans of
grain. I had a kind of National Geographic idea of what America
looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Stewart says, he's especially looking forward to
doing the selections from ``Sweeney Todd _ The Demon Barber of
Fleet Street,'' the blackly comic Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler
show about a deranged London haircutter who slits his customers'
throats and bakes their bodies in pies. Stewart calls Sondheim's
score ``one of the most emotionally powerful of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a role that I have fantasized playing ever since I heard
the recording of it,'' he says. ``First of all, the score is
brilliant, brilliant in its musicality, brilliant in the way it
communicates the madness and passion of Sweeney, in the way it
communicates the time, in the way it drives the story forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in recent years several prominent British
directors have been revisiting American musicals and gleaning
darker themes and visual subtexts from them. Nicholas Hytner's
recent production of ``Carousel'' for Britain's Royal National
Theatre (which played at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre) placed a
strong emphasis on the musical's class divisions and its plotline
involving domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Nunn's current London revival of ``Oklahoma!'' reportedly
looks past the reassuring Corn Belt homilies of the Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical to the isolation and loneliness that also
framed the American frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be in the English nature a tendency to look for
perhaps some darker and even grimmer undertones in all kinds of
work,'' Stewart observes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Redgrave, who lives with her husband in Topanga, took
another big step toward Americanization: She officially became a
U.S. citizen, primarily, she says, so she'd be entitled to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't ready for it for a long time,'' she says of
becoming a citizen, ``not that it makes any difference to anyone
else. It's more a sentimental gesture to oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she intends to stay in the United States, which she calls
a ``bigger pasture'' than Britain, she still occasionally gets
pangs for her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a bit of music that takes you back to the green
fields and the lushness that only England seems to have in the
summer, or the smell of, I don't know, an English sausage!
Something quintessentially English.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone for adding English sausages to the Bowl takeout menu?

AN INVITATION TO DRESS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's time to hit the cummerbund trail again.
</P>
<P>
   The annual black-tie season begins next week with the L.A.
Opera's opening night of ``Carmen'' at the Music Center, followed
by enough dress-up opportunities to keep your social calendar
filled until June '99. But don't count on your little black dress
for everything.
</P>
<P>
   It may look dated, now that the fashion police have relaxed
their standards and theme parties are back in style. In addition to
seeing the term !ital!creative!off! black tie, you'll be seeing
invitations to wear something from the roaring '20s, the swing
dance era, or the cocktail-crazed '50s. But don't worry about
finding a dress, as designers have gone back to the past and made
it our future.
</P>
<P>
   This year you'll find gowns in all price ranges, inspired by
numerous decades. The '20s flapper dress with beaded fringe has
made a comeback, right along with dropped-waist gowns that might
have been worn in the big-band era. Cocktail suits and tiny
feathered hats inspired by the '50s are new, and it's ditto for the
slinky sequined sheaths of old Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like a costume parade, you're right. Anything that
looks too spare ... too early '90s ... has been upstaged by luxe
looks and flashy details. But a feather boa, fringed piano scarf or
velvet shrug (a tiny capelet with cap sleeves) could freshen it up
and get you to the party in style.
</P>
<P>
   When the invitation says:
</P>
<P>
   BLACK TIE &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; Yes, this means you must wear a tuxedo and a black
bow tie. A single-button jacket is the most popular style and can
be worn with a cummerbund (pleats up) or a brocade vest, plus those
shiny tuxedo pumps. The newest styles have satin insets in both
peak and notch lapels and satin accents on pockets and sleeves. For
women, it translates into a long, formal evening gown with dress-up
shoes. If you've got a fur coat, this is the time to wear it.
</P>
<P>
   CREATIVE BLACK TIE: Ah, a little freedom from the traditional
black-tie ensemble. You'll still wear a tuxedo, but you can wear a
collarless dress shirt without a tie and black suede Hush Puppies
instead of tuxedo pumps. For an edgier look, try a four-button
cardigan-style tuxedo jacket, a classic smoking jacket or a club
suit with traditional tie like Tom Cruise wore to the Oscars. For
her, it could be a short or long evening dress worn with strappy
high-heeled sandals that show off bare feet and painted toenails.
Sometimes referred to as California black tie.
</P>
<P>
   COCKTAIL ATTIRE _ This dress code was originally designed for
parties held before the dinner hour, and it indicated less formal
(not to be confused with informal) attire. With cocktail parties
back in style, consider a dark suit and elegant tie for him and a
dressy knee-length dress or suit in evening fabrics (such as satin,
brocade or velvet) for her. Or a shimmery skirt and a cashmere
twinset with crystal bead trim. Also referred to as After Five
attire.
</P>
<P>
   CASUALLY CHIC _ This is one of the toughest dress codes to
interpret, because there are no strict rules. However, the emphasis
is on casual styles in elegant fabrics. In L.A., it's often a black
silk tee with a linen suit for him, and a sheer slip dress or pants
with a cashmere camisole and high-heeled sandals for her. Cashmere
sweaters, Italian silk sport shirts and all-black ensembles also
fall into this category. At its dressiest, this could take you to a
cocktail party.

   RUSSIA-CLINTON _ MOSCOW _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
wrapping up a two-day summit with President Bill Clinton, said
Wednesday that his politically paralyzed nation is determined to
stay the course to democracy and a free economy. Clinton held out
hope for expanded western investments but emphasized ``there is no
short cut'' for Russian reform. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-LEWINSKY _ MOSCOW _ Eight time zones from Washington and
behind the thick Kremlin walls, President Clinton could not shake
``Monica-gate.'' Clinton broke his silence on the Monica Lewinsky
scandal to tell the world he had said enough about his mistake and
had no plans to make a formal apology. ``I have acknowledged that I
made a mistake, said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven,
spent a lot of valuable time with my family in the last couple of
weeks and said I was going back to work,'' Clinton said in response
to a question at the closing press conference of his summit with
President Boris Yeltsin. Braced for the questions he knew would
come, Clinton and his White House staff sought to use the world
stage of the U.S.-Russian summit to present the president as a man
too busy to worry further about the controversy that has dogged him
for seven months and raised the possibility of his impeachment.

   HAITI-GROOVE _ MIAMI _ Angered about a comment linking Haitians
to AIDS in a popular summer movie, Haitian-Americans are pushing
for a boycott if they don't get a public apology. In the movie,
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' the main character has an
affair with a Jamaican. When her two sisters question her about it
later, one asks if he used a condom ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.'' The other says ``No, that's Haiti, Miss
Manners.'' Haitians say the dialogue has unleashed painful memories
of a time when the U.S. government branded Haitian-Americans as
AIDS carriers and barred them from donating blood. What hurts
Haitians even more is that the film was written and directed by
blacks. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   JOURNAL-JAMAICA _ KINGSTON, Jamaica _ ``Crime's so bad they'll
cut off your arm to get their hands on a nice watch,'' the American
businessman sitting next to me on the airplane warned. It was an
ominous beginning to the start of a four-day trip to Jamaica, an
island that's long conjured up images of peaceful beaches and
picturesque waterfalls. But there was nothing peaceful or
picturesque about the Jamaica I encountered. Driving into the
capital of Kingston from the airport I passed children in tattered
clothes. liquor stores no bigger than closets, and slums that
reminded me of the worst parts of Haiti. Later I learned that
Jamaica, the largest English-speaking island in the Caribbean, is
on the verge of economic collapse. Experiencing an astounding three
years of negative growth rates, Jamaica's economy is performing
worse than any other economy in the hemisphere, even Haiti's.

   SERBS _ Muslims aren't the only Bosnians refugees who have
resettled in Atlanta. There are Serbs here as well. Last week, a
Serb who lives in the metro area was accused of having tortured
Muslims and Croats during the war in the former Yugoslavia in 1992.
There are two groups of Serb refugees in the United States. Some
are married to Muslims - being in a mixed marriage makes them
targets for persecution. Others are Serb refugees who were forced
out of the Krajina region of Croatia by Croatian soldiers in 1995.
The Serbs in Belgrade wouldn't take them and instead sent them to
Kosovo, where they are now fleeing. Local resettlement agencies say
Serbs and Muslims live here together peacefully now, but that may
be because they don't ask each other too many questions. (Kurylo,

   TAX-MILESTONE _ WASHINGTON _ If Milestone Properties, Inc., is
right, the Internal Revenue Service was wrong for demanding almost
$512,000 in taxes on a securities sale. The Boca Raton, Fla.-based
property management company denied in a petition filed with the
U.S. Tax Court here that neither it nor its Milestone Mortgage
Corp. subsidiary was a ``dealer of securities.'' The petition
claimed the IRS erred when it ruled that Milestone realized a $1.41
million taxable gain on the sale of $30 million worth of U.S.
Treasury notes in 1994. (Moskal, Cox News Service 400).

   WASHINGTON _ The fate of a proposed radioactive-waste dump in
West Texas is now fully in the hands of Texans after the U.S.
Senate voted Wednesday, 78-15, to allow waste from Maine and
Vermont to be shipped to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With a veto from President Clinton unlikely, the next move is up
to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, which is
weighing whether to license the dump's location near Sierra Blanca,
about 90 miles southeast of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action _ backed by both of Texas' senators,
Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison _ did not specify a
site for the waste but ratified an agreement among Texas, Maine and
Vermont that will allow the smaller states to ship their
radioactive waste south as soon as a storage site is built. Nine
similar agreements, known as compacts, among a total of 41 states
have previously been approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush was pleased by the Senate vote, according to
spokeswoman Shirley Green, but he is withholding full endorsement
of the location until the commission rules on the safety of the
Sierra Blanca site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has said that he's troubled that two
administrative law judges do not feel that the applicants have
proven the safety of the Sierra Blanca site,'' Green said,
referring to a July report from two examiners for the commission.
``He has said all along that if the site is not proven safe, he
will not support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's challenger for the governor's office, Democratic Land
Commissioner Garry Mauro, criticized Bush for opposing amendments
to the Senate action that would have foreclosed any other state
from eventually using the Texas dump site. None of the other
agreements approved by Congress contained that limitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is talking out of both sides of his mouth,''
Mauro said in a statement Tuesday. ``Governor Bush says he supports
the Sierra Blanca site if it's proven safe; he says he won't let
Texas become a national dumping ground. But Governor Bush hasn't
instructed his appointees to the TNRCC to reject the Sierra Blanca
site, and he opposed an amendment to the compact bill that would
have prevented Texas from becoming a national nuclear dumping
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas opponents of the dump site _ some of whom watched the
debate and vote Wednesday from the gallery above the Senate floor _
said they will continue their fight before the TNRCC and the Texas
Legislature, which must appropriate money for the waste authority
that will operate the dump site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're done with the Congress, we're going to be
focused on the Legislature,'' said Erin Rogers of Austin, executive
director of the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund. Rogers said she
wasn't surprised by the lopsided Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was happy we got through to 15'' senators, she said.
``For a while, we just had one,'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who
was the only senator who spoke against the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison took to the Senate floor Wednesday to urge her
colleagues to approve the compact: ``I would never support a
hazardous waste site in my state that is not in full compliance
with state and federal regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said after the vote that he did not speak out on the
Senate floor because ``my views on this are well known.'' He said
he was following the lead of Gov. Bush, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and
other state officials who support the compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Wellstone tried to make his case, and, obviously,
nobody bought it,'' Gramm said. ``Am I to assume that Senator
Wellstone is more concerned about Texans than the governor?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, who fought an open-ended compact
in the House, said he was disappointed that more state officials in
Texas didn't speak against the waste agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sounds of silence on this issue from most of our statewide
elected officials have sent a loud but unfortunate message to the
country,'' Doggett said: `` `Send Texas your nuclear garbage.' ''

FOR SALE AT LAST IN CHINA: DREAM HOMES, BUT NO SINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Buying a home is a relatively new phenomenon
in China, and so is serious home furnishing. Even in Shanghai, the
nation's most affluent and modern-minded city, the decor in most
apartments still ranges from Spartan to dowdy to just plain
tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   But change is on the way. And not just because Ikea opened a
store here early this year. A new consciousness about home
furnishing is germinating in many Chinese cities, and it is growing
out of the surging popularity of buying a home itself.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few kinks to be worked out. For one thing,
many home buyers have to pay cash, and that means toting bundles of
100-yuan bills _ the largest available, worth about $12 each _ that
have to be painstakingly counted at the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sale is final, a new home is rarely ready for occupation,
even in a brand-new building. Getting an apartment in this city
usually means getting the space itself, without anything as basic
as paint on the walls or wiring within them, much less plumbing in
the bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. There seems to be no end to the number of people
eager to buy homes in China's cities, where a vast conversion of
housing from public to private hands means a revolution in Chinese
living standards.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of urban families in China are buying homes for the
first time. After years of talking about it, Chinese authorities
are finally getting serious about supporting home ownership, by
making mortgages available in some cases and by ordering local
governments to do away with the state-allocated housing that has
been a mainstay of the socialist system here.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven months of 1998, housing sales in China shot
up 71 percent compared with sales a year earlier, authorities
reported. Although the number of new homes was not available,
official reports said a total of roughly 3 trillion square feet of
housing was sold
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Chinese tenants generally resisted buying as long
as their rent was almost free. But buyers are now emerging in big
numbers, not only because rents are certain to skyrocket with the
end of subsidized housing, but also because relaxed rules on
reselling homes mean that apartments are finally a viable
investment. Demand for housing looks so insatiable that average
prices are expected to climb for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   For Sindy Lee, a 30-year-old graphic designer in Shanghai,
owning a home means first of all having a little more space to live
in. Ms. Lee said that she gets along fine with her mother-in-law,
but that it was not ideal to be living with so many people _ her
husband, infant son and parents-in-law _ in a cramped apartment, as
most Chinese families do. Especially not when another choice came
along.
</P>
<P>
   The new one-bedroom apartment she and her husband bought for
$50,000 earlier in 1998 is in a building of about 30 stories in the
Xuhui district, a pleasant residential neighborhood downtown.
</P>
<P>
   While it is only 500 square feet, the apartment seems spacious,
since it is roughly double the average space for a family of three
in this city. Although modest in size, it has been carefully and
tastefully decorated, partly inspired by the the new
home-furnishing style magazines cropping up in this city of 14
million.
</P>
<P>
   The living room is painted a soft lime green _ ``a light, fresh
color that is kind to visitors,'' Ms. Lee explained. The bedroom is
peach, a warmer color, for herself. Instead of holding to any
specific set of feng shui-like rules, Ms. Lee seems have her own
sense of what works.
</P>
<P>
   And it does. The kitchen, gleaming with stainless-steel counter
tops and wooden cabinets, is unusually clean and modern for a
Chinese home. There is no oven _ Chinese cooking involves little
baking _ but there are four burners on the stove and two sinks, a
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make our home a good place for my son,'' said Ms.
Lee, a pert woman with a page-boy haircut. ``Everything had to be
the way we wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee and her husband chose pine flooring that is softer than
the concrete they were used to, and easier on the head of their
1-year-old son, Chi, when he falls. The corners of their yellow
cotton upholstered sofa and wooden coffee table are carefully
rounded, as are the edges of a desk where the family computer sits.
</P>
<P>
   Although most state-run furniture stores in China still play to
a widespread taste for chrome and black leather, Ms. Lee said she
did much of her furniture shopping at Ikea, which opened here in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The international chain has advertised widely, distributing a
million 16-page catalogs, and has found that birch, beech and
leather sell particularly well in Shanghai. (``Leather seems
popular because it's easy to clean and looks expensive,'' said
Chung Liu, an Ikea representative in Shanghai.)
</P>
<P>
   Taking such care in the renovation of a home is becoming as much
of a fad as buying one in China. Though credit cards are still in
their infancy, most homeowners expect to lay out at least half the
price of a new home for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is probably what's keeping the economy alive this year,''
said Ms. Lee's husband, Richard Chen, referring to the renovation
and decoration business. A lot of his friends are either buying a
home or trying to buy one, Chen said, and all plan to carry out
extensive renovations.
</P>
<P>
   For Chen, who is 28, it was not so much the psychological sense
of security that made him want to buy an apartment. Nor was it just
plain economics, even in a society known for a careful evaluation
of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the impetus for plunking down a lot of cash _ $50,000 is
a huge sum in a country where the average urban wage is still $50 a
month _ was his desire to improve his family's living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never have things so nice if we rented,'' Chen said.
``The most important thing is having a higher standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, as in many other Chinese cities, most housing is
still in low-rise buildings where tenants have to share a kitchen
and a toilet with their neighbors. In the past, rent was not a real
concern, since it was typically less than $10 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The catch was that the standard of upkeep was appallingly poor.
And that is clearly part of why families like Ms. Lee's and Chen's
do not blink at spending half the cost of their home, or nearly
$25,000, on a thorough renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy a home because it means they can fix it up the way
they want,'' Chen said. ``You can renovate it to your own
specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chen's case, this meant starting almost from scratch. In
China, perhaps because private housing is a relatively new thing,
developers get away with selling apartments in new buildings that
lack even the most basic amenities, like electrical outlets or
faucets in a sink _ in some cases, even the sink itself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Chen knew that. He is a graphic designer for American
Standard, the maker of bathroom and kitchen fixtures, and he was
eager to have the apartment done over.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited Shanghai in June, he spent an
afternoon meeting with homeowners as a way of recognizing the new
freedom Chinese people have to live where they wish, rather than
where they are assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are pushing home ownership, less for the freedom
it affords people than for the opportunity it gives the state to
get rid of an onerous and finance-draining responsibility. Housing
subsidies for all of China's 200 million to 300 million urban
residents are scheduled to be phased out by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders are also eager to find ways to get access to the
enormous cash holdings that ordinary Chinese have in the bank,
since the nation's savings rate of roughly 40 per cent of income is
among the highest in the world. In Shanghai, as in many other
cities, state-owned developers are putting up thousands of
apartment buildings, creating a huge glut of new housing.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of housing is already benefiting China's
carpenters, decorators, plumbers, brokers and financiers.
Economists point to housing reform as a key to China's economic
health. So restrictions on buying and selling homes are dropping
away. On June 1, Shanghai formally made it legal for people to
resell their homes on the open market; previously, special
permission was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure aims to stimulate the city's property market,''
said Cai Yutian, director of the Shanghai Housing and Land
Administration Bureau. That enables Ms. Lee and Chen to look ahead
to selling their apartment and finding a bigger one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a bit small,'' Ms. Lee observed. ``Our son is still
a small child, so it's OK having one bedroom. But when he gets
bigger, we're going to want more room.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many buyers, Ms. Lee and Chen combined a bank mortgage with
loans from relatives. Typical mortgages are now available for 10 or
15 years, at 7 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly payments of about $400 require about a third of Ms.
Lee's and Chen's combined income. A little adjustment may be
necessary, since they are not used to paying for housing, but the
couple said they would manage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I don't get laid off, we're OK,'' Chen said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities say that few home buyers have defaulted on
mortgages in cities that pioneered housing reform. That message is
meant to encourage state-run banks _ which are still unused to
making loans to individuals _ to venture into the mortgage
business.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's work at American Standard made him particular about how
his bathroom was done. First he had it expanded to a length of
about 8 feet, roughly twice the original length, even though that
meant cutting into the living room. Then he had a full-length
bathtub installed, a rarity in a Chinese home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to play in the tub,'' Chen said, gesturing at his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also had a shower with a sliding Plexiglas door installed,
as well as a wide sink. He had gray tiling laid, with a design he
selected himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since most Chinese customers are first-time home buyers, few
have experience working with contractors, and stories of shoddy and
substandard work are legion. Chen said he had to watch the workers
night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually moved in next door for two months so I could
supervise them,'' he said. ``I don't think they liked that very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is justifiably proud of the results. Chen's home is a
pleasant contrast to many new Chinese homes, filled as they are
with all that chrome furniture with black leather upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very particular idea of what we wanted,'' Chen said.
``Buying a home is still new in China. It's a lot of work, but it's
worth it.''

`CAYUTAVILLE': RURAL LIFE HAS ROOM FOR ANGST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beneath the picture-postcard scenes of pastoral America,
writers, at least since Sherwood Anderson and Edgar Lee Masters,
have discerned a depressing reality: Things are not as they seem
amid the foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Now a television documentary maker confirms that civilization's
discontents do not spare an upstate New York community despite the
beauties of a snowy winter and the childhood frolickings of summer.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Cayutaville,'' Diana Crone Frank trains her camera mainly
on two families, the Chapmans and the Soules, and finds plenty of
angst. Theirs is a Christian community, centered around faith and
church, but these prove frail defenses against early death, heroin
addiction, economic buffetings and family breakups. Shunning
narration, she lets parents and children tell their own, mostly
melancholy stories.
</P>
<P>
   Particular attention is given to the most dire cases: Robert
Chapman, father of three, who is unable to shake off his grief over
a daughter's death years ago at the age of 10, and one of the Soule
sons, Robert, who passed much of his life cut off from his parents
and in a heroin haze. (Robert has since died.)
</P>
<P>
   Cayutaville is not prospering, and neither family is awash in
money. Chapman has resigned his teaching job for reasons not made
clear; the beautiful old Chapman home has been mortgaged. Robert
Chapman's attention to tending his daughter's grave seems obsessive
and plays into the breakup of his marriage. A daughter says her
mother has finally ``gotten out from under his thumb,'' but it is
he who seems liberated.
</P>
<P>
   Soule, retired from his job as a guard at a youth camp,
apparently carried his authoritarian style into his home and may
have contributed to his addict son's sense of failure. But his
other children seem content to raise their own families not far
from home in jobs that are guaranteed not to make them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intimations of guilt, blame, responsibility, Ms. Frank
sensibly stays clear of judgments of what went wrong. Instead she
returns to church meetings where some of the family members find
consolation for their disappointments in the warmth of community
and the security, despite everything, of small-town living.

`STEAL THIS DREAM': ABBIE HOFFMAN AND HIS TURBULENT TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the young rebels with or without causes who marched,
chanted, tripped and protested their way through the 1960s and
'70s, none was more of an enigma than Abbott Hoffman, a nice Jewish
boy from Worcester, Mass., who finagled his way to the front lines
of every battle fought during those turbulent years _ from the
civil rights campaign to the drug and sex revolution to the antiwar
movement.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Steal This Dream,'' Larry Sloman attempts to piece together
a rough mosaic of Abbie Hoffman through the reminiscences of a
battalion of friends and foes alike _ classifications that often
became blurred over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In his exhaustive research, Sloman interviewed more than 200
people who knew Hoffman and has attempted to turn their
recollections into an oral history. In fact, ``Steal This Dream''
reads more like a sound-bite history, since few of the voices speak
much more than a sentence or a paragraph at a time. But since
Hoffman virtually invented the sound bite, it somehow seems
suitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning this staccato approach leaves the reader
feeling as if he has wandered into a reunion of hippies who are all
trying to talk at the same time. But as one grows used to it, the
style becomes apt for portraying a generation that thrived on
confusion and contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   Who was Abbie Hoffman and what made him run? As Sloman
demonstrates, if you ask 210 people you get at least 210 different
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rubin: ``If you were going to a demonstration . . . Abbie
would be the one bringing the ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer: ``Abbie was a serious man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Gianetta (a friend): ``He was cuckoo.'' His mother: ``He was
brilliant, just brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   The book follows Hoffman's life in chronological order, starting
with his family and classmates from high school, Brandeis,
Berkeley; it trails him from his first demonstration (against the
execution of Caryl Chessman), at San Quentin and his first riot (in
San Francisco) back to Worcester and on to New York, where it was
all happening, baby.
</P>
<P>
   The opening skirmishes were being fought in what would become
known as the countercultural revolution (read sex, drugs and
rock-and-roll), and the rebel headquarters were in the East Village
in Manhattan. Hoffman and his comrades formed the Youth
International Party (call them Yippies) to oppose the Vietnam War.
The problem was how to get the word out to rally the nation's
youth. Hoffman figured that television could deliver the message
free, straight into the living rooms of America.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew how to get on television better than Hoffman. As he
explained to a friend: ``See, like at 7:26, after they've done all
the heavy stuff, they gotta have a sign-off piece, something cute
and weird and wacky and whimsical. So I know we can't get on at
7:03. That's Johnson's time. But we could get on at 7:26.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the weird and wacky and whimsical stunts that Hoffman
helped stage were throwing dollar bills onto the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange and watching the traders scramble for them, the
protest march in Washington at which chanting hippies tried to
``levitate'' the Pentagon and a ``Yip-in'' happening in New York's
Grand Central Terminal that turned into a melee.
</P>
<P>
   But they were all dress rehearsals for what was originally
billed as a Festival of Life, a mass protest against the Vietnam
War, to be held in Chicago during the Democratic National
Convention in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of ``Steal This Dream'' is the section dealing
with the Chicago riots and the subsequent trial of the protest
organizers, who came to be known as the Chicago Seven (or Chicago
Eight, depending on whether you included Bobby Seale on the same
scorecard). It is a gripping account of one of the most bizarre
episodes in the country's political history, told by those who were
on the barricades. The pandemonium in the streets of Chicago was
matched only by the confusion among the protest's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Rubin, for example, had a falling out and stopped
speaking to each other. Stew Albert, one of the organizers and a
friend of both, said, ``It was over the pig.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the stunts the Yippies pulled that week was to run a pig
(Pigasus) for president. Hoffman went out and got a pig and took it
to downtown Chicago. When the crowd started singing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' to the pig, police started making arrests.
Albert recalled: ``When we were in jail a cop came and said, `I
have bad news for you boys, the pig squealed.' That was the best
cop joke I ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic Convention ended in chaos, it was nothing
compared with the trial that was to come. Hoffman wanted to turn
the trial into theater, showing via television coverage the
bankruptcy of the American judicial system. Other defendants
disagreed, and they argued over strategy. William Kunstler
recalled: ``When they were charged with conspiracy, Abbie said,
`Conspiracy? We can't even agree on lunch.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, the movement slowly began to disintegrate. By
the time the 1972 conventions in Miami rolled around, there was a
weak effort to repeat the demonstrations of four years earlier. But
the Yippies had become mainstream. The remnants of the Chicago
Seven all had press passes in Miami. Allen Ginsberg was still
om-ing, but this time from the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin had thrown in the towel earlier. As he recalled telling an
ex-Yippie who urged him to carry on the revolution from
underground: ``I'd rather do yoga than go underground. You want to
go underground? Hey, have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last third of the book follows Hoffman through his feeble
attempts at being a family man, his arrest for drug dealing and his
own years on the run from the law to his later campaigns for
environmental issues and his suicide in 1989 at age 52.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a complaint about the book, it is that Sloman
assumes that readers will readily recall events and names that
didn't even grab that many headlines 30 years ago. Yet in focusing
his kaleidoscope on Abbie Hoffman, the one unreconstructed radical
among the lot, Sloman succeeds in turning ``Steal This Dream ''
into a surprisingly rich and detailed panorama of a movement that
helped stop a war, bring down a president and, for better or worse,
change the social fabric of the nation.

WORLD RELIGIONS: THIS WEEK, BUDDHISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORIGIN: Buddhism, one of the world's major religions, began in
what was northern India, now southern Nepal, and traces its origin
to Gautama Siddhartha, who lived from 566 to 486 B.C. Revered as
the Buddha, ``the awakened one,'' Siddhartha was a prince who
married, had a child, and then left his royal family and became a
wandering monk in search of truth. He was destined to achieve
enlightenment because of the merits he had accumulated in his
former existences. He saw ``the four sights:'' a sick person, an
old person, a corpse and an ascetic who was trying to avoid
suffering and death by abandoning the pleasures and
responsibilities of ordinary life. Siddhartha also tried asceticism
but later adopted ``the Middle Path,'' in which he led a balanced
life of self-denial and self-indulgence. He is seen as a source of
enlightenment but is not worshipped.
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERSHIP: U.S. Buddhists are a growing presence, but they are
a small portion of the 300 million adherents worldwide. Estimates
vary, but the Yearbook of American &AMP; Canadian Churches estimates
that 565,000 Buddhists live in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most famous Buddhist leader is the Dalai Lama,
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. He is revered as a
reincarnation of the Buddha. Most Buddhists live in Asia and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEFS AND RITUALS: Buddhist practices vary from culture to
culture. Basic beliefs include reincarnation and meditation to
achieve spiritual ascendance. The ultimate religious experience is
to end the cycle of rebirth by achieving ``nirvana,'' a state
marked by a cessation of worldly cares and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhists follow the eightfold path divided into three areas:
moral conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood);
mental discipline (right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration); and intuitive wisdom (right views, right
intentions). Five moral precepts are: not to kill, not to steal,
not to lie, not to abuse sex and not to use intoxicants. Images of
Buddha are central in worship.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has offered Russia moral support but no financial
help. Sounds like what we used to get from our parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``very much want
Russia to succeed.'' As long as we don't have to listen to
political speeches about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the future of Russia,'' says Mr. Clinton. No
doubt he wishes he were as certain about the future of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Russians need to know, says the president, there are no
``painless solutions.'' Unfaithful husbands, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says Russia should ``reject the failed policies of
the past.'' As he himself did when he decided to tell the truth
about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president says one reason for his trip to Russia is to
``tell them that the easy thing to do is not the right thing to
do.'' That's a sermon he might have done well to preach to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems that develop beyond our borders,'' Mr. Clinton says,
``sooner or later find their way to our doorstep.'' Where they must
compete for attention with home-grown problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound,'' the
president says. But some days it sounds like a scream of someone
jumping off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation will ever have a monopoly on ideas,'' says Mr.
Clinton. True. Bad ideas come from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   September is nature's way of reminding everyone that there are
parts of the world where it's already too late to send Christmas
presents by ship.

   Wednesday, Hurricane warnings were issued for the central Gulf
Coast as Hurricane Earl crawled sluggishly northeastward through
the Gulf of Mexico. Though Earl will likely remain a minimal
hurricane in terms of its wind speeds, the tropical cyclone will
bring prodigious rain to southern Alabama, southern Georgia and
sections of the Florida panhandle on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall tallies could exceed 10 inches in a few spots by
evening, causing local flooding, particularly in areas already
affected by the storm's torrential rain bands. Meanwhile, partial
sunshine will fuel additional showers and thunderstorms in the
sultry air covering the Carolinas and Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding currents of air behind the tropical system will
squelch clouds across the southern Plains and Texas. The resulting
sunshine will help boost afternoon readings past 100 degrees near
the Red River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation around a swirling mass of cool air aloft will bring
unsettled conditions to the northern Great Lakes and interior
Northeast on Thursday. A solid layer of low, gray stratus clouds
will enhance the chill, holding daytime readings in the 60s from
northern Michigan to upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably hot air will continue across much of the West on
Thursday as a strong ridge of high pressure near 20,000 feet
remains over the region. Beneath ample sunshine, late afternoon
temperatures will soar past 100 degrees in the Central Valley of
California. The heating of the uneven terrain will spark isolated
thunderstorms over some of the mountain peaks of the interior
West. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: HURRICANE WARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, hurricane warnings were issued for parts of the
Gulf Coast despite the fact that an offshore storm was designated
Tropical Storm Earl. The apparent discrepancy is an outgrowth of
unique considerations in warning the public about tropical
cyclones. The prospect of a landfalling hurricane often impels
emergency management officials to order evacuations of coastal
areas, which can require many hours to complete. On Tuesday,
despite uncertainty about the intensification of Earl, forecasters
hoisted hurricane warnings so precautions could be completed before
the storm.

TREASURY PRICES SLIP SLIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of most Treasury securities slipped slightly
Wednesday, as stock markets around the world stabilized and the
dollar weakened in currency trading, lessening the flight into the
government securities market that has been an almost daily
occurrence lately.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, however, the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32,
to a price of 102 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, slipped to 5.33 percent from 5.34 percent the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   With yields at a 30-year low, the lure for some investors is not
as strong as it was a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Davis, senior technical analyst at Thomson Global
Markets in Boston, said, ``Essentially, the markets are all due for
some corrective activity,'' which, she added, could come on Friday,
when the Labor Department reports the nonfarm payroll number for
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aggressive 350,000 gain or more will probably knock bonds
for a loop, sending prices lower and yields higher,'' she said,
particularly if the dollar continues to weaken. ``The next bond
trade is apt to be down,'' she said, adding that the ``price has
come too far too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of economists' forecasts goes from 205,000 new jobs to
430,000. Thomson Global Markets is looking for a rise of 325,000,
which is slightly lower than the consensus, but still on the high
side.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus
Investment Management, is also cautious on bond prices. He urged
investors not to try to rationalize current low yields on economic
grounds. While Treasuries may have become a commodity symbolizing
safety for speculators and day traders, he said, ``long-term
investors must be able to square bond prices with economic
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite investors' many worries about the effects of weaker
foreign economies on the United States, factory orders in July rose
by a strong 1.2 percent, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whelan cautioned that Treasury securities, having priced in a
50-basis-point drop in rates, already reflected a lot of the good
news. ``In fact, with the admission that economic data lag, there
is no proof yet of a dramatic slowing in the U.S. economy,'' he
said. ``Current data suggest that third-quarter GDP growth is
likely to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent, not 1 percent.''

<P>
   As a Dallas professional, Inez Brand has a full plate during the
week. On the weekend, however, she always finds time for a movie _
especially if it's targeted at African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually somehow falls into the weekend plans,'' said Brand,
a diversity specialist for Northrop Grumman in Dallas. ``Friday,
Saturday or Sunday _ it'll fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand is after more than entertainment. She is president of the
Dallas chapter of the First Weekend Club, a group that supports
films starring and/or made by African-Americans. Although the seeds
were sown with the premiere of 1995's ``Waiting to Exhale,'' the
club was founded in March 1997 in Los Angeles, with the Dallas
chapter forming late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas chapter's phone message describes the club's mission:
``Our goal is to grab Hollywood's attention by supporting selected
African-American films at the box office in their first weekend of
release.'' The current message encourages callers to catch ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love,'' a story about '50s teen idol Frankie Lymon.
It opens today and stars Larenz Tate, Halle Berry, Lela Rochon and
Vivica A. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The club, with chapters in nearly a half-dozen cities
nationwide, uses phone calls, faxes, letters and e-mails to alert
members to the openings of African-American movies. In the
competitive movie market, a good opening weekend can mean the
difference between a movie staying in the theaters for weeks _ and
becoming a hit _ or getting quickly shuttled off to video stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we have waited for the video to come out or for
the crowds to die down,'' Brand said, ``without being aware of how
important the first weekend of box office was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it puts the emphasis on quality, the group doesn't try
to boycott such films as Ice Cube's prostitution-themed drama ``The
Players Club.'' It mobilized 4,700 people nationwide to catch ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back'' in its first weekend. ``Stella,''
starring Angela Bassett and based on Terry McMillan's bestselling
novel, debuted at No. 2 at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive was the performance of ``Blade,'' starring
Wesley Snipes, which was last weekend's No. 1 box-office movie.
Another movie featuring African-Americans, ``Dance With Me,''
debuted at No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the African-American audience is underserved at the
movies. Approximately 250 movies will play Fort Worth-Dallas in
1998; only about a dozen are aimed at African-American audiences.
They range from the major-studio ``Stella'' to the cruder hip-hop
comedy of ``I Got the Hook-Up'' to the romantic comedy-drama ``Hav
Plenty,'' a Woody Allen-influenced indie that had a brief run on
one Dallas screen.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``blaxploitation'' craze of the early '70s, few
black-oriented movies were made until the mid-'80s, when films by
Spike Lee and Robert Townsend started gaining attention. Even so,
Lee's latest, ``He Got Game,'' received a very limited release,
despite being one of 1998's more masterfully directed movies.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``Game'' depicted some characters (especially women) in
a bad light, and one of the club's motives is to see more positive
images in African-American movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a long way to go,'' Sandra Evers-Manly, the
club's co-founder, said from Los Angeles. ``You don't see a lot of
movies with black romance, or with a black child praying.''
</P>
<P>
   And although many films star black actors, they're usually in
tandem with a white star, who is usually higher-billed. That
doesn't mean the club would rule out a movie like ``The
Negotiator,'' in which Samuel L. Jackson shared top billing with
Kevin Spacey. But the club particularly hopes to drum up support
for movies built around stars such as Jackson and Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   The club is based at the Black Hollywood Education and Resource
Center in Los Angeles, where Evers-Manly is president. The club
also has chapters in Washington, D.C.; Oakland, Calif.; and
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas chapter has more than 100 members, Brand said; anyone
interested in supporting black cinema is welcome. ``Our group in
Dallas is more diverse than other places, in fact,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other unrelated organizations have been helping get the word
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, we've sponsored screenings of movies such as
`Ghosts of Mississippi, The Preacher's Wife' and `Waiting to
Exhale,' '' said Gwen Barbee, executive director of the Women's
Division of the Fort Worth Metropolitan Black Chamber of Commerce.
``We're going with quality _ not just because it's a black movie
that's out there. We want movies we can recommend.'' The
African-American newspaper Dallas Weekly and urban-contemporary
radio station KKDA also sponsor preview screenings.
</P>
<P>
   The gay-oriented newspaper Dallas Voice does similar sponsorship
of gay-themed movies. But neither the Fort Worth or Dallas Hispanic
chamber of commerces were aware of any similar group supporting
Latino-themed movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take into consideration the size of the Hispanic
population, you can make an argument that the population is
underrepresented as far as characters go,'' said Rene Rodriguez,
film critic for the Miami Herald. ``But many Hispanics have grown
up so assimilated into American culture, I don't think they're as
hungry for Hispanic movies as African-Americans are for movies like
`Stella.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and other people of color can also benefit from the
First Weekend Club, however. Chayanne, the leading man in ``Dance
With Me,'' is Puerto Rican, and ``Selena'' director Gregory Nava is
behind the camera again for ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' the
club's target movie this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The recent box-office numbers feed Brand's optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a huge difference, and you're going to see
it fast,'' she said. ``I think the percentage is going to increase
as black people take a stand.''

DRUG PRICES VARY, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Drug prices can vary dramatically among local
pharmacies, sometimes by as much as 91 percent for prescription
drugs and 175 percent for over-the-counter drugs, according to a
survey released Wednesday by the Massachusetts Public Interest
Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing,'' said Dierdre Cummings, the group's
consumer program director who has supervised surveys on everything
from insurance to groceries. ``I have never seen a spread that wide
in any retail product.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the survey found that prices for Augmentin, a
prescription drug used to treat infections, cost $111.32 for 42
pills at a Stop &AMP; Shop Pharmacy in Allston, but $173.17 at an Osco
Drug store in Boston. A tube of Neosporin costs $2 at Stop &AMP; Shop,
but $5.49 at Osco.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in June, compared prices for 28
prescription and 15 over-the-counter drugs at six Boston area
pharmacies. Prices reported in the survey may have changed since
then, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson is the same: Consumers can save hundreds of
dollars by doing some comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, however, aren't used to shopping around for their
pharmaceuticals, Cummings said. Many assume prices are similar at
all drug stores. Some patients, particularly those who are sick or
elderly, prefer the nearest pharmacy. Others don't care because
their insurance covers much of the cost for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing, Cummings said. As health insurers face soaring
drug costs, many are scaling back drug benefits, leaving an
increasing number of people to pay their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more consumers are having to pick up the tab,''
Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford Bernstein
in New York, estimates that up to 40 percent of Americans, roughly
110 million people, do not have prescription drug coverage, while
Deborah Socolar at Boston University School of Public Health put
the estimate at more than 30 percent of the population, or about 80
million people.
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Dion at Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting noted that drug
coverage among the elderly in particular is shrinking. ``Older
people are more likely to have chronic conditions and complex
illnesses that require lots of medication. That makes these price
spreads more important for them,'' Dion said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimates the number of prescriptions written per
person is expected to jump 15 percent this year from 1997, when
each adult and child in America was given an average of 11
prescriptions. An aging population, more rapid introduction of new
life-enhancing drugs, and aggressive pharmaceutical advertising
directed at consumers are among the forces leading doctors to issue
an increasing number of prescriptions, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has its limits, she cautioned. It did not include
mail-order drug companies, pharmacies at health maintenance
organizations and independently-owned pharmacies. In addition, the
survey captured prices during a one-week period in June, and
included sale prices and ``regular'' prices. Those prices have most
likely changed, and consumers will have to do their own homework to
get fresh figures.

ROMAN MUSIC CENTER RISES FROM THE RUINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Four years after winning his first commission to design a
building in Rome, Renzo Piano watches as three concert halls, known
collectively as the Rome Auditorium, rise on the northern outskirts
of the city; he hopes they will be ready by 1999, the eve of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the Auditorium, the latest project in Italy by the
60-year-old architect, the winner of this year's Pritzker
Architecture Prize, has been delayed by criticism of its design and
materials, and by the discovery on the building site of Roman
ruins. (It is hard to drive a spade into Roman soil without
striking ruins.)
</P>
<P>
   Perched atop a vast horseshoe-shaped base of brick and
travertine, the $145 million Auditorium comprises three
beetle-shaped halls _ the largest for 2,700 people, the two smaller
ones for 1,500 and 500 _ and will surround a 3,000-seat outdoor
amphitheater. The complex will have restaurants, museums of music
and musical instruments, and rehearsal halls, including one
sufficiently large for a 120-piece orchestra plus chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Piano is pursuing other spectacular projects in Europe,
including rebuilding on the site of Berlin's Potsdamer Platz and
raising an immense church at the monastery of the Italian mystic
and healer Padre Pio in Foggia.
</P>
<P>
   But none generates as much emotion for Piano as the Auditorium,
which will be home to the city's philharmonic orchestra and is to
be inaugurated with a concert in late 1999, in time for the
Jubilee, Rome's celebration of the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Striding across the building site, Piano remarked, ``Rome is a
special town, with a strong meaning.'' Despite the Auditorium's
starkly modern design, he said he was trying ``to give you the
feeling that you are still in Rome.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano is a practical man, more interested in getting a building
built than in defending the purity of a concept. Modifying the
Auditorium's design to make the Roman ruins _ low walls in volcanic
tufa stone _ visible to visitors, he said, ``was not a problem, it
was an enrichment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruins gave ``a special taste to the building,'' he said.
``So a part of the scheme is belonging to Rome, while another part
is belonging to the universe of music.''
</P>
<P>
   A museum will house Roman artifacts and objects found during the
digging, including pottery and a remarkable decorative mask.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Piano is neither a stranger to controversy nor a
newcomer to the design of rooms for music. ``I am passionate about
music, though not a great expert in music,'' he said. A close
friend is Luciano Berio, the Italian composer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Piano gained instant fame when he and Richard Rogers
designed the museum and library in Paris known as the Georges
Pompidou Center, with a dramatic, brightly colored exterior of
tubes and pipes. With Berio and the French composer Pierre Boulez,
Piano also created an underground center for experimental music
beside the center.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's philharmonic orchestra, the Accademia di Santa Cecilia,
has sought a permanent home since 1935, when Mussolini ordered its
old hall torn down to lay bare its foundation, the tomb of the
Emperor Augustus, as part of a drive to restore Rome's imperial
grandeur. Mussolini's pledge to build a new and grander hall for
the philharmonic within 18 months had the substance of many of the
dictator's promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through 63 years of abstinence,'' complained Bruno
Cagli, general manager of the Santa Cecilia, which now rents a hall
in central Rome from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Rome had a new mayor, Francesco Rutelli, who
resolved to embellish the city for the Jubilee. In 1994, an
international competition among eight invited architects, including
the Dutch architect Herman Hertzberger, was won by Piano.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   George Izenour, an American acoustics specialist who served on
the jury, said the design of the largest and smallest of Piano's
concert halls, with acoustics by the German specialist Helmut
Mueller, was based on Berlin's Philharmonic Hall. The third hall
will be used mainly for gatherings like conferences. Piano's
design, Izenour said, was ``far and away the best of the designs,
as far as technical aspects were concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's acoustical pedigree is no product of chance.
Mueller was a pupil of Lothar Cremer, the German specialist
responsible for the acoustics of the West Berlin Philharmonic Hall,
which was built in the 1960s by the architect Hans Scharoun.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the Roman concert halls, Piano responded to the
layout of the Berlin Philharmonic, which relies on the so-called
vineyard effect, terracing the hall, and where the listeners
surround the orchestra, with about 75 percent of the seats facing
the musicians and 25 percent behind them. Only the middle of the
three halls, intended for conferences as well as music, will
feature face-to-face ``parliamentary'' seating, Piano said.
</P>
<P>
   Piano is known for large adventuresome projects that stretch the
limits of technology and often celebrate it, like the Pompidou
Center. But this building more closely recalls some of the museum
designs for which the architect is known, most notably the Menil
Collection in Houston and the Fondation Beyeler in Basel,
Switzerland: spare modernist cubes in which lighting and heating
elements are hidden from view.
</P>
<P>
   While the basic shapes of the Auditorium's exterior resemble
nothing so much as huge leaden beetles from the outside, the
interiors will be characterized by sweeping hung ceilings to
produce the open spaces that are acoustically desirable yet allow
maximum seating arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The start of construction was scheduled rather optimistically
for 1995, and the inauguration concert for late 1997. But delays
set in.
</P>
<P>
   First, an Italian government approval board objected to, among
other things, the widespread use of wood, a very un-Roman material,
and demanded that the design be altered: Augustus, after all,
boasted that he had found the city in brick and left it in marble.
</P>
<P>
   With Rutelli's support, the design remained substantially
unchanged, but work was further delayed for almost a year after
workmen digging for the foundations unearthed the remains of
pre-Christian buildings, including a villa. Only after Piano
further changed the plans, rotating the entire complex on its axis
and shifting it 18 feet to the north to include the ruins, could
work resume.
</P>
<P>
   Piano says the central amphitheater is the ``most Roman'' part
of the Auditorium, describing it as ``not only a place for making
music, but a piazza, a magnificent place, for ice skating in
winter, with restaurants. It will make of this a very urban
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Piano's plans for the Pompidou Center and for Berlin's Potsdamer
Platz also triumphed because of their imaginative use of vast open
plazas. At the Auditorium, a horseshoe-shaped foyer with
restaurants and stores will surround the amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   The concert halls are made of laminated wood sheathed with lead,
and the architect compares them to the resonance chambers of
``three gigantic instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood is not a Roman material,'' Piano acknowledged, ``but it
will be covered with lead, and lead is a Roman material.''
</P>
<P>
   Work proceeds in several shifts, 14 hours a day, but there is no
certainty that all will be ready on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated _ a lot of the work is done in the
factory,'' Piano said, describing how large segments of the halls
are prefabricated. ``And then suddenly everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're keeping our fingers crossed.''

COMMENTARY: SCHUMER IN THE STRETCH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internal polls are starting to show Rep. Charles Schumer neck
and neck with _ or even slightly ahead of _ Geraldine Ferraro in
the three-way Democratic primary race for the U.S. Senate, with
Public Advocate Mark Green trailing.
</P>
<P>
   The polls, commissioned by candidates, have not been released
publicly. They focused on likely primary voters as opposed to all
eligible voters, and they reflect what has been a widespread
feeling among reporters and other political observers _ that there
has been considerable erosion in Ferraro's once-commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still be nervous if I were Chuck,'' said a person
familiar with the poll numbers, ``but his campaign seems to be
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, the best known of the candidates, has run a campaign
that at times has been so low-keyed as to seem nonexistent. She
announced her candidacy in January when she was well ahead in the
polls, and apparently decided that the best strategy was to do as
little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   She has tried to immunize herself against criticism by
repeatedly warning her opponents not to attack her, has tried her
best to avoid debating, and has fought angrily with reporters who
have attempted to pin her down on this issue or that.
</P>
<P>
   She has acted as though the Senate nomination should be handed
to her in the same way that Walter Mondale presented her with her
claim to fame _ the vice-presidential slot on his ticket in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll data suggest that Ferraro's strategy could be
leading to the kind of debacle that befell the hare that raced the
tortoise. She does well in surveys that target all eligible voters.
But Schumer seems to do better and better as the pollsters weed out
respondents who are not likely to vote in the primary. He does very
well among voters who are familiar with all three candidates, and
among those who are well versed on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro still benefits greatly from her celebrity status,
but her shrinking lead is proof that it is dangerous to run a
campaign entirely on what Mark Green has derisively described as
``the fumes of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary election is on Sept. 15 and the winner will go head
to head with Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. But while the momentum would
seem to favor Schumer, that may not last. The heavily financed
Schumer campaign has been running television ads introducing the
candidate to the voters all summer. Schumer has been on the tube
virtually alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with less than two weeks to go, Ferraro and Green are also
going on the air. Ferraro, who has had trouble raising money,
nevertheless has about $1 million to pay for commercials between
now and Election Day. Her first ads, attractive and engaging, have
been well received.
</P>
<P>
   And while Green has had very little money to work with, the poll
data show that in a three-way race with a low turnout expected, his
candidacy is still viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see what happens now,'' said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion,
which conducts the respected Marist Poll. ``Now there will be lots
of ads by lots of people on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has an impressive legislative history. He is, among
other things, the leading gun control advocate in Congress and the
principal sponsor of the 1994 crime bill. But he was less well
known than either of his opponents and has struggled to boost his
name recognition around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Green has an impressive history as a consumer advocate but has
been chronically short of campaign cash. That has contributed to
concern that he might not be able to mount a winning campaign
against D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have tried to convince voters that their
accomplishments in public office make them better qualified for
admission to the Senate than Ferraro's most valued political asset
_ her celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff said he was doing a poll now and the results should be
released on the weekend. He noted that the primary has been
overshadowed by events on Wall Street, in Washington and around the
world. But he added that the campaign itself has been less than
exciting. ``It's been like a modern dance,'' he said. ``There
hasn't been any contact with anybody. No one touches anybody.'' &QL;

SHY WHITE CANADIAN PRODUCES GANGSTA RAP, AND AVOIDS CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the pioneering gangsta rap group N.W.A was
looking for its first record deal, it found a distributor in
Priority Records, which released an album so obscene it prompted a
letter of complaint from the FBI. When Ice-T left Warner Brothers
Records after police groups and the company's shareholders objected
to his song ``Cop Killer,'' he found a new home at Priority. When
Suge Knight, the imprisoned head of Death Row Records, who is known
for his pugnacious business tactics, was looking for his first
deal, Priority gave it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the violence and controversy of hardcore rap music _
from its roots in N.W.A to its current resurrection with Master P _
the Los Angeles label Priority Records has been a major player. Yet
Priority has somehow escaped censure.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the letter sent by the FBI objecting to N.W.A's
lyrics about police officers, Priority and its founder and
president, Bryan Turner, have never been vilified, even during
congressional hearings on music lyrics or by anti-obscenity
crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``And let me tell you something, man, that takes strategy,''
said Turner, a press-shy white Canadian hockey fan who started a
label selling California Raisins oldies before striking gold with
gangsta rap.
</P>
<P>
   In quietly distributing the rap albums that large corporations
would not touch, Priority became the country's largest independent
label in the mid-'90s. Two years ago it sold $114 million in music;
last year sales climbed to $175 million, and this year the company
expects to take in over $240 million. These increases can be
attributed primarily to a distribution deal with the phenomenally
successful No Limit Records, the Louisiana-based rap label run by
Master P.
</P>
<P>
   Priority now accounts for 3.2 percent of the American record
market.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 42, recently read ``Have Gun Will Travel,'' a new book
chronicling the violent history of Death Row Records and West Coast
gangsta rap and noticed that his name came up only once, in a
passing reference. ``A book with that kind of subject matter, and I
was mentioned once,'' he said. ``That was no fluke. I knew exactly
what was going on. I knew exactly how involved I had to be and how
little involved I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the game has changed for Priority. The company is
no longer the biggest independent label in the country. In March,
EMI Music completed its $125 million purchase of the label. Before,
Turner had no one to answer to as he built a lucrative shelter for
one of the country's most debated musical forms. Now he is part of
a publicly traded corporate giant _ a part whose future is tenuous
at best. EMI Music's parent company, Thorn EMI, has been looking to
sell its music holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, however, said he wasn't worried about EMI's impinging on
his freedom to release whatever he wants, in part because the
company is British-owned. ``They haven't said a word about it,''
Turner said. ``I've been with EMI Music Distribution from day one,
so my retort was always, `You guys know what I do, you know how
much business I do and you know the kind of business I do.'''
</P>
<P>
   If EMI was bought by a company that interfered with the way he
ran Priority, Turner said, he would leave and start another label.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the labels owned by EMI _ from Capitol, which has the
Beatles and Beach Boys catalogs, to Virgin, which releases the
Rolling Stones and Janet Jackson _ Priority sells the most records.
For many, this is a surprise, since Turner has remained in the
shadows. He easily gets sidetracked into passionate discussion of
old school and underground hip-hop, though he consistently avoids
media and music business social functions. Since being bought by
EMI, Turner has decided to make tentative forays into the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Although a handful of white executives built their companies on
rap in the early '80s, the soft-spoken Turner was the only one
willing to engage in music so extreme. ``People think he's black
automatically because he's in so much business with the black
folk,'' said Snoop Dogg, the leading gangsta rapper, formerly known
as Snoop Doggy Dogg. ``But he's been in it since the N.W.A days, so
he knows rap front and back. I've known him since I was on Death
Row, and he's a cool man. He recognizes talent and recognizes money
and gives opportunity, and that's one thing I respect out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another testament to Turner's skill in remaining anonymous is
that during all the speculation surrounding Snoop Dogg's release
from a six-album contract with Death Row Records so that he could
record for No Limit, Turner's name was barely mentioned, even
though he was the middle man in the deal, running back and forth
between Master P in Louisiana and Knight in prison. Considering
that Snoop Dogg was Death Row's biggest cash cow and that he had
been accusing Knight of bad business dealings, this was no easy
task. But last month, just as Snoop Dogg's No Limit album went to
No. 1 on the pop charts, Knight finally signed off on his release
from Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the independent middle guy who everybody sort of trusted
and who wasn't going to let anything happen to anybody in terms of
not getting their right deal,'' Turner said. ``Things changed so
rapidly during that period of time. At 6 each night I wanted to
leave the office because I knew that the next phone call could turn
the whole thing upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner added that as a result of the deal, it seemed likely that
Snoop Dogg and Knight, who is up for a new probation hearing now
that his nine-year prison sentence was annulled this week by the
California Court of Appeals, would work together again.
</P>
<P>
   Though Turner is a champion of freedom of expression and has
worked with rap's most controversial figures, he does have his
limits. ``There was one record that I listened to that actually
offended me, which I didn't put out,'' he said. ``And it wasn't a
rap record, it was a rock record. I won't name the group, but its
lyrics had to do with children. With all the controversy that we
ever had, any of the artists could sit down and discuss it and
explain their perspective. But this actually offended me. There was
no way anyone could justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of N.W.A's police-bashing song, he remembered, ``When
they first played that track for me, it blew my mind. I just
couldn't believe it. But we talked about some stuff _ police
pulling them over and taking their money and their watches. It
never happened in my neighborhood. But those were their
experiences. What justification can you have for not putting that
out?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Turner began working with rap music in the early '80s after he
moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles and found a job creating
compilations at Capitol and then K-Tel Records, where he put
together an album with early rap acts like U.T.F.O., Whodini and
the Fat Boys. In the process he met many of the rap label heads who
helped him out when he left K-Tel in 1985 and started Priority,
which kicked off with a collection called ``Kings of Rap.''
</P>
<P>
   What put the label on the map, however, was a series of oldies
compilation albums featuring the television commercial characters
the California Raisins on the cover. The albums sold two million
copies, attracting the attention of Jerry Heller, who managed
N.W.A, which included three rappers who went on to have successful
solo careers, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day Jerry Heller brought the group in,'' Turner
remembered. ``They were 18 years old. And I was like, `Let's do it.
This is some scary stuff. It will scare some white people here.'
From a business perspective, N.W.A completely fit in with what our
success had been. First of all, we did compilation albums _ there
was no radio. It was just heavy retail and heavy press. Then we did
the Raisins, which didn't have radio singles. I just loaded the
stores so you couldn't walk in without tripping over a California
Raisins record. Then along came gangsta rap. Radio wasn't going to
play any of those songs. It was strictly retail marketing, which
was our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner paused, then laughed. ``I'm probably the only guy in the
world who could find a similarity between N.W.A and the California
Raisins. You market them exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   After working with N.W.A and Eazy-E's label, Ruthless, Turner
became a gangsta rap mogul, making deals with Rap-a-Lot, the
Houston label responsible for one of the genre's most extreme acts,
the Geto Boys, and No Limit Records, which released six of the
eight records Priority has in this week's Billboard top 100 pop
album chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remind my guys every day that this is a windfall,'' Turner
said. ``I tell them that we're doing incredible business _ but
don't get carried away with this. It's not something that we can
bank on; it's not something that's a growing asset.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Turner has been making deals to distribute other
regional rap labels, including Duck Down in New York, home to the
rising rap act Heltah Skeltah. He is also preparing to release
albums by Mack 10, Ice Cube, Ras Kass and Bad Azz as well as a
compilation chronicling N.W.A and its offshoots. Those may all be
rap records, Turner said, but that doesn't mean Priority will be a
rap label forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, we were a compilation label,'' Turner
said. ``Then we were a Raisin label. And now we're a rap label. So
what does it all mean? Whatever type of music you're successful
with at a certain point in time, suddenly you take on that
definition.''

BATTER UP TO THE MARTITAL PLATE

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Reds and the Blues would probably prefer
that this story run on the sports page.
</P>
<P>
   Especially the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this was a baseball game. Last month, 19 guys
withstood the heat in order to replay history, a time a few years
back when many of them hit, pitched, caught, stole and ran for the
Southwest High School Raiders. Most of them, still in great shape,
meant business, even if there were other motives for calling the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion was in celebration of 24-year-old Monte Pearson, who
on August 22 wed his high-school sweetheart, Jodi Sturgiss, at
First United Methodist Church in downtown Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   What? A bachelor party without a cake girl or stag films?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sir. Play ball!
</P>
<P>
   The best man with the plan was Michael Brandon, 24. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Monte and I both grew up loving baseball,'' he said. ``We
figured this would be our last chance to play a real, organized
baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan executed.
</P>
<P>
   There were red and blue T-shirts with the league's logo:
``Pearson's Bachelor Party, August 15, 1998'' (in that
baseball-style lettering, of course).
</P>
<P>
   There were buckets of bubble gum and packets of sunflower seeds
(hey, what's a ballgame without spit?). During the third and fourth
innings, Reds captain J.R. McLaughlin grilled 'dogs. There were
pickles, water jugs and ice chests full of Gatorade made from a
mix, which meant about an inch of sugary sludge at the bottom of
the bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon prepicked the teams, placing himself on the Reds and
Pearson on the Blues. ``I know everyone and could even it up,''
Brandon said.
</P>
<P>
   They rented a field at Fort Worth's Rockwood Park and hired an
ump from Texas Amateur Baseball Umpires. They got Bubba Selmon, who
obviously preferred his strikes low.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon even bought a ``Baseball's Greatest Hits'' CD, which
included such ballpark classics as ``Who's on First,'' ``Take Me
Out to the Ballgame'' and ``Casey at the Bat.'' The teams lined up,
hands over hearts for the national anthem, to begin the game.
</P>
<P>
   They had a few spectators. Occasionally, a parent would appear,
including the father of the bride, Dave Sturgiss.
</P>
<P>
   And, as is typical of sporting men, there was plenty of
locker-room camaraderie and references to the male anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   Missing were the organist grinding out ``Charge,'' recorded
music by Guns `N Roses and the ``Macarena,'' and that annoying HOT
DOG guy. And, oh, yeah, thankfully there wasn't a large-screen
wedding proposal.
</P>
<P>
   That had already happened, albeit not on the large screen.
</P>
<P>
   They played with Little League rules. ``You can steal after the
ball is past the plate,'' McLaughlin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, had it not been for stolen bases, there wouldn't have
been many runs to home, even though the game was not devoid of
stars _ the Blues' Graham Robbins was the heavy hitter and Reds
pitcher Alan Hutson had some crafty pitches up his sleeve. The
groom, who claims that he ``wasn't all that good in high school,''
even had some luck on the pitchers mound.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the best man and his team got the best of
the groom's team. The score: 10-8 Reds. But no one cared who won or
lost; it was that they were ``able and willing'' to play with a
friend in what would be his last game as a single man.
</P>
<P>
   And at least there were no major injuries, an especially big
relief for Pearson's future father-in-law. ``What I was really
worried about is some of them getting hurt. We've got the best man,
the groomsmen, ushers ... I'd hate for them to come in on
crutches,'' Sturgiss said.

 &HT;    Country stars of past bank on nostalgia craze
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug Johnson, the president of Giant Records in Nashville, is
pumped about his newest artist. ``I can't tell you how excited we
are about the album,'' he says, with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy.
``The music is alive and vibrant and real. Listening to it was an
absolutely spiritual event.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Johnson has an agenda for the hyperbole, but he's not
hyping some new, 25-year-old bellybutton artist who's going to give
Shania Twain a run for her money. Giant's newest act has gray hair,
sad eyes and is 59 years old. Longtime country fans will
immediately recognize his name: Don Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1974 and 1986, Williams had 17 singles that went to No.
1 on the country music charts, including hits such as ``Amanda,''
``Till All the Rivers Run Dry'' and ``You're My Best Friend.'' But
in the Garth Brooks-influenced '90s, Williams _ along with dozens
of other established country acts _ faded into obscurity. Now the
tide may be shifting.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Nashville labels have started taking a second
look at older artists, signing many to new recording contracts.
Ronnie Milsap, 52, who had 35 No. 1 singles between 1974 and 1989,
is working on an album for Warner Bros., set for release in 1999.
At age 57, Grand Ole Opry diva Connie Smith (``If It Ain't Love,
Let's Leave It Alone'') is reviving her late-'60s heyday with an
album produced by her husband, country star Marty Stuart. More than
two decades after he told his boss to ``Take This Job and Shove
It,'' wild and woolly Johnny Paycheck, 57, is working on an album
for Lucky Dog Records, while Georgian Bill Anderson, 61, is writing
and recording under a new contract with Reprise Records.
</P>
<P>
   Will country audiences respond? Lon Helton, the country chart
editor for the trade publication Radio &AMP; Records, says these
artists may find a home in the growing niche of classic country
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country radio has a wider audience age spread than any other
format in America,'' he says. ``Finding a song that appeals to an
18-year-old girl and a 55-year-old man is a pretty daunting task.
There have been a lot of interesting country formats that have
grown up in the last few years. Maybe if a classic country station
is already playing Ronnie Milsap, they'll play his new stuff as
well.''

   Recipes for simple deserts with quick cleanup
</P>
<P>
   By Reagan Walker
</P>
<P>
   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   A mixing bowl or saucepan. A spoon to mix and some to measure,
along with a cup. And a baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the equipment you'll need to make these divine
desserts. That means that's all there'll be to clean up, too.

<P>
   For those pressed for time, distressed by a perceived lack of
culinary prowess or depressed by the thought of a dirty kitchen,
these desserts are for you. The ingredient lists are simple,
containing many common pantry items. The skill required is minimal,
the cleanup quick.
</P>
<P>
   But the result? Trust us. When you tell your guests or family
that ``it's just a little something I threw together,'' they'll
chide you for being so modest.

 &HT;    Between-meal treats pack nutritional punch
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. A recent study that looked at the eating
habits of teenagers found that America's kids are veritable eating
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Teen Eating Study, commissioned by Channel 1 Network,
laid waste to the three-meals-a-day norm and found that close to
half of the nation's 23 million teens eat at least five times a
day, with 19 percent eating a whopping six times daily. Translated,
that means there's a whole lot of snackin' goin' on. In fact, the
study dubbed the afternoon snack ``the fourth meal.''
</P>
<P>
   A snack is broadly defined as food informally eaten between
regular meals, which means a snack could be just about anything. As
it is, the study found that teens favored fast food hamburgers,
pizza and Tex-Mex, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   But snacks can contribute more than empty calories. If you want
to start taking kids' snacks seriously, a good place to get started
is the Internet. For a feast of snacks start with
http://godzilla.eecs
</P>
<P>
   .berkeley.edu/recipes/snacks/index4.html. Just under the granola
category alone we found at least 50 variations of that classic.
Besides that there are hundreds of other possibilities, from
easy-to-make fruit bars to energy balls.

easily stored, check out http://www.gorp.com/gorp/food/foogorp

 &HT;    Take the labor out of Labor Day meals with hassle-free desserts
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Labor Day weekend, the last three-day interlude of the
summer. Maybe the relatives are headed your way, and you'd like to
have a sweet snack on hand to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Or your neighbors have invited you over for a backyard blowout
and your duty is dessert.
</P>
<P>
   But working in the kitchen is not your idea of taking a break.
As much as you'd like to show your family and friends they're
special, this just isn't the weekend to pull out the
cake-decorating kit and heat up the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret. We know how to take the labor out of Labor Day
desserts without resorting to the nearest bakery or supermarket
freezer case. There are a number of crowd pleasers that don't
require a 12-step cooking process, then a cleaning crew.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few basic cooking tools, you can throw together a
Chocolate Raspberry Cobbler Cake that's sure to be a sensation. Or
if you have a crowd coming, we've got a recipe for Orange Butter
Balls that takes just 20 minutes from start to finish and yields
several dozen irresistible morsels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of our recipes come from the series of ``One Pot''
cookbooks written by Andrew Schloss and Ken Bookman. By using only
one pan, these recipes eliminate not only hassle in the preparation
but also a sinkful of dirty dishes afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the idea when I used to visit a friend of mine who is
culinary-impaired,'' Schloss said. ``She always had the same
chocolate cake, which she said she could make because it only
required one pan. So I took the idea and started experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Cakes are by far the trickiest to streamline, Schloss says,
because they are more sensitive to chemical balances. Any recipe
that calls for beating egg whites is out, said Schloss, because
that requires a mixer and bowl. But many sweet treats can be
adapted to a ``one-pot technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some general guidelines from ``One Pot Chocolate
Desserts'' (Broadway Books, $12.95) for streamlining baking and
dessert recipes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Eliminate sifting of dry ingredients in many recipes. Sifting
is done to aerate the ingredients, but aerating flour is essential
for only the most delicate sponge or angel food cakes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Simplify the creaming of butter and sugar by partially
melting the butter in a large saucepan. The heat generated
completes the melting off the stovetop. When chocolate is part of
the recipe, it, too, will finish melting off the heat, so there's
no danger of scorching.
</P>
<P>
   -- Using the same saucepan as for the butter, add less
heat-sensitive ingredients next, such as sugar, vanilla, spices,
sour cream and yogurt. Then add the eggs after the mixture has
cooled a bit to prevent curdling.
</P>
<P>
   -- Baking powder and baking soda are added in pinches to allow
them to soften and disperse through the batter before the remaining
dry ingredients are added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this technique is you can bake a lot more often.
I can throw a cake in the oven an hour before the kids get home or
when I start making dinner,'' Schloss says.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, we offer low-labor desserts perfect for the busy,
back-to-school pace of the coming weeks. None requires hauling out
mixers or food processors, or more than 20 minutes' preparation. We
show you how to become the star of the school bake sale with ``The
Dampest, Darkest, Deadliest Brownies of All Time.'' And the trick
to making s'mores without building a bonfire.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Down-home cooking with taste of Japan
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ If Michiko's restaurant were a bar, you could
call it Cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Hood tends to patrons with the casual care of a genial host
at home, while his wife, Michiko, turns out the dishes from the
kitchen, leading many regulars to call it ``the only Japanese
restaurant you'll find with home cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's the only one I've found in the
Georgia-Tennessee-North Carolina mountains. Hoping to appeal to
visitors drawn to the area by the kayak and whitewater events at
the nearby Olympic venue on the Ocoee River, the Hoods opened
Michiko's before the 1996 Games. ``We figured people would come
here for a short visit, and later on, they'd come back to eat with
us,'' says Herb Hood.
</P>
<P>
   The Games are over, and the visitors keep coming, kayaks and
canoes lashed atop the sport utility vehicles that line downtown
streets on weekends. Weekdays, however, area regulars hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   Michiko's very existence in this tiny community on the
Georgia-Tennessee border says much about the general blending of
culinary cultures in inland America _ and in particular, about the
increasing popularity of Japanese cuisine, echoing the longtime
establishment of Chinese restaurants in myriad small towns across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Herb, a native of McCaysville, and Michiko, who was born in
Tokyo, married almost 45 years ago in her hometown. After he spent
22 years in the Air Force and 22 years with the Postal Service, the
Hoods, parents of five, moved here in 1991_ opening the restaurant
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is like many such establishments, serving
teriyaki chicken, shrimp tempura, nori maki (seaweed and rice
rolled around crab meat and carrot) and many other dishes,
including two of my favorites, red miso soup (heartier and thicker
than white miso soup) and scrambled tofu with fresh vegetables over
rice.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, Michiko's is a gathering place for townsfolk _
individuals and groups. ``The Kiwanis Club met here just last
night,'' Herb said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   One night during green tea after dinner, he pulled out a huge
stack of photographs, many of them very old, showing buildings and
people in downtown McCaysville-Copperhill, as well as scenes from
the once flourishing copper industry. The fading photographs
amounted to a historical tour of the Copper Basin.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thomas, a retired newspaperman and still active
raconteur, and I have enjoyed our ink-stained chats at the
restaurant. And at lunchtime, I've seen the big round table near
the door filled with dining women who swap stories and share the
fun fostered by the gentleman I call ``the scarf man.'' He's
officially Clark Barker, a retired Air Force officer, who on any
given day is likely to stroll into Michiko's carrying a colorful
array of scarves, giving them away with a flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know who's going to show up,'' says Herb.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure: You don't show up more than once without
everybody knowing your name.

 &HT;    A marmalade cake that is easier to make
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As promised last week, here is an orange marmalade cake that is
considerably easier to make than the one we published last week.
That one, created by Atlanta chef Scott Peacock for Victoria
magazine, was based on a prize-winning cake in Jan Karon's Mitford
novels.
</P>
<P>
   After Margarett Kinton of Roswell requested such a recipe,
dozens of readers sent in Peacock's version. Still others sent
recipes for orange marmalade cakes they found in their own files.
Our tester liked this one from Anna Hall of Marietta, topping lemon
cake mix with a mixture of marmalade, coconut and butter.

 &HT;    Jackson's 8th CD good fix for fans
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, Alan Jackson has become country music's name
brand label. Like a pair of quality workboots that show up each
year in an outdoor catalog, his handcrafted songs are always a
perfect, functional fit for the hard-core country fan. This new CD
(Jackson's eighth), is another dose of pristine, pickup truck music
that deviates little from his satisfying, established pedal
steel-and-fiddle formula. He dabbles in cowboy swing (``Right on
the Money''), odes to the pre-Wal-Mart, good ol' days (``Little
Man''), and badly broken hearts (``What a Day Yesterday Was''). In
the tune ``I'll Go on Loving You,'' the normally reserved Jackson
gets downright sexy as he recites a kind of muscle shirt rap about
``slippin' off your dress'' and ``the pleasures of the flesh.''
Whew. The weepie ``Gone Crazy,'' about the end of a relationship,
is so effectively melancholy it's enough to make you spill tears
without blinking. Jackson may not be bold in his experimentation,
but so what?

 &HT;    Unusual touches give Willie creative edge
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a very few of the most ornery entertainers who have
survived decades, generations, of career upheavals and passing
fashions, Willie Nelson has learned how to hone everything down to
the essence. He's so purely gestural in his approach to
performance, so ruthlessly pared-away, that his glance is as good
as a gander. So it makes a certain kind of sense to hear Nelson in
the hands of New Orleans studio wizard Daniel Lanois, the former
Brian Eno protege, who has built a magnetic reputation as the
high-end Don Was: lending some aesthetic pizazz to longtime artists
whose icon status has slipped a few notches.
</P>
<P>
   Those unfamiliar should know that Lanois is Mr. Atmospheric,
beloved of ambient washes of sound that have an almost mystically
hypnotic effect. It's tweaky, but effective, doing the trick for
Bob Dylan (``Time Out of Mind''), Emmylou Harris (``Wrecking
Ball''), and even the studio-unfriendly Neville Brothers (``Yellow
Moon''). It works for Willie, too, who has made one of the best
albums of his life, often singing in tandem with Harris, and
sensitively set up with a set list that emphasizes, as one title
puts it, ``My Own Peculiar Way.''
</P>
<P>
   His plain speech and scruffy elegance are powerfully contrasted
by African-influenced drumming and floaty guitar licks that could
make you wonder if you walked in on a Paul Simon album by mistake.
But the genius here is clearly the singer and the song, as a
30-year-old gem called ``I've Just Destroyed the World'' will
testify.

   What we have here is an album of pretty decent songs sung
extraordinarily well. Sure, the first release from this debut has
remained atop the R&AMP;B charts for the past five weeks, but ``Friend
of Mine'' would be just another somebody's-done-some-woman-wrong
song if it wasn't Kelly Price telling the story. Price isn't simply
a narrator. For her, microphones become lecterns from behind which
her soaring range and emotive ability compel you to ache along with
the betrayed in ``Friend,'' appreciate the women in your life in
``Soul of a Woman'' and testify as she does in the song most
complementary to her talents, the truly soul-powered ``Lord of
All.''

<P>
   This sophomore effort by Welsh quintet Catatonia recently hit
No. 1 on the British charts, suggesting that there are slim
pickings across the pond these days. Whereas fellow Welsh acts
Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci attempt to expand the
boundaries of pop, Catatonia hews to the standard alterna-rock
formula. Singer Cerys Matthews, whose voice is pitched somewhere
between those of Bjork and the Divinyls' Christina Amphlett,
displays a modicum of charisma. And the leadoff track, ``Mulder and
Scully,'' cleverly evokes TV's favorite alien investigators in a
lyric about the mysteries of desire. But, mostly, ``International
Velvet'' offers the sound of a band beating a dead horse.

   Former Husker Du and Sugar frontman Bob Mould has announced that
this fall's tour will be his last with a full electric band; hence
the title of his fourth solo recording. Though not surprising, it's
still a shame, because he sounds hungry for the first time in
years. The guitars clatter and ring with renewed vigor behind the
best batch of songs Mould has offered since Sugar's 1992 debut,
``Copper Blue.'' Despite his instrumental exuberance, he's never
the most upbeat of lyricists, so this set is frequently concerned
with things lost or taken away, as titles such as ``Moving Trucks''
and ``Taking Everything'' attest. In ``First Drag of the Day,''
Mould intones that ``it's starting to sound like it's time to sign
off.'' I beg to differ.

<P>
   Having dabbled in jazz and pop standards of late, New Orleans
R&AMP;B great Dr. John attempts to resurrect the spooky, funky vibe of
his late-1960s work on his 36th (!) album. An unlikely corps of
supporting players help him set the mood _ ``Anutha Zone'' boasts
cameos by members of such cutting-edge British acts as Supergrass
and Spiritualized. But the ultra-slick production by hot British
knob-twiddler John Leckie (The Verve, Radiohead) undercuts the
hoodoo groove of such numbers as ``Ki Ya Gris Gris'' and ``John
Gris,'' and the guest artists sound curiously anonymous.
Thankfully, Dr. John's born-on-the-bayou rasp and effortlessly
soulful piano playing add spice to this somewhat bland gumbo.

   Here's a vertible trove of 1970s sonic nonsense. Almost
everything is here: Diana Ross' ``The Boss,'' Sylvester's ``You

This Way,'' Odyssey's ``Native New Yorker'' and Silver Convention's
``Fly Robin Fly.'' Although ``54'' isn't the first retro '70s flick
to cobble together two soundtracks worth of vintage disco (1997's
``Boogie Nights'' also did an admirable job), this set is far more
delectably cheesy and comprehensive. Whether you were old enough to
don puka beads and actually get into disco clubs 20 years ago or
just fantasized about it while suffering through the watered-down,
PG version of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' this collection is a
must-have. One further advantage is that most of this material was
originally issued on vinyl and only now is making its CD debut.

 &HT;    iMacs: the Apple of the consumers' eye
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apple Computer is shipping ``tens of thousands'' of iMacs a week
but still can't meet the demand for the company's glitzy new
consumer model.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, some computer retailers say iMacs are selling out
almost daily but that they they are able to restock them in a day
or so. Still, Apple Computer estimates that it has a backlog of
150,000 orders for the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not been able to keep with the demand,'' Steve Jobs, the
company's interim chief executive told the opening session of the
Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Inability to meet demand is not a new problem for Apple
Computer. In the past, the company has left retailers waiting up to
months for their machines.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the problem is not supply, it's demand,
according to Apple. Jobs said the company is shipping tens of
thousands of iMacs a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants nationwide report receiving up to 60 new iMacs
daily but then sell them out in a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, iMacs are sold at CompUsa and Micro Center in
Marietta. CompUsa couldn't be reached for comment but a spokesman
for Micro Center said that the store continues to receive iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   The machines sells out quickly, said Micro Center. Demand,
though, has tapered off from the feverish pace of the first two
weeks following Apple Computer's release of the iMac on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Jobs said he was thrilled with the continued
interest in the iMac. ``We have had a phenomenal response to this
product,'' he said in his keynote address to Seybold.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the struggle to meet demand in the US, Apple Computer
has begun selling the iMac in Japan. Already, that market is sold
out through September, said Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Apple Computer plans to launch the iMac in Europe.

 &HT;    CLINTON ON LEWINSKY AFFAIR: 'IT'S TIME TO ... GO BACK TO WORK'
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CLINTON-0903.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES and BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Defiant in the face of his critics, President Clinton
said Wednesday he had said enough about his Oval Office affair with
Monica Lewinsky and appeared to rule out any further public
discussion of the matter or a formal apology to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Donning his mantle as leader of the free world, Clinton said he
was too busy trying to tame nuclear arms and avert a global
financial meltdown to devote additional attention to a scandal that
has dogged his presidency for nearly eight months and raised the
prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And, with an eye toward polls suggesting the American public is
weary of the tawdry matter and wary of the methods of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, Clinton took another swipe at the federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Starr's investigation has ''consumed a
disproportionate amount of America's time, money and resources and
attention,'' and, once again, urged the country to set the matter
aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of valuable time
with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was going
back to work,'' Clinton said in response to a question at the
closing press conference of a two-day summit with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see from what we're discussing here, there are very
large issues that will affect the future of the American people in
the short run and over the long run,'' Clinton said, standing
beside Yeltsin in an ornate Kremlin ceremonial room. ''There are
large issues that have to be dealt with now in the world, and at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides have suggested in recent days that Clinton
revisit the Lewinsky matter publicly to help counter criticism that
he was more combative than contrite when he addressed the nation on
the issue August 17.
</P>
<P>
   In the nationally televised address, Clinton acknowledged that
he had misled his wife and the American people about a relationship
that was ''not appropriate.'' He did not explicitly apologize for
the affair or for the months of deception, however. Nor did he ask
for national forgiveness, saying instead that the matter was
''nobody's business but ours,'' a reference to his family.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of varying ideological stripes assailed the speech,
saying it fell short of a full apology and was laden with
gratuitous criticism of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked the first time Clinton has taken questions on
the matter since his speech to the nation, and he appeared to have
a ready response. He said the speech he gave was a good one and the
American people liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have actually been quite heartened by the reaction of the
American people and leaders throughout the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read it again the other day and I thought it was clear that
I was expressing my profound regret to all who were hurt and to all
who were involved, and my desire not to see any more people hurt by
this process who are caught up in it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I was commenting that it seemed to be something that most
reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate
amount of America's time, money and resources and attention and was
now continuing to involve more and more people,'' Clinton
continued. ''It's time for us to now go back to the work of the
country, give the people their government back.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Stephen Hess said there was little Clinton
might do now to correct the deficiencies his critics perceived in
his earlier address.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did it. He didn't do it well, he didn't do it right, but to
try to fine-tune it, I think, would not really go over very well,''
said Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank. ''Maybe now that's going to be the party
line -- 'We've said it, that's it and we're just going to move
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear whether Clinton's critics would be
satisfied with Wednesday's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction was muted on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers from both
parties are awaiting Starr's investigation report, likely to be
sent to Congress soon after the House returns from its summer
recess next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With midterm elections in November, Democrats are being cautious
not to be too critical of their party's standard bearer, while
Republicans are wary of overstepping public opinion by sounding off
too sharply against a president who continues to enjoy job approval
ratings topping 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Minority leader Richard Gephardt said the
Missouri Democrat would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   In general though, the aide said, Gephardt doesn't feel it's
necessary for Clinton to say anything further about the matter in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''He thinks the president's apologized, he felt that he's done
enough and that it took a great deal of courage to do what he
did,'' the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   An aide for Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said that publicly the
senator's had little to say about the Lewinsky matter and is
awaiting the Starr report before commenting further.
</P>
<P>
   ''On background,'' the aide said, ''I'm not sure he wants to
hear anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, have been scathing in their criticism of
Clinton since his August admission.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Monday that
Clinton had squandered the moral authority necessary to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a moral dimension to the American presidency, and
today that dimension, that power, has been lost in scandal and in
deception,'' Lott said. ''I am very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas,
have called for Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report will be critical in a decision by the House over
whether to begin impeachment proceedings against Clinton, censure
him, or do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   When allegations first surfaced in January that Clinton had an
affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, he categorically
denied it. For the past seven months, he's dispatched cabinet
members and senior aides to deny it as well, a strategy he
abandoned last month, only after Starr's investigation had
reportedly turned up extensive evidence rebutting Clinton's earlier
denials.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped the Russia summit would give Clinton
an estimable setting in which to put the Lewinsky scandal behind
him and concentrate on foreign policy. But two of the three
questions from American reporters Wednesday were about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   That drew the ire of ninth-term Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who
jumped an American correspondent after the press conference, wagged
a scolding finger in his face and upbraided him for raising the
Lewinsky matter in the Kremlin press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Speaking as an American, I'm outraged,'' Hoyer told Reuter's
White House Correspondent Lawrence McQuillan, former president of
the White House Correspondents Association. Hoyer said the scribe
had tried to embarrass the president abroad and he admonished the
American media to ''drop its obsession'' with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   McQuillan later told reporters traveling with Clinton that his
questions were justified.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Clinton gave the most important speech of his presidency
two weeks ago and then went into hiding,'' McQuillan said. ''l
didn't choose the venue,'' for Wednesday's questions, ''he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica-gate was also on the minds of some Russians.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton met with parliamentary and regional leaders in
Moscow, one emerged to give his own bizarre assessment of meeting
the American president for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy Monica Lewinsky,'' a smiling Dmitri Ayatskov, governor
of the region of Saratov, told reporters as he left the meeting
with Clinton. ``He's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied to Moscow by his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and some White House correspondents looked for body
language and nuance to assess their relationship in the wake of
Clinton's confession.
</P>
<P>
   Some media reports noted that Hillary Clinton introduced her
husband at a Russian elementary school on Tuesday, but failed to
say just that: ``my husband,'' her customary public reference to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of a Russia-US summit Monday, the Russian
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, known as ``Mad Vlad'' for
his outrageousness, told parliament that Clinton should stay at
home and marry Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as individuals with high moral character, would prefer not
to meet a person who still can't sort out his relationship with his
secretary,'' said Zhirinovsky, himself no stranger to questions
about moral character. He bottles his own vodka with his face on
the label and starred in his own soft-porn film last year.

 &HT;    `Sphere's' technical spots shine
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The weird thing about ``Sphere'' is that it could well go down
in history _ cinema and national _ as the film that made ``Wag the
Dog'' possible. Director Barry Levinson and star Dustin Hoffman
were committed to this big-budget, special-effects picture when
scheduling fallout gave them some free time. So they made ``Wag the
Dog,'' which, along with The Dress, The Tie and The Bombing Raids,
has become part of the whole Bill 'n' Monica lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   But back to ``Sphere,'' which has recently come out on DVD. As
movies with heavyweights like Levinson, Hoffman, Sharon Stone and
Samuel L. Jackson go, it's something of a disappointment
(translation: not worth renting on video). But the DVD format
brings out the picture's technical excellence, beginning with the
opening shot of Hoffman's helicopter sweeping over the Pacific to a
secret destination. What awaits him and his fellow experts? A giant
alien sphere that crash-landed in the ocean ... 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bonuses here are twofold: a mini-history of sci-fi in the
movies (it takes up screen after screen of print, but it's
well-researched for a surface treatment) and voice-over comments by
stars Hoffman and Jackson. Hoffman reveals that some of the scenes
were improvised, while Jackson explains his shaved-head look: It
wasn't an homage to Michael Jordan but a carry-over from a film
he'd just shot, ``The Red Violin.''

 &HT;    Kiki isn't your typical witch
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Kiki's Delivery Service'' (G) _ Dubbed in English and
released for video by Disney, this animated 1989 Japanese film from
director Hayao Miyazaki (the upcoming ``Princess Mononoke'') is a
visually opulent girl-power fable for preteens. Kiki is a young
witch living in the countryside with her witch mom and human dad.
Now 13, it's Kiki's duty to hop on her broomstick and fly off to an
unknown city to train as a neophyte sorceress for a year. (This is
a strange plot-starter, not to mention the fact that witches in
this movie wear eggplant-colored shifts and bows in their hair and
wish to be helpful, not scary.) Alone in a beautiful town with her
talking black cat, Jiji, Kiki finds work as an airborne delivery
girl and makes a bunch of friends. In its 103-minute running time,
there's not much tension or conflict. But some of the animation _
particularly the elaborate backgrounds _ are breathtaking. Priced
to buy: $19.99.

 &HT;    'A second life': Couple still together despite severe brain
injuries
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_On one of their first outings, Mandy Fugate and Morris
Steinheimer took a walk outside her mother's home. It was an
inauspicious beginning. En route home, she accidentally tripped
Steinheimer, giving him a bloody nose when he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven months later, they move in sync. In the living room
of their apartment, Fugate rises from her chair, her right arm
reaching out to steady herself. Steinheimer immediately grabs her
cane and places it within her reach.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when the couple recite their wedding vows, their
promise to stay together and love each other ``in sickness and in
health'' will have greater meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a disability where they can't live alone,'' says
Fugate's mother, Sandy. ``But together they're one whole person.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fugate, 22, and Steinheimer, 36, are recovering from severe
traumatic brain injuries. Their plan to live independently
confounds their doctors early predictions and delights their
families. But their challenges likely will last the rest of their
lives.quote from someone at the brain injury association here about
the difficulties of recovery from this type of injury?)
</P>
<P>
   Brain injuries can affect the entire body, slurring speech,
blocking communication skills, or hindering movement and
coordination. At the most extreme, brain injuries can leave people
in a vegetative state, unaware of the environment around them and
in need constant care, usually at a nursing home. On the other end
of the spectrum, a mild brain injury causes temporary confusion and
short-term memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fugate and Steinheimer suffered severe brain injuries after
vehicle accidents, the most common cause.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before her 11th birthday, Fugate fell off an
all-terrain vehicle, slamming her head against the ground after
being thrown some 10 feet in the air. She was in a a coma for six
weeks, and doctors told her mother that she would never wake up,
and if she did, she would probably be in a vegetative state and
would require around-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
   Steinheimer's car accident, which left him partially paralyzed,
was 15 years ago. He keeps a reminder in the pocket of his pants:
Pins that were drilled into his toes to help them heal, then
removed when they began to cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take them out, in case someone asks me why I walk so
funny,'' he says. ``Everything has been changed since the time of
the accident. It's like living a second life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingering the pins with his hands, Steinheimer says they also
are a symbol of bad choices. He had been drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   Though Steinheimer walks hunched, he no longer walks with a cane
and has few other outward signs of disability. Fugate's family
hopes her progress will follow his.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he lived with his parents on a ranch in Good
Hope, Ga., where the former mechanic helped with the farm. Now he
is looking for volunteer opportunities or a job to make use of his
Mr. Fix-it abilities, and to keep him busy while Fugate undergoes
daily rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's brain injury was at least as severe. After waking up
from her coma, she didn't speak for three months. She was paralyzed
from the neck down _ not from spinal injury but because her brain
couldn't tell her body what to do. She had to relearn the most
basic functions _ controlling her bowel movements, brushing her
teeth and swallowing, for example. It took 17 months of therapy to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, therapists had to retrain undamaged brain cells to
pick up where the damaged brain cells left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thousand times harder to teach them over again than to
teach a baby,'' says her mother, Sandy Fugate. ``I brought home
this child that wasn't the same as the one I took in.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 years after the accident, Fugate this year moved
out of her mother's house and into an apartment. An assistant stays
with her 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Steinheimer joined her, so the couple could
prepare to become independent and test what it would be like to
live together. They soon will have the assistant's help four days a
week, instead of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Like other young couples making a life together, it's give and
take. Early mornings, they exercise together, walking along the
patio, riding an exercise bike and doing sit ups. Though it's part
of Fugate's rehabilitation program, it's more important to exercise
now than ever, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wedding dress barely fits,'' Fugate jokes, carefully
enunciating each syllable.
</P>
<P>
   Steinheimer helps Fugate apply make-up, brushing her eye lashes
with mascara and painting her lips a glossy pink. Sometimes, he
helps her with nail polish. ``I don't mind helping her because of
the shakiness of her hand,'' he says. ``It's hard to paint the
nails on your right hand if you're right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's right hand is dominant, not only because she is
right-handed, but also because the left side of her body is
generally weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she wears a single white glove on her left hand because
her hand gets cold from lack of circulation. When it does,
Steinheimer helps her, finger by finger, slip the glove onto her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only appropriate that Steinheimer does the deed _ he
now has use of both his hands. His left hand was the dominant one
after his accident, and for some time, he walked with his right arm
perpetually held against his chest.
</P>
<P>
   After they prepare breakfast together, Fugate's full day of
therapy gets started, often at her computer.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, two clocks rest on the wall above the computer
station. Both tell the time, but one has colored slips of paper at
each hour, noting breakfast at 7 a.m., dinner at 6 p.m. and other
activities like physical therapy and tutoring throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The labels are reminders, like those in the kitchen where
cabinets have tags for ``large bowls,'' ``small bowls'' and ``good
China,'' and the refrigerator door has a list of foods that are
stored inside and the week's menu of foods to be eaten. Even light
switches have notes, to turn the light off after leaving the room.
</P>
<P>
   The tags affirm the ongoing problems that brain injury patients
face, life-long scars that can appear in cognitive problems like
memory or fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Leila Hartly, a speech and cognitive therapist,
visits Fugate at 10 a.m. First they practice repeated sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa,'' Fugate says, enunciating as fast as she can.
She uses a computer program developed for vision and speech therapy
that times the speed of her speech. As she speaks into the
microphone, a frog on the computer screen jumps from lily pad to
lily pad, to the rhythm of her words. At the end, it gives her a
score by averaging the speed of her speech. Though it continues to
improve, her speech remains much slower than average.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the computer, a board lists the different speech
exercises Fugate must practice on her own: Work on saying two pages
of long words, getting the accent on the right syllable and getting
good speed; practice sheets of words, phrases and sentences; look
in the mirror; keep jaw closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's rehabilitation program is designed to help her regain
her fullest potential, but it is an expensive one that has taken an
inordinate amount of time and money to develop. Besides Hartly, two
academic teachers, a physical therapist and a neuropsychologist
visit Fugate on a set schedule that she, her mother and health care
specialists developed a few years ago. Each therapist can charge up
to $150 an hour and monthly expenses usually totals $10,000,
including rent and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is out of the family's pocket. Fugate doesn't qualify
for Medicaid, and private insurance won't cover her pre-existing
illness. Instead, some money flows in from a lawsuit that the
family won after the accident; her mother also mortgaged her home
to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I get the money back. It's worth it just to
see the independence she's gained,'' Sandy Fugate says.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy tale wedding is worth it, too, her mother says. Fugate
will wear a traditional white gown and $800 corrective wedding
shoes, designed so that she can walk down the aisle without her
cane. A horse and buggy will transport the couple to the wedding
site at a country club in Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will join hands outdoors before a hundred guests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they have any fears about the relationship,
Fugate's reply is succint: ``No.'' Then she adds, ``I'm very
thrilled about everything. I'm looking forward to getting
married.''
</P>
<P>
   working on this ending Steinheimer is looking forward to a life
he never thought he'd have. ``It's such a good feeling to be with
someone who's been through something I've been through.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Some celluloid salutes to working men and women
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The origins of Labor Day _ that oxymoronic holiday _ have almost
been lost. For most of us, it's become a last long weekend before
the grind of work, school, etc., sets in. But lest we forget, Labor
Day, which was declared a national holiday by Congress in 1894, was
instigated by a Philadelphia-based secret organization of working
men called the Knights of Labor. So God bless the working man (and
woman), and here are some ideas of how to honor them at the video
store.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Blue Collar'' (1978): Having written ``Taxi Driver'' for
Martin Scorsese and ``Obsession'' for Brian De Palma, Paul Schrader
made his directorial debut with this astute story of three friends
(Yaphet Kotto, Harvey Keitel and Richard Pryor) who work on the
assembly line at an auto factory in Detroit. Figuring that their
union does them no more favors than it does their bosses, they
decide to rob the union office. The filming was pretty much a
battle on all sides. Kotto and Keitel were having problems with
Schrader, and all three were having problems with a deep-into-drugs
Pryor. Plus, even before production began, the Detroit city fathers
decided that the movie might not be a paean to their No. 1
industry. So, 10 days before shooting, Schrader still didn't have
an automobile assembly line lined up. At the last minute, the owner
of a Checker Cab plant in Kalamazoo offered his place.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Molly Maguires'' (1970): Sean Connery and Richard
Harris both got their Irish up for Martin Ritt's film about rugged
Irish immigrant coal miners in Pennsylvania in the 1870s. Tired of
being exploited by the mine owners, they form a secret union called
the Molly Maguires. Connery plays the group's leader, while Harris
is a company detective sent to infiltrate it. While it's somewhat
preachy _ director Ritt wanted to stress parallels with the 1960s
civil rights movement _ the movie benefits from its two charismatic
leads and a compelling, fact-based story. The studio, incidentally,
wanted Ritt to shoot in color, while he leaned toward a grittier
black and white. He solved the problem by agreeing to color, then
saturating everything on location (Eckley, Pa.) in coal dust.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Norma Rae'' (1979): Martin Ritt went back to the factory
with this movie about management-labor struggles in a Southern
textile mill. Also reality-based, it stars Sally Field as a
blue-collar wife, mother and millworker transformed into a union
maid by labor organizer Ron Liebman. Though it lost to ``Kramer vs.
Kramer'' in the race for best picture, the film won Field the first
of her two Oscars as best actress. Accepting the award from
presenter Richard Dreyfuss, she graciously told the audience,
``Marty Ritt is Norma Rae; he's fought all his life to put on films
that have something to say.'' Shot just across the state line in
Alabama, ``Norma Rae'' used a lot of Atlanta talent in featured
roles. Among the more noticeable faces on the factory floor are
Stuart Culpepper and a then Atlanta-based Grace Zabriskie
(best-known these days as the woman who almost became George's
mother-in-law on ``Seinfeld'').
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Devil and Miss Jones'' (1941): Not to be confused with
``The Devil in Miss Jones,'' a well-known porno film of the
mid-1970s. In this Capra-esque social comedy (actually directed by
Sam Wood), longtime character actor Charles Coburn plays a gruff,
standoffish millionaire who poses as a shoe clerk in his own
department store to ferret out potential malcontents among the
workers. Robert Cummings is the union man most likely to lose his
job, and Jean Arthur is Coburn's unsuspecting co-worker, who takes
him under her wing and humanizes him. The movie was co-produced by
Arthur's husband, who was trying to find his wife better roles. It
worked; she got her best reviews since ``Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington.'' But the movie belongs to Coburn, who also nabbed a
best supporting actor nomination.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Roger and Me'' (1989): The ``Roger'' in the title is Roger
Smith, then chairman of General Motors. The ``me'' is Michael
Moore, who made his film debut with this hilarious, heart-wrenching
documentary and went on to a successful career as a professional
thorn in the side of corporate America. His movie shows what
happened in his hometown of Flint, Mich., after GM closed its plant
there. Quite simply, the town died _ a slow, agonizing death made
worse by GM's indifference and the buffoonish efforts of the city
fathers (at one point, they try making it a tourist mecca). The
spine of the film concerns Moore's one-man crusade to bring Smith
to Flint to see the human cost of the closing. Essentially, it's
moviemaking as grudge match, as unabashedly one-sided as a protest
march. Moore was up to his old tricks more recently with ``The Big
One,'' a look at corporate downsizing across the nation.

 &HT;    Passage of time sinks the big ship
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Icome not to praise ``Titanic,'' but to sink it.
</P>
<P>
   I gave the blockbuster teen tear-jerker an A- when I reviewed it
last winter. But the ``minus'' part of that grade, like a stealth
iceberg, has grown bigger in the intervening months till it's
punched a hole in the side of my first reaction.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the loathsome behavior of writer-director James
Cameron, with his crowing rooster routine and fake piety at the
Oscars. No, you can't judge a movie by the spoiled behavior of
directors, or their bad habits. If we did, who could love
Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's technologically groundbreaking film made us believe
the unsinkable liner was sinking again, right before our eyes. His
visionary approach in past movies has sparked new technology,
particularly in CGI (computer-generated imagery). Remember the
watery probe in ``The Abyss,'' or the liquid-metal dude in
``Terminator 2?'' Thank Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   So how come my estimation of ``Titanic'' has sunk so low? Well,
it's a mix of his cardboard script and the avalanche of awards the
movie won.
</P>
<P>
   When it first came out, the air-brained Harlequin romance
between lower-class Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and upper-class Rose
(Kate Winslet) was a guilty pleasure. And the wrap-around story
with Gloria Stuart as the ancient Rose was good nose-blowing hokum
for the Kleenex-susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' is still grand entertainment. But it isn't original.
It's a paste-up job, a pastiche that exploits our nostalgia for a
more innocent kind of movie (and period of history). It's like
``Star Wars'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' both astonishing
bits of affectionate wizardry. But like these films, ``Titanic''
is, for all its heart-will-go-on melodrama, a heartless, shrewd
piece of machinery. And it functioned exactly as Cameron wanted it
to, at the box office, at the Price-Waterhouse ballot box and now
at your local video store.
</P>
<P>
   Did the movie deserve its technical Oscars? Absolutely. But an
Oscar for best picture of the year? No. Unless the year is 1937,
not '97.

 &HT;    Automobile accidents account for 50% of brain injuries
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee

<P>
   ATLANTA_As seat belts, air bags and medical technology have
improved chances of surviving a head injury in recent years, health
care specialists have stepped up efforts to treatand research brain
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 375,000 Americans are hospitalized each year because of a
traumatic brain injury. Of them, more than 90,000 sustain lifelong
disabling conditions. The annual cost of traumatic brain injuries
in the United States is $48.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia alone, more than 60,000 people incur a brain injury
each year; about 1,700 of them die and 2,000 face permanent
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But because brain injuries are individual, it is often difficult
to predict what those disabling conditions may be. Depending on
which portion of the brain is damaged, communication or
coordination skills may be affected in varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more severe the injury, the longer the recovery period and
the greater the deficits the injury creates,'' said Dr. Alan
Harben, a physiatrist at Emory University (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Automobile accidents account for 50 percent of brain injury
incidents while others are the result of sports accidents, falls or
gun violence. Most incidents cause one of two types of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In one, the brain directly hits the skull. Most often, the
impact leads to injuries in the frontal and temporal lobes, the
parts of the brain that plan day-to-day activities and regulate
memory. In addition, car accidents can also force the head to slow
down too quickly, jolting the brain within the skull and damaging
nerve cells and blood vessels by shearing or stretching them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanical trauma happens in about 50 milliseconds, but
over the next few hours and days, there are biochemical events
occurring that lead to toxic injury to the brain,'' Harben said.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary phase, the injury can worsen, as toxic
chemicals can cause the brain to swell. Damage to other organs in
the body can cause drops in blood pressure or in oxygen
concentration in the bloodstream, both affecting the brain, Harben
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, doctors diagnose patients with mild, moderate or
severe brain injuries. Effects of mild brain injuries - dizziness,
confusion, fatigue - usually disappear within a few hours or days.
</P>
<P>
   Those with moderate brain injuries suffer a loss of
consciousness for less than six hours. They have some degree of
impairment in thinking, attention, problem solving and
concentration, but will eventually resolve most problems within
three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Severe brain injuries cause a loss of consciousness for more
than six hours. Patients may have amnesia for more than a day,
suffer cognitive deficits and experience paralysis, a loss of
balance, visual and hearing difficulties and sometimes behavior
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Support groups and the Brain Injury Association of Georgia help
patients and families struggling to cope.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's brain injury support groups are behind Amendment 3, a
state constitutional amendment on November's ballot establishing a
Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Trust Fund, with money from a 10
percent increase in fines for drunken drivers.

 &HT;    'A second life': Couple still together despite severe brain
injuries
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_On one of their first outings, Mandy Fugate and Morris
Steinheimer took a walk outside her mother's home. It was an
inauspicious beginning. En route home, she accidentally tripped
Steinheimer, giving him a bloody nose when he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven months later, they move in sync. In the living room
of their apartment, Fugate rises from her chair, her right arm
reaching out to steady herself. Steinheimer immediately grabs her
cane and places it within her reach.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, when the couple recite their wedding vows, their
promise to stay together and love each other ``in sickness and in
health'' will have greater meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a disability where they can't live alone,'' says
Fugate's mother, Sandy. ``But together they're one whole person.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fugate, 22, and Steinheimer, 36, are recovering from severe
traumatic brain injuries. Their plan to live independently
confounds their doctors early predictions and delights their
families. But their challenges likely will last the rest of their
lives.quote from someone at the brain injury association here about
the difficulties of recovery from this type of injury?)
</P>
<P>
   Brain injuries can affect the entire body, slurring speech,
blocking communication skills, or hindering movement and
coordination. At the most extreme, brain injuries can leave people
in a vegetative state, unaware of the environment around them and
in need constant care, usually at a nursing home. On the other end
of the spectrum, a mild brain injury causes temporary confusion and
short-term memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fugate and Steinheimer suffered severe brain injuries after
vehicle accidents, the most common cause.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before her 11th birthday, Fugate fell off an
all-terrain vehicle, slamming her head against the ground after
being thrown some 10 feet in the air. She was in a a coma for six
weeks, and doctors told her mother that she would never wake up,
and if she did, she would probably be in a vegetative state and
would require around-the-clock care.
</P>
<P>
   Steinheimer's car accident, which left him partially paralyzed,
was 15 years ago. He keeps a reminder in the pocket of his pants:
Pins that were drilled into his toes to help them heal, then
removed when they began to cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take them out, in case someone asks me why I walk so
funny,'' he says. ``Everything has been changed since the time of
the accident. It's like living a second life.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingering the pins with his hands, Steinheimer says they also
are a symbol of bad choices. He had been drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   Though Steinheimer walks hunched, he no longer walks with a cane
and has few other outward signs of disability. Fugate's family
hopes her progress will follow his.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he lived with his parents on a ranch in Good
Hope, Ga., where the former mechanic helped with the farm. Now he
is looking for volunteer opportunities or a job to make use of his
Mr. Fix-it abilities, and to keep him busy while Fugate undergoes
daily rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's brain injury was at least as severe. After waking up
from her coma, she didn't speak for three months. She was paralyzed
from the neck down _ not from spinal injury but because her brain
couldn't tell her body what to do. She had to relearn the most
basic functions _ controlling her bowel movements, brushing her
teeth and swallowing, for example. It took 17 months of therapy to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, therapists had to retrain undamaged brain cells to
pick up where the damaged brain cells left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thousand times harder to teach them over again than to
teach a baby,'' says her mother, Sandy Fugate. ``I brought home
this child that wasn't the same as the one I took in.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 years after the accident, Fugate this year moved
out of her mother's house and into an apartment. An assistant stays
with her 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Steinheimer joined her, so the couple could
prepare to become independent and test what it would be like to
live together. They soon will have the assistant's help four days a
week, instead of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Like other young couples making a life together, it's give and
take. Early mornings, they exercise together, walking along the
patio, riding an exercise bike and doing sit ups. Though it's part
of Fugate's rehabilitation program, it's more important to exercise
now than ever, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wedding dress barely fits,'' Fugate jokes, carefully
enunciating each syllable.
</P>
<P>
   Steinheimer helps Fugate apply make-up, brushing her eye lashes
with mascara and painting her lips a glossy pink. Sometimes, he
helps her with nail polish. ``I don't mind helping her because of
the shakiness of her hand,'' he says. ``It's hard to paint the
nails on your right hand if you're right-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's right hand is dominant, not only because she is
right-handed, but also because the left side of her body is
generally weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Often, she wears a single white glove on her left hand because
her hand gets cold from lack of circulation. When it does,
Steinheimer helps her, finger by finger, slip the glove onto her
hand.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only appropriate that Steinheimer does the deed _ he
now has use of both his hands. His left hand was the dominant one
after his accident, and for some time, he walked with his right arm
perpetually held against his chest.
</P>
<P>
   After they prepare breakfast together, Fugate's full day of
therapy gets started, often at her computer.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, two clocks rest on the wall above the computer
station. Both tell the time, but one has colored slips of paper at
each hour, noting breakfast at 7 a.m., dinner at 6 p.m. and other
activities like physical therapy and tutoring throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The labels are reminders, like those in the kitchen where
cabinets have tags for ``large bowls,'' ``small bowls'' and ``good
China,'' and the refrigerator door has a list of foods that are
stored inside and the week's menu of foods to be eaten. Even light
switches have notes, to turn the light off after leaving the room.
</P>
<P>
   The tags affirm the ongoing problems that brain injury patients
face, life-long scars that can appear in cognitive problems like
memory or fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Leila Hartly, a speech and cognitive therapist,
visits Fugate at 10 a.m. First they practice repeated sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa,'' Fugate says, enunciating as fast as she can.
She uses a computer program developed for vision and speech therapy
that times the speed of her speech. As she speaks into the
microphone, a frog on the computer screen jumps from lily pad to
lily pad, to the rhythm of her words. At the end, it gives her a
score by averaging the speed of her speech. Though it continues to
improve, her speech remains much slower than average.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the computer, a board lists the different speech
exercises Fugate must practice on her own: Work on saying two pages
of long words, getting the accent on the right syllable and getting
good speed; practice sheets of words, phrases and sentences; look
in the mirror; keep jaw closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fugate's rehabilitation program is designed to help her regain
her fullest potential, but it is an expensive one that has taken an
inordinate amount of time and money to develop. Besides Hartly, two
academic teachers, a physical therapist and a neuropsychologist
visit Fugate on a set schedule that she, her mother and health care
specialists developed a few years ago. Each therapist can charge up
to $150 an hour and monthly expenses usually totals $10,000,
including rent and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   All of it is out of the family's pocket. Fugate doesn't qualify
for Medicaid, and private insurance won't cover her pre-existing
illness. Instead, some money flows in from a lawsuit that the
family won after the accident; her mother also mortgaged her home
to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I get the money back. It's worth it just to
see the independence she's gained,'' Sandy Fugate says.
</P>
<P>
   The fairy tale wedding is worth it, too, her mother says. Fugate
will wear a traditional white gown and $800 corrective wedding
shoes, designed so that she can walk down the aisle without her
cane. A horse and buggy will transport the couple to the wedding
site at a country club in Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The couple will join hands outdoors before a hundred guests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they have any fears about the relationship,
Fugate's reply is succint: ``No.'' Then she adds, ``I'm very
thrilled about everything. I'm looking forward to getting
married.''
</P>
<P>
   working on this ending Steinheimer is looking forward to a life
he never thought he'd have. ``It's such a good feeling to be with
someone who's been through something I've been through.''

 &HT;    Birth control pill used after sex to be marketed in U.S.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``morning-after pill,'' a type of emergency birth control
that can be used within 72 hours after sex, soon will be widely
marketed to American consumers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the
PREVEN Emergency Contraceptive Kit, which contains oral
birth-control pills and a urine pregnancy test.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Gynetics Inc. of Belle Mead, N.J., the $20 kit will
be available only by doctor's prescription. It should arrive in
pharmacies in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The ``morning-after pill'' is actually several birth-control
pills that must be taken in two doses, starting within 72 hours of
unprotected sex. The pills do not cause an embryo to abort, as does
the controversial abortion pill RU-486, which has been used up to
two months after conception.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy by blocking
the release of an egg, by blocking an encounter between an egg and
sperm or by blocking an already fertilized egg from implanting in
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Though many women are unaware of this emergency contraceptive
method, it has been in use since 1974 and acknowledged by the FDA
since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Preven kit contains four oral contraceptive pills. Two pills
must be taken within 72 hours of sex, followed 12 hours later by
the other two pills.
</P>
<P>
   The dosage is considered safe and about 75 percent effective.
Another emergency contraceptive method, which involves inserting a
copper intrauterine device) within seven days after sex, is 99
percent effective, but is more costly and must be performed by a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that of
1,000 women age 18 to 45, one in four knew pregnancy could be
prevented after unprotected sex Told such an option is available,
almost half the women said they would consider using it.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors generally don't consider emergency contraception
an abortion, the introduction of a kit designed to prevent
pregnancy after sex is controversial among some religious groups
and anti-abortion organizations.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ A U.N. tribunal investigating mass killings
in Rwanda handed down the first guilty verdict by an international
court for the crime of genocide Wednesday, and for the first time
defined rape as a genocide crime.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, against a small-town mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, was
the first verdict after a trial by the Rwanda tribunal, which has
been plagued by mismanagement and corruption since its inception in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-page decision by a three-judge panel, a result of nearly
four years of proceedings, marked a pivotal moment in international
law and laid the legal groundwork for future prosecutions in U.N.
courts. ``It gives us a road map of how we are to proceed,'' the
lead prosecutor, Pierre Prosper, said.
</P>
<P>
   Akayesu, the former mayor of Taba, in central Rwanda, winced
once, but then betrayed little emotion as the president of the
tribunal, Judge Laity Kama of Senegal, asked him to stand and then
pronounced him guilty on 9 of the 15 counts in the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Akayesu faces a maximum penalty of life in prison when he is
sentenced later this month, court officials said. Nicolas Tiangaye,
a lawyer for Akayesu, said his client would appeal the decision to
a five-judge chamber at The Hague. ``There are some points we can
criticize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges dismissed several charges against Akayesu that he had
violated the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of victims of war,
saying he was not a military figure who could be held accountable
under those treaties.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges ruled that Akayesu, as mayor, was responsible for
the killings of more than 2,000 people and the rape of dozens of
Tutsi women in Taba after April 19, 1994, even though police
officers, soldiers and Hutu militiamen had committed the actual
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council set up the tribunal in November 1994
to prosecute top Rwandan officials for one of worst mass killings
in recent history, the slaughter of an estimated 500,000 Tutsi and
moderate Hutu during three months in 1994.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It set up a similar court in The Hague to try war-crimes cases
after the Balkans war. While that court initiated a genocide trial,
the defendant died this summer before the case could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday, the most important victory for prosecutors at
the Arusha tribunal came May 1, when former Rwandan Prime Minister
Jean Kambanda pleaded guilty to genocide and promised to testify
against other defendants. Kambanda, the first person to accept
culpability for genocide in an international court, is to be
sentenced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Genocide was first defined legally in the Genocide Convention,
which was adopted in 1948 after the Nuremburg and Tokyo trials.
</P>
<P>
   The statute setting up the Arusha court allows prosecutors to
charge people with violations of the Genocide Convention and with
several internationally accepted crimes against humanity _ torture,
murder, rape and extermination _ that were first set down in the
Nuremburg charter. The tribunal is also empowered to charge
defendants with violations of the Geneva Convention on the
Treatment of War Victims.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kama said the evidence was overwhelming that Akayesu
ordered the deaths of several Tutsi intellectuals in his commune,
as well as eight Tutsi from another town who had sought refuge in
his office.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also found Akayesu guilty of inciting villagers to
commit genocide in an inflammatory speech on April 19, a harangue
in which he urged people to eliminate Tutsi civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said they were also convinced that Akayesu had
overseen the torture of several Hutu residents in Taba in an effort
to find out where Tutsi residents were hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 17-month trial and the testimony of 42 witnesses,
the defense argued that Akayesu had at first tried to protect the
Tutsi in his commune, but found that he was powerless to stop the
Hutu militiamen, whom he maintained were not under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers portrayed Akayesu as a victim of circumstances,
a decent man who continued to try to save Tutsi until he was forced
himself to flee in May 1994. Akayesu lost control of the town to
Hutu killers and has been made a scapegoat for massacres he could
not prevent, his lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the judges accepted the prosecution's version.
</P>
<P>
   Prosper, the prosecutor, argued that Akayesu had first resisted
calls to kill Tutsi neighbors but two weeks later succumbed to
pressure from hardliners in the Hutu-led government and, after
April 19, wholeheartedly joined the effort to exterminate Tutsi
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also rejected defense arguments, often heard among
Hutu apologists in Rwanda, that the massacres were an ugly but
unavoidable consequence of the civil war being waged at the time
between Tutsi rebels in the north and the Hutu-dominated government
and army.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence proved conclusively a genocide had taken place, as
defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention, Judge Kama said.
Government officials had planned the killings in advance and
overseen them, the judges ruled, and the attackers had killed
innocent Tutsi civilians, not combatants, with an eye toward wiping
out all Tutsi in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kama pointed out that Hutu militiamen had killed women and
children, including infants. They often cut the Achilles tendons of
their victims to prevent them from escaping before they were
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the massacres that occurred in Rwanda in 1994
had a specific object, namely the extermination of the Tutsi,'' the
judge said. ``It was indeed genocide that was committed in Rwanda
in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   In another important ruling, the court held that the systematic
rapes of Tutsi women in Taba also amounted to an act of genocide.
The ruling says rape and sexual aggression fall under a clause in
the 1948 convention defining genocidal acts as those causing
``mental or physical harm to members of a group,'' lawyers said.

 &HT;    Birth control pill used after sex to be marketed in U.S.
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``morning-after pill,'' a type of emergency birth control
that can be used within 72 hours after sex, soon will be widely
marketed to American consumers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the
PREVEN Emergency Contraceptive Kit, which contains oral
birth-control pills and a urine pregnancy test.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Gynetics Inc. of Belle Mead, N.J., the $20 kit will
be available only by doctor's prescription. It should arrive in
pharmacies in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The ``morning-after pill'' is actually several birth-control
pills that must be taken in two doses, starting within 72 hours of
unprotected sex. The pills do not cause an embryo to abort, as does
the controversial abortion pill RU-486, which has been used up to
two months after conception.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy by blocking
the release of an egg, by blocking an encounter between an egg and
sperm or by blocking an already fertilized egg from implanting in
the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Though many women are unaware of this emergency contraceptive
method, it has been in use since 1974 and acknowledged by the FDA
since February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Preven kit contains four oral contraceptive pills. Two pills
must be taken within 72 hours of sex, followed 12 hours later by
the other two pills.
</P>
<P>
   The dosage is considered safe and about 75 percent effective.
Another emergency contraceptive method, which involves inserting a
copper intrauterine device) within seven days after sex, is 99
percent effective, but is more costly and must be performed by a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that of
1,000 women age 18 to 45, one in four knew pregnancy could be
prevented after unprotected sex Told such an option is available,
almost half the women said they would consider using it.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors generally don't consider emergency contraception
an abortion, the introduction of a kit designed to prevent
pregnancy after sex is controversial among some religious groups
and anti-abortion organizations.

 &HT;    Three Remainingh R.E.M. members ready to move on
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ After a tumultuous year in which they found themselves
at professional and personal crossroads, the three remaining
members of rock band R.E.M. have begun the carefully choreographed
media dance of unveiling their new album.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear why they named the new work ``Up'': singer Michael
Stipe, guitarist Peter Buck and keyboardist Mike Mills seem
genuinely happy and enthusiastic about the new collection of songs,
their first without long-time drummer and founding member Bill
Berry, who retired last October.
</P>
<P>
   What everyone soon will be hearing is quite different from past
R.E.M. albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of relish that,'' said Buck, of the new somewhat
ethereal sound. ``Bill's leaving allowed us to redefine what we do
and how we do it. We really had to reinvent ourselves. Except for
Michael's vocals, it really doesn't sound like R.E.M. And I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers' executives and the band are toiling to get the
project ready for the scheduled Oct. 27 release. As the musicians
relaxed in their individual hotel suites Tuesday, sipping tea and
talking on cellphones, label executives zealously protected the
lone available ``Up'' CD, while unrolling the newly delivered
mock-up of the album's cover art across a queen-size bed. The
artwork consisted of a collage of photos of the band in dark, muted
tones with calligraphy of the lyrics scrawled across the sleeve.
The musicians worked late Tuesday night, heading back into the
studio for final mixes and to determine the lineup of songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album forced the three of us to become essentially a new
band,'' said Stipe, 38, sitting in his suite, dressed in an eletric
blue shirt and black jeans. ``All the things we used to be doing,
and the way we worked in the studio, were thrown out the window. We
didn't want to bring in a drumnmer to be the new Bill Berry. That
wasn't going to work...This is about the saddest and most romantic
record I've every made. It's like, here's an alternative universe.
Please come in. Expect anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know we're not a juke box,'' Mills said. ``We're a
band that's always going to take left turns. I think people like a
challenge. I think they get tired of the same thing.'' Alluding to
Berry's retirement, Mills, 41, added, ``Any record is a reflection
of what is going on in your life at the time. We've been through a
lot in the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Although R.E.M recently scrapped plans for a tour to support the
new album later this year, Stipe, Mills and Buck are spending the
rest of the week in a Queens production studio to shoot a video for
the first single, ``Day Sleeper.'' Buck, 41, explained that in lieu
of touring, the band will concentrate on television appearances on
MTV, VH-1 and ``Late Show with David Letterman.'' R.E.M. also plans
to play the benefit ``Bridge Concert'' with Neil Young in San
Francisco on Oct. 17. ``At this time in our lives, and at our ages,
it doesn't make sense to go out and play songs because that's what
we're supposed to do,'' Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident in the music and everything that goes into it
that we enjoy what we're doing,'' Stipe said. ``We're not doing it
for the wrong reasons. We've never been a three-piece before, but I
have to say it feels really great. I'm on top of the world.''

 ARUSHA, Tanzania: lawyers said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In the chamber's opinion, they constitute genocide the same as
any other act,'' Judge Kama said.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, several witnesses painted a brutal picture of
Akayesu orchestrating horror, ordering murders, condoning mass
rapes and overseeing the killing of children.
</P>
<P>
   They described how Akayesu, who was elected mayor in 1993, had
exhorted Hutu in a speech to ferret out Tutsi neighbors to kill
them, even urging them to rip babies from mother's wombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the person who kills a rat never spares the one who is
pregnant, you never spare a pregnant rat,'' one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in his month-long reign of terror, Akayesu ordered
all Tutsi children to be stripped and the boys killed. Later,
children of both sexes were murdered on his orders, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Akayesu, a former teacher and school inspector born in 1953,
also led house-to-house searches for certain Tutsi intellectuals,
torturing people for information, witnesses said. In one instance
he threatened to run over a elderly Hutu woman with a car unless
she disclosed the whereabouts of a particular woman.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also said Akayesu sanctioned the rapes of dozens of
young Tutsi women who were held at a Cultural Center next to his
office and repeatedly violated. One witness described how he had
allowed militiamen under his control to parade the naked women up
and down and brutalize them sexually before clubbing them to death.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness reported that Akayesu had commented to militia
members after the rape of several women: ``So never ask me again
what a Tutsi woman tastes like. Tomorrow they will be killed.'' The
women were killed the next day.
</P>
<P>
   For many Rwandan survivors of the genocide, Akayesu's conviction
is no comfort. Several said they had come to expect little from the
tribunal, which has spent over $100 million since it was
established and has just this year begun finishing trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Rwanda can't be satisfied and it's understandable,''
said Chantal Kayitesi, a spokeswoman for a group of Tutsi widows
who survived the genocide. ``The survivors are the people who need
justice the most. But we don't know about or understand the
procedures of the tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Rwandan courts have tried at least 330 people for
genocide and have sentenced 116 to death, though foreign lawyers
have said the trials do not meet international standards of
fairness. In April, Rwandan firing squads executed 22 people
convicted of taking part in the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear where Akayesu will spend his sentence,
assuming the conviction is upheld on appeal. Norway and Denmark
have both offered to house the tribunal's prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal is now holding 26 defendants in Arusha, four of
whom are on trial. Another suspect, Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, is
being held in a Texas prison and has successfully fought
extradition to Arusha. Eight others are under indictment but have
not been apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has been criticized by judges and Rwandan officials
for being slow and incompetent. One of the judges who wrote
Wednesday's decision, Lennart Aspegren, has said he will resign
this year in protest, citing bad management and poor working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But court officials insist they have improved the tribunal's
efficiency. Prosecutors are also seeking approval from judges to
hold mass trials, which would speed the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Akayesu trial took a long time partly because it was the
first, they said, and almost every legal question had to be decided
with no precedents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the next set of trials will be faster than the ones
we are about to conclude,'' a spokesman for the court, Kingsley
Moghalu, said Wednesday. ``It's not really that we are slow. It is
a problem that is inherent in the nature of what we are doing.''

MOBSTER DENIES TAPING FBI DEALINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In FBI documents made public during months of hearings
in federal court, Stephen Flemmi and his criminal sidekick James
``Whitey'' Bulger are portrayed as electronically-savvy gangsters
obsessed with security -- sweeping their cars for bugs, installing
elaborate alarm systems in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: Did they secretly tape record the FBI
handlers who they claim offered them nearly-blanket protection from
prosecution in exchange for information they gave the bureau on the
Mafia?
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, questioned for a final time Wednesday in federal court,
said no, he'd never taped a conversation with the FBI. As for
Bulger, who has been on the run for more than three years, Flemmi
wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Mr. Bulger it's very possible,'' Flemmi said in a
response to a question by US District Judge Mark L. Wolf. ``I can
say he's very capable of it. For him, everything is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi said he and Bulger had discussed taping their talks with
the FBI, to provide them ``protection.'' He'd seen Bulger's tiny
tape recorder but said he was never part of any secret taping
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't received any tapes in the mail (from Bulger), have
you?'' Assistant US Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr. asked Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I haven't,' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi was called back to the witness stand Wednesday to answer
some questions that Wolf had determined he had no legal right to
refuse to answer. In testimony last week, Flemmi had invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 200
times.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf must decide whether Flemmi had a valid agreement with the
FBI that promised him immunity for prosecution in exchange for
information he provided the bureau as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   When Flemmi Wednesday again refused to answer certain questions
-- such as whether his longtime FBI handler John Connolly had ever
quizzed him about his alleged involvement in drugs, including
extorting drug dealers -- the government once again asked Wolf to
strike all of Flemmi's testimony, which is the most severe penalty
for improperly taking the Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's attorney, Kenneth J. Fishman, argued that such action
would be extreme, since Flemmi had refused to answer ``a very
limited number'' of questions. Wolf refused to strike all of
Flemmi's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf also set conditions for the testimony of a New Jersey FBI
supervisor, casting doubt on whether the government will not call
him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Darcy Jr., who has investigated organized crime for the
Atlantic City FBI office, is expected to testify that field agents
did not routinely report the alleged criminal activity of
informants to headquarters in Washington, as required by informant
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Flemmi and his co-defendants, including New England
Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme, argue that the failure to notify
headquarters is evidence of an immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Darcy testifies, Wolf said defense lawyers must be provided
with the informant documents he used to compare Bulger and Flemmi's
treatment with that of informants in New Jersey, a condition which
Assistant US Attorney James D. Herbert said would probably make it
``impractical'' to call Darcy.

 &HT;    PBS showing British series until American version makes new
episodes
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PBS' ``Antiques Roadshow'' is a fine, enjoyable, sometimes even
wonderful series. But it's in repeats now _ and, boy, do we mean
repeats. How many more times can you watch that guy's jaw drop when
he finds out the rusty old sword he once cut watermelon with is
actually a Civil War relic worth $35,000?
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, PBS is juicing its ``Roadshow'' mix with the original
British version of ``Antiques Roadshow'' (check local listings).
</P>
<P>
   It's the start of 33 ``Roadshow'' episodes you've never seen
before. And several of its right-you-are British finds are nearly
as jaw-dropping fun as the antiques discoveries in the American
series.
</P>
<P>
   One woman with a pocketful of jade fingering pieces she bought
in Hong Kong learns one object is likely worth $2,400. The entire
collection might be worth $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's practically the same type of show you've been watching the
past couple of years as the American ``Roadshow'' has toured U.S.
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a couple of differences. British participants
don't seem to act with as much astonishment as Americans when they
learn their collections are worth more than they might have
thought.
</P>
<P>
   What does that jade woman, for instance, utter when told her
pieces are worth thousands? ``That's rather shattering,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, is it?
</P>
<P>
   An elderly man who presents his pre-World War I collection of
tiny metal Salvation Army ``fig-uhs'' learns they're likely worth
$1,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much,'' the man says almost plainly. ``You've
made my day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, none of the Brit experts are as oddly compelling as those
Keno twins, who appraise furniture with such aplomb on our shores.
And Britain's host, Hugh Scully, apparently has a personality and
spits his lines, which makes him no match for the watchable
blandness exuded by our own Ed Sullivan clone _ the remarkably
stiff-necked Chris Jussel.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this fresh ``Roadshow'' might be too British for
you. If so, take heart.
</P>
<P>
   The American ``Roadshow'' will continue in reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Did he really say that Civil War sword was worth $35,000?

SPORTS COLUMN: HACK WILSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he died, on a wintry day in Baltimore on Nov. 23, 1948, he
was 48 years old, penniless, an alcoholic. He was also one of
baseball's great players, who would later be voted into the Hall of
Fame. This was Hack Wilson, whose National League record of 56 home
runs in one season stood for 68 years, or until Mark McGwire drew
even and passed him with two homers Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, Wilson's salary was $33,000, the highest in the
National League. He was said to have made more than a quarter of a
million dollars in his 12-year big-league career. Yet some of the
expenses for Wilson's funeral were paid after some of the men in
the bars that Wilson frequented passed the hat. The gray suit he
wore in his coffin was donated by the undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   A week before his death, Wilson said that his life should serve
for youngsters as an example of which road not to travel. ``There
are many kids in and out of baseball who think that just because
they have some natural talent, they have the world by the tail,''
Wilson said on a ``We the People'' radio program over the Columbia
Broadcasting System. ``It isn't so. In life you need many more
things besides talent. Things like good advice and common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks on that radio show were printed and are framed in a
prominent place on a wall in the Chicago Cubs' clubhouse in Wrigley
Field, as a reminder to the players of today just how far a star
may fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's heart-wrenching story, a story that has been replayed
by many, many other athletes through the years, right up to this
very moment, began when he was a young, oddly shaped sensation
playing for the minor-league Martinsburg, Va., Blue Sox. While he
also played for the Giants, the Dodgers and the Phillies, his best
years were with the Cubs, from 1926 to 1931.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own idol was always Hack Wilson,'' Bill Veeck wrote in his
book, ``The Hustler's Handbook.'' ``Having said that, I now have to
admit that if any player of exceptional ability ever drank himself
out of baseball long before his time, it was my boyhood idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Robert Wilson _ he was called Hack because he was said to
resemble a champion wrestler of his day named George Hackenschmidt
_ was built like a beer keg, on two thin sticks: he stood
5-foot-6-inches, weighed 200 pounds, had a size 18-inch neck, a
powerful chest, short arms, short legs and child-size 5{ feet. In
batting practice, he would pick up a handful of dirt and wipe the
sides of his pants. ``By the time the game started,'' wrote Veeck,
``Hack would always look as if had just delivered a ton of coal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his size, the power he generated was stupendous. He led
the majors in home runs four out of five years. And in 1930 he not
only hit those 56 homers, he drove in 190 runs, a major-league
record that hasn't been threatened in decades. Yet four years
later, he was out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the low point of his career came when, playing center
field for the Cubs in the 1929 World Series against Philadelphia,
he lost two fly balls in the sun in the seventh inning of the
fourth game. The Cubs entered the inning with an 8-0 lead, and left
losing 10-8. Wilson came to the dugout after the inning with tears
in his eyes. But he rebounded for his remarkable 1930 season, in
which he also had a .356 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McCarthy, Wilson's manager with the Cubs, sought to impress
upon him the evils of alcohol. McCarthy dropped a worm into a glass
of water and the worm swam. He dropped another worm into a bottle
of bourbon and the worm died. ``What does that prove, Hack?'' asked
McCarthy. ``Well,'' said Wilson, ``it just goes to prove that if
you drink, you won't get worms.''
</P>
<P>
   In his short career with the Dodgers, Wilson played for Casey
Stengel. In a game against the Phillies in the compact Baker Bowl
in Philadelphia, Stengel had come out to the mound to remove the
pitcher Walter (Boom Boom) Beck. Wilson was in right field, his
hands on his knees, his head down, exhausted from chasing baseballs
hit off Beck. It was hot, and maybe Wilson had been out late the
night before. Beck didn't want to leave the game, argued with
Stengel and then flung the baseball which hit the tin fence behind
Wilson. Startled, Wilson leaped into action, raced to the fence,
picked up the ball and made a perfect throw to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best play Hack made all year,'' said Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   And soon after Hack Wilson was gone. His seasons in the sun
ending quicker than he had ever imagined.

PROGRAM ADDRESSES CULTURE GAP IN CARING FOR ASIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, Dr. Andrew Phan avoids making distinctions based on
race.
</P>
<P>
   But in a health-care setting in which Asian-Americans are
increasingly becoming sicker because of language and other cultural
barriers, race can carry great significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Asians in Tarrant County who either aren't
getting treated at all, or they are waiting until they are so sick
they need emergency care,'' said Phan, an assistant professor of
family medicine at the University of North Texas Health Science
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Phan's sentiments underscore plans by the health science center
to launch a community-outreach initiative between its
family-practice residency program and the Asian-American community.
Several Asian-American organizations, including the Hmong American
Planning and Development Center and the Asian-American Chamber of
Commerce, will help institute the program.
</P>
<P>
   A grant from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is
helping to make the program possible.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 Asian immigrants live in the Metroplex, but
because of language and cultural barriers, many have trouble
accessing health care that others take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   By making its resident clinic more ``ethnosensitive'' and hiring
a bilingual and culturally diverse staff, the center hopes to
increase the number of patients it serves and improve the skills,
knowledge and attitudes of family-practice residents in managing
ethnic and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities make up about 60 percent of the patients at the
resident clinic, known as Seminary Drive Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of statistics, but I do know that within
the community, fear keeps a lot of people from going to the
doctor,'' said Phan, who is Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and breast and other
gynecological cancers are the most common ailments affecting
Asian-Americans, he said. In addition, doctors are also seeing a
lot of parasitic infections in people from Laos and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of the problems are concentrated in the older
population,'' he said. ``Because of superstitions, they tend to
resist Western medicine, especially any kind of surgical
procedures. We still use a lot of traditional, Chinese-type
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Phan said, many Asians opt to use herbal treatments
rather than undergo surgery. Depending on the year of the Chinese
calendar, many Asians consider surgery too risky. ``That's the kind
of cultural thing Western doctors aren't aware of. This program
will address issues like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jon Sivoravong, a family-practice physician and assistant
professor at the health science center, said it is hard to judge
just how sick the community is. Data on Anglos and
African-Americans have been collected for years, but little has
been done on the health status of other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the patients he sees at the center's clinic, Sivoravong said,
about 10 to 15 a day are of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of people who have been bounced around from one
doctor to the other because of language barriers,'' said
Sivoravong, who is Laotian. ``A lot of them, when they come, are
already very, very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   They also often lack health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sivoravong recalled a thirtysomething Laotian patient who sought
help after experiencing paralysis in his legs. ``He had a very
severe thyroid problem, but when he came he didn't have any records
of his treatment. He basically walked in and said the doctor hadn't
told him anything. So I had to start from the beginning and get his
records and talk to the doctor who'd cared for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the population gets older and assimilates, Sivoravong said,
the community will probably become even sicker and suffer from the
kinds of diseases _ congestive heart failure, diabetes _ that
characterize Americans.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, diabetes is nearly nonexistent in China, but the
rate of diabetes in immigrants is near the rate for
African-Americans and Hispanics. ``There haven't been any studies
to look at the specific causes,'' Sivoravong said, ``but my guess
is it has to do with diet, lifestyle and lack of exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Phan and Sivoravong said that details for the new initiative
have yet to be worked out, but that plans call for treating 2,000
additional patients a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking to do something like this for a while,''
said Sivoravong. ``We tried to do this at the community clinic in
Haltom City, but it was very difficult to get the (financial)
support. That's why this is so exciting.''

 &HT;    Lawsuit has local Bosnians astir
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they fled their war-torn homeland for the safety of a new
life in America, Bosnian Muslims tried to leave behind horrible
memories of torture, rape and being forced to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   They concentrated on starting over in a new country they didn't
understand. They struggled to learn English, get a job and put
their children in school. They assumed everyone else they met here
from Bosnia, even those who are Serbian, had suffered the same
indignities, but they didn't often talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit filed last week in Atlanta may change all
that. A Serbian refugee who lives in Clarkston was accused of
having tortured Muslims and Croats during the war in the former
Yugoslavia in 1992. The suit was filed by Kemal Mehinovic, a
Bosnian Muslim refugee who lives in Salt Lake City. He claims he
was repeatedly brutalized by Nikola Vuckovic, a former Serb
soldier. Mehinovic filed suit after learning from friends that
Vuckovic was living in metro Atlanta, said one of his lawyers, Paul
Hoffman, chairman of Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic declined to comment, but told his employer at a Tucker
compressor plant that the allegations were ``all lies.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the lawsuit is slowly spreading through metro Atlanta's
Bosnian community, because many do not speak English and had not
heard about the case. But some Bosnians ``are reacting pretty
emotionally'' when they learn about it, said Mirza Hadzibegovic, a
Bosnian Muslim who works at Lutheran Ministries of Georgia and
helps refugees find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like to hear about this. They are pretty
disappointed,'' said Hadzibegovic, 40, who has lived in Atlanta
four years. ``If someone came here to the United States from the
hell of Bosnia and someone from another nationality came here, too,
most Bosnians suppose that person is OK. They don't expect they
will find a killer or someone who did something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,200 Bosnian refugees have resettled in metro
Atlanta, most in DeKalb County. The majority are Muslim, but there
are Croat and Serb refugees here as well. Many live as neighbors in
the same apartment complexes, because the refugee agencies that
find them apartments do not routinely separate people by their
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbs qualified as refugees because they are married to
Muslims and being in a mixed marriage makes them targets for
persecution. Other Serbs were forced out of the Krajina region of
Croatia by Croatian soldiers in 1995. The Serbs in Belgrade
wouldn't take them and instead sent them to Kosovo, where they are
now fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bosnian refugee program started in 1993, the United
States has accepted 61,000 Bosnians, according to the State
Department. Seventy-six percent are Muslim, 10 percent are Serbs
and 7 percent are Croats. The rest are classified as ``other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All ethnicities are eligible for the resettlement program,''
said Peter Herbert, director of the International Rescue
Committee's Atlanta office, which has resettled hundreds of
Bosnians here. ``If you are in a mixed marriage, you may not be
welcome or able to return to your home in any part of Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic has told his employer, Our Way Inc. in Tucker, that his
wife is Muslim. Vuckovic's supervisor, Don Hood, has said he is a
``model employee'' who is ``very easygoing, friendly and very
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Each refugee is screened by the State Department and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service before being allowed to
enter the United States. Each one has to pass medical and security
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Vuckovic's name did not show up when it was run through a
Justice Department database of people suspected of committing
wartime atrocities, a State Department official said. His status as
a refugee is unchanged because the allegations haven't been proven,
the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert said all ethnic groups seem to get along once they get
here, and they don't dwell on their past. ``There is a lot more
anxiety over other issues, like who got a better job, who came with
more money or who got a spot in the best ESL (English as a Second
Language) class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Social workers from other agencies that resettle Bosnians
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``My refugee families out here help each other,'' said Linda
Dowd, who works at World Relief's office in Lawrenceville. ``They
don't seem to care who is from where. They are all starting over
from nothing and they are interested in having a new life and
having jobs and good schools for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbert said he is not aware of any tension in the Bosnian
community since the lawsuit was filed. ``I don't know if anybody
really knows the truth yet,'' he said. ``I would not be surprised
if people who have been through the worst in the war are upset over
the thought that something like this is taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadzibegovic said most Bosnians do get along, regardless of
their ethnicity. But this lawsuit may make some more suspicious of
their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expected they would be safe here. That's why some of them
are pretty disappointed,'' he said.

TERRORIST, SUDAN PLANT LINKS NOT VERY REASSURING  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN WEDNESDAY'S ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As news emerged from Egypt of the capture of
Palestinian guerrilla chief Abu Nidal _ accused of killing hundreds
of people all over the world _ the whereabouts of that other
terrorist, Osama bin Laden, remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the suspect in the Aug. 7 embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania is in the mountains of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he is in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing seems certain. The U.S. cruise missile attacks on
his training bases did not kill him, and he remains a threat to
American targets all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Clinton administration miss an opportunity to
destroy this monster in its military strikes on his terrorist
facilities in southeastern Afghanistan, the U.S. attack on an
alleged chemical weapons plant in Khartoum, Sudan, has forced
American foreign policy onto the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Was the Shifa Pharmaceuticals plant an innocuous producer of
simple medication?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps learning a lesson from the Gulf War when Iraq claimed
the Unitd States had struck a baby formula factory, Sudanese
officials claimed before the United Nations that their plant
manufactured painkillers and malaria medicine and not chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been forced to concede that links between
bin Laden and the pharmaceutical plant are rather ``fuzzy,''
although officials emphasize a clandestine soil sample from the
Sudan plant property showed traces of a material with no commercial
uses that is a key ingredient in certain chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen explained that bin Laden had
``financial interest'' in the plant, and the facilities that the
United States struck were important parts of the bin Laden network
of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the administration has been hard pressed to explain why
that particular plant was not mentioned in previous reports on the
manufacture of chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the strength of U.S. electronic intercepts of
telephone calls, tenuous financial links and soil samples to
justify its strike against the Sudanese plant.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Clinton administration's dubious record of honesty and
candor, the American people _ and, indeed, the world _ might need
more evidence to feel confident an appropriate and effective blow
was delivered against international terrorism. &QL;

BURTON STILL CRITICAL OF RENO DESPITE CAMPAIGN FINANCE MEETING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of Attorney General Janet Reno's harshest
congressional critics said Wednesday he was not satisfied after
meeting with her over the issue of campaign finance investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general appears to be trying to protect the
president and vice president of the United States,'' said Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., after a 2 1/2-hour meeting between Reno and
lawmakers. Burton has been critical of Reno for not calling for an
independent counsel to investigate alleged campaign fund-raising
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and members of Congress who met with Reno and her
advisers on the campaign finance issue focused on Justice
Department memos urging the attorney general to call for an
independent counsel. Burton has threatened to ask the House to hold
Reno in contempt of Congress for failing to surrender those memos
to the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, which
Burton chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has rejected the calls for an independent counsel, let
Burton and other lawmakers at the meeting review edited versions of
the memos. However, Burton said the attorney general's revisions
left him questioning what evidence of campaign finance abuses might
have been excised.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Burton said, Reno declined to answer many
questions regarding the Justice Department's examination of alleged
fund-raising abuses by Vice President Al Gore, citing agency policy
prohibiting comment on pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that everything we wanted was given to us,''
Burton said. Nevertheless, he called the meeting ``helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Burton said he would withdraw his threat to press
the House to hold Reno in contempt of Congress until his legal
advisers have had a chance to review the edited sections.
</P>
<P>
   But Burton added he might renew his call for a contempt citation
if the review does not answer his questions regarding Reno's
refusal to call for an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno declined to comment when she left the meeting. However, her
chief spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, said Burton's allegations
regarding a cover-up are without merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She bases her decisions on the facts and law and nothing
else,'' Brandenburg said. He added that Reno believed the meeting
was ``constructive'' because it allowed her to address the
lawmakers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Reno last month told a panel of three federal judges that she
had called for a preliminary 90-day investigation of Gore and this
week launched a similar examination of Harold Ickes, a former aide
to President Clinton. At the end of the 90 days, Reno can seek an
additional 60 days to wind up the probe, ask the panel to appoint
an independent counsel or report that the Justice Department found
no credible allegation warranting further inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's refusal to name an independent counsel in the Gore case
prompted Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
to call the attorney general to his Capitol Hill office for
Wednesday's meeting. Also attending was Charles LaBella, the former
chief of the Justice Department's campaign finance task force,
whose memo calling for an independent counsel sparked the criticism
of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has criticized Reno for not seeking an independent
counsel, said the attorney general was ``forthcoming'' at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh has also written a memo urging Reno to
ask the three-judge panel to name an independent counsel to
investigate alleged campaign finance abuses by Gore. Freeh did not
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the
committee Burton chairs, praised Reno for her willingness to meet
with her congressional critics and answer all the questions she
could without compromising the ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memos were helpful, and the discussion was helpful,''
Waxman said. ``The attorney general is making a good-faith effort
to comply with Congress's right to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day probe of Gore will focus on dozens of telephone calls
Gore made from his government office in late 1995 and early 1996
soliciting money for the Democratic Party. In December, Reno ended
a similar probe, saying there was not sufficient evidence to
require naming an independent counsel to conduct a full
investigation
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department last month obtained a 1995 White
House memorandum bearing handwritten notes that appear to
contradict Gore's repeated claims that the 45 calls in question
were made to solicit only contributions to the Democratic Party and
not to the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day probe of Ickes was prompted by a report from the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which accused Clinton's
former deputy chief of staff of ``misleading and inaccurate''
testimony during a congressional hearing into alleged fund-raising
abuses by the White House and the Democratic Party. The Ickes probe
was not on the agenda of the closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the Reno meeting were Sen. Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee; Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; and Deputy
Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. &QL;

A PAUSE SPEAKS VOLUMES   FOR YELTSIN

<P>
   MOSCOW _ For a full 10 seconds, the president of Russia was
silent, visibly uncomfortable, strugging to answer the question his
embattled nation needed to ask:
</P>
<P>
   Was he, Boris Yeltsin, ready to dissolve the Communist-led
legislature if it kept rejecting his candidate to lead his nation
out of its worst crisis in five years?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that,'' Yeltsin started sluggishly before his
long, embarrassing pause, ``that rather many events will take place
before we reach that result.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's halting answer did little to clear up doubts that the
Russian leader is fully in control as the ruble took another
nosedive Wednesday in his politically and financially paralyzed
country.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, President Clinton waited for Yeltsin to say more, as
did reporters in the Kremlin hall. Hands shaking, mouth turned down
in a permanent scowl, Yeltsin finally responded, ``That's all,''
prompting nervous titters from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious, isn't it?'' said one Russian government
official who saw the press conference and asked not to be
identified. ``We are at the end of the Yeltsin era. Don't the
Americans see that?''
</P>
<P>
   In Yeltsin's first press conference since he abruptly fired his
government and split down 11 days ago, Clinton shrugged off the
Russian president's hesitation and literally bailed him out,
ad-libbing a joke about Yeltsin's good reply.
</P>
<P>
   But among Russians, all but Yeltsin's most loyal allies have
long ago written off the president as a spent political force.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, after surviving open-heart surgery, Yeltsin can no longer
work full days, or even more than a few hours at a time, according
to the powerful business magnate Boris Berezovsky, who has close
financial and personal ties to the Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preservation of power is all Yeltsin thinks about,''
</P>
<P>
   said Dmirty Pinsker, a political analyst for the news magazine
Itogi. ``It's his only concern.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Yeltsin has preferred to ride out his country's worst
crises in the shadows, re-emerging to cow his opponents in
parliament and show the world that he is still in charge. But this
time, after the Russian economy collapsed under a burden of debt,
revenue shortfalls and capital flight, the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, has energetically challenged Yeltsin by
spurning his choice for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis will grow because no one is stopping it,'' said
retired general Alexander Lebed, now a regional governor and a
possible future presidential candidate, who was one of several
opposition leaders who met with Clinton Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Duma rejected Chernomyrdin, who served for five
years as prime minister and whom many Russians blame, along with
Yeltsin, for their problems. Yeltsin quickly asked the Duma to vote
a second time, and senior lawmakers, who set a new vote for Friday,
say Chernomyrdin has little chance of passing. If they vote ``no''
a third time, Yeltsin is mandated by the Constitution to dismiss
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers, aware of Yeltsin's weakness, suggest the
legislature may refuse to disband and instead may try to impeach
him.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, ignoring a Duma request to back down and name another
candidate, Wednesday approved Chernomyrdin's request to form an
interim government, even as legislators questioned the legality of
the move.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin has vowed to protect Russians' savings as the ruble
crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Central Bank ordered all accounts in faltering
commercial banks, which have been virtually closed for the past
three weeks, switched to the state savings bank. The Central Bank
also set a new rate of 12.89 to the dollar for the ruble, half the
currency's value as late as August 17.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia waits for more details from Chernomydrin's
boss, Yeltsin, whose silences have only deepened the nation's
uncertainty, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the whole systsem of the country is falling apart
because it depends on one man being active,'' said Nikolai Petrov,
a political analysts at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ``And he is not
all that active.''

CLINTON URGES OPPOSITION LEADERS, YELTSIN TO WORK TOGETHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton urged opposition leaders to work with
President Boris Yeltsin for reform as the summit between the two
leaders ended without an indication of how Russia intends to
resolve its massive political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day session seemed only to offer a brief respite for
Yeltsin from the political infighting in the Communist-led
legislature, which has blocked his efforts to form a new government
to deal with the financial mess.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference at the ornate Catherine Hall deep
inside the Kremlin, President Clinton warned Yeltsin's political
opponents: ``I think if other political forces in Russia try to
force the president to abandon reform in midstream or even reverse
it, what I think will happen is even less money will come into
Russia and even more economic hardship will result.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin acknowledged that Russia must resolve its economic woes,
which in recent days have seen the ruble plummet in value, banks
freeze assets and an almost insolvent stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not saying that we count solely on support from the
outside,'' Yeltsin said. ``What we need from the United States is
political support to the effect that the United States is in favor
of reforms in Russia. Then all the investors who would like to come
to the Russian reformed markets will do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men sat side by side after signing agreements to reduce
plutonium stockpiles and to establish a mutual early warning system
for missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared tired and Yeltsin fielded questions with a
lopsided smile. Both men are under fire at home and have faced
repeated calls for resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to say _ and I hope Bill will agree with me _ the
summit was a success,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president offered a confusing response when asked if
he intended to press for Viktor Chernomyrdin's appointment as prime
minister even if it meant dissolving the Duma and calling new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I must say, we will witness quite a few events for us to
be able to achieve all those results,'' Yeltsin said. After a long
pause in which people waited for him to continue, he smiled, turned
to his press secretary and said, ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The political confrontation between the Communist-led Duma and
Yeltsin will replay itself Thursday or Monday when Chernomyrdin's
name is placed before the chamber for a second vote. If the Duma
rejects Chernomyrdin three times, the legislative body is dissolved
and new elections are called.
</P>
<P>
   The political drama has delayed a coordinated response to the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, after two days of hearing of Russia's
commitment to reform, now intends to watch Russia for its action as
the deadline nears for a mid-month decision by the International
Monetary Fund to continue its installments of Moscow's $22.6
billion bail-out fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the ball I think is very much in their court. We do not
have any new or additional aid or plan in our pocket. I think the
first order of business for Russia is clearly going to be putting
forward a plan that would lead to the resumption of the current IMF
package,'' said a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at the news conference and later at a meeting with Duma
leaders, continued to press for changes that would make Russia more
attractive to international investors.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official later said, ``While it is
reassuring, and there have been a lot of reassuring comments made,
I think that the focus of the IMF, as well as ourselves, will be on
the action that is taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with more than a dozen parliamentary leaders and
regional politicians at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's
residence. The group included Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the
Communist Party faction, who has accused Yeltsin of setting the
stage for a civil war, and Aleksandr Lebed, the former military
official turned politician. Clinton spoke to the leaders as a group
and later met with them individually.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, he reiterated his outline for reforms that Russia must
undertake, including the creation of a fair tax system to meet its
spending requirements, effective regulations for banks and allowing
the rule of law apply to all.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a friend I say I do not believe that you can defy the rules
of the road in today's global economy anymore than I could defy the
laws of gravity by stepping off the top floor of Spaso House,''
Clinton said. ``It has nothing to do with politics, and everything
to do with the way the world is working today.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the political factions to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can find a way to work together and work through this
crisis, the United States will stand with you and will not presume
to judge the specific social systems you decide to put in place
within a democratic system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Clinton and Yeltsin met
one-on-one to discuss the situation in Kosovo, Iraq and with the
Western defense alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin spoke of Russia's opposition to an expanded North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and to the use of military force
whether in Kosovo, Iraq or Afghanistan, a reference to Clinton's
use of missile strikes aimed at terrorist camps.
</P>
<P>
   The two also talked about the energy-rich Caucasus and Clinton
pressed for U.S. firms to have access to the energy sector there.
</P>
<P>
   The aide said the issue of the international space station was
discussed only briefly and was ``remanded to the experts'' for
further talks. Russia has had numerous problems delivering its part
of the construction of the international project.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day Clinton telephoned Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat for brief
chats about the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials offered no details of the conversation
other than to say hopes for a resumption of the peace process were
closer than ever.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli spokesman quoted Clinton as saying he ``intends to
take steps to speed up the talks with the Palestinians, as soon as
he gets back from Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves Russia on Thursday for a visit to Northern
Ireland and Ireland to champion the peace process there.

   MOSCOW _ President Clinton ended his summit with Boris N.
Yeltsin Wednesday by again skirting a public apology for his
adulterous affair with Monica S. Lewinsky and his lies that
followed it. Both leaders faced questions about their conduct in
office and the fate of the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin lauded the friendship between the two nations, but
bluntly spoke of his differences with Clinton. He criticized the US
for using military force in the August 20 missile launches on
suspected terrorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan and said that
Russia abhors the expansion of the NATO military alliance into
former Iron Curtain countries in central Europe, which he described
as ``a blunder, a big mistake'' and ``a historic error.''
</P>
<P>
   In a contrast of surreal proportions, Clinton and Yeltsin
gathered in the Kremlin's majestic Catherine Hall to sign a pair of
pivotal military agreements, then stammered their way through
subjects raised by reporters from Clinton's sexual conduct to
Yeltsin's political competence.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Yeltsin, asked about his strategy to win
confirmation for his nominee as prime minister, uttered a virtually
incomprehensible answer that had no bearing on the question, then
abruptly ended his response with a wave of his hand and the words,
``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice, Clinton blushed bright red when reporters questioned him
on his affair with Lewinsky, the former White House intern less
than half his age, as well as his defiant public admission on
August 17. Pointedly given the opportunity to apologize for his
actions, Clinton refused. He said the American people understood
his position and were ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it the other day again,'' Clinton said of his earlier
speech, ``and I thought it was clear that I was expressing my
profound regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved,
and my desire not to see anymore people hurt by this process and
caught up in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was commenting that it seemed to be something that most
reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate
amount of America's time, money and resources and attention, and
now continued to involve more and more people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was anathema to many White House strategists,
Democratic allies and Republican opponents who have pleaded
publicly and privately with Clinton to apologize explicitly for his
affair and lies, and temper the defiant front he has mounted to
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   For two and a half weeks, the White House has wrestled with the
issue of a proper, public apology by Clinton. Some aides had
privately hoped that he would offer it in Moscow, during his first
press conference since he admitted his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier in the press conference if the Lewinsky affair has
diminished his effectiveness as president, Clinton said no, adding,
``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I regretted
it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable time with my
family in the last couple of weeks and said I was going back to
work. I believe that's what the American people want me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's responses to the Lewinsky questions and Yeltsin's
troubling performance overshadowed the end of a summit at which the
United States sought to lure Russia further down the road of market
reform by raising the prospect of economic aid. As the summit
ended, the Russian economy continued to deteriorate. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``America and the international community are, I am convinced,
ready to offer further assistance if Russia stays with the path of
reform,'' Clinton said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Under the gold-fringed dome in Catherine Hall amid towering
white columns, Clinton and Yeltsin sat side by side at a long desk
and penned their signatures to a pair of military agreements that
their aides have described as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agreements calls for each nation to remove 50 tons of
weapons-grade plutonium from its nuclear stockpile. The other
establishes a global early warning system for all missiles launches
to prevent an accidental or mistaken retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Before their news conference, Clinton and Yeltsin met again
Wednesday morning in the presidential study of the Kremlin, turning
what was supposed to have been a widely attended gathering into
another face to face encounter between the two leaders alone. The
meeting lasted over an hour, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Clinton met with Russian opposition leaders
and prodded them toward economic reform. Before Clinton spoke at
the US ambassador's residence, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright chatted amiably with Aleksandr Lebed, the hard-line former
general who is now the governor of the Krasnoyarsk province in
Siberia. As soon as Clinton concluded his speech, he walked
directly to Lebed and talked to him for at least five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the ceremony and signs of friendship, it was an
bizarre summit by any measure. The two leaders made an unusual
couple. Yeltsin is politically crippled by his nation's imploding
economy and ailing health. Clinton is dogged by issues of
credibility and the prospect of damaging evidence presented in an
upcoming independent counsel's report.
</P>
<P>
   Their respective weaknesses were highlighted in one particular
exchange initiated by Reuter's reporter Laurence McQuillan, who
asked Yeltsin whether he would be willing to nominate someone other
than Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister or if he would be
prepared to dissolve the Duma, the lower Huuse of the Russian
parliament, to get his way.
</P>
<P>
   As the question was posed, Clinton, sitting next to Yeltsin,
seemed to smile, looking first toward press secretary Mike McCurry,
then over to Madeleine Albright sitting nearby. But before Yeltsin
could respond, McQuillan turned to Clinton and said, ``Mr.
President, another Lewinsky question.'' With that, Clinton flushed
red.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders then looked at each other. Yeltsin, after
hesitating, haltingly said, ``Well, I must say, we will witness
quite a few events for us to be able to achieve all those
results.'' He paused, looked to his press secretary, then added,
``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Before responding to the Lewinsky inquiry, Clinton laughed and
said, ``That's my answer, too. That was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a hallway of the US embassy here, Democratic Rep.
Steny Hoyer of Maryland cornered McQuillan, jabbed his finger in
his chest and said, ``Speaking as an American, I'm outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the question an attempt to embarrass the president
while he was in Moscow conducting important business. He said the
media should ``drop its obsession'' with Lewinsky because Americans
don't care. But ironically, Hoyer would periodically interrupt
himself to add that he didn't condone Clinton's activities with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, US officials continued to defend their stated
position that Yeltsin was engaged in all of his meetings with
Clinton and seemed to retain an intellectual grip on the issues
that confront him.

HOW DO I LOVE GROCERIES? LET ME COUNT THE WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JUNE NAYLOR RODRIGUEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only in the past few days have I discussed my addiction.
</P>
<P>
   It was with the sort of giddiness that a clotheshorse feels at
visiting Nordstrom that I confessed to a close friend _ upon
learning that the newest Tom Thumb ``new generation'' store was
open in my neighborhood _ that I go to the grocery store every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``EVERY day?'' she asked with doubt.
</P>
<P>
   OK, six out of seven. That might seem weird, since I don't have
a large family to feed and I only cook once or twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, grocery shopping fills me with unbridled pleasure.
To me, food is spiritual and sensual.
</P>
<P>
   On some trips, I don't buy anything _ just being there provides
the euphoria I crave. In Houston, for instance, I make a point of
visiting Rice Epicurean simply to look at the displays of pates and
breads. In Austin, I always make a trip through Central Market,
just to gawk at the vast vats of imported olives, the
unpronounceable brands of vinegars and oils, the fruits that look
as if they're on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Fort Worth, I visit the Asian markets on Belknap
Street to look over the strange vegetables and fruits, or to find
the rare ingredients to make red curry paste. Then there's the
cornucopia of chiles and Mexican cheeses at Fiesta Food Mart.
</P>
<P>
   When I actually do some serious grocery shopping, I'll easily
drop $8 on a hunk of cheese or $10 on a bottle of olive oil. If my
whole tab comes to $150 or $200, what the heck. Yet I'm racked with
guilt if I spend lavishly at Target or Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this addiction is genetic. As a child, I remember sitting
in the cart as my mom _ another grocery addict _ hummed happy tunes
while choosing produce, chatting with the butcher or pointing out
to me all the spices and explaining their uses.
</P>
<P>
   When the holidays are upon us, I'm intoxicated with the thought
of numerous grocery trips to prepare party foods and family meals.
Sometimes that calls for more than one trip per day. Ecstasy!
</P>
<P>
   Here, for instance, are 10 reasons you'll find me in the aisles
of the new Tom Thumb _ one of the few places in Fort Worth where
you can find all of these under the same roof:
</P>
<P>
   1. Huge floral section. Right at the entrance, just like in
European and Mexican markets. The cut-flower selection includes
tropical blooms such as anthuriums at $4.99 per stem, giant
heliconias at $9.99 each and tiny purple-and-white orchids for
$3.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   2. HMRs _ Home Meal Replacements. Ready-to-heat entrees include
meat loaf marinara with mashed potatoes and green beans, chicken
enchiladas with rice, and chicken Parmesan with pasta, $6-$8. Or
opt for the herbed rotisserie chickens, $5, and cool Caesar salad,
$2.50.
</P>
<P>
   3. By-the-pound Greek vegetable salad, $5.99; chicken breast
salad with green grapes, $8.99; dolmas, $4.99; and grilled salmon
fillets, $10.99.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bakery. Yummy. Mini-cheesecake topped with fresh fruit and
surrounded by sliced almonds is the perfect dessert for four,
$6.89. Thick, dense focaccia topped with basil, rosemary, red bell
peppers, mushrooms and Parmesan is $3.59.
</P>
<P>
   5. Fresh sushi, made daily and packaged with wasabi and pickled
ginger.
</P>
<P>
   6. Selection, selection, selection. Five kinds of polenta, five
kinds of tofu. Blue, Roquefort, Stilton and gorgonzola cheeses.
Fresh red jalapenos, pale green habaneros, long thin Fresno chiles.
At least 20 kinds of olive oil, as well as peanut, sesame, walnut
and avocado oils.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are _ counted 'em _ 90 kinds of salsa. In addition to
the expected Pace and El Paso, there are brands you've never heard
of, using everything from peaches and pineapple to black-eyed peas
and black beans.
</P>
<P>
   8. Exotics. Finally, we can throw together a Southeast Asian or
Indian dinner without trotting all over the county to various
ethnic markets (although purists will still do so). Choices include
Thai lemon grass oil, Panang red curry, Keow Wan green curry, pure
coconut milk and tandoori paste.
</P>
<P>
   9. Curbside video and game drop-off. No kidding; you don't have
to leave your car.
</P>
<P>
   10. Friendly staff. We've grown weary of surly grocery store
people. These folks seem to actually enjoy their jobs.

KENNEDY SEES GOP DELAYS ON HEALTH, WAGE BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after Senator Edward M. Kennedy helped
push into law a health insurance portability bill and a 90-cent
increase in the minimum wage, his attempt to repeat that
performance with two similar bills is being stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is trying to pass new regulations for health maintenance
organizations and a $1 increase in the current $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage, but Wednesday he acknowledged that Senate Republican
leaders, emboldened by President Clinton's troubles, think they can
stonewall attempts to pass the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he is totally overshadowed by a completely weakened
president and an economy that all of a sudden is shaky,'' said Chip
Kahn, the chief operating officer and president-designate of the
Health Insurance Association of America, a leading trade
association for the insurance industry. ``You just cannot play
these non-central issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he is confident that his bill to guarantee certain
patient rights and impose rules on managed care plans as well as
the minimum wage increase would pass if either came to a vote on
the Senate floor because both issues have strong public support. He
said if Republican leaders continue to block the bills, Democrats
will end the session with campaign issues for November.
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues are enough to win in just about any district in
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week Senate Democratic leader Thomas Daschle changed
tactics and offered to use the House managed-care bill as a base
bill for Senate consideration, provided Republican leaders allow
Democrats to offer amendments.
</P>
<P>
   After Majority leader Trent Lott said he would allow only three
amendments, Kennedy said at a news conference Wednesday, ``A gag
rule is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after Clinton had effectively blamed the GOP for the
1995 government shutdown, moderate Republicans backed
Kennedy-authored bills on health insurance and the minimum wage,
guaranteeing passage prior to the election.
</P>
<P>
   This year the ongoing investigation into Clinton's relationship
with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky has drowned out debate over
such issues, congressional observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, delays in passing spending bills, which must be
approved before the start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1, have
crowded out most other legislation from the congressional calendar.
Government operations cannot continue without approval of 13
separate spending bills, the first of which went to the White House
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy plans to attach his minimum wage proposal to a
bankruptcy reform bill that could reach the Senate floor as soon as
Friday, a move that could force Majority Leader Trent Lott to pull
the legislation from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Support for another minimum wage increase is not as great as it
was two years ago, said Lee Culpepper, vice president of federal
relations for the National Restaurant Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996 Senator Kennedy discovered an issue that became a
political tsunami, that was the minimum wage increase. This time
around he is finding out that the tide is out,'' said Culpepper.
``This issue is not anything that is really a top-of-the-mind
concern of voters.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia struggled through another day without a
government; the ruble's value fell again; people had less money
than ever, and spirits and fortunes were sagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is worse than in 1917,'' the year that the
Bolsheviks seized power in a country depleted by war and government
indecision, Alexander Lebed, the ex-general and regional governor
with presidential ambitions, said he told President Clinton on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that the situation in Russia is catastrophic,''
said Lebed, who joined other Russian political leaders Wednesday
afternoon for a meeting with Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak predictions flourished in Moscow on Wednesday, as
newspapers and commentators sifted through various scenarios _ from
dictatorship to armed insurrection _ that could result from the
standoff between President Boris Yeltsin and his opposition in the
lower house of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house is now set to meet Friday afternoon for a second
round of voting on the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister, five days after his candidacy was rejected the first
time. If no political breakthrough occurs before then, and the
parliament rejects Chernomyrdin a third time, then Yeltsin is
constitutionally bound to disband it and call for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into the breach Wednesday with a presidential decree,
Yeltsin named six acting cabinet members, including Boris Fyodorov,
Russia's tough-talking top tax collector, and for the moment, the
lone clear and authoritative voice advocating Western-style
remedies for Russia's worsening economic and financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Fyodorov drew the line at any
mass printing of new rubles, an option Yeltsin's opposition pushed
in its own economic program. Such a course, he said, would only
lead to hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody intends to go down the road to inflation,'' he said
flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk would be reassuring to Clinton and Russia's other
western allies, who all week have been pressing Moscow to stay the
course on economic reform, and not slide back into Soviet-era
practices like price controls and excessive state spending.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting the Central Bank for policies that set the stage for
the ruble's collapse, Fyodorov also floated the idea of a currency
board, a solution that imposes strict controls on money supply and
which has been used successfully in Argentina, Bulgaria and other
countries to steady inflation and restore investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said he would continue to pursue the idea at a meeting
Thursday with Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's former economy minister
who presided over a currency board that halted inflation by
requiring the central bank to hold one U.S. dollar for every
Argentinian peso in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   But without a government to carry it out, Fyodorov's pledges and
proposals had a ring of prematurity. ``Who can tell me who is going
to be Russia's prime minister in a week?'' asked a western
official. ``That is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has insisted he will not back off Chernomyrdin's
nomination, although he prevaricated Wednesday when the question
was put to him at a news conference. Most analysts thought it
unlikely that Yeltsin would be the first to blink in the current
standoff since any concessions would only further embolden his
opposition to press for more.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview Wednesday, Boris Berezovsky, the financier
who helped engineer Chernomyrdin's nomination, suggested that
Yeltsin may ultimately have to resign to allow a strong political
figure to emerge in his place. An alternative, he said, would be to
create room for a strong political figure who would rule alongside
Yeltsin, ``quietly putting up with the fact that the president
cannot, to the necessary degree, take part in the swiftly
developing events.''
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky, in a later television interview, said he thought
parliament may still be outmaneuvered by the Kremlin, and that
Chernomyrdin's chances of becoming prime minister are not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin had a chance,'' said Berezovsky. ``It's another
question how he will use it now. He had a real chance. I still
think far from everything has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin picked up support from a group of regional
governors, who urged the lower house to act swiftly so that a
government can start putting a program in place. He is due to meet
Thursday with the parliament's upper house, made up of regional
leaders, which has influence, but no power over the formation of
new governments.
</P>
<P>
   The political paralysis continued to take an economic toll
Wednesday, as the value of the ruble fell again during electronic
interbank trading. Continuing uncertainty about the value of the
currency caused major stores to halt credit card transactions, even
as their shelves were being emptied of essential goods.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Central Bank said it was preparing measures to
transfer savings accounts from six major banks to the
government-controlled Sberbank, although in an interview on
television Wednesday night, a top bank official said depositors
would have the option to leave their accounts untouched ``if they
have faith in their bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Central Bank official said in a radio interview that
Russia had spent $9 billion in the last two months defending the
ruble, and had had no choice now but to let its value float.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that if events took a normal course, the rate
could be held without any intervention,'' said deputy bank chairman
Denis Kiselyov. ``What is happening now in economics and politics
can in no way be called a normal course of events.''

A TIME FOR TAKING STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: For many market players, the past few weeks have been a
bearish torment they'd only heard about but never experienced.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who discovered stocks in the '90s, and their
timing was exquisite. These bull market beneficiaries have known
nothing but good times. Even the occasional stomach-wrenching
sell-offs have been embraced as buying opportunities that
subsequently drove prices ever higher. Playing Wall Street's game
had to seem to this lucky bunch of novices like the next best thing
to winning a lottery jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has all unraveled. Since the major indexes peaked July
17, a huge collapse has vaporized an estimated $2 trillion in
market value. That is about one-fourth of the value of all the
goods and services that will be generated by the U.S. economy this
year _ otherwise known as the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny thing about stock market values. Stocks at any
given moment are worth only what buyers and sellers say they're
worth. So why was the market worth $2 trillion more in mid-July
than it was on the last day of August?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a word, is confidence. There was no magic moment
when confidence was lost, however. Moreover, the day investors lost
confidence didn't occur during the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No, the signs of an impending major decline had been building
for months. The only question among those who understand the
market's most-telling auguries was whether the market was in for a
substantial correction or whether a full-fledged bear market was in
the cards.
</P>
<P>
   While the most widely watched indicators showed strength, the
stock market's lesser lights had been deteriorating for months.
While the aftermath of Monday's tornadic destruction left the Dow
Jones industrial average with a loss of only 4.7 percent for the
first eight months of the year, the Russell 2000 was showing a 23
percent decline for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration of the Russell 2000 before August's dramatic
market break was important because this index comprises middle- and
lower-tier capitalization companies. When the shares of the smaller
companies experience the kind of extended decline that was
occurring to Russell 2000 stocks, it's usually only a matter of
time until the big-capitalization companies are pulled into the
vortex.
</P>
<P>
   Another portent of the market's shaky condition before the July
17 peak was the weakness of the breadth numbers. Declining stocks
were beginning to outnumber gainers with disturbing frequency, as
were the stocks making new lows compared with those making new
highs. Thus, from a technical standpoint the market was slipping
into a sorry state long before major gauges hit their highs.
</P>
<P>
   What will it take for investors to regain enough confidence to
bid aggregate stock prices back up enough to recoup the lost $2
trillion? It's said that the market moves between fear and greed.
Greed has been in ascendancy throughout the '90s, but an
increasingly uncertain world has put fear back in the driver's
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is slowing along with corporate profit growth,
Russia is imploding, Latin America remains iffy, Japan seems frozen
in the headlights of its banking crisis, Southeast Asia's recovery
depends largely on Japan, and North Korea just launched a missile
across Japan's bow.
</P>
<P>
   With so much to fear, the market may show occasional bounce, but
recapturing sustained upward momentum will be difficult.

HEARING DELAYED ON KILLER'S PAROLE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With Acting Governor Paul Cellucci ordering the parole
board to tighten its verification process, the Governor's Council
Wednesday decided to wait another week before scheduling a hearing
on whether to revoke the commutation of murderer Joseph Yandle.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sheila Hubbard, chairwoman of the parole board,
Paul Johnson, Cellucci's legal counsel, Wednesday ordered the board
to tighten its verification procedures by requiring that:
</P>
<P>
   _Any petitioner for clemency submitting documents to the parole
board comply with the state laws of evidence regarding the
authenticity of those documents.
</P>
<P>
   _All petitions be sworn under oath and subject to perjury
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   _The board verify all claims of military service.
</P>
<P>
   _The board clearly identify the evidence supporting any facts or
information contained in its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration issued those instructions after finding that
the parole board only began verifying military records in 1993 _
and then only when questions arose _ and that it began routinely
verifying records with the military as recently as last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, a mistake was made here,'' Cellucci said. ``That
military record should have been verified. It was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the acting governor tried to deflect some criticism on
the issue, saying he and Weld had not gained control of the board,
whose members are filled by gubernatorial appointments, until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Yandle's hearing before the board came in 1992. The board, which
accepted his forged military records claiming a bogus record of
heroism in Vietnam, recommended a commutation in June of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Weld subsequently endorsed that recommendation, which the
Governor's Council granted in 1995, commuting the life sentence
Yandle had received for his felony-murder conviction as the getaway
driver in a 1972 Medford liquor store holdup. A man was murdered in
the holdup.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Governor's Council Wednesday were mixed on how to
proceed in the matter of revoking the commutation for Yandle, who
has admitted he forged the military records.
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Dorothy Kelly Gay, a Democrat from Somerville, said
she wanted to ask former governor William F. Weld and his former
legal counsel, Brackett Denniston, what factors had led them to
recommend commutation for Yandle.
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Christopher Iannella Jr., a Jamaica Plain Democrat,
thought the council should query the former parole board members
who recommended commutation for Yandle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Council ultimately voted unanimously for the motion of
Councilor Edward M. O'Brien to wait another week to see how the
parole board handles the issue of revoking Yandle's parole.
</P>
<P>
   The parole board this week provisionally revoked Yandle's
parole. Wednesday, administration officials said a final hearing on
the matter has been set for Sept. 30.

JUST A TASTE: TIME TO BONE UP ON BASICS OF NUTRITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Whether your child is a picky eater, budding gourmet or
a well-adjusted vegan, back to school signals it's time to bone up
on the basics of good nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few tips from the experts:
</P>
<P>
   - The ABCs
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Nutrition Research Center at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston suggests using the vitamins A, B and C as a
guideline when packing a lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin A: Just 1/2 cup of a deep yellow or deep orange fruit or
vegetable is packed with vitamin A. Possible choices: baby carrots,
cubed cantaloupe or dried apricots.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin B: You'll find this vitamin in whole grains, meat, nuts
and seeds. Pack two serving of grains or bread and some protein
every day. Possible choices: meat, cheese or peanut butter
sandwiches on whole-grain bread, pasta salad with cheese and kidney
beans, graham crackers, oatmeal-raisin cookies and sunflower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin C: This vitamin and calcium are abundant in
calcium-fortified orange juice. Or try 1/2 cup serving of fresh
strawberries, cubed pineapple or citrus fruits. For calcium you can
try the dark, leafy green vegetables such as collard greens, kale,
mustard greens or turnip greens. If that's a tough sell, try 1 cup
low-fat milk or yogurt to get the necessary calcium. If you're
child eats a vegan diet, try calcium-fortified soy milk and tofu.
</P>
<P>
   - Sack lunch safety
</P>
<P>
   To keep your kid from trading lunches _ or worse, throwing it
away _ the Asceptic Packaging Council recommends the following
packaging tips:
</P>
<P>
   Keep foods fresh by keeping cold foods cold and hot foods hot.
Freeze drink boxes the night before and use as a cold pack.
</P>
<P>
   Peel fruit. Kids often don't eat fruit because it takes too long
to peel, like a first-grader confronted with an orange. Dip fruit
in lemon juice to retard browning.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap pickles in aluminum foil, and mold the foil into
interesting shapes. Do the same with tomatoes and lettuce to keep
sandwiches from getting soggy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're harried in the morning, make lunch the night before.
Or even freeze a week's worth of sandwiches ahead of time. Mayo
doesn't freeze well but butter and mustard work fine.
</P>
<P>
   - Homework for picky eaters
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association offers the following
suggestions to keep mealtimes from becoming a parent//child tug of
war:
</P>
<P>
   Offer choices of foods so kids can make their own decisions.
This also increases the likelihood they will be open to trying new
foods.
</P>
<P>
   Make foods fun. Cut sandwiches into fun shapes, offer vegetable
dips, ``hide'' bits of fruit in yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Involve the child in food preparation. Even toddlers like to
help tear lettuce for salad or measure ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Stay calm when your child rejects what you've served.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, set a good example by allowing your children to see
you eat healthy foods.

SUBDUED CLINTON REITERATES HIS REGRET FOR HURT CAUSED BY LEWINSKY
MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Directly questioned for the first time in public about
the Monica Lewinsky matter since his televised admission two weeks
ago, President Clinton said at a Kremlin news conference Wednesday
that he believed he had expressed ``profound regret'' to those who
had been hurt by his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While his remarks Wednesday amplified his previous statements,
the president again stopped short of issuing an outright apology
for the relationship or for lying about it to his family, his staff
and the nation. And Clinton reiterated that the investigation by
the independent counsel Kenneth Starr that brought him to this pass
was ``disproportionate'' to his alleged offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake, said that I
regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton said, speaking at a joint press
conference here with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that's what the American people want me to do, and
based on my conversations with leaders around the world, I think
that's what they want me to do and that is what I intend to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he was ``heartened'' by the reaction of the
American people and world leaders to his public admission on Aug.
17, the same day that he testified to the grand jury about
accusations that he had lied about the relationship and tried to
cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   But within the walls of the Kremlin, as Russia is seething with
political intrigue and economic privation, Clinton looked anything
but heartened by having to deal with the Lewinsky matter when he
would prefer to be conducting high-level diplomacy. Clinton's
demeanor during the news conference, which lasted 43 minutes _
indeed, throughout the two-day summit meeting in Moscow _ was
subdued, almost mournful.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, Clinton has come under heavy criticism,
much of it from members of his own party and political allies, who
said he was insufficiently contrite and overly defensive in his
public statements two weeks ago. Aides said he had been prepared
for questions about the Lewinsky matter at the news conference and
decided on his own to address them rather than rebuffing them as
inappropriate in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's response Wednesday to the first question left many
in the White House press corps dissatisfied. At the next
opportunity, he was asked whether he regretted the bitter tone of
his statement and felt that he owed an apology to his family, his
supporters and the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to avoid the question by jokingly echoing a curt
response by Yeltsin to a separate question about his prospects for
forming a government out of the current political chaos in Moscow.
But Clinton then gave a fuller answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question of the tone of the speech, and people's
reaction to it, is really a function of _ I can't comment on
that,'' Clinton said as Yeltsin looked on alternately bemused and
bewildered by the spectacle in the beautifully restored Catherine's
Hall in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued, ``I read it the other day again, and I
thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound regret to
all who were hurt and to all who were involved, and my desire not
to see any more people hurt by this process and caught up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, elaborating on his combative words toward Starr, Clinton
added: ``And I was commenting that it seemed to be something that
most reasonable people would think had consumed a disproportionate
amount of America's time, money and resources and attention, and
now continued to involve more and more people. And that's what I
tried to say.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides offered no elaboration on the president's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this matter,'' said Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary, ``the president obviously wants to speak from the heart,
and he did. He said what he wanted to say, and I don't think it's
the role of staff to try to amplify or comment further on his
remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would McCurry or other aides provide the names of the
``leaders around the world'' who Clinton said had offered him
support and encouragement after his admission of an inappropriate
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his misleading public statements
on it. Officials would not say whether Clinton's comments Wednesday
would be his last on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent some of the rare unscheduled time on this trip
making calls to the United States to gauge the impact of his
admission, a senior White House aide said. Other officials on the
trip have also been in contact with Congressional Democrats to try
to judge their mood as they return to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One senior administration official who has worked closely with
Clinton at the summit meeting said he had seen no evidence that the
president was dejected over the Lewinsky revelations and the
critical reaction to his televised speech last month.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Clinton's somber mood over the last two days
reflected the turmoil in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious situation which does not lend itself to
laughter,'' the official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said Clinton's mental state had not affected his
ability to do his job. ``Not on this trip,'' the official added.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did not comment on the questions about Ms. Lewinsky,
either in the news conference or in private meetings with Clinton,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a liberal political party here,
said that many Russians sympathized with Clinton for the legal
problems he faced arising from the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it in a more personal way,'' Yavlinsky said. ``We
don't take this juridical view.''

CLINTON TELLS KREMLIN NEWS CONFERENCE HE `REGRETS' AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Recasts lede to reflect Yeltsin not standing; pickup 3rdgraf:

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
at his side, on Wednesday defended his expression of ``regret''
last month for his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky and
said it was intended to extend ``to all who were hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake; said that I
regretted it; asked to be forgiven; spent a lot of very valuable
time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I was
going back to work,'' Clinton told a news conference in the
Kremlin, his voice resigned and his mood somber.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was ``quite encouraged'' by what he said
was the favorable reaction of the American people and world leaders
to his remarks on Aug. 17, just hours after he testified before a
federal grand jury investigating the alleged sexual relationship
with Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and the cover-up of the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's acknowledgement of a relationship with Lewinsky that
was ``not appropriate _ in fact it was wrong'' came after seven
months of public denials by the president, his wife and White House
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I misled people, including even my wife. I
deeply regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Kremlin, Clinton was asked about the tone of his speech
on Aug. 17 when he didn't apologize and instead lashed out at
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who is investigating the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship for evidence of perjury, subornation
of perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it (the speech) the other day again, and I thought it
was clear that I was expressing my profound regret to all who were
hurt and to all who were involved and my desire not to see any more
people hurt by this process and caught up in it,'' Clinton replied.
</P>
<P>
   As he has previously, Clinton sought to portray the Lewinsky
affair as a private matter to be worked out within his marriage to
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my best to continue to go through this
personal process in an appropriate way, but to do my job, to do the
job I was hired to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming Starr, Clinton said he believed the ongoing
four-year, $40-million inquiry ``had consumed a disproportionate
amount of America's time, money and resources, and attention and
now continued to involve more and more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``All I wanted to say was I believe it's time for
us to now go back to the work of the country and give the people
their government back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin news conference with Yeltsin was the first
opportunity for reporters to meet with Clinton since his Aug. 17
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who accompanied Clinton aboard
Air Force One as a member of the official U.S. delegation,
upbraided Reuters White House correspondent Laurence McQuillan for
asking one of the two questions about the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an American I'm outraged,'' Hoyer, a member of the House
Democratic leadership, told the veteran White House correspondent
who had asked Clinton whether he felt he needed to ``offer an
apology'' and whether he wished the tone of his Aug. 17 address had
been different.
</P>
<P>
   His Kremlin comments represented his third attempt in 17 days to
put the White House sex scandal to rest and quell a political
controversy that imperils his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   During his vacation last month on Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
Clinton interrupted his family retreat to visit a church and tell a
predominantly black audience that he was ``having to become quite
an expert in this business of asking for forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said then that he had learned during the controversy
that he had to ``forgive those we believe have wronged us'' before
he could ``ask for forgiveness from people we have wronged.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former Bush administration Justice Department official
and federal appeals court judge, is expected to report his findings
to the House of Representatives by the end of the month. House
Republicans are gearing up to weigh Starr's findings to determine
whether an impeachment inquiry is warranted by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 17 address, Clinton lambasted Starr, accusing him of
steadily broadening a court-approved investigation into the
Clintons' failed 1978 Whitewater land scheme in Arkansas into a
wide ranging probe of White House operations and his private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the
prying into private lives,'' Clinton declared. ``This has gone on
too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.''

   Clinton had declared in a Jan. 17 deposition in Paula Jones'
$700,000 civil sexual harassment lawsuit that: ``I have never had
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark.,
issued an order Tuesday that she would release the misleading
deposition on Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Wright wrote in a one-sentence footnote to her decision that she
had ``concerns about the nature'' of Clinton's deposition in light
of his subsequent admission that he did ``not volunteer
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said her court ``makes no findings at this time regarding
whether the president may be in contempt.''

<P>
   RONGCHENG, China _ Xiao Renbai, director of this beleaguered
town along the overflowing Yangtze River, stood before an
encampment of blue tents inhabited by 800 sorry-looking people who
weeks before were told to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We protected our dikes for more than 40 days,'' Xiao told
visitors. ``But on the orders of the provincial government, on Aug.
5 we opened the embankment in order to save the city of Wuhan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody drowned when an earthen dike that held back the swelling
river was blasted with dynamite, engulfing the homes of 13,000
people in this one incident. But many people, including Yang
Luozhi, her husband, their four children and two grandparents, were
left with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They had just two
hours' warning, Ms. Yang said, before they were carried away by
boat through the rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   This stretch of Hubei province has suffered some of the worst
damage of the summer's floods. Of Jianli County's 1.4 million
residents, 100,000 saw their homes and nearly all their belongings
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands, less lucky than Ms. Yang, are now crowded into
makeshift huts atop the remaining dikes, where they subsist on
rations of 1.1 pounds of rice and 12 cents a day per person and for
drinking must boil the filthy flood water.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in this county, as along much of the Yangtze this
summer, the raging river did not by its own power breach a single
dike _ neither the major dikes, huge earthen mounds that line the
Yangtze flood plain, often several miles apart, nor the minor dikes
jutting into the flood plain to shield farmland reclaimed from mud
and marshes.
</P>
<P>
   All the damage in Jianli County resulted from government
decisions to spread the swelling waters by breaching inner dikes to
relieve pressure on the vital main dikes and the provincial capital
of Wuhan downstream.
</P>
<P>
   These were not decisions made lightly by authorities in Wuhan, a
city of 7 million. But neither were they accepted readily by
villagers who lay in the path of the flood diversion. Some tried to
block the inundation of their land with an all-night vigil on the
dike, while many others had to be forced from their homes,
according to local news accounts and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Events in Jianli are emblematic of China's worsening bind as
more people crowd into the country's fertile river valleys. To
prevent a repetition of this year's costly disasters, officials now
realize, the country must spend billions of dollars it does not
have to reinforce dikes, and move millions of farmers who have
nowhere else to go out of the low-lying areas that can serve as
safety valves for excess waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, officials will periodically face terrible
choices, weighing the value of homes and farms in one place against
the risk of catastrophe elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In his exhortations this summer, President Jiang Zemin laid out
the priorities: first, protect the river's main dikes; second,
protect major cities; third, protect human lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Jianli County, 17 zones in the flood plain had over the
decades been drained, surrounded by dikes and filled with farms,
villages, even factories. Since early August, 16 of those areas
have been intentionally flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newly homeless here, there is a mood of sullen
resignation, if not anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt just terrible when they told us we had to leave,''
said a mother of two in a shaky lean-to of boards and plastic
sheeting atop the major dike, who gave her name as Ms. Song. ``It
didn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncommissioned officer from a military unit in the area, a
Sgt. Chen, said a large part of his unit's job had involved
``mobilizing people to leave areas that were about to be
inundated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people were mentally unprepared to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was certainly the case in Sanzhou township, tens of miles
downstream from Rongcheng and the site of what had been the
county's largest dike-enclosed area, home for 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   An article on Aug. 17 in the official county newspaper, Jianli
Daily, titled ``A Tragic Abandonment,'' gave details of farmer
resistance. Its rare frankness suggests, too, that local officials
were not entirely pleased with their county's place at the bottom
of the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the article said, authorities in Wuhan made ``the
painful decision to abandon Sanzhou.'' The next day, officials
decided they would breach the dike at 4:30 p.m. and issued the
order to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   But as the word spread, villagers ``spontaneously massed
together on the dike,'' the article said, and guarded it through
the night. Through much of the next day, county officials tried to
persuade them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, at 3:05 p.m., 30 policemen with shovels dug a channel
through the dike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again the villagers were up in arms,'' the article said.
``They rushed to the breach, dragging sandbags brimming with sand,
shovels and spades with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police again closed in to stop them,'' the newspaper
reported, ``holding them back less than three meters from the
breach.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardships resulting from this geographical triage are most
visible along Sanzhou's major Yangtze dike, where more than 5,000
displaced people inhabit an endless line of makeshift huts, in
conditions that worry health officials.
</P>
<P>
   From government relief agencies, the dike dwellers receive their
rations of rice and money, plus some charcoal for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   They are told to boil the river water, which laps with deceptive
gentleness against the dike, and they have been given purification
tablets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't always use the tablets,'' said one mother on the
dike, ``because the children don't like the taste.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, diarrhea, skin diseases and eye infections have been
reported, but no major epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   The dike residents assume they will stay there perhaps two more
months, until the floods recede and they can return to their plots.
While Beijing officials have said that farmlands reclaimed from
rivers and lakes should be returned to nature, officials here say
they have little choice but to send the displaced people back to
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The former village of Sanzhou, a 15-minute motorboat trip out
into a sea of brown, was totally destroyed. Here and there protrude
shattered rooftops and the upper branches of tall trees, some
festooned with chairs lashed on hopefully by fleeing residents.
Large water snakes slither through the sunken ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Flood officials far away in Wuhan appear divided as to how
serious the threat to their city's dikes ever were. But they insist
that the sacrifices by the villagers upstream were necessary, if
not to save the city and its industry, then to save major dikes
guarding millions. They add that in some cases, villagers were
imperiled by possible sudden breaches of their own protective
dikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better to breach the dikes ourselves than to let it
happen,'' said Wu Shiwei, director of flood control in Wuhan.
``Above all, we need to protect people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a flood control plan that tells us what to do,'' he
said.

RECEPTION FOR CLINTON MAY BE COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ In 1995, when Bill Clinton became the first sitting
American president to visit Northern Ireland, he was greeted on
both sides of the border as a hero and an independent broker who
would help propel the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received tumultuous welcomes in Belfast and Dublin then.
The day in Belfast was, according to Clinton and his senior aides,
the best day of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a political settlement between Catholics and
Protestants in place for which Clinton has received substantial
credit. When he returns to Belfast Thursday, and when he goes south
to Dublin Friday, the welcome undoubtedly will be warm. But few
here believe it will be nearly as enthusiastic as it was three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and even more by his
decision to attack Afghanistan and Sudan, Clinton is tarnished,
even in Irish eyes. He will see in throngs of admirers a sprinkling
of vocal critics. Activists here are planning a series of protests
over the strikes which Clinton authorized in retaliation for the US
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, Clinton is scheduled to visit Omagh, the
town where 28 people were killed and 220 injured by a terrorist car
bomb on Aug. 15. While Clinton's display of sympathy to the victims
of the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland this century will likely
prove poignant, it will also provide uncomfortable parallels to the
American missile raids that, while directed at terrorists, killed
and injured civilians, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, only the fringe or the anonymous questioned Clinton's
involvement in the search for a political settlement, which was
reached last April and endorsed by an overwhelming majority of
people on both sides of the border in a May referendum. But now the
dissenting voices are more mainstream and more willing to be heard
publically. Among those leading the protests are Patricia McKenna,
an Irish member of the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two weeks, several letters have been published in
The Irish Times, widely considered Ireland's best and most serious
newspaper, drawing comparisons between what the dissident Catholic
group known as the Real IRA did in Omagh and what Clinton did in an
attempt to destroy the terrorist operations of the Saudi exile,
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Molly O'Duffy, the chairperson of Comhlamh, a Dublin
organization of international development workers, said it is
hypocritical to ``quite rightly condemn punishment beatings by the
IRA while raising no voice against punishment bombings by the US.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Omagh bombers killed 28. The US bombers killed 26. The
Omagh bombers, including the godfathers, receive our repudiation
and opprobium. The US godfather does not even have his invitation
to visit Ireland withdrawn,'' O'Duffy complained.
</P>
<P>
   Juliette Cunliffe, a Briton who is one of Comhlamh's leaders,
added that the Irish make up a disproportionately high percentage
of the aid workers in the Third World and are especially skeptical
of American claims that such bombing raids are surgical strikes at
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is civilians get killed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She compared the anti-Clinton sentiment today to that which
greeted Ronald Reagan when he visited Ireland in 1984. Reagan was
politely welcomed by most of the Irish, but he also provoked
protests over American policy in Central America at the time. The
Catholic bishops made public their contempt for US support of
right-wing dictatorships in the region. And even the Irish premier
at the time, Garret FitzGerald, gently rebuked US foreign policy in
a speech.
</P>
<P>
   But, like Clinton himself, the Irish bishops have been dogged by
a series of sex scandals and are no longer the political force they
once were in Ireland. The Irish government, meanwhile, is unlikely
to criticize Clinton, which Dublin credits with adding the
``international dimension'' necessary to push the peace process
along.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Irish diplomats make no secret of their dislike of
retaliatory air strikes that inevitably kill civilians. The Irish
have been among those who criticize Israel for similar actions. But
the Clinton administration is extremely popular with the government
led by Bertie Ahern, the Irish taoiseach, or premier.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments are indebted to Clinton. They
believe that without him and his appointee as Irish envoy, former
Maine senator George Mitchell, who chaired the peace talks, last
spring's political settlement would not have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky affair is seen here as embarrassing rather than
impeachable. Still, Irish officials worry that it will be used by
some to embarrass the president, and there have been some efforts
to minimize potential embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In Ballybunion, the seaside town in rural County Kerry where
Clinton is scheduled to play golf on Saturday with Dick Spring,
Ireland's former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, a sign
was discreetly removed last week. Hung over a defunct hairdresser's
shop, it carried the name of the former hairdresser there: Monica.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, most people will welcome Clinton to show
their appreciation of the White House's even-handed approach to the
peace process. Clinton has promised that US support will continue,
and he will urge more US investment in an economy that has been
sustained largely by $5 billion in annual subsidies from the
British government.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some dissident voices. Oliver Gibson, whose niece
was killed in the Omagh bombing, accuses Clinton of using the Omagh
tragedy to score political points. Gibson is a member of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly. But as a member of the Democratic
Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley, he was unlikely to welcome
Clinton under any circumstances. Paisley's hardline party considers
Washington biased toward Irish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are others who are going out of their way to
welcome Clinton. The White House is especially appreciative that
the Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, chose this week to acknowledge
that violence in Northern Ireland was no longer justified under any
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments, and especially Protestant
unionists, had been urging Adams and other political allies of the
Irish Republican Army to make such a statement. Adams' choice of
timing is seen as a gesture of thanks to Bill Clinton, who these
days is taking kind gestures wherever he can find them.

SINN FEIN AIMS TO TRY TO HALT ILLICIT ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ A day after declaring its commitment
to ending violence in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army, announced Wednesday that it
would cooperate with efforts to plan ways to disarm paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the eve of President Clinton's visit here, Gerry
Adams, president of the party, appointed the party's chief
negotiator, Martin McGuinness, to the independent international
commission on disarmament that was set up by last April's peace
settlement. He coupled that with an assertion that ``the issue of
arms must be finally and satisfactorily settled.''
</P>
<P>
   A product of the peace settlement, the commission is headed by
Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain and is charged with arranging
gradual disarmament of guerrillas over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRA has maintained a cease-fire for 14 months, it has
resisted repeated calls from political leaders to indicate any
willingness to destroy or surrender its tons of Armalite assault
rifles, machine guns, AK-47s, Semtex explosives, rocket launchers,
homemade mortars and flame throwers hidden in underground bunkers
throughout the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant opponents have seized on this refusal to challenge
the right of Sinn Fein members elected to the new Northern Ireland
Assembly to take up positions they are entitled to in the 10-person
cabinet that will run the province.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement did not reverse the IRA's stance, but
it signaled an interest by the clandestine force in the creation of
procedures for disarming, known as ``decommissioning.'' It also
added substantial momentum to the quickened political pace stirred
by Adams' statement of Tuesday that ``Sinn Fein believe the
violence we have seen must be for all of us now a thing of the past
_ over, done with and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a fight over Sinn Fein's role in the new Assembly
could imperil the peace process, the British and Irish governments
and the White House have been pressuring Adams to declare an end to
``the war'' and to agree to scrapping weapons. More than 3,200
people have lost their lives as a result of violence by warring
Catholic and Protestant paramilitary groups in three decades.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Ulster Unionists, the largest party in the
Assembly, welcomed both of Adams' statements, saying, ``This will
obviously be welcomed and seen as another step in the right
direction. They are obviously now reacting to the lobbying and
pressure from the U.S. government and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said both moves were a Sinn Fein initiative to use the
visit by Clinton ``as an opportunity to build dynamic into the
process, that the visit becomes a catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist Party's security spokesman who
generally condemns the statements and actions of Sinn Fein, said of
Wednesday's action, ``Every tentative step towards the
psychological hurdle of disarmament will be welcomed by the UUP.''
</P>
<P>
   David Ervine, spokesman for the Progressive Unionist Party,
which is linked to Protestant paramilitaries, said, ``As far as I
am concerned, if the IRA war is over, then the loyalist war is
over.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the political parlance of Northern Ireland, Protestants are
known as loyalists or unionists, reflecting their desire to remain
part of the United Kingdom and loyal to Britain, while Catholics
are known as nationalists or republicans because of their desire to
associate themselves more closely with the Republic of Ireland to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the party's leader and first minister of the
Northern Ireland Assembly, on Wednesday called on the leaders of
eight parties, including Sinn Fein, to attend a meeting Monday to
plan the opening of the new body Sept. 14. Though Trimble and Adams
were both negotiators and signatories of the peace settlement, the
two men have never spoken, at Trimble's insistence.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the accommodating statements of the past two days and
the presence in Belfast on Thursday of Clinton, an active party to
the Northern Ireland peace negotiations, there is still only a slim
expectation that Trimble will use the occasion to end his snub of
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   What would be a simple gesture in most societies constitutes one
of great risk for Trimble, whose leadership of the Protestant
community is subject to challenges from hardliners who accuse him
of being weak.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Democratic Unionists, the Rev. Ian Paisley, said
he would not attend the meeting on Monday. ``I am going to give Mr.
Trimble no cover to the dirty deed of getting IRA-Sinn Fein into
the government of Northern Ireland,'' Paisley said.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders reacted positively Wednesday to the early
release from prison of two Scots guardsmen who had been serving
life sentences for shooting dead an unarmed 18-year-old Catholic
here in September 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted,'' Maginnis said. ``I have been campaigning
with others that they should be released. It is far, far too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestant leaders angry over the releases of Catholic prisoners
in recent months had cited the case of the two soldiers as an
example of discrimination. Some 400 Catholic and Protestant
prisoners are to begin leaving prison next week under early-release
provisions included in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The two soldiers, James Fisher, now 30, and Mark Wright, 25,
killed Peter McBride as he fled down an alleyway in the Catholic
New Lodge area of North Belfast. The soldiers argued that they
feared that he carried a weapon. But testimony showed that McBride
had minutes before been searched and found to be unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the British and Irish Parliaments returned to London
and Dublin Wednesday for emergency sessions to draw up
anti-terrorism legislation. The bills, expected to be rushed to
overwhelming passage, are aimed at members of dissident
paramilitary groups opposed to the peace settlement and bent on
disrupting it with violence. Among the targets is the Real IRA, the
renegade republican group that bombed Omagh two weeks ago, killing
28 people.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions of the bills under debate include one that would
make the opinion of a single police officer admissible in court as
evidence of membership in a terrorist group and another that would
allow courts to ``draw inference'' from a suspect's refusal to
answer questions about paramilitary groups. A third provision would
let the government seize assets used to support groups.

 &HT;    Market exceeds expectations of BellSouth in Brazil
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Brazilian partnership led by BellSouth has now grown to
535,000 customers for its four-month-old wireless service, company
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of the business _ with subscribers mostly
coming in the huge metropolitan area of Sao Paulo _ is a promising
sign for BellSouth's multi-billion-dollar bet on Brazil and Latin
America. For BellSouth, the region still promises a lucrative
payday down the road, despite the current global economic malaise,
said Charles C. Miller, president of BellSouth International.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosive demand we are witnessing confirms and exceeds
our expectations for the Brazilian market,'' he said. ``And, as our
waiting list demonstrates, that demand shows no signs of slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and its partners have more than 2.4 million customers
in nine Latin American countries. In Brazil, the 18 million-person
area of Sao Paulo has so far produced about 485,000 customers and
the company has a waiting list of 550,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two licenses _ one to serve Sao Paulo and another for the
northeast region around Recife _ cost BellSouth and its partners
more than $2 billion last year. The service has only been available
since the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The company made its commitment to wireless before last fall's
Asian currency crisis, which has deepened even as other economic
dominoes fall _ most recently in Russia. Latin America has thus far
avoided a serious downturn, although Brazil in the past year has
slashed public spending and cut loose thousands of government
workers. BellSouth did bid on only one license _ and lost _ during
the most recent round of auctions for wire-line phone companies in
Brazil. However, another round is coming up this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street this week, BellSouth stock has bobbed like a
contrarian cork on the surf of the changing daily mood. Investors
rallied to BellSouth Monday when the market was plunging, shied
away Tuesday when the market rallied. Wednesday the market dipped
and BellSouth edged up 46.25 cents to close at $66.37 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   It is the strength of BellSouth's business in the Southeast _
coupled with the lack of investments in Asia and Russia _ that make
the stock attractive as a ``safe haven'' when the market is
tumbling, analysts say.

 &HT;    Timing, and other myths of the market
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lesson for small investors in the stock market's
recent trading pattern: Don't try to time the market. You won't
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom behind this frequently offered piece of investment
advice has now been documented in a new study by analysts at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market has bounced back from a major decline,
gains have frequently been concentrated in a few days, weeks or
months. This makes it extremely difficult to `time' the market,''
said Jonathan Thomas, an analyst with the Smith Barney Consulting
Group and author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an investor tried to get out of the market on every drop,
he would miss the upside potential,'' Thomas said in an interview.
``The investor is trying to time the market twice: when to get out
and when to get back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas looked at 11 monthly losses by the S&AMP;P 500 index since
October 1987 _ the month of the market's biggest crash. Only twice
did the market fail to recover its losses within two months, and in
every case _ including the crash _ the market was back within six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, analysts have developed many schemes to ``time''
the market so an investor could be in stocks when they are rising
and out of the market when it is falling.
</P>
<P>
   That this can be done is, by almost universal agreement, one of
the myths of Wall Street. But there are others, as well as
messages, that investors can take from the recent selling. Here are
some of them:
</P>
<P>
   The myths and realities
</P>
<P>
   Myth: The stock market is a leading economic indicator, and the
economy will follow its trend.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Maybe, maybe not. Economist Paul Samuelson once
observed that the stock market had predicted ``10 of the last five
recessions.'' The economy boomed in the year following the 1987
crash. Recessions are typically caused by high inflation and rising
interest rates, neither of which is a problem now.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: It's a new paradigm, the old rules no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Except that they do. By all accounts, the stock market
got overbought in the period of manic stock buying since 1990. If
the value of a stock is the future earnings of the company that
issued it,then people were eventually paying more for some stocks
than they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, savvy investors were certain to unload those
overpriced shares, which is what they have been doing since July
17, when the Dow set its all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Myth: The big threat is that small investors will panic and sell
when the market tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: It may be too early to call this one, but the early
evidence suggests that small investors stood their ground. It was
the professionals who panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Company Institute says total assets in stock
mutual funds declined by $30.4 billion in July. That's a drop of
only 1.1 percent _ hardly a bolt for the door on the part of small
investors. To be sure, the August numbers will be more indicative.
</P>
<P>
   The market's messages
</P>
<P>
   Keep things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 10 biggest one-day point losses by the Dow Jones
industrial average occurred in 1997 and 1998, the other being the
Oct. 19, 1987, crash. But of the 10 biggest one-day percentage
losses, two were in October 1987 and the rest were in the 1920s and
'30s, with one in 1907 and another in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Even a stopped watch is correct twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   Those bearish stock market forecasters who have warned for years
of impending disaster were bound to be right, eventually. Here's
what one market letter said in August 1995: ``We ... wouldn't be
surprised in the months ahead to see market corrections approaching
10 percent, with lightninglike plunges of 300, 400 or even 500
points taking place in just a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who got out of the market then, and stayed out, would
have missed the Dow's subsequent rise of 4,727 points, or 102.5
percent, to its recent high.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to keep the market's decline in perspective, but don't
get too casual about it.
</P>
<P>
   The recent loss was, in fact, staggering by any measure.
Monday's selling loss has been estimated at $2.3 trillion. Look at
it this way: Since the stock market added $12.5 trillion to
household wealth since 1994 (the Federal Reserve says), Monday's
sell-off took back 18 percent of that gain _ no small sum.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions really are important.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market tanks in an economy that is still growing
_ with modest but rising profits, minimal inflation and falling
interest rates _ the selling has to come from a sense of fear on
the part of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The fear may be that stocks are headed for a crash, that the
Asian flu really will hurt the economy, that Russia's economic
problems will lead to political instability, that ... well, you get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   What may be needed to turn investor psychology around is another
big event. A good candidate would be a cut in interest rates by the
Fed, but don't hold your breath.

 &HT;    Lyceum first in Atlanta to offer ADSL
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tiny Internet company on Wedesday beat BellSouth to the punch,
becoming the first in metro Atlanta to offer a speedy new
technology for faster transmission of data.
</P>
<P>
   Lyceum Internet, a six-year-old, 10-person firm, announced the
availability of ADSL _ which stands for asymmetric digital
subscriber lines. The service being trotted out by Lyceum, which
will pump data over regular phone lines, and compete right away
against other means of high-speed transmission like high speed T-1
data lines and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL is capable of transmitting data at better than 1.5 million
bits per second, as fast as a T-1 line. That's at least 30 times
faster than the fastest modems and 10 times as fast as ISDN.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL is also seen as the key rival to cable modems _ especially
among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyceum will first target businesses in Buckhead, expanding in
coming months to other areas, said Lindsey Crawley, company founder
and president.
</P>
<P>
   The foray into ADSL puts Lyceum ahead of the region's dominant
telecommunications company _ but probably not for long. BellSouth
is unveiling the service in New Orleans today and plans to unveil
the service in metro Atlanta Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Lyceum's version of ADSL will cost businesses between $400 and
$1,000 a month, depending on how fast a connection the customer
wants. Lyceum believes companies of 20 workers or more that need
fast links to the Net will see ADSL as a more sensible expense than
the other high-speed options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to complement what BellSouth is doing,''
Crawley said. ``They are a much bigger company and they will deploy
it on a bigger scale.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth will sell the ADSL service to Internet Service
Providers who will, in turn, market it to customers. BellSouth's
Internet unit is planning to charge residential customes $60 a
month for ADSL, plus a $100 installation cost and $200 for the
equipment, according to BellSouth spokesman John Goldman. Customers
that have the company's ``complete choice'' phone package would get
a $10 a month discount.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth had planned to offer ADSL to consumers by September,
but delayed the launch in order to study a proposal by federal
regulators that could reshape the way they do their high-speed data
business, Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition to BellSouth's ADSL will come from tiny players like
Lyceum and cable companies like MediaOne, Comcast and Charter
Communications. ADSL will also be offered by other Net companies
like MindSpring and America Online, and MGC Communications, which
this year started competing with BellSouth for local phone
business.
</P>
<P>
   An ADSL offering will proabably come by early next year, said
MGC Chairman Maurice J. Gallagher. ``The big mystery is how to
price these things.''
</P>
<P>
   ADSL also has some flaws, since not every phone line in every
home can handle the technology.

 &HT;    Northwest layoffs hit Hartsfield
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Northwest Airlines pilots strike hit Atlanta in a big way
Wednesday, but in the form of layoffs rather than travel
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The grounded airline laid off 27,500 employees, including most
of the nearly 2,000 workers at its maintenance hangar at Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the International Association of Machinists,
which represents Atlanta mechanics, said all but 300 or 400 workers
were sent home until further notice. The bulk of the Atlanta
workers are mechanics, but they also include clerical, technical
and management employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a waiting game,'' said Dennis Isaacs, a
mechanic and spokesman for the IAM local. ``Some of the guys will
be looking for temporary work.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers can file for unemployment benefits next week.
Northwest said health benefits will continue through September.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot strike began Saturday. The impact on air travel has
been greatest in the Midwest, where Northwest has hubs in
Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, which inherited the Atlanta hangar in a 1986
merger, had a small flight schedule at Hartsfield. Another airline
labor dispute may affect more Atlanta travelers this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Airlines and its flight attendant union are in
last-ditch contract talks through Friday. If they fail, the
Association of Flight Attendants is threatening spot walkouts that
would not shut down AirTran but would disrupt its schedule and
cause uncertainty for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran vows to maintain its schedule, in part by training gate
agents as substitute attendants and using fewer attendants than
normal if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots at Air Canada also went on strike after failed contract
talks, and that carrier canceled all flights including
Atlanta-Toronto service.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest layoffs could be followed by more today. In
Washington, the National Mediation Board called an ``exploration
meeting'' Saturday to bring airline and pilot union representatives
back to the table to identify areas of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has canceled all flights through Monday and says it
will take eight to 10 days after a settlement to rebuild its
system.
</P>
<P>
   Other major airlines are accepting Northwest passengers if space
is available.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are deadlocked on pay rates, back pay and job
security provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes a strike, but it's not the pilots' fault,'' said
Isaacs, adding he believes mechanics firmly support the pilot
union.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the IAM is in the midst of its own contentious contract
negotiations with Northwest. It recently asked the mediation board
to declare an impasse, which would start the countdown to another
potential strike. The board hasn't yet ruled on that request.

Barry Schwabsky is the author of ``The Widening Circle:
Consequences of Modernism in Contemporary Art,'' published by
Cambridge University Press. 
 By BARRY SCHWABSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There's more of everything,'' proclaims the slogan emblazoned
across ``Watts 1963,'' a painting by Kerry James Marshall evoking
the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Los Angeles, where he
moved at age 8, in that politically and culturally momentous year.
</P>
<P>
   Those words are just one element in an elaborate interplay
between realities and ideals in the 1995 painting's depiction of
the project as a place of unexpected bliss. But they could also
describe the modus operandi of an artist best known for grand,
brilliantly realized canvases like this one, a visually and
emotionally loaded meditation on black American life.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest work, however, Marshall has let his idea of
``more'' jump off the canvas into three dimensions, and given it an
even more specific historical focus as well. Admirers who see the
artist as a flag bearer for painting _ echoing his own assessment
in a recent conversation that ``the work I've done has demonstrated
the viability of this art in a hostile critical climate where the
idea of painting is often discredited'' _ may be taken aback by the
apparent change.
</P>
<P>
   The new work is featured in ``Mementos,'' his first New York
museum exhibition, which opens Friday at the Brooklyn Museum, where
it is supplemented by a small selection of works dating from 1994
to 1996. A somewhat different version of ``Mementos'' was shown
last spring at the Renaissance Society at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although it includes four large bannerlike paintings,
``Mementos'' is a single installation, or suite of works, that also
contains sculpture, photography, prints and video, all of which
evoke images and slogans associated with the racial struggles of
the 60s. The prints trumpet phrases ranging from ``We shall
overcome'' to ``Burn, baby, burn.''
</P>
<P>
   The paintings memorialize icons from musicians like the
rhythm-and-blues singer Otis Redding and the jazz saxophonist John
Coltrane to the men the artist calls ``the holy trinity of the
civil rights movement'': Martin Luther King Jr. and John and Robert
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the paintings, such images are set within the spaces of black
middle-class living rooms. By focusing on past events, people or
ideas, not so much for their own sake as on the way they are
commemorated and ceremonially invoked in the present, the artist
seems to imply that they've been rendered innocuous, even kitschy.
Stylistically, too, the works quote the 60s. The sculptural
elements, for instance, include giant, Claes Oldenburg-style rubber
stamps, from which the prints of the slogans were made.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall dismisses the idea that this mixed-media extravaganza
represents a shift of position, recalling that Leonardo da Vinci
and Michelangelo considered it ``not incompatible to do paintings,
architecture, weapons development, poetry, and do all of them very
well.'' His determination to branch out in this way may have been
encouraged by another of the resonant slogans in ``Mementos,'' this
one from Malcolm X: ``By any means necessary.'' &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Artists like Leonardo were engaged in an inquisitive pursuit
that employed a lot of tools that we now consider art, but at the
time were simply means to an end, though not without philosophical
intent,'' Marshall says. The point, he says, has been ``to avoid
forcing into a painting structure things that are not best explored
in that manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was inevitable that this particular artist would take
on the subject of the 60s, and in particular the memory of the
competing yet intertwined movements for civil rights and for black
power.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a black child born in 1955 whose childhood took him
from Birmingham, Ala. _ where four schoolgirls were killed in the
bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church _ to Watts, where one of
the decade's most notorious riots took place, might be forgiven for
seeing himself as the chosen witness to a heroic yet tragic
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of the things going on then,'' says Marshall, in a
voice still redolent of his Alabama origins, ``but I had no way to
contextualize them. This work was a way of coming to terms with a
part of my personal history I couldn't deal with before now, but
also of coming to terms with a historical moment that still
resonates. And to talk about a historical distance, a remove from
the volatility things had at the time.'' His intention was not to
document a period, he explains, but to create a space in which
people can come to terms with that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, innumerable lives were touched by those events, but
no one else would have tried to engage them in the disparate visual
languages exemplified by Leonardo and Marcel Duchamp, the artists
Marshall cites as the exemplars of his conception of art as ``an
inquisitive pursuit into perception and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that the Chicago-based critic Kathryn
Hixson wrote in the art journal Trans(GT)Arts.Cultures.Media, after
a visit to Marshall's studio, ``There is something grandiose about
Marshall's embrace of the great tradition, a pride that may be
repellent but, here, is completely seductive.'' Marshall has lived
in Chicago since 1987 and teaches at the University of Illinois
campus there. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Ms. Hixson is hardly the only viewer to have been beguiled by
Marshall's unfashionable ambition. The demise of mastery and
masterpieces having been proclaimed many times over, the art world
may not be ready for the next Renaissance man, yet Marshall has
tried on the role anyway. Since 1993, when he painted ``The Lost
Boys,'' which he considers his first mature painting, and had his
first solo exhibition in New York as well as one in Los Angeles,
his career has been in precipitous ascent, culminating last year in
his inclusion in the Whitney Biennial (after not making the cut two
years before) and the prestigious international exhibition
Documenta X in Kassel, Germany (where he was one of only three
artists to show paintings on canvas), as well his receipt of one of
the MacArthur Foundation's ``genius'' grants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Marshall's swift emergence and acceptance recalls that of
other 90s Wunderkinder like Matthew Barney and Jason Rhoades, the
difference is that he was not in his 20s but already nearing 40
when this happened, with a long period of quiet, steadfast
development to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to do something worthwhile in painting,'' he says,
``it takes a long time to get to the point where you're ready to do
it. You have to know the history, not just rhetorically but
materially, technically as well as philosophically. You have to
practice painting a lot to get that to work. But what makes it come
alive is the way you synthesize it with a bunch of other things
that come into it from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles in
1978, Marshall began working his way from Cubist-influenced
collages toward abstract painting and eventually a style that
included shadowy, schematic figures. He began to wonder, he says,
``what happens if I take that fragmented Cubist space and put back
everything the Cubists left out?'' _ a question that finally led to
the more fully fleshed-out imagery he uses now.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was also working in film as a production
designer, most notably for Julie Dash's ``Daughters of the Dust''
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering the long gestation that led to his
current work, Marshall bridles at critics who have overemphasized
its relation to outsider art, asserting instead his intention to
``operate inside the discourse of art-making but outside the art
world.''
</P>
<P>
   His portrayals of incongruously Edenic housing projects like
Nickerson Gardens in ``The Garden Project'' series in 1995, may
have had an air of folk art, but a closer look showed reminiscences
of the early Renaissance mixed with a broad range of modernist
strategies _ clearly the work of a broadly educated artist. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  ``If you look at what the art world is doing,'' Marshall says,
``you have a certain idea of what's valuable; in the moment, you
see a lot of things described as something _ the fact that somebody
used paint makes it a painting. But if you're interested in the
discourse of painting, that's not enough. There are other issues to
be dealt with to be part of the discourse of painting. I didn't
simply want to use paint. I wanted the work to be about painting.''
</P>
<P>
   But not just painting. ``I don't think an artist can do just one
thing,'' he continues. ``All the categories are traps _ painting,
sculpture, conceptual, landscape. What's really valuable is not in
any of these external modifiers, but in the relation you establish
between the medium or form and the concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there may be more of a contradiction than Marshall is
willing to admit between his desire to be seen ``not as `the
painter' but as an artist'' and his passion for the ``material
involvement in the process,'' which is so much more easily
fulfilled in a traditional medium like painting than in more
distanced, directorial modes like installations and video.
</P>
<P>
   In that light it is interesting that _ after Marshall has been
the object of so much attention from the news media over the last
few years _ the response to the Chicago showing of ``Mementos'' has
been surprisingly subdued.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer in the current issue of New Art Examiner, the
Chicago-based regional art magazine, observes that ``The works in
other media in this exhibition seem weaker than the paintings.'' As
a result, others have observed, the work's tone was unsettled, the
attitude conveyed toward its subject unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be that the artist has finally overreached himself, that
``more'' has finally become ``too much''? Marshall's step into the
realm of mixed-media installation could be an unproductive detour
or a fruitful expansion.

CHRIS ROCK THE FAMOUS IS THE SAME MAN AS CHRIS ROCK THE UNKNOWN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Rock might be ``the funniest man in America,'' but some of
us recall a rail-thin brother with a flattop fade, bug eyes and a
hearty appetite for racially inflammatory material. That was Rock
during his ``Saturday Night Live'' days, when he was just as sharp,
just as deep, just as promising, but when few would have noticed
had he left comedy and gone off to sell Slurpees at a 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   That was before his HBO show, of course, and before he stole the
show in this summer's ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' and before those
ubiquitous (but funny) 1-(800)-COLLECT commercials. Still, it's
astonishing to Rock that he has suddenly been anointed as the
standard-bearer of comedy; that now we're all laughing and bowing
our heads to a comic who seems to have jolted us out of our
otherwise humdrum lives.
</P>
<P>
   Read deeply into his slew of magazine articles, watch carefully
during his TV appearances, listen closely to what he says and
particularly what he DOESN'T say, and you'll come away with the
image of a young blood who deserves to swagger but is still a
little shaken that the world finally woke up and said, ``Oh, I get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock believes he's the same cat who created Nat X, the
politically strident talk-show host on SNL; the same brother who
responded to death threats against Tiger Woods with, ``Oh, he knows
he's black now;'' the same sharp observationist who opened his HBO
special by dumping on Washington's beloved Mayor Marion Barry and
its Million-Man March by quipping, ``Even in our finest hour, we've
got a crackhead on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are TV viewers unhip to an existing Chris
Rock talk show on HBO illustrates how under-the-radar Rock was just
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's ``The Chris Rock Show'' (the talker returns at
10:30 tonight with Johnnie Cochran) was a highlight reel of
enlightenment and laughs. (That Whoopi Goldberg tete-a-tete ranks
not only as my favorite interview, but tops among everything I
witnessed last season.)
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, this does include Jay Leno and David Letterman, who are in
such a fierce battle that their shows have become safe, bland,
boring and insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   With the leg room supplied by cable, Rock delves into territory
that Leno and Letterman are forbidden to touch, and I don't mean
playing fast-and-loose with obscenities. Cable plays to Rock's
strength as a conceptualist able to stay so firmly within the gray
areas that he's considered an equal-opportunity jokester.
Republicans think he's a Democrat, Democrats figure a Republican,
and black folks want to revoke his brother-down-for-the-cause
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing irked some blacks more than Rock's ``Vanity Fair''
article last month, with cover and inside photos showing him in
ashy white face. During an interview, Rock defends this by saying,
``I'm a comedian; it's a joke. Get over it,'' and later spewing a
few of those F-words to slam home the point.
</P>
<P>
   Rock and African-Americans have had a dicey relationship during
his anointment phase. It was fine when Rock's core audience was a
roomful of buppies, with whites merely invited to listen along.
Rules change when you're on mainstream magazines' covers and giant
cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   Black intellectuals, Rock is certain, don't like him, and have a
difficult time with comedy in general. They ``tend to overanalyze
show business,'' Rock says, ``and don't let the audience be an
audience. I mean, you have to be Dr. Martin Luther King in
everything you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian D.L. Hughley, with whom Rock is collaborating on an ABC
sitcom due next month, says pretty much the same thing. He's
already in defense mode about perceived stereotypes in his series
about a black family's migration to the white suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Rock's anointing began when he skewered
the Republicans at their 1996 convention as special correspondent
for Bill Maher's ``Politically Incorrect'' program, then on Comedy
Central. His most memorable dispatches came not in talking with
candidates but in his search for hair-care products, underlining
New Hampshire's less-than-diverse demographic.
</P>
<P>
   The metamorphosis was complete when Rock went off on the
difference between blacks and ``niggas'' in his now-infamous 1996
HBO special ``Bring the Pain.'' The black intelligentsia is sure
that's when white America decided to push him front and center,
seeing in him a black man saying what white folk want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Rock often appears irritated by the assertion that his
``acceptance'' means being brought along by a dominant culture able
to pick and choose its superstars. ``I'm no puppet for anybody,''
Rock says. ``Pleez, that would insult any comedian.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised with both parents in a low-income but established
Brooklyn neighborhood, Rock, 32, voices views that merely reflect a
childhood that was more conservative than many might think. Rock
often talks about the misconceptions about black Americans, meaning
not just media myths about welfare and crime, but also the
assertion that the average black person is a die-hard liberal when
it comes to, say, family values.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly out of the Rock context to ask on stage, ``Are there
any single parents in the house?'' and, if so, well, tell them to
go back home to their kids. Or to harp on some folks' acceptance of
antisocial behavior as legitimate black cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me old school,'' Rock says, ``but I still believe that
individual merit counts for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, the Rock anointing coincides with a smarter, wiser
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no control over who I'm reaching,'' Rock says. ``I just
have control over the kind of work I do. I'm a comic. I make people
laugh. To say that black people are hands-off is ludicrous. To say
black people are untouchable, that they shouldn't be criticized, is
unproductive. Are you telling me there are no crazy black people? I
meet them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks back, Rock was in Washington, D.C., to meet
with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, in
town for their 23rd annual convention. He came to boost a fledgling
undergraduate humor magazine he is helping finance at Howard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Rock talked proudly of wanting young black men and women to
think of comedy-writing, since that's where the money is. This
wasn't Rock the comedian, but Rock the brother down for the cause,
trying to stir some noise among the brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, he was talking to a group of black journalists far
more interested in their drinks and conversations. Rock talked
above the chatter for about 10 minutes before simply walking off,
frowning and groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Outside afterward, waiting for a car to whisk him way, the
anointed one shook his head, as if saying, I-told-you-so. ``Your
people,'' he says, looking off in disgust. ``Your people.''

MALAYSIAN PREMIER DISMISSES DEPUTY WHO DIFFERED ON ECONOMIC
POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CAMBODIA-UNREST) 
(nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ In a swift and politically brutal move,
Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, on Wednesday dismissed
his deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, who had opposed his
insular and free-spending economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 51, who was seen as the standard-bearer for a new and
more liberal generation of Asian leaders, became the latest
political casualty of the region's economic turmoil _ this time the
victim of a backlash by the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the government, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said he expected Anwar to be charged with sedition for
supposedly leaking government documents. Anwar was dismissed from
his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was told to resign,'' the informer said. ``He told the
prime minister, no way I'm going to resign. If you want to, you can
fire me and I'll defend myself in court.''
</P>
<P>
   The deputy was dismissed one day after the prime minister acted
to close off Malaysia's economy from the pressures of international
finance by making the currency, the ringgit, nonconvertible and
fixing its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   These steps, in turn, followed the introduction in July of a
stimulus package that overturned Anwar's tight fiscal policies by
lowering interest rates and boosting government spending on big,
expensive projects.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Anwar was already on the political defensive, his
position severely undermined by what was, by Malaysian standards, a
lurid back-room brawl.
</P>
<P>
   For the last six years, Anwar had been the heir apparent to the
72-year-old prime minister and had developed a broad political base
of his own. While Mahathir was a leading advocate of authoritarian
``Asian values,'' Anwar appeared more in tune with the Western
liberal tenets of open markets and the free flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The odd but successful coupling of their differing styles and
philosophies became strained over the last year as the economy
soured and as Mahathir rattled foreign investors with his attacks
on currency speculators, neocolonialists and Jews, all of whom he
said were trying to ruin Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was left to placate critics and at times to correct
Mahathir's statements, and his profile and popularity rose _
dangerously, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, at the annual general assembly of the ruling
party, Umno, Anwar's supporters tested their strength, bringing a
tentative challenge to Mahathir's leadership. One speech raised
accusations of corruption and nepotism _ code words drawn from the
opposition in Indonesia that successfully toppled former President
Suharto in May.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash was swift. The editors of Malaysia's two largest
newspapers, both allies of Anwar, were forced from their jobs. The
governor of the Central Bank and his deputy, also seen as close to
Anwar, stepped down in protest against the changes in economic
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's influence was severely undermined by the appointment of
his predecessor as finance minister, Daim Zainuddin, as a special
economic adviser to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   He was also politically wounded by a book filled with
unsubstantiated and sometimes fantastic allegations of sexual
impropriety titled, ``Fifty Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime
Minister.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the message and retreated from the limelight,
ostentatiously supporting Mahathir with statements like: ``Compared
to the prime minister I am just a student. I cannot fight my
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in Indonesia and other nations suffering through Asia's
economic crisis, political maneuvering, even by a master like
Mahathir, is no longer enough. Economic hardships, often subject to
forces beyond national borders, can force political change, as they
have already done in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Malaysia announced that it had fallen into its
first recession in 13 years, with its economy shrinking by close to
7 percent after a decade of growth of more than 8 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The construction sector _ a key barometer of economic health _
was down by 22 percent in the second quarter of the year, compared
with 12 percent growth in the corresponding period last year, the
Central Bank announced.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide unemployment rose to 6.7 percent in a country that
until recently had to import workers to fill its needs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the currency has lost 40 percent of its
value against the dollar and the stock market has lost 75 percent
of its total worth. More than 2,600 people are losing their jobs
every week, according to the Human Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's announcement of new foreign-exchange controls,
the government Wednesday fixed the exchange rate for the ringgit at
3.8 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said the moves might offer a short-term fix
but leave Malaysia with longer-term problems as investors steer
clear of an unpredictable economy. With reduced foreign investment,
they said, Malaysia is likely to have more difficulty reviving its
ailing banking system and pulling itself out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   With its economic and political hardships intensifying, Malaysia
began to move away from its months of pugnacious denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing reality now and saying the good old days will
not return,'' Daim said.

`RASPUTINA': HARD ROCK, WITH CELLOS AND CORSETS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JON PARELES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a world of rock bands, Rasputina is unique for its
combination of lineup _ three female cellists and a male drummer _
and costumes. At Shine on Tuesday night, the three women wore
corsets; two had elaborate lacy dresses, while the third proudly
displayed tattoos and a pierced lip.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed visual signals, part Marie-Antoinette and part metal,
carry over into Melora Creager's songs, which use the cellos for
punctilious chamber-music counterpoint and then switch to grunting
hard-rock chords, scraping the strings for distortion effects.
Above the cellos, she sings in a high voice with a metronomic
vibrato; between songs, she pouts, rolls her eyes and makes
pronouncements like, ``It was four score and seven years ago that
we last ventured out of doors to perform a recital.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, in other words, artifice aplenty; Rasputina and its
songs are mannerisms incarnate. But the songs are inseparable from
the mannerisms, existing in a zone of private obsessions and
associations. Ms. Creager writes about wayward characters and,
especially, women who have become grotesques, as in ``Transylvanian
Concubine,'' ``Leech Wife'' or ``Diamond Mind,'' in which she
trades her usual lifted-pinky tone for a heavy Long Island accent
to demand a diamond from her hapless mate while the cellos play
genial opera buffa lines. The songs are elaborate constructions,
like Gothic reliquaries, holding shards of emotion. Within the
Satie-like suspended chords of ``Signs of the Zodiac,'' she sings
to someone who's dying, ``Oh honey, I know it hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasputina is admirable for its sheer waywardness. Its peculiar
instrumentation and showmanship fit songs that putter around the
odd corners of 20th century life, quizzical and heartfelt and
comic. At Shine, they played Lesley Gore's hit ``You Don't Own Me''
as an encore, and they lived up to it. &QL;

U.N. REPORT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT SMALL LOANS TO THE POOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A report from Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
U.N. members this week sounds a cautionary note about the rush to
small-scale bank lending _ known as microcredit _ as an easy cure
for world poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``A certain sense of proportion regarding microcredit would seem
to be in order,'' says the report to the 185-nation General
Assembly, which begins its 53rd session next week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, more than 3,000 small financial institutions,
mostly in developing countries, have pioneered the system of
lending small amounts of money, usually $100 or less, to people
with little or no collateral to enable them to start small
enterprises. A large percentage of the recipients of these loans
are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could allow them,'' the report says, ``to be more
self-reliant, create employment opportunities and, not least,
engage women in economically productive activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The best known of these financial institutions is the Grameen
Bank of Bangladesh, which has lent more than $2.1 billion to more
than 2 million people. While microcredit is most common in Asia,
there are many similar institutions in Latin America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-poverty groups in the United States have also
advocated the introduction of the system in poor urban
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary-general's report raises several warnings. The
report, which includes summaries of what U.N. departments are doing
along with nongovernmental organizations and some governments, says
professional studies of microcredit are beginning to challenge the
claims made by some institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of follow-up work, experts say, it is hard to
check the rates of repayment being claimed by proponents or to
assess the impact of many microcredit programs. The costs to the
borrower can also be steeper than they appear at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many developing countries,'' the report says, ``overall
interest rates are relatively high to begin with, so that the rates
charged by microlending schemes are quite high when a risk premium
is added. Furthermore, it is not clear if the extent to which
microcredit has spread, or can potentially spread, can make a major
dent in world poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   It adds that the World Bank _ the U.N. agency now coordinating
many microcredit programs _ has allocated only $218 million for
small loans. To reach the target of 100 million families by 2005
set by proponents of microcredit would require $2.5 billion more.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that microcredit projects are limited in
their effect to reduce poverty in the long term unless they are
accompanied by other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microcredit should be viewed as complementary to the provision
of basic services like education, housing, health and nutrition,''
it says. ``The latter are indispensable in the fight against
poverty.''

KENTUCKIANS WIN BID TO SAVE CALUMET TROPHIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ A grass-roots campaign in Kentucky to
save the Calumet Farm's racing trophies from being dispersed to
help pay the farm's debt was declared a success Wednesday when no
other bidders surfaced to meet the home-state bid of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The treasures include 536 trophies, plates and julep cups and 40
paintings amassed between 1934 and 1982, when Calumet horses were
winning 148 stakes races and $26.4 million in purses. The spoils
were destined to be included in the estate's assets when the farm
went bankrupt, but a group led by James Bassett organized the fight
to keep them in their old Kentucky home. They have been enshrined
since 1982 at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, where Calumet
Farm once spread over 900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, banded as the Save the Calumet Trophies Committee,
raised $1.2 million in private donations from 44 states and three
foreign countries, plus $1.5 million from the state of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The New York auction house Guernsey established a deadline of
Aug. 31 for bids to be entered for the collection and, when it
passed Monday, nine inquiries had been made but no serious bids
were in sight. So, the committee's offer of $2.7 million was
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be done, it's part of our racing legacy,'' said
Bassett, chairman of the Keeneland Race Course and former chairman
of the Breeders' Cup. ``It would have been a travesty, a tragedy
and an embarrassment to the community, the state and the racing
industry to permit the dissolution of this magnificent
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   4 Months Out for Smith
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith was still listed in fair condition but was resting
comfortably at Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center, and was expected to be
released Friday. But he will not resume riding for perhaps four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old jockey suffered two fractured vertebrae in his
upper back when his horse was trapped in traffic during an
allowance race and flipped him into the hedges lining the grass
course at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``A body cast will be placed on him later today or tomorrow,''
reported Jim Smith, a spokesman for the hospital. ``He is still
lying on his back, but he's in good spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Edwin Cotto, the jockey whose horse started the chain
reaction of bumping that led to the spill, was suspended for 30
days by the stewards at Saratoga for ``grossly careless riding.''
He appealed the suspension, and was riding Wednesday, pending a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away Off to Belmont
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine and Skip Away were back at their Saratoga barn after
their close call in the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park in New
Jersey last Saturday. But the trainer said his superstar horse was
``feeling good'' and would leave Thursday for Belmont Park to
continue his campaign for fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, carrying 131 pounds, was forced to dig in and rally
in the homestretch to beat back Stormin Fever, who was carrying
118. The 5-year-old gray champion rallied just enough to win by a
nose for his eighth straight stakes victory and to raise his career
earnings to $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race didn't take too much out of him,'' Hine said. ``He's
actually fresh and ready to race. I think he will move forward from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine said that Skip Away would resume training next Thursday for
the $500,000 Woodward at a mile and an eighth on Sept. 19. Older
horses carry 126 pounds and 3-year-olds, 121.
</P>
<P>
   Storms Cancels Saranac
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga has been blessed with a season of generally dry and
beautiful weather, but the good times came to an end late Wednesday
when thunderstorms with heavy lightning struck the area and flooded
the track.
</P>
<P>
   So, after keeping the horses for the ninth race, the Saranac
Handicap, waiting in the paddock until the lightning subsided,
track officials decided to cancel the ninth and 10th races in the
interests of safety.
</P>
<P>
   No replacement date for the Saranac was announced. &QL;

AT THIRD WORLD MEETING, HOPES FOR CONGO PEACE RISE AND FALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Hopes for a cease-fire in Congo were
quickly raised and as quickly dashed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, all parties to the war appeared at the meeting of
Non-Aligned Nations here, including President Laurent Kabila of the
Congo, who flew in unexpectedly at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of potential movement toward peace, the
U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, here for the meeting, scheduled
meetings with several of the leaders involved in the war.
</P>
<P>
   And Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa said twice
Wednesday that he was ``certain'' there would be a cease-fire in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day wore on the few public remarks made by the
warring parties became increasingly belligerent and diplomats
seemed discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, who has sent troops to Congo to
fight on the government's side, alongside those from Zimbabwe and
Angola, was one of the opening speakers at the meeting, and said
his men ``would leave when the job is done to the satisfaction of
the government of the Congo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust the summit will endorse this position,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila spoke late in the day, in the part of the program in
which 86 national leaders are each allotted seven minutes to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing Nujoma's slot, he spoke volubly, rapidly and in florid
prose, baiting the Tutsi and accusing the Rwandan and Ugandan
armies, his former partners in the overthrow of the Zairian
dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, of assassination, rape and using
children as cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I request from your august assembly an unequivocal
condemnation and a demand for the withdrawal of these aggressors
from our territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their words were in stark contrast to the pacific tones taken by
the two senior statesmen at the summit, President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa and Annan. Annan referred to the Congo war in his
address, saying: ``My brother African leaders, I appeal to you once
again. We Africans must summon the will to resolve our problems by
political, not military, means. For every day that we fail to do
so, the innocent people of this continent pay a terrible price.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila did not meet face-to-face with anyone from Rwanda or
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has dared suggest it,'' said Bin Karubi Kikaya, one of
his spokesmen. Instead, he met with a diverse list of summit
dignitaries, including Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo itself, the capital, Kinshasa, was returning to normal.
Last week, a rebel attempt to move in on the capital failed, and
many of the attackers were captured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, electricity was sporadic, as it has been in recent
weeks, and a curfew remained in force, but the roadblocks that had
filled the city for several days last week were almost all gone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels still control the eastern parts of the country and
the central city of Kisangani, and are pushing toward the south.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed to hold Kalemie, near Lake Tanganyika, and to be
moving toward Kabila's birthplace, Moba, in Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Wednesday that its troops had encircled the
rebels near the lake, but little is known about what is really
happening in the southern region because there are no sources of
information independent of the rebels and the government.

MARKETS MIXED IN SLUGGISH TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two days of a frenzied selloff and a partial
recovery, stock prices were broadly mixed Wednesday in
comparatively sluggish trading Wednesday. But few analysts were
prepared to predict that the reverberations from the market's
recent steep slide have ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than 100 points
early in the day, building on Tuesday's 288-point gain. But the
run-up, coupled with a big drop in transportation stocks, persuaded
some investors to once again move to the sidelines as the closing
bell neared. The late selling helped push the Dow down 45.06 points
at the close, or 0.6 percent, at 7,782.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``From its lows on Tuesday to its highs Wednesday the market was
up 550 Dow points,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at
A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``There was some buying fatigue, and
there were bound to be a few second thoughts after the blood
letting on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indexes also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poors 500-stock
index dipped 3.78 points, down 0.4 percent, to 990.48. The Big
Board's composite index slipped 1.30, or 0.3 percent, to 494.63,
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq composite index posted a healthy gain, bolstered
by rising prices for favorites like Dell Computer and Cisco
Systems, as well as recently battered Internet stocks like Yahoo
and Amazon.Com. The Nasdaq rose 17.76, or 1.13 percent, to 1592.85.
The Russell 2000 index of small stocks rose 4.55, or 1.3 percent,
to 352.65,
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Tuesday's session, the busiest in its history,
trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was relatively light,
with just over 896 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case on Tuesday, buying seemed to be concentrated in
sectors that have been severely battered since mid-July, when the
Dow peaked at 9,337. And while some said the steep decline had
brought equity prices down to more reasonable levels, analysts said
the market's problems are not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that August of 1998 was the worst month
in the market since October of 1987, and one of the ten worst
months since the 1927 crash,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure we will have a firm grip on what is going on
here for another week or two, because things are still too
emotional for institutional and individual investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., said that ``back in mid-July, the equity market
was priced for a perfect outcome. But we are not living in a
perfect world now. Still, the dramatic declines we have seen since
the peak has readjusted prices to the point where the market is a
more robust and resilient animal than it was in July.''
</P>
<P>
   After severely punishing financial service stock prices over
fears about third quarter earnings repercussions of trading losses
in international markets, including Russia and Asia, investors
began to move back into those stocks Wednesday. Cliggott said those
fears have been largely assuaged because firms have been timely in
informing investors where they stand.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading Wednesday, stocks of big brokerages like
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette all posted gains.
</P>
<P>
   Among major money center banks, Citicorp rose $2.13, to 108.75;
Bankers Trust was up $0.38, to $73.50; and BancAmerica was up
$1.25, to $65.75.
</P>
<P>
   Still, worries about the health of international economies
continued to plague any number of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which derives roughly 70 percent of its revenue and
75 percent of its profits from overseas operations, fell $4, to
$64.25. And Proctor &AMP; Gamble dropped $1.09, to $78.41.
</P>
<P>
   James Higgins, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said
concern about airline stocks with significant international
exposure was a big reason for the day's big 52-point drop in the
Dow transportation index.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of major carriers, which have sustained heavy price
declines since July, were hammered again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines fell $6, to $97.41. AMR Corp. lost $3.09, to
$52.09. And UAL Corp. dropped $1.13, to $61.88.
</P>
<P>
   Among important Nasdaq stocks, Dell Computer rose $1.88, to
$110.25. Cisco Systems closed at $91.63, up $1.63. But Intel fell
by $1.13 a share, to $74.88. And Microsoft dipped $0.34, to
$100.28. Yahoo surged 5{, to 77}, and Amazon.com rose 7 59/64, to
87~.

CAMBODIAN POWER STRUGGLE ESCALATES OMINOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodia's parliamentary election more
than a month ago was only the opening round in a struggle for power
that is pushing the nation toward a chaotic and possibly violent
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The newly elected National Assembly is scheduled to open in
three weeks, but that date now seems to amount to a deadline for a
face-off among three bitter rivals who split the electoral vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 days, thousands of protesters have filled a park
in Phnom Penh, putting up blue plastic tents, digging latrines,
eating banana-flower salad and prawn cakes and holding constant
rallies to denounce the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbent strongman and official winner of the election, Hun
Sen, first threatened to evict them, then promised nonviolence, but
the protests carry an air of menace. Reporters listening to the
speeches stay at a safe distance on a nearby rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's two challengers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, who are usually bitter rivals, have joined forces to lead
the protests. They insist that they will block the formation of a
new government unless election irregularities are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father but not necessarily
his supporter _ has opened an attempt to broker an agreement, but
there is no sign now of compromise among the feuding politicians.
</P>
<P>
   When the final election results were announced Tuesday,
confirming the preliminary count released a month ago, they were
almost irrelevant. The battle lines had already been drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The official tally gave Hun Sen's formerly Communist Cambodian
People's Party the victory with 41 percent of the vote. Prince
Ranariddh's royalist party won 32 percent, Sam Rainsy's party won
14 percent, and the rest was scattered among 36 tiny parties.
</P>
<P>
   This outcome was a blueprint for unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the election was fundamentally acceptable, as some
experts have concluded, or whether it was fatally flawed by its
many irregularities, as others insist, its official outcome gives
nobody a convincing win.
</P>
<P>
   Under a complicated formula that is one of the chief issues of
protest, Hun Sen's 41 percent of the vote gives him a majority of
seats in the assembly: 64 out of 122.
</P>
<P>
   This falls short of the two-thirds needed to form a government
and means that Hun Sen must persuade at least one of his rivals to
join him in a coalition. But it is enough to prevent these rivals
from joining to form their own governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   If the formula was replaced by an earlier version, as the two
opposition parties demand, they would together have the majority
and could seek to form a government that excludes Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   They are also demanding a review of the vote tabulation, which
was controlled by Hun Sen's backers, and a new vote in the most
questionable districts.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has invited both opposition parties to join him in a
coalition government but insisted on controlling all the key posts.
The man most likely to accept the offer is the Prince, who may be
using the protests to enhance his bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
   But a Western diplomat said the protests might already have gone
too far to allow the prince to back away from them and join Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
   The protests gained additional credence, even among some who do
not support them, when the National Election Committee and the
Constitutional Council that is the court of last resort _ both of
which are packed by Hun Sen supporters _ refused on Monday to
investigate the complaints of the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leads some people, including some foreign diplomats, to
wonder if some funny things are going on,'' a European diplomat
said. ``Why is it so complicated to check back a few things and
defuse the protest?''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts say Sam Rainsy, who is leading the challenges,
has failed to present a coherent and compelling case that the
accumulation of irregularities and intimidation are enough to
nullify the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The ``idealists'' here argue that even before it was held, the
election was invalidated by Hun Sen's ouster of his co-premier,
Prince Ranariddh, in a coup in 1997 and by scores of political
killings and a campaign of intimidation that followed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``realists'' say that the election, with all its flaws, was
as clean and fair as could be expected in a country torn apart by
violence for nearly three decades and that its official outcome
broadly reflects the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Kassie Neou, a respected human rights advocate who resigned from
the election committee in protest last month, nevertheless
supported the outcome in a statement published this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skeptics were wrong about the Cambodian elections,'' he
wrote. ``Although marred to some extent by pre-election violence,
intimidation and lack of full media access to the opposition, the
elections themselves were conducted according to international
standards for free and fair polls.''
</P>
<P>
   He said charges of election irregularities should be
investigated, but added: ``It is vital that the Cambodian people
and the international community accept the election results as
legitimate. If not, there will be trouble ahead for the new
government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cambodia does not have a tradition of good losers. Instead,
it has a tradition of bitter personal rivalries whose roots go back
decades. For many of the contestants, a democratic election here is
just one element to be exploited in these rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who are caught up in such long-drawn-out
historical struggles and who don't have the means or the interest
to try to compromise,'' a Western expert with long experience in
Cambodia said, insisting that his name not be used. ``They are
impelled in good part by ego, and they keep struggling no matter
what the cost to the Cambodian people.''

US PANEL BACKS APPROVAL OF BREAST CANCER DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cautiously opening the door to a new approach to lessening the
toll of breast cancer, an advisory panel Wednesday recommended that
the government approve the use of the drug tamoxifen for healthy
women at at high risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement was a tentative one, however, because of its
side effects and the lack of proof that the drug, sold as Nolvadex,
actually prevents the cancer, rather than just delaying it for a
short time. Specialists are still questioning whether the delay
offsets the danger from the side effects, which include a higher
risk of endometrial cancer and blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Given these concerns, Boston specialists said they would not
rush to recommend tamoxifen for healthy women until more data is
available on its long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even know who should get it,'' said Dr. Steven Come,
director of the hematology-oncology units at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. To address that problem, the National Cancer
Institute said it will soon make available at no cost a computer
CD-ROM _ known as a ``risk disk'' _ that that will help patients
and their doctors assess each woman's individual cancer risk and
guide the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration was
also expected Wednesday night to recommend approval of Herceptin, a
new-generation genetically engineered drug that offers hope to some
women who face a poor prognosis because their breast cancer has
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin, made by Genentech, Inc., of South San Francisco, is a
monoclonal antibody that shuts down abnormal growth signals found
in about 30 percent of breast cancer cells. In studies, the drug
has shown impressive results against advanced breast cancer when
combined with standard chemotherapy drugs like Taxol.
</P>
<P>
   Both Herceptin and tamoxifen had been given ``fast-track''
status at the FDA because of their promise in as new weapons
against breast cancer, which strikes more than 180,000 women each
year and kills about 44,000. The FDA usually follows the
recommendations of its advisory panels: final approval could some
before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen, sold as Nolvadex by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, has been
used for 25 years to treat breast cancer and has been shown to
sharply reduce the chances that a woman with breast cancer will
develop it in the other breast.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that it can prevent a first cancer in healthy women
came in April, when data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project, a government-funded research study, showed that
tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer by 45 percent, compared
to a placebo, in high-risk women.
</P>
<P>
   That trial was stopped early when the significant benefit became
clear, and critics said that made it impossible to tell how long
the preventive effect would last. Moreover, the study revealed a
slighly higher risk of endometrial cancer, and of thromboses, or
blood clots, in deep veins or the lungs in women taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca filed an application to market tamoxifen as a preventive.
</P>
<P>
   The drug acts by protecting breast cells from the
growth-stimulating effects of the hormone estrogen. In the national
study, women who took tamoxifen for five years had fewer breast
cancers, but none had been followed for more than three or four
years when the trial was stopped. Panel members argued that the
drug might only be delaying the development of cancers _ a benefit
that might not be worth the added risks.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leslie Ford, a cancer prevention official at the NCI, hailed
the panel's decision, saying, ``I think it's incredibly significant
that it's the first recommendation of a drug for reducing the risk
of breast cancer in a group of women known to be at high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it matters whether you call it reduction
of risk or prevention,'' Ford added in a telephone interview. ``It
just depends on what time period you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCI has estimated that as many as 29 million US women have
the same level of breast cancer risk as the women who benefited
from tamoxifen in the study. Age _ being over 60 _ is the biggest
risk factor for the great majority of those women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is going to be a lasting benefit'' from
tamoxifen ``at least in a subgroup of women,'' said Dr. Irene
Kuter, chair of the breast clinical committee at Massachusetts
General Hospital. But she said that many women may opt to wait
until safer risk-reducing drugs become available. One of them,
called raloxifene, will be compared to tamoxifen in a trial
beginning later this year or early in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision on Herceptin appeared to be much more
straightforward, because the drug has proven remarkably free of
side effects and has brought a new kind of weapon to the treatment
of advanced breast cancer. Herceptin is the first of an expected
flood of drugs designed to attack specific molecules on cancer
cells while sparing normal cells from damage.
</P>
<P>
   In research trials reported last April, Herceptin combined with
standard chemotherapy halted or shrank cancer in 49 percent of
women with metastatic tumors, compared with 32 percent who had only
the chemotherapy. The responses lasted for an average of 9.3 months
in the Herceptin group, compared to 5.9 months in the chemotherapy
alone group. A small number of desperately ill women have had
long-term responses.
</P>
<P>
   Kuter at MGH said that in about a dozen patients treated
experimentally there, ``I've seen some pretty impressive
responses'' including one woman whose large tumors ``melted away.''
She is ``still doing fine'' after almost two years, Kuter added.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is in short supply, but Genentech has expanded a
lottery program to make it available to women whose cancer has not
responded to other treatments.
</P>
<P>
   If the FDA gives final approval to Herceptin this year, as
expected, Genentech will be able to expand production to meet the
anticipated market, said Marie Kennedy, a company spokeswoman, in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   She said the increased supply will make possible new clinical
trials to test whether Herceptin can be even more effective when
given at earlier stages of breast cancer.

ADVERTISING: DOWN WITH `DISABILITY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If in marketing parlance a used car is pre-owned, toilet paper
is bathroom tissue and the elderly are mature, why not bolster the
image of a provider of individual disability insurance by
describing its primary product as income protection plans?
</P>
<P>
   That's the idea behind television commercials and print
advertisements, scheduled to begin appearing on Monday, for
Provident Cos. Spending will total more than $10 million between
now and the end of the year with a planned annual budget of $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which carries the theme ``Protecting everything
you work for,'' is the first from Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York
since the agency was awarded the Provident account in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the lead in educating consumers about this
form of insurance, for which there has been limited public
awareness,'' said J. Harold Chandler, chairman, president and chief
executive at Provident in Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a mistake as an industry in not pursuing a broad
market,'' he added, ``by pursuing only a very narrow market segment
of the upscale and not professionals, managers and middle-income
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Provident's push to pitch makes sense because it is the largest
American insurance company specializing in coverage of doctors,
dentists and others who can't work as a result of injury or
illness. Stimulate interest in the product, the thinking goes, and
that will benefit Provident's sales.
</P>
<P>
   As for the use of income protection, Chandler said: ``We're poor
marketers as reflected by the name given the product. After all,
life insurance is death insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler provided a preview of the campaign at a meeting last
week in midtown Manhattan where he was joined by executives of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The term disability insurance ``in itself has been a
roadblock,'' said Jennifer Laing, chairwoman and chief executive
for the North American operations of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, a unit of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer research conducted by the agency with
psychologists, Ms. Laing said, the word disability ``conjures up
images of bodily injury and loss, which create feelings of fear,
concern and anxiety _ and talking about insurance in that context
gets you nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But re-express it as `income protection,''' she added, ``and
that's the best advertising route in. It means a paycheck, power,
protecting that which is important to you, giving you control,
independence, self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that the campaign is starting on Monday,
Labor Day, Chandler said, because Provident wants ``to celebrate
those we seek to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are self-selecting those we think make good customers:
Those who honor work,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial shows rosy vignettes of office and factory workers
that would not have been out of place in a spot from the original
``Miller time'' campaign for Miller High Life beer or the campaign
for rival Budweiser that carried the theme ``For all you do, this
Bud's for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Provident commercial unfolds, an announcer intones: ``We
Americans have a funny thing about work. We actually like it. We do
a good job, even when no one is watching. We linger long after the
clock says to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we get much more out of work than a paycheck,'' the
announcer asserts. ``But the paycheck feels pretty good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is of course where Provident is meant to come in,
according to the spot, because with disability insurance _ sorry,
income protection _ ``if you're ever sick or hurt and can't work,''
the announcer says, ``the money keeps coming in along with any help
you need so you can get back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   People ``would rather be working than not working,'' said Tod
Seisser, chief creative officer at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, adding:
``They define who they are by what they do. Certainly the people
we're talking to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also addressed in the print ads. One, for instance,
carries this inquisitive headline: ``If you couldn't work, what
would you miss most? The camaraderie? The challenge? The
adrenaline? The paycheck?'' The text declares that `Most people
would say `All of the above.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another print ad asks ``What did you make at work today? A tough
decision? A hard sale? A better mousetrap? A paycheck?'' The text
reads: ``Whatever it was, keep up the good work. You're just the
kind of person that Provident income protection plans are designed
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are to run during ``60 Minutes'' and coverage of
football and baseball games and the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
The print ads are to appear in such consumer magazines as Fast
Company, Forbes, Inc., Money, Newsweek and Time as well as in trade
publications for insurance agents and benefit managers like
Employee Benefit News and National Underwriter.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Were it not for the time-consuming and
costly efforts of Phoenix City Council, the good citizens of our
community would have no concept of the important work performed for
us by people like ``Jesse.'' I didn't realize it myself until

   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ During these pogo stick days on Wall
Street, Stanley Walker, a retired mechanic with a good chunk of his
life savings in the stock market, has thought once or twice about
his boyhood in the Depression years.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no desire to have pockets so empty, as his own father
did, that Sunday dinner means pig tails and sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it time to pull the rip cord?'' Walker, 77, nervously asked
his broker on Monday, as the market dived 500 points, before making
its strong rebound. ``I like to be able to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   His broker told him to relax. And Walker, who did not sell a
single stock, is trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some jitters, there is no panic on Main Street this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are becoming old veterans at this,'' said Doug Reese, a
broker here for Edward Jones. ``They've been through all of this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most of America, the stock market has become everybody's
game in this pleasant Iowa courthouse town. Inside the Muddy Waters
coffee shop, people were echoing all of the financial analyst
cliches _ the economy's strong fundamentals, great buying
opportunities and, of course, the importance of ``staying in for
the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have even become a bit blase about the market's
gyrations. Mark Engle, a 44-year-old high school Russian teacher,
kicked his boots up on a chair and rattled Wednesday morning's
edition of the Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
   On the front page, there was a cartoon about Wall Street that
showed a bunch of little chickens screaming about a falling sky,
with a frightened looking bull. But Engle skipped right past the
stories about the market. He turned, instead, to the sports section
to read about Mark McGwire, the home run king who is having a much
better year than the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' said Engle, who lets the managers of his
pension plan worry about stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the market has hit plenty of home runs in recent years for
people in this town of 26,000, about 40 miles northeast of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains allowed Barb Collins to retire from a factory
job at age 64, vacation in France, England and Italy and take a
cruise to the island of Crete. She even has a vacation home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   To people like Mrs. Collins, now 63, who was pushing her
one-year-old grandson, Ariaus, in a stroller on this sunny day,
complaining about a bumpy stretch of road on an otherwise
magnificent run, would seem a bit greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you do have to keep on top of things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, she checks the Register for the prices of her
stocks and mutual funds, and watches one of the financial
television networks just about every day.
</P>
<P>
   During the steep drop on Monday, however, she was at her
vacation home, taking a respite from the news. Late that afternoon,
she climbed into a boat to fish for walleye with some friends. One
of them asked, with an ominous tone, ``So, what about this stock
market?''
</P>
<P>
   She confessed to some anxious moments, but never considered
selling off her stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It helps calm the nerves to recall scary days in the stock
market's recent past. Best of all, the big jump in stock prices on
Tuesday showed there is still confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on Main Street are not traders, but investors,'' said
Reese, the stock broker, noting that people who hold their cards
usually end up with a strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   DyAnne Henry, 49, who owns an embroidery shop, ``In Stitches,''
said the stock market was a lot like life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have some highs and you have some lows,'' she said,
between bites of pancakes at Monica's coffee shop. ``But if you
have patience and keep the faith, everything mellows out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general buoyancy, however, Reese noted that some
nettlesome developments have given investors some uneasy moments.
Besides the economic crisis in Asia and the political turmoil in
Russia, there is the specter of a weakened President Clinton,
tarnished after acknowledging that he misled the public about his
relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a place like Iowa, which exports plenty of grain and
agriculture-related machinery, among other goods, a crisis halfway
around the globe can come home to roost in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to economics, Iowa is by no means isolated,''
said Engle, the Russian teacher. ``How we do depends a great deal
on how people in other countries are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mueller, a 47-year-old insurance salesman who sported a blue
blazer and a deep tan, expressed few worries about the strength of
the American economy. He had doubt about President Clinton's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but think he's not the same leader that he was
four or five weeks ago,'' said Mueller, who got up early today to
watch Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on television.
``He doesn't come across as being so confident anymore. Is that
going to hurt our standing around the world?''
</P>
<P>
   In general, people did not seem to think Clinton's problems
would hurt the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Making a connection between the Washington soap opera and the
profits at Fortune 500 companies seemed, at least to someone like
69-year-old Shirley Duffy, ``a bit of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Duffy, who operates tours for Iowans to places like Nova
Scotia, Alaska and New York, said she was not going to take a penny
out of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Wallace Duffy, became alarmed during a
sudden downturn two years ago, and shifted much of their holdings
to fixed-income accounts. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned our lesson, so we're going to sit tight,'' said
Mrs. Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Reese and other stock brokers have been talking to customers
about the silver lining in any downturn. For much of the past few
years, he had been trying to damp down expectations of investors,
many of whom expected whopping gains in a matter of weeks. Now with
prices on many stocks down 15 to 20 percent compared to a few
months ago, Reese has been encouraging investors to think about
adding to their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   John Kraft, a 38-year-old painter, said he would like to jump
into the market, but will not, out of respect to his wife's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She doesn't like the idea,'' he explained, ``that you can end
the day with less money than you had yesterday.''

STOCK PRICES RISE AND FALL, AND THAT'S THAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, MARKET-BROKERS, MARKET-SMALL-TOWN) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are plunging stock prices a harbinger of economic crisis? Paul
Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics, once quipped that stock
market declines had anticipated nine of the previous five
recessions.
</P>
<P>
   That impish caution from decades ago has been updated by Peter
Temin, a colleague of Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. After examining every recession this century, he
concludes that only a minor downturn, in 1903, was caused by
falling stock prices. Some recessions were caused by
anti-inflationary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Others
were caused by external events, like the oil price shocks in the
1970s. Even the Great Depression of the 1930s did not stem from
plummeting stock prices. Chalk that horror up to persistent policy
blunders here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   History does not necessarily repeat itself. But the nearly
unblemished record is a sobering counterpoint to breezy speculation
this week about recession, rising unemployment and other economic
woes that could follow the recent plunge on Wall Street. On Monday,
the broad market gauge lost more than 7 percent of its value,
leaving it down nearly 20 percent from its peak in July.
</P>
<P>
   Though no forerunner of recession, stock market plunges can
nevertheless slow an economy. Consumers react to their shrunken
wealth by cutting purchases. Companies, fearful of uncertainty and
forced to issue a larger number of (lower-priced) shares to raise
any given amount of money, react by cutting investment outlays. It
is possible, then, that a stock market crash could tip an economy
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   But that leap would occur only after a sharp decline and then
only under certain conditions. A back-of-the-envelope calculation
shows why a stock drop the size of the one in the last couple of
weeks is unlikely to do serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   American stocks are worth about $10 trillion; in recent weeks,
their value has fallen about $1 trillion. Economists estimate that
consumers cut back spending by about 4 cents for every dollar of
wealth they lose. So a trillion-dollar stock market plunge would
cause about a $40 billion drop in annual consumer spending, about
one-half percent of total spending. Professor Benjamin Friedman of
Harvard University points out that it ordinarily takes a spending
cut four times that size to bring on a recession.
</P>
<P>
   A $40 billion cut in consumer spending could produce a downturn
in an already-stagnant economy. But this economy is strong, with
consumer spending and business investment growing briskly in the
first half of the year. Besides, consumers may not cut back
spending even as much as these estimates suggest because many might
not react to a drop in paper wealth from recent sky-high levels
they never regarded as secure. Consumers did not rush out the
minute the Dow hit 9,300 to order a new yacht, nor will they cancel
the family vacation because of a possibly temporary fall below
8,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the argument sounds Pollyanna-ish, consider what was wrought
by October 1987, when the market plunged by more than 20 percent in
one day. Main Street _ national output and jobs _ barely noticed,
though some regions, like New York City, were hit hard. The economy
is more resilient today than it was 11 years ago. Inflation,
interest rates and unemployment are low. Bank reserves are high.
The Federal Reserve could readily fight off recession by pumping up
the money supply without fear of igniting inflation or making other
smoldering problems worse.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Fed, under its chairman, Alan Greenspan, did in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is one problem today that Greenspan did not face in
1987. Asia is mired in recession, and financial crises plague
Russia and threaten Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some economists and market watchers called this week for
the Fed to set domestic monetary policy with an eye toward the
plight of the country's trading partners, perhaps nudging rates
down even if the American economy needs no such help.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates would ease the debt burden of foreigners
who have borrowed in dollars. Lower rates would also permit the
dollar to fall on foreign exchange markets, pulling down currencies
tied to the dollar. That would help those countries bolster export
sales. And, the argument goes, if a Fed easing helps Asia and other
beleaguered regions recover, then the United States will eventually
reap the benefit of trading with prosperous partners.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's easy to call on the Fed to take global factors
into account, federal law and good sense dictate that Fed policy
follow home-grown events. Friedman cautions against having the Fed
tailor its policies to foreign borrowing practices or exchange rate
policies. Professor Alan Blinder of Princeton, a former vice
chairman of the Fed, says the impact of Fed policy on foreign
economies is neither huge nor certain.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on Fed easing to help the domestic economy by
bolstering foreign economies is to rely on a speculative chain of
events that provides no sure guide to policy. Economists agree that
the Fed needs to factor foreign demand for exports into its
projections about the domestic economy. Blinder can imagine times
when the Fed would decide to ease because of weakness abroad even
though it was otherwise wavering between cutting rates and staying
pat. But almost always, the Fed's focus must be domestic needs
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The important point, on which monetary experts agree, is that
the Fed's monetary weapons are powerful enough to keep the American
economy in line, short of financial catastrophe abroad. The Fed can
pump up domestic spending by making it easier to borrow. Any
shortfall in foreign demand for American products can be offset by
additional American purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers point out that plummeting stock prices could spook
the international currency and capital markets, leading to a
self-fulfilling pessimism among consumers and investors. From there
the story turns to worldwide downturn and even deflation
reminiscent of the 1930s. But few economists find that story
compelling. They point out that a lot of stock investments are tied
up in retirement and pension accounts and will not be dumped the
minute the markets turn sour. Besides, investors who lived through
the carnage in 1987 are secure they can ride out the next nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to exaggerate the impact of dramatic events like
this week's stock market volatility. But consider that even at this
week's low, stock prices were about where they were in January _
and well above the levels at the end of 1996 that Greenspan warned
were irrationally high.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, rather than soaring beyond 9,000 in July and swooning
to 7,500 in August, the Dow had merely moseyed its way on an even
track for eight months at what were widely perceived to be high
levels. Would any of us be wringing our hands over a recessionary
blow to the American economy that could reverberate across
international borders? Stock prices rise and fall and, as Samuelson
taught us 30 years ago, that's that.

MAGNETS BECOMING PAR FOR THE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AL BARKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The magnetic personality is taking on an alternative meaning in
referring to tour golfers. It suggests not only the ineffable
charisma of an Arnold Palmer, but the obvious pain-free ease with
which Jim Colbert wins tournaments on the Senior PGA Tour.
Actually, Colbert is one of many tour golfers using magnets, along
with athletes from other sports, including Dan Marino and Jimmy
Connors, and even some race horses.
</P>
<P>
   Using magnets as pain therapy goes back to ancient China, to
Cleopatra (the lodestone on her forehead), to the early days of
Sears and Roebuck (women's corsets). The practice has recently
caught on anew to the tune of some $500 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   How does magnetic therapy work, if indeed it does? To put it as
simply as possible, when negative magnetic energy is applied to a
pain-ridden area, it stimulates the body to increase the flow of
blood and oxygen to the area, which thereby relieves the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets for pain relief is not approved by the Federal Drug
Administration, but neither have they been banned. The magnet
therapy industry just cannot claim proven therapeutic value,
because there is no hard science that says magnets relieve pain.
However, this question is being addressed as never before. Rigorous
double-blind tests by Carlos Vallbona, former chairman of the
department of community medicine at Baylor University, brought
results released in 1997 that convinced a hitherto highly skeptical
Dr. William Jarvis, president of the National Council Against
Health Fraud, to give magnetic therapy a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetherapy Inc., manufacturer of the Tectonic line of magnets
that Colbert uses, is also spending a reported $10 million in
annual sales to prove the worth of magnets as painkillers. The
results of a study on the use of magnets in the treatment of
fibromyalgia, a painful muscle disorder of unknown cause, by Agatha
Colbert of Tufts University is due out in the Journal of American
Medicine in October. It is expected to be favorable.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is considerable anecdotal evidence,
especially among professional athletes. In 1994, Colbert was on the
verge of giving up tournament golf owing to a lifetime of
lower-back pain that had finally got beyond his endurance. He was
introduced to William Roper, founder, chairman and chief executive
officer of Magnetherapy Inc. Roper had used magnets himself to
relieve the pangs of a college and professional football career.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert strapped magnets onto his back, put magnetized insoles
in his shoes. And what happened? With a final-round 67 in a Florida
senior tour event, he came from eight shots off the lead to finish
one off the winning score. Colbert has been wearing magnets ever
since, and has won well over $5 million, 11 tournaments and
consecutive Senior PGA Tour player-of-the-year awards (1995-96).
</P>
<P>
   Magnet therapy is widely used on the senior circuit, but it is
also being used by juniors, and by players on the PGA and Ladies
Professional Golf Association tours. John Huston, who set a PGA
Tour scoring record while winning this year's Hawaiian Open (28
under par), travels with a mattress cover loaded with 265 magnets.
Donna Andrews used magnets to alleviate a back problem that was
seriously curtailing her career. Another LPGA star, Michelle
McGann, a diabetic with circulation problems in her feet, claims
she has been helped considerably through the use of magnetic
insoles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one claims magnets cure, only that they reduce, if not
entirely eliminate, pain. For that reason, proponents say they
should be worn all the time. After all, one cannot overdose on
magnetic energy, according to Dr. Alvin Bakst, the onetime chief of
heart surgery at New York City's Flower-Fifth Avenue Hospital, who
is now in the magnet therapy business in Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because man over the past 50,000 years has become
acclimated to magnetism through day to day living on earth, which
is a huge magnetic ball,'' Bakst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, when it was suggested you could use a
magnetic field to diagnose illness within the body, the notion was
pooh-poohed. It became MRI,'' Bakst said, referring to magnetic
resonance imaging exams, ``now the most effective diagnostic tool
in medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnets should not be used by people with a pacemaker, or
surgically implanted metal pins or screws, he added. They are also
not recommended for pregnant women. Those who do wear them should
beware they might affect (knock out) your cell phone and television
set.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets are man-made, with either a ceramic or neodymium
housing. The latter are considered the best, and come from mainland
China. In any casing, the magnetic energy can be controlled as to
its positive and negative charge, and the amount of each, which is
called a Gauss rating. The higher the Gauss, the stronger the
magnet.
</P>
<P>
   Negative energy is considered the most effective for pain
relief, and if one is using a bipolar magnet (positive on one side,
negative on the other), the negative side should be touching the
body. They come in many forms _ wrist bracelets, insoles, chair
pads, leg, knee, shoulder, elbow and back wraps and dime-sized
``dots'' to place on small targets such as a finger or toe.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent argument for magnetic-pain therapy is the
elimination or deep reduction in the use of painkiller drugs.
``Magnetism is still not accepted for the treatment of illness,''
Bakst said, ``but that's what is coming next.''

POP LIFE: THE FIRST ROCK OPERA (NO, NOT `TOMMY'); SAMPLING
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the lyric ``From number three there came the
cry, `S.F. Sorrow is born,'' the British band the Pretty Things
entered the rock-and-roll history books in 1968 with what is
generally acknowledged as the first rock opera. But for a work of
such importance _ among the most interesting and ambitious albums
of the 60s _ ``S.F. Sorrow'' has remained unjustly obscure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album has never really had a proper release,'' Phil May,
the band's singer, said from his home in London. ``To some extent,
it died at birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, three decades later, ``S.F. Sorrow'' is being born again.
Out of print for decades, the album is to be reissued on CD by
Snapper Music. After the band settled out of court this year with
several record labels for royalties and the rights to its catalog,
Snapper made a deal to repackage the group's past albums and record
three new ones. On Sunday, the reunited Pretty Things are to
perform ``S.F. Sorrow'' in its entirety for the first time at Abbey
Road Studios in London. The concert, featuring the band's 1966
lineup with the addition of David Gilmour of Pink Floyd on guitar
and Arthur Brown (known for his hit ``Fire'') providing narration,
will be broadcast live (at 4 p.m. in New York), on the Internet
(www.onlineconcerts.com) and recorded for a live album.
</P>
<P>
   The Pretty Things began as a raucous blues-rock band influenced
by Bo Diddley and constantly described in relation to the Rolling
Stones as meaner, louder, uglier and with longer hair than the
Stones, a band the Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor originally
played bass in. By its fourth album, ``S.F. Sorrow,'' the Pretty
Things had changed their course to remain relevant in an era that
was producing more sophisticated pop like ``Pet Sounds'' and ``Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.''
</P>
<P>
   For the album, the Pretty Things took a short story May had
written and developed an entire record around the life of the
story's protagonist, Sebastian F. Sorrow, whose downward spiral
begins when he watches the hot-air balloon carrying the woman he
loves crash and burn. Loaded with rich harmonies, sharp
dissonances, odd electronic effects, early Pink Floyd-style
psychedelia, proto heavy metal and songs that drastically change
styles from one moment to the next, the album was full of pop
experiments and abstractions that have become a calling card for
current underground alternative bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for another way of making a 40-minute disk,''
May said. ``I could never understand why an album had to be five
A-sides and five B-sides with no connection. Pieces of music had
been written for at least a 40-minute listen, and I thought the
best way to do that was to overlay a story line and create music
for the various characters and instances. It was the oldest concept
in the world, but at the time nobody had done it before.'' The
band's record label balked when the group wanted to publish May's
story with the album and made it pay the extra cost of printing the
text on the album packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Who has denied that the album was a major influence
on its better-known 1969 rock opera, ``Tommy,'' May and many rock
cognoscenti disagree. ``You've got the opening of `Pinball Wizard'
completely there, in `Old Man Going,''' he said, comparing the Pete
Townshend song to his.
</P>
<P>
   Despite lyrics like ``You might be the loneliest person in the
world/You'll never be as lonely as me,'' the Pretty Things did not
have a reputation as Britain's most sensitive residents. With an
estimated 61 convictions, ranging from drug to weapon possession,
they were banned in Australia, kicked out of hotels and restaurants
worldwide and claimed to have invented the rock tradition of
throwing furniture out hotel windows.
</P>
<P>
   But May said that the band's reputation sprang mostly from its
long hair and scruffy look. ``It was apparently against all the
codes that were laid down for behavior,'' he said. ``People would
look at you and want to take a swing at you. They thought that
obviously we were homosexuals or perverts or transvestites. And we
were considered dirty. But what they didn't realize is if you have
long hair you have to take more care of it than someone with a crew
cut. We were taking three showers a day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Recording Industry Association of America stepped up
its efforts to crack down on CD plants manufacturing pirated and
bootlegged albums this year, the initiative had a strange side
effect. Some groups whose songs incorporated samples of music by
other artists without written consent suddenly discovered that CD
makers were unwilling to press copies of their albums. This
resulted in a story about how one small band made a big enough
noise to force the industry to revise its guidelines, which it did
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the group Negativland _ known for challenging
copyright law with its sample-heavy collages, which have attracted
the ire of U2 and the radio personality Casey Kasem _ discovered
that no CD pressing plant was willing to make copies of a new album
documenting its radio show because it included an unlicensed
excerpt from Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon.'' The band and
record label used to be held responsible for any legal
repercussions of using copyrighted material without permission, but
in the last year the climate had changed and the recording
association made it clear that CD-pressing plants could be sued
under copyright law for making CD's with unlicensed samples. Be it
intentionally or accidentally, every year hundreds of recordings
with illegal excerpts of other songs are released, some of them by
major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Eckart, president of Olde West, a CD-manufacturing company
in San Francisco, was one of those who refused to press copies of
Negativland's CD. Previously, he was prevented from making copies
of a CD for the turntable group the Invisibl Skratch Picklz, which
incorporated an unlicensed excerpt from a song by Rush. Eckart said
he was not happy about having to turn down those jobs.
``Intellectually and morally, I agree with Negativland
completely,'' he said. ``The RIAA has stepped out of its mission of
stopping piracy and bootlegging and knowingly stepped into the
realm of censorship. They have the plants so scared of lawsuits
that they are being super-zealous. I told the group that no plant
in America would press this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, in response to complaints from Negativland fans,
the association tried to make its position on sampling _ a legal
gray area _ a little clearer by amending its guidelines to
CD-pressing plants, saying that in some instances ``sampling may
qualify as fair use under copyright law'' and recommending that CD
plants consult their lawyers to decide how to handle each
situation. Hillary Rosen, the association's president, said that
now a band without sample clearance can still make a case to get
its CD pressed.
</P>
<P>
   The association's new position, however, has left many in the
manufacturing industry unsatisfied. They said that they resented
pressure from what they feel is a private organization looking
after the interests of major record-label clients, and that in many
cases it had been impossible to identify and difficult to deal with
such samples on albums.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosen said although the guidelines were not originally
intended to cover sampling, she felt irresponsible telling plants
to press CD's with excerpts of copyrighted material. Though the
association has never sued a CD manufacturer for making copies of
records with illegal samples, she said: ``It's not fair to tell a
plant to ignore samples. Anytime a CD plant does something, it has
responsibility under copyright law.''

PLAY THAT STIRRED OUTCRY PREPARES FOR ITS OPENING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About three months have passed since the Manhattan
Theater Club decided not to produce ``Corpus Christi'' by Terrence
McNally and then reversed itself after an outcry from artists and
civil liberties organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, printed postcards registering opposition to the play
have poured into the theater by the thousands, as have many letters
of support from the theater community, the public and Theater Club
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The theater recently announced the cast and began rehearsals for
the drama, which early reports said featured a gay, Jesus-like
figure who had sex with his apostles. In May, the theater received
anonymous threats of violence when details of the play's content
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The production, directed by Joe Mantello, is scheduled to open
on Oct. 13 at City Center in Manhattan. Previews begin on Sept. 22.
The cast is made up of mostly unknown actors, including Anson
Mount, who will play the lead character, Joshua, a gay man whose
life is traced from contemporary Corpus Christi, Texas, to ancient
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, which
describes itself as the nation's largest Catholic civil rights
group and led the initial outcry against the production, plans a
protest at the theater on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of artists and representatives of civil liberties
organizations met recently to discuss how to respond to such a
demonstration and to consider approaching opponents of the
production about the long-term free-speech issues raised by the
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Manhattan Theater Club is trying to say as little
as possible. ``To protect the privacy of the rehearsal process, and
given the nature of controversy surrounding this production, MTC
has agreed with McNally and Mantello to let the play speak for
itself and not to discuss the production process,'' the theater
said in a statement issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, the theater said it had hired Kroll
Associates, the private investigation and security company, as a
consultant and that the theater's representatives had met
``repeatedly with top officials of the NYPD, and have spoken with
the police commissioner, Howard Safir.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater declined to discuss its safety precautions in
detail, citing security concerns. In a note sent to subscribers
with their tickets, the theater said: ``Because of increased
security, you may experience some temporary inconvenience at the
theater during the run of the play. If you decide you do not wish
to see the play, we will promptly refund your money. If you choose
not to attend the play, please return your ticket to the
subscription office and do not sell it to a stranger.'' The theater
has also established a telephone number for people with questions
or comments: (212) 642-5929.
</P>
<P>
   For nonsubscribers, limited seats are available, the theater
said in the statement, and tickets go on sale Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the theater, Chris Boneau, said the principals
in the production declined to be interviewed. Some cast members did
not return calls and several have unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the circumstances surrounding the
opening of ``Corpus Christi'' were sensitive, Boneau said that
theaters typically do not offer a look behind the scenes before a
play opens.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening night demonstration, the Catholic League said it
expected busloads of people from as far away as Baltimore and
Philadelphia, as well as nuns, priests and lay people from Long
Island. ``Hopefully we'll send a message that this is basically
unacceptable,'' said William Donohue, the league's president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A league spokesman said the organization planned to get a permit
for the protest and that police were aware of its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said that 45 national religious organizations _
associated with Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims _ had
signed a statement condemning ``Corpus Christi'' and that he
planned to release the statement on Sept. 22. Although the league
objects to the play's content, Donohue said it is not seeking to
close it down. ``History has shown that an attack on one religion
may open the door to attacks on other religions,'' the statement
says, ``and that is why we call upon the good will of all Americans
to join with us in condemning this blasphemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, who said he had not been able to obtain a copy of the
play but had secured a ticket, emphasized that the league does not
promote or condone violent tactics. ``I think it is a very nice
tactic to point fingers at people going into a theater and yell,
`Shame, shame shame!' That's certainly something I'm going to
encourage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the play said the league helped stir up some
of the extreme reactions to the play in May, particularly with its
strong presence on talk radio. Donohue said, ``I'm not going to
take any responsibility for the excesses of some lunatic out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the larger issues of artistic freedom that some believe
are at stake, a small group of people involved in the arts and
issues of artistic freedom gathered recently to plan their
strategy. The group included the playwrights Tony Kushner and Craig
Lucas; Joan Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition
Against Censorship; Michael Roberts, executive director of the PEN
American Center; Amy Schwartzman of Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts,
and Ben Cameron of Theater Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any sort of trouble, I think we have to be
prepared to respond,'' said Kushner, who called the meeting with
Lucas. ``It would be terrible to see this kind of pressure work in
New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to discussing a counter-demonstration, the group
drafted a statement it has yet to release about the principles
raised by the ``Corpus Christi'' matter and discussed the
possibility of organizing a dialogue between the opposing camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eager to point out what's really at stake here is not a
religious issue but homophobia,'' Kushner said. ``Many Catholics
are not homophobic. The Catholic League does not represent those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kushner encountered similar protests in response to his
play ``Angels in America,'' and the National Endowment for the Arts
has long been a target of attack, civil liberties experts suggest
that the theater world is largely unfamiliar with such combat. ``I
think people in the theater community are not used to this,'' Ms.
Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kramer, the playwright and author, said he believed that
the theater's initial decision not to produce the play might make
playwrights think twice before bringing their work there in the
future. ``Did it hurt Manhattan Theater Club in my eyes?'' Kramer
asked. ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas said that what mattered was that the theater
ultimately did the right thing. ``I would take my work to Manhattan
Theater Club,'' he said. ``The right wing often succeeds in getting
the left to fight with ourselves. I think we should stick together
and support each other. We have to know who the enemy is.''

NEW KIMBELL DIRECTOR IS BATTLE-TESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Kimbell Art Museum trustees didn't hire
Timothy Potts as their new director because he shut down an
exhibition last year. They knew of the incident _ it involved
Andres Serrano's controversial photographs _ but they were looking
at his other credentials, which range from exhibition curating to
investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if anyone outside Australia or the art world has heard of
Potts, hired this month, it is probably because of the Serrano
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Potts' predecessor at the National Gallery of Victoria in
Melbourne planned the exhibit, and Potts knew it would be trouble.
Leaders of Melbourne's Catholic community had attempted to prevent
its opening, and Potts had been criticized for scheduling it
concurrently with a major Rembrandt exhibition. But how could he
know that Serrano's infamous ``Piss Christ'' photograph would be
attacked twice and ultimately destroyed by extremists who entered
as visitors?
</P>
<P>
   When that happened, Potts and his trustees considered their
options and chose the most radical. They closed the exhibition, not
as an act of censorship, but out of concern for the safety of staff
members and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Potts was called a coward, and his decision was
described as a blow to freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing an exhibition is something no director or curator
wants to do,'' Potts said. ``Indeed, most people just try to avoid
the issue altogether and, in some ways, understandably. I didn't
have that option.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the circumstances it seemed the right thing, and I
still believe what we did was right. I wasn't about to put anyone's
personal safety at risk for any exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Potts was even more eloquent when he addressed freedom of
expression in an essay that can be found on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Was this not,'' Potts wrote, ``a backing down on an equally
unnegotiable point of principle _ the right of an artist and
gallery in a free society to show important art? No, it was a
decision to shift the battlefield to an arena where people's lives
would not be at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Does anyone really believe that those who find
Serrano's work blasphemous will be persuaded otherwise by the NGV
turning itself into a fortress and toughing out the exhibition for
two months? If so, they confuse persuasion with defiance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that last sentence that hits me, as a critic working in a
culture in which so much art is laden with provocative content,
content that seems intended to defy certain sensibilities rather
than work persuasively for change.
</P>
<P>
   Potts' handling of the Serrano exhibition confirms to me his
promise. It demonstrates his ability to make and stand by a tough
decision and to articulate the complexities of that decision, as
well as the larger issues surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   True, Potts is unlikely to add that to his resume, sandwiched
between ``Ph.D. in ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology'' and
``contributing art and book reviewer, he Financial Times, New York
and London.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an accomplishment of sorts, one that the Australian
press duly noted along with Potts' fund-raising acumen and
expansion projects, in its Page One reports of his resignation.
True to their barbed, tabloid-style approach to journalism, the
Australian media pointedly criticized Potts as much as they faintly
praised him for making Australia's oldest and largest museum its
most popular, as well.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, they managed to make Potts' departure sound
quite disastrous _ a possibility that he discounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that things will grind to a halt with my
departure,'' he said. ``We have very good senior management here,
and trustees. Life will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   And in October, Potts will go on: He'll leave Melbourne and come
to Fort Worth with his family. And, once in Fort Worth, he seems
certain to make a beeline for the Kimbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very keen about getting my feet under the desk there,'' he
said. ``So at that point, I don't think wild horses could keep me
away.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With investors shaken by the recent stock plunge and
much of the world slipping into an ever-deeper financial morass,
Americans are turning to the insti- tution that has bailed them out
of economic trouble so often in the past _ the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In growing numbers in recent days, po- litical leaders,
economists and even ordi- nary shareholders have called on the Fed
to cut short-term interest rates to ward off what some see as a
lurking danger of recession and steady the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to a wide variety of ana- lysts, neither Fed
officials nor policy makers elsewhere are likely to act anytime
soon. In- deed, say these analysts, for the first time
 &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  in the post-Cold War era, the nation and the
world appear headed for a period of substantial upheaval with no
one ready or able to guide the course of economic events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a global crisis that's more severe than
any- one expected and there's no big brother out there to fix it,''
said Da- vid M. Jones, a veteran Fed watcher and chief economist
with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free marketeers are getting their wish with a vengence,''
said Gary C. Hufbauer, director of stud- ies for the Council on
Foreign Rela- tions in New York. ``There's not a lot of political
will in any of the ad- vanced nations to manage this crisis so the
markets are going to carry us where they will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the Fed is re- luctant to act because,
despite the recent spate of bad stock market news, many Fed
officials still fear the US economy is growing unsus-H tainably
fast and must be slowed to avoid rekindling inflation. Cutting
interest rates would have the oppo- site effect of speeding the
economy up by reducing the borrowing costs of companies, home
buyers and oth- ers.
</P>
<P>
   Rate-cut advocates argue that the central bank is unduly nervous
about inflation and doesn't L appreciate the havoc that the recent
stock sell-off may cause by making middle-class Americans feel
poorer and therefore less ready to spend, a combination that they
worry will push the United States into recession and other
countries into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep up the miracle combination of negligible
inflation and robust growth going without  &UR; -------------------- &LR; 
easing'' interest rates, said Roger M. Kubarych, a former senior
Fed offi- cial who is now a partner with the New York financial
firm of Kaufman &AMP; Kubarych. In addition, he said, the United States
can't fill the role the rest of the world needs it to fill _ as
``importer of last resort'' _ without lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is acting a lot like pet- rified wood. They need to
cut rates to restore confidence,'' said Senator By- ron L. Dorgan,
a North Dakota Democrat and longtime Fed critic.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, Fed officials' reluctance to act might not be so
worrisome, ac- cording to analysts, if it were not for the fact
that no other policy maker here or abroad appears up to the job of
managing the latest economic cri- ses in Asia and elsewhere, and
en- suring they don't turn into a global rout.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from President Clinton to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin; L from Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to German
Chancellor Hel-H mut Kohl, the world seems woefully short of strong
leadership and less prepared to cope with economic L trouble than
it has in years, said these analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the G7 countries and there's not a lot of
strength,'' said Hufbauer, referring to the so- called Group of
Seven nations, in- cluding the United States, Japan, Germany and
Britian, that have the world's largest economies and at least until
recently provided the world's economic lead- ership.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary L Fund, which has spent the last year
and close to $100 billion trying to prop up the Asian economies and
Russia, is ``close to being discredited for its mishandling'' of
those crises, Hufbauer said. ``The World Bank is not particularly
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Fed and its counterpart  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  central
banks in the other industrial nations retain substantial clout,
Huf-H bauer said, and ``they don't want to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe we were in a fina-H cial bubble and that this
correction is exactly the tonic that's needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, analysts said, manag- ing global economic crises has
never been easy, and the task has only grown harder as nations'
economies have become more entwined since the end of the Cold War.
But in vir- tually every other crisis in recent years, one or
another of the major economic powers has stepped in to try to guide
events.
</P>
<P>
   When Thailand, Korea and other Asian nations first hit the skids
last year, for example, the IMF under close US direction stepped in
with money and policy prescriptions. L When Mexico became
economically unhinged in 1994 and 1995, US Trea- sury Secretary
Robert Rubin almost single-handedly pumped billions of dollars of
loans into its economy. When Latin America was unable to repay its
debts in the early 1980s, the Fed boosted US growth to help pull
the region out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If Fed officials and other policy makers now take a hands-off
policy toward Asia, Russia, Latin America and other current
economic trouble spots, said Jones, the veteran Fed watcher, ``this
will be the first time we've tested the system without any
intervention.''

CARY MIDDLECOFF, DENTIST TURNED GOLFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Cary Middlecoff, who abandoned dentistry to play
professional golf and won more prize money than Ben Hogan, Sam
Snead or anyone else in the storied 1950s era, died Tuesday at the
Allen Morgan Health Center in Memphis, Tenn. He was 77 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cary Finn, his personal physician, said the cause of death
was congestive heart failure. He said Middlecoff had lived in a
nursing home the last six months because of deteriorating health.
Middlecoff had not been well since 1993 when, after watching the
final round of the Masters tournament on television at home in
Memphis, he fell and suffered a severe head injury that
hospitalized him for two months.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, Middlecoff was a glamorous figure _ 6-feet,
2-inches, 185 pounds, handsome, articulate and boyishly charming.
From 1945 to 1967, he competed on the Professional Golfers'
Association tour. He won the 1949 and 1956 United States Opens and
the 1955 Masters, and he was so happy with his 1956 victory and its
$6,000 purse that he tipped his caddie $500.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he won 40 times on the tour, a number bettered only by
Snead (81), Jack Nicklaus (70), Hogan (63), Arnold Palmer (60),
Byron Nelson (42) and Billy Casper (51) and equaled by Walter
Hagen. When he retired as a full-time tour player after back
surgery, he led in career earnings with $295,043.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Emmett Cary Middlecoff was born Jan. 6, 1921, in Halls, Tenn.,
and raised in Memphis, where his father, Dr. Herman Middlecoff, was
a dentist and club golf champion. When the youngster was 7, his
father taught him to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go out with the other kids my age and shoot six or
seven holes once a week,'' the son said. ``By the time I was 14, I
was playing 54 holes a day. But it wasn't until I was 17 that I got
serious about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he was city champion. After attending the University of
Mississippi, he graduated in 1944 from the Tennessee College of
Dentistry, and like his father and two uncles he became a dentist.
He was soon commissioned as an Army dentist and in 18 months filled
12,093 teeth (The Army did keep such statistics). In 1945, still in
the Army, he became the first amateur to win the North and South
Open in Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out of the Army,'' he said, ``I didn't want to see
any more teeth. I just wanted to play some golf.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1946, after his discharge from the Army, he joined his
father's dental practice. A year later, he started playing golf
full time. For 10 years, his name remained on the office door, but
he never filled another tooth.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the tour, Middlecoff spent 18 years as a
golf analyst for television. Otherwise, he was a private person,
and in the early 1990's he stopped playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not miss the tour life, especially the traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did most of it in cars those days,'' he said, ``50,000
miles a year, mostly on Sunday nights and Monday. It was not like a
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of that time, he was accompanied by his wife, the
former Edith Buck, whom he married in 1947. She is his only
immediate survivor. They had no children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rose Gerrit Huy was a fast-rising executive at Daimler-Benz AG,
the German industrial giant that makes Mercedes-Benz automobiles. A
Harvard-educated economist, she was in charge of developing cars
like the SLK roadster before she was promoted to head the company's
finance and telecommunications subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Ms. Huy, 43, quit Daimler after 11 years to
become Compaq Computer Corp.'s managing director in Germany. Not
that her Daimler salary was skimpy, but the Texas-based computer
maker offered something that could catapult her into vastly greater
riches: stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Huy would not disclose the size of the options package that
lured her away, but these numbers provide a clue: While the
chairman of Daimler holds a form of options worth less than $1
million, the options of the Compaq chairman are worth more than
$188 million at last count.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades, even as the global economy has
demolished national barriers to trade and investment, the executive
pay gap between America and the rest of the world has widened
dramatically. While American executives were loading up with stock
options, restricted stock and other compensation intended to align
their interests with those of shareholders, their counterparts
overseas continued to collect only salary and modest bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   That is largely because the political cultures of many European
and Asian countries recoiled at the idea of lavishing vast riches
on capitalist chieftains for a single year's work. Many Europeans
were left aghast by pay packages like the $49.9 million that
Travelers Group chairman Sanford Weill collected in 1997, or the
more than $556 million that Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner
made in 1997 by exercising fewer than half of his stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, that attitude is changing, albeit slowly. To stem a
drain of executive talent to their American rivals, big European
and Asian corporations have begun pressing their governments to
modify securities laws and accounting practices that discourage
jumbo pay packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the world is moving to our pay model,'' said Kevin
Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and a
leading expert on worldwide executive pay. ``Maybe that movement is
out of efficiency, maybe it is out of greed _ we don't know which
yet _ but the trend is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Japan revised its commercial code to
allow stock options. Already, 160 companies, including Sony, the
entertainment and electronics concern, have adopted option plans,
according to Bob Buford, a compensation specialist with the
consulting firm Towers-Perrin in New York, who has worked with many
Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of American-style pay plans, including stock
options, is uneven in Europe, specialists say: faster in high
technology, like telecommunications and software, and slower in
manufacturing and heavy industry. But it is having a big impact
wherever it is found, and the recent turmoil in global stock
markets, although it may have cut the value of some compensation
packages, is unlikely to have any long-term effect on equity-based
pay.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the Netherlands and Australia, a few companies have
started adding options and other forms of equity to executive
compensation packages, a practice that the British began widely
adopting in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany last month, a court earlier upheld a form of stock
options that Daimler offered two years ago to 170 executives, a
pool it has since expanded tenfold, while also increasing the size
of its still-modest option packages.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Doell, a partner in Frankfurt with the executive-search
firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, said that two years ago Ford Motor Co.
extended its American pay levels to its operations in Europe, and
immediately lured two top executives from Volkswagen. Ford is now
fishing for lower-level managers using the same bait _ stock
options _ and this has increased the pressure on the German auto
industry, one of the slowest areas of German business to adjust, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is now moving to the U.S. model because it works
very well for shareholders,'' said Steven Kaplan, a finance
professor at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options give the holder the right to buy shares at a given
price over a specified period, usually 10 years. If the stock
surges, the holder can exercise the option, sell the stock at a
much higher price and pocket the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Even in America, where it is the most widespread, the practice
is controversial, especially when poor-performing executives walk
away with multimillion-dollar payoffs either because their stock
has been held aloft by the bull market or because the exercise
price has been reset downward.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the criticism, other countries are embracing the
practice. In London, Paul Hodgson, an editor at Income Data
Services, which tracks executive compensation at British companies,
said that the ``only difference is in the size of pay, not the
components, which are going toward the U.S. style.''
</P>
<P>
   While options in Britain have tended to be modest, Unilever PLC,
the British-Dutch household-products maker, and Marks &AMP; Spencer
PLC, Britain's largest retailer, are moving toward American-style
mega-grants.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, including SmithKline Beecham PLC, the drug
concern with major operations in London and Philadelphia, and Four
Seasons Hotels and Hilton International, a unit of Ladbroke Group
PLC, the multinational lodging companies, have made all or parts of
their compensation packages identical regardless of where an
executive is stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation experts call such plans ``global pay.''
Translation: pay on an American scale.
</P>
<P>
   These experts say global pay eliminates internal tensions that
arise when, say, the home office executives in Brussels or Osaka
make less than their subordinates in Chicago or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in pay between American companies and the rest of
the world came into sharp focus in May, when Daimler agreed to
acquire Chrysler Corp., whose No. 2 executive made more last year
from salary, bonus and cashing-in options than the top 10 Daimler
executives combined.
</P>
<P>
   Both Daimler and Chrysler have told shareholders that the new
DaimlerChrysler will have separate pay plans for executives in
Stuttgart and in Detroit, an indication that it does not plan to
quickly equalize pay. But Daimler is also planning to ask
shareholders to approve a new equity pay plan, said Daimler
spokesman Roland Klein.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eaton, the No. 2 Chrysler executive, predicted that the
highest German and American executives at DaimlerChrysler would
someday be paid similarly. ``We have to be competitive,'' Eaton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kay, a partner in New York with Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said
that in recent years, foreign owners have begun to adopt long-term
incentive pay, including small grants of options, which he saw as
signs of how foreign-owned companies were moving closer to
American-style pay. By paying executives with equity, American
companies have performed better than those overseas, Kay argues in
his book ``CEO Pay and Shareholder Value: Helping the U.S. Win the
Global Economic War'' (St. Lucie Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Gareth Williams, an international pay expert in the Chicago
office of the consulting firm William M. Mercer, said that in five
years or so there would be many ``global executives who will not be
hamstrung by their location'' and who would earn global pay that is
heavily dependent on stock options and other forms of equity-based
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to raising the compensation of executives at
multinational companies to the levels in the United States has
encountered all sorts of opposition _ even from the very executives
who stand to benefit from it. Alan Johnson, a compensation
consultant in New York, said many European and Asian executives he
has worked with showed an obvious distaste for huge options
payouts. ``I have been surprised that it is not just a legal,
wake-up-and-smell-the-money issue,'' Johnson said, ``but it is
deeply rooted in their culture and views that you just don't seek
unlimited money.''
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to the United States, Commerzbank chief executive
Martin Kohlhaussen stunned an American banker recently when he said
he owned no Commerzbank stocks. ``What makes you tick?'' was the
American banker's response. Commerzbank chief economist Ulrich Ramm
said Europe was moving toward American-style pay, but added: ``It's
done here with more sensitivity than in the United States, with all
the exaggerations there. Here you try to spread it a little more
broadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson predicted that like Daimler ``most companies will change
in baby steps.'' He added, ``It will take a decade or so to get
like the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slow pace, in the view of John England, a
Towers Perrin executive-compensation specialist in Brussels, is the
greater responsiveness of European companies to stockholder
concerns. When Daimler's original options plan for its executives
came under attack from an investor, for example, England said that
Daimler modified its option grants. ``You never see a U.S. company
do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's high income-tax rates can make perks like cars,
chauffeurs, gardeners and lifelong health benefits as big a draw as
options. And European tax laws discourage companies from making
bountiful options awards by treating them as a cost on the
corporate balance sheet rather than as a deduction on their taxes.
As a result, European stock-incentive plans are often watered-down
versions of their American counterparts. For example, what Daimler
calls ``options'' are more like what Americans call convertible
debentures.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Daimler plan, executives use after-tax money to buy
securities that pay about 4.4 percent interest for 10 years and
give the right to convert to stock at a fixed price once the shares
have risen 15 percent. The plan limits the 170 top executives to a
$120,000 investment a year, pocket change for American chief
executives, while senior managers can invest only $30,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Foley, an executive compensation lawyer in White Plains,
N.Y., said that requiring executives to buy into their equity, what
he called ``putting some skin in the game,'' might lower resistance
to American-style pay plans in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Buy one, get two' sounds a lot better than giving
something'' away free, as most American stock-option plans do, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Graef Crystal, the editor of an executive-compensation
newsletter who once designed executive pay plans, took a more
jaundiced view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The virus,'' he said, ``is now spreading around the world.''

Andrew Solomon, a writer, will discuss the South African Puppet
version of ``Ubu Roi'' at the International Festival on Saturday. 
 By ANDREW SOLOMON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
living soul,'' says the Book of Genesis. What God did is not so
different from what puppeteers do, using humble materials to model
their own images, and then breathing finite life into those
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ninth century B.C., when the first puppet performances
of the ``Mahabharata'' and the ``Ramayana'' were introduced in
religious contexts in India and China, the puppeteer's art has
smacked of sanctity.
</P>
<P>
   Herodotus describes sacred fertility figures operated by wires
and strings that fascinated the Greeks, and Plato uses puppets for
powerful metaphoric purposes in his ``Laws.'' The shaman is a
puppeteer, and so in a metaphorical sense is the priest, who,
before the eyes of his congregation, transforms the inanimate wafer
and wine into the living flesh and blood of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Puppets are a form of idolatry; they are things that are alive
and yet not alive, and so they fascinate us in much the same way as
do viruses, the painting of the Black Madonna that weeps, UFOs,
robots, Lenin in his mausoleum or dreams and mirages.
</P>
<P>
   In medieval Europe, puppeteers were regularly attacked by the
church for violating God's privilege. The principle of animism, of
an object infused with meaning beyond its material self, becomes
the principle of metaphor, and puppets are perfect metaphor.
``Grace,'' the great German dramatist Heinrich von Kleist wrote in
``On the Marionette Theater'' in 1810, ``appears to best advantage
... in the mechanical puppet, or in God.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a great increase in this high-art notion of adult
puppet theater in the United States over the last 20 years as
vanguard American artists have turned to the medium, and as work
from countries where puppetry was never ghettoized for children has
been brought to the New York stage.
</P>
<P>
   The most important venue for new puppet work is the biennial
International Festival of Puppet Theater, produced by Cheryl
Henson, Leslee Asch and the Henson Foundation. The fourth festival
opens Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All this is happening in a year when critics have hailed Julie
Taymor's puppet-dominated ``Lion King'' as one of the best shows on
Broadway; when Basil Twist's ``Symphonie Fantastique'' has sold out
for three months at Here, a downtown performance space; when a
puppet ballet to Aaron Copland's 1939 World's Fair composition,
``From Sorcery to Science,'' produced by Eos Music, attracted
attention from the dance and music worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Major directors, including Lee Breuer, Ping Chong, George C.
Wolfe, Martha Clarke, Robert Lepage and Andrei Serban have all
incorporated puppetry into recent productions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this century, puppets gained a
substantial audience as children's entertainment when they were
presented by Tony Sarg, who also made the balloons for the first
Macy's Day Parade in the 20s. The tradition he began was
popularized with the advent of television and the successes of
Charlie McCarthy, Howdy Doody, Kukla and Ollie, and Bert and Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   There is pleasure in presenting puppets to children, who are
often still uncertain about what is living and what is not. Adults
have in the past signaled their canniness by disdaining the
animated inanimate as a trivial entertainment. They equate
believing in the life of puppets with believing in the Easter
Bunny. But in the last 25 years, puppetry has edged quietly into
the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The modern American puppetry movement really began with the
Muppets' fantastic success at attracting adult audiences. This was
followed in 1980 by the ground-breaking World Puppetry Festival in
Washington, which brought together hundreds of puppeteers from
around the world. Since then, puppetry has grown ever stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Arts recognized it as a distinct
art form in the 80s, and in that decade the MacArthur Foundation
gave ``genius'' awards to two puppeteers, Ms. Taymor and Bruce D.
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta has grown steadily since
it was founded in 1978, and this year Cal Arts in Los Angeles has
set up the $600,000 Costen Center for Puppetry and the Arts, a
program that will train artists in all areas of puppet theater
design and presentation. Several universities in the United States
now offer graduate degrees in puppetry arts.
</P>
<P>
   Puppetry has now triumphed over ``foolish literalism,'' and its
possibilities hold fascination for technicians and theorists alike.
George Bernard Shaw wrote, late in his life, ``Their unvarying
intensity of facial expression, impossible for living actors, keeps
the imagination of the spectators continuously stimulated ... there
is nothing wonderful in a living actor moving and speaking, but
that wooden headed puppets should do so is a marvel that never
palls.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Blumenthal, puppetry's outspoken theorist and a professor
at Rutgers University, says: ``Human actors still come in a paltry
range of sizes and shapes. They can endure only modest physical
action without sustaining unacceptable damage. And the performing
artist and the character, using the same body, inevitably get all
tangled together.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with this matter is the center of the new puppetry: what
is mechanism, what is authentic, what is sheer trickery? These
questions are now brought to the forefront. The magnificent
American puppeteer Roman Paska wrote, ``The puppet's inherent
resistance to realism, which previously obstructed its acceptance
as a respectable art form in the West, has now become its principal
raison d'etre.'' Indeed, to watch a puppet show today is to watch
both the puppeteer and the puppets.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of an audience at a play involves transference:
we project ourselves onto the actors and their narrative. Freud
pointed out that a neutral object is the best subject for
transference, and the unmoving expressions of puppets made them
richer for projections than the living actor could be.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schumann, founder of the Vermont-based Bread and Puppet
Theater, writes, ``Words are attached to faces which don't move
externally and so are all the more obviously able to produce
meaning.'' He goes on to refer to puppets as ``applied sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bell, the dramaturg with Schumann's company, says that in
conventional theater the audience's attention is ``focused on the
performer, whose own attention, according to Stanislavsky-based
theory, is also focused on his body and inner being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In performing object theater, on the other hand, both the
performers' and the audience's attention is focused on the
object,'' and this, he says, is the basis for the puppet theater's
complex relationship to realism.
</P>
<P>
   Puppet theater does not seek a permanent or total evisceration
of the lines between the living and the unliving but the blurring
of those lines. You are not supposed to think that a bit of cloth
or papier-mache is alive; you are supposed to know that it is not
alive and yet respond to it with the emotions you ordinarily
reserve for living things. Sometimes it is better to weep for a
puppet than to weep for a man; sometimes metaphor is more profound
than literalism; sometimes art is better than reality.
</P>
<P>
   As the relationship between the ``real'' and the ``artificial''
obsessed early industrial society, one artist after the next
approached the subject, from E.T.A. Hoffmann (whose ``Sandman''
became the ballet ``Coppelia'' and the Olympia act in the opera
``The Tales of Hoffmann'') to George Sand, who established an
internationally hailed puppet theater (for which she sewed the
puppet costumes herself); from Paul Klee, Marc Chagall, Vassily
Kandinsky and members of the Bauhaus, all of whom built puppets, to
Shaw and Lorca, who wrote for them.
</P>
<P>
   Georg Buchner has one of his characters declare that hanging a
man in effigy is better than hanging him in fact, as the deed is
done and the man is unharmed; the effigy puppet here is better for
many purposes than the human it represents.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism is refusal: elimination of costumes and props, of
broad spans of time, of plot, of language. But the most radical
gesture is the elimination of actors. In 1908, Edward Gordon Craig,
the designer and theatrical theorist, proposed that puppets should
replace actors entirely. ``The Uber-marionette will not compete
with life _ rather will go beyond it. ... It will aim to clothe
itself with deathlike beauty while exhaling a living spirit,'' he
wrote in a text dear to the hearts of many puppeteers.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit of sanctity, Josef Krofta, the founder of
Czechoslovakia's Theater Drak, recently said, ``We need to remind
ourselves often that the word `to animate' does not mean `to make
move,' but rather `to give a soul to,' from the Latin word `anima.'
''
</P>
<P>
   While Craig spoke of puppetry as a ``descendant of the stone
images of the old temples,'' the puppeteer Hanne Tierney has
pointed out that all art has folk (and often religious) origins,
and that what has happened to puppetry in the last two centuries is
much like the evolution of music, from folk song and chant to the
full complexity of classical composition to the post-modern
revisiting of worldwide mystical roots.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary radicalism in puppetry, too, is often signaled by a
return to ancient sources; Asian and African puppetry traditions,
for example, never denied the nonhuman status of puppets.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval European puppets _ Punch, Petroushka, Pulcinella,
et al. _ were used to represent and heroize the common man. They
``hoodwinked the law, were contemptuous of book-learning and the
upper classes, and beat their wives with gusto,'' according to Ms.
Tierney. Schumann writes, ``Their asocial status acted also as
their saving grace.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Much later, in the Communist period in Eastern Europe and in
Russia, puppet theater was reborn as a mode of social protest.
Subject to far less censorship than the theater, puppet stages
became sharply politicized and fiercely independent.
</P>
<P>
   International puppetry enthusiasts put together an important
puppetry festival in Bosnia in 1996. Puppetry activism (``more
relevant than `Waiting for Godot,' anyhow,'' one Bosnian said) is
highly energetic and populist.
</P>
<P>
   The two determining external developments for modern Western
puppetry are materialism and movies. Henryk Jurkowski, the great
Polish puppetry scholar, talks about the ``dictatorship of objects
in everyday life,'' within which we develop intimacies with what we
own.
</P>
<P>
   Modern puppeteers often forgo the use of manufactured puppets in
favor of found objects, and they tend to demonstrate their art in
their ability to project life onto anything. The pathetic fallacy
comes true in their hands; the brick tires of holding up the
building, and the kitchen blender suffers waves of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as someone, or something, moves, a relationship is
immediately created with the atmosphere around it,'' writes Ana
Maria Amaral, a puppetry professor in Brazil. ``A static object has
an accumulated energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of movies on puppetry has been compared to that of
photographs on art. ``Before films,'' says Ms. Blumenthal,
``puppetry was the only theater able to manipulate scale, and this
remains one of its fortes.''
</P>
<P>
   A puppet is a subtle mechanism to be used in performance: most
of the dramatic tricks can be achieved in the new medium (no
problem now to have representations of people flying or burning),
and so the older one must find a new way by exposing its underlying
structures. Following the Japanese Bunraku tradition, the invisible
puppeteer is now often quite visible, but if the puppeteer is a
skilled performer, he becomes less human, less interesting, and
ultimately less visible than the puppet he manipulates.
</P>
<P>
   Paska writes that the purpose of hiding the puppeteer was never
to create the illusion of a perfectly unmediated reality; it was to
create the illusion of live theater performance, to suggest ``the
mechanical autonomy of the puppet'' rather than the naturalism of
his situation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a down side to all this high-art seriousness. New
``puppet theorists'' write prose full of sentences like ``The
puppetness of an object is determined by use, not latency, and is a
renewable, not permanent quality ... the signifying puppet
dematerializes into pure simulation,'' and ``In the puppet theater
sculpture serves a quasi-narrative purpose, if narration is
understood as the revelation of an inner world and if we allow the
possibility that the narration hinges on and is inspired by the
sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Puppet criticism is almost as mystifying as deconstructionism.
But the sheer materiality of the puppets themselves means that this
rhetoric falls away in the face of performance.
</P>
<P>
   This year's gigantic festival will reflect all these tendencies,
traditions and radicalisms. Each of the individual shows should be
interesting in its way, but what will be most interesting will be
to see several shows, to dip into the language of modern puppetry.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting the achievements of various performers, one finds
that some of these abstract-sounding issues are really very
concrete. One is seduced by the work, every time in a different
way. In our culture, so much preoccupied with belatedness and
exhaustion, the vitality of this medium is particularly
invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Broadway's biggest successes are revivals and many of
Hollywood's top films are remakes, but though the story of
Pinocchio may supply an armature for generations of puppet work,
puppeteers are not repeating their inspiration. They do not have
the leeway to do so; in this tightly curated festival, the breadth
and depth and height of the puppet arts is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the performances should be breathtakingly realistic, so
that one wants to do what Don Quixote did and rush onto the stage
and battle with the clay-headed dolls. Many of them will be
emotional. Puppet artists are fully aware of the complexity of
their medium: as Paska has said, they are ``out on a limb between
the angel and the machine.''

 By JASON DePARLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are young, poor and hard beyond their years,
with resumes that often list jails, not jobs. Their earnings have
spent decades in decline, and so has their likelihood to marry. Yet
there is a growing sense that the nation's ambitious welfare
overhaul cannot succeed without them.
</P>
<P>
   With tough new rules now in place for welfare mothers, the
spotlight is turning to welfare fathers. Dozens of programs have
sprung up in the last few years, seeking to raise the incomes of
these missing men and strengthen their ties to their children.
Though few can yet show clear success, the effort has suddenly
found a wellspring of government and philanthropic support.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the states given lucrative federal welfare-to-work
grants this year have pledged to include fathers in their programs.
The Ford Foundation, which virtually created the welfare-to-work
field two decades ago, is seeding a parallel industry to run
programs for men and study them. And most surprisingly, some
congressional Republicans have proposed a multibillion-dollar
program for poor, unwed fathers _ scarcely a usual Republican
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   To glimpse the odd politics, consider the journey of Rep. E.
Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who was the main author of
the 1996 welfare law. That law made unprecedented spending cuts and
expressed a profound unease with activist government. Now Shaw is
pushing a ``Fathers Count'' bill that would spend $2 billion on the
kind of men who gather on street corners with half-smoked
cigarettes behind their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups, including faith-based organizations, would use
the money to provide poor fathers with job training and parenting
advice and encourage them to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to solve the problem of poverty, you've got to
do what you can to make these guys marriage material,'' Shaw said.
``So many of them _ I would say the majority of them _ are men
these women wouldn't want to marry. And I don't blame them. They
don't have jobs. They're smoking dope on the streets. We've got to
clean them up. We know the kids who grow up without a parent figure
in the house, particularly the males, end up in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was chagrined to find a Palm Beach constituent _ Rush
Limbaugh _ among those dismissing the idea as throwing money at
social problems. But Shaw acknowledges that the work will be
difficult. On average, the men have much higher arrest rates than
women on welfare and just as little education and work experience.
Several generations of job-training programs have shown little or
no impact on their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the political support for fatherhood programs is
split between camps with competing strategies. The promoters of
``responsible fatherhood'' programs tend toward a cultural, often
faith-based, approach with marriage as an explicit, even
indispensable, goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change a man's heart, change his attitude, and the rest will
take care of itself,'' said Charles Ballard, founder of the
Institute for Responsible Fatherhood and Family Revitalization, a
Washington organization that runs programs in five cities.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, those seeking to help ``fragile families'' argue
that marriage is not a viable goal until the men become more
marriageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can change the man's heart all you want,'' said Ron Mincy,
the program officer leading the Ford Foundation's efforts. But
without supports like counseling, training and a more flexible
child support system, ``you're just sending him into a buzz saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those puzzling over the issues is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
of New York, who canceled a welfare speech in May after Newsday
published a leaked passage in which the Mayor was to outline a
fatherhood plan. It would have sent single mothers to
``family-strengthening activities,'' like counseling sessions on
marriage, and the article in the Long Island newspaper compared the
mayor to Dan Quayle, the former vice president who was ridiculed
for his criticisms of single-motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani finally delivered the speech on July 20, the talk
of fatherhood had vanished. ``It's not in my speech because I like
to talk about things where I have a real sense of assurance,'' he
said at a news conference that day. He said he was still trying to
determine how ``government can play an effective role'' in
promoting stable, two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE OVERHAUL CREATES AN URGENCY
</P>
<P>
   While family breakdown has vexed policy makers for three
decades, the issue has acquired new urgency in an age of
time-limited welfare. The 1996 federal law limits most recipients
to five years of cash benefits, and about half the states have set
shorter limits. With legions of poor, single mothers now leaving
welfare, their need for a financial and parenting partner may be
especially acute.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the problem of welfare dependency is almost entirely one
of absent, non-supporting fathers. Only about 5 percent of the
nation's three million welfare families report a father in the
home. By contrast, almost 70 percent of the women on welfare were
unmarried when they had their first child. Most of the men served
by the new programs do not receive cash benefits themselves, but
their children, and the children's mothers, do.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law also places new pressure on absent fathers to pay
child support. Some of the new programs see their mission as
helping the men manage those new pressures without fleeing or, as
some fear, resorting to domestic violence. The new programs are
designed for an especially disadvantaged group of fathers: poor men
who fail to pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   Mincy calls them ``turnips,'' as in ``you can't get blood from a
turnip.'' He estimates there are about 1.6 million such men. On
average, they are 26 years old and have just under 11 years of
education, Mincy wrote in a recent paper. Fifty-five percent are
black; 30 percent are white; and 12 percent are Hispanic. In
studying a similar group of fathers, the Manpower Demonstration
Research Corp., a New York research group, found that 75 percent
had been arrested and 46 percent had been convicted of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous programs, Young Unwed Fathers and Parents Fair
Share, tried to raise the earnings of poor fathers, but had little
effect. Still, optimists point to a silver lining. Despite their
reputation as cavalier deadbeats, many of the fathers at least
professed an interest in parenting, especially when their children
were first born. Both programs ran popular ``peer support'' groups
where street-wise men vented their frustrations, sometimes
discovering they were repeating the mistakes of the fathers who had
abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unequivocally demonstrated that the fathers do have an
interest in being fathers and caring for their children, but there
are obstacles that get in the way of that,'' said Jeffrey Johnson,
president of the National Center for Strategic Nonprofit Planning
and Community Leadership, a Washington group that advises
fatherhood programs.

<P>
   DIVISION ON GOALS FOR PROGRAMS
</P>
<P>
   Among those trying to build on that premise is Joseph Jones, who
runs a well-regarded Baltimore program called Healthy Start Men's
Services. Like many other men involved in this work, he has a
personal connection to the streets. Reared by a single mother after
his parents' divorce, Jones became a drug addict, a prison inmate
and an unwed father by age 22.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Jones, now 42, had kicked his drug habit,
earned a degree and landed a job in a program to reduce infant
mortality. Recognizing the behind-the-scenes influence that
boyfriends exerted on pregnant women, Jones began traveling door to
door, recruiting men to counseling sessions to discuss their plans
for fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   These days he has federal financing, a staff of 12 and 200
clients who receive job training, case management, and counseling
services. One recent Monday, two dozen clients gathered in a room,
offered an Afrocentric prayer (``for Garvey, Muhammad, Malcolm and
King''), and settled into an hourlong discussion of marriage, led
by Jones. The reigning attitude was skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't really for all that marriage stuff, man,'' said
Sylvester Bradshaw, a 21-year-old father of two. ``It's easy for a
person to say `I love you,' man. But you got to really know
somebody to marry them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones pushed back. ``How well do you have to know them to have
kids?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw answered with an embarrassed smile, as if to confess
the shortcomings of his relationship with his children's mother.
But both he and Jones say the program has helped him mature. Since
joining nearly three years ago, Bradshaw said, he has quit selling
drugs, landed a $9.50-an-hour job as a forklift operator and taken
custody of one of his sons. ``Before I came into this program, I
hustled a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like these already have one new source of federal
financing. Over the next two years, the Labor Department will
distribute $3 billion in ``welfare to work'' grants for programs to
serve the most disadvantaged families. So far, 41 states have
received $815 million, and 35 of them have pledged to spend some of
the money on services for absent fathers. Three states are spending
almost their entire grant on fatherhood programs: Michigan ($36
million), Missouri ($17 million) and Wisconsin ($13 million).
</P>
<P>
   A GOP LAWMAKER SEEKS ALLIES ON BILL
</P>
<P>
   As the field grows, the Ford Foundation is leading an effort to
give it an institutional infrastructure. There is now an academic
organization, The National Center on Fathers and Families, to
collect and disseminate research on fathers. There is an advocacy
group, The Center on Fathers, Families and Public Policy, to
monitor the legal issues that poor men face. There is a membership
group for people who run fatherhood programs, The National
Practitioners Network on Fathers and Families.
</P>
<P>
   And as in any other field, there are sharp disputes. Among the
more prominent voices is that of Ballard, whose work enjoys a
following among social conservatives. A charismatic, 62-year-old
man, Ballard frequently tells the story of his 1959 conversion to
Christianity in a Georgia prison cell and his subsequent decision
to adopt the young son he had abandoned. Each of Ballard's five
programs is run by a married couple, sent into an inner-city
neighborhood to model good behaviors and find fathers willing to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a psychological, spiritual approach,'' said
Ballard, who is skeptical about programs that emphasize
job-training or other more traditional social services.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Ford Foundation enlisted Ballard to run a
large demonstration program. But they had a falling out that
mirrors the broader tensions in the field. Ballard wanted to focus
on ``changing hearts.'' Ford wanted to build cooperative
relationships between the community groups that serve poor men and
the child support offices that pursue them. Johnson, of the
nonprofit center, is now implementing the $10 million Ford program.
</P>
<P>
   As Shaw seeks support for his bill, he has found disputes of his
own. In January, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the
Ways and Means Committee, cited the bill as a priority for the
year. But Archer, a Republican, quickly reconsidered, declining to
list himself as a co-sponsor a month later.
</P>
<P>
   His press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said Archer succumbed to
mixed feelings, with concerns about family breakdown set against a
reluctance ``to spending money on things that people should do for
themselves.'' Fleischer said Archer was now waiting to see how much
support Shaw could generate on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Among those potentially receptive is Robert Rector, an analyst
at the Heritage Foundation whose views carry considerable influence
among conservative grass-roots groups. In a recent interview,
Rector said he would favor the bill if it was re-drafted to place
more emphasis on promoting marriage, ``not just a bunch of job
training.'' Rector also praised Shaw for having ``the political
courage'' to address family dissolution among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Shaw acknowledges that his evolution from program
cutter to program proponent makes for ``strange politics,
especially on the right.'' But he said that the forces put in play
by the welfare law left no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Do these guys deserve our help?''' he said. ``The
answer is, `No, but their kids do.'''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, he asked, ``Does anyone have a better idea?''

   MURRAY-CLINTON (Washington) Washington Sen. Patty Murray
Wednesday said she is angry and hurt by President Clinton's
conduct, and that she does not believe he adequately understands
how painful his behavior has been to his supporters. Murray's
comments, during a briefing for reporters, were her most extensive
to date on the Clinton-Lewinsky matter, and come as Wash. Rep.
Linda Smith is attacking Murray for failing to hold Clinton to the
same standard to which she held Brock Adams and Bob Packwood.
Murray's remarks are still less pointed than those of Richard
Gephardt or Dianne Feinstein, but given her predilection for mild
rhetoric, this is as far as she's going.

CONVICT SAYS PRISON BREEDS MORE ADDICTION
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 articles in heroin package (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He lied, cheated and stole from his family. He was
gunned down by a drug dealer and almost died. He spent the past
decade spinning through a revolving door in Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet John Hyder isn't confident that heroin has loosened its
death grip. And he sees a new generation of young addicts following
in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 34, and I sit back off to the side and see that the
system is flooded with youngsters,'' Hyder said in an interview at
the Lew Sterrett Justice Center in Dallas, where he was awaiting a
hearing on burglary charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prison system has become nothing more than a breeding
ground for our youngsters,'' he said. ``They learn how to be a
better addict, how to be a better hustler, manipulator and con
artist. Hey, I'm No. 1 on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyder dreamed of piloting a helicopter or becoming an artist,
until his heroin addiction took over. In and out of prison since
1989, he lost his first wife and three children when they got
``smart enough to get the hell out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his jail whites, Hyder wears a thin gold wedding band
given to him by his second wife, Vanessa, a heroin addict serving
time for burglary. Around his neck on a black leather string is a
St. Jude medallion _ patron saint of thieves, he points out _ and a
scapular medal, a Catholic symbol that he believes will save his
soul from the fires of hell.
</P>
<P>
   Hyder can't remember how many times he has been arrested. He
will, however, acknowledge the people he has hurt to feed a habit
that sometimes topped $400 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing the lengths we go to as addicts to get
high,'' Hyder said. ``We steal from our parents, our grandparents.
I've stolen everybody's stuff: rings, family heirlooms, antiques.
Stuff that can never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than his sister, Rhonda Benschoff, Hyder's relatives keep
their distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my brother, and I love him,'' said Benschoff, 39, of
Rowlett, noting that Hyder has stolen from most of their relatives.
``When my family talks about what he's done, I say, `This isn't
Johnny doing this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad doesn't understand. My sister doesn't understand,'' she
said. ``This is the drug. I learned that it is an addiction. But I
am not going to lie. I do want to say, `Johnny, why don't you just
not do the drugs?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hyder, a sixth-grade dropout, tried heroin for the first time
when he was 20. ``It's been a helluva habit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls frequenting a low-income neighborhood in Dallas to
score capsules of black tar heroin from his favorite dealer, who
cruised a 10-block area all day waiting for customers to page him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would meet us at a store,'' Hyder said. ``He was better
than Domino's.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Hyder was shot in the chest and abdomen by a dealer who
wanted to steal his jewelry and money. He almost died. But even
that failed to shock him out of his addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Hyder hasn't seen his son and two daughters since 1993. His
former wife married a Navy officer and now lives with the children
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have a role model to look to, and you know what? Who
am I to go in there and take that away from them?'' he said.
``Because I'm nothing but an addict. Everything I promise you, I'm
going to break. I wouldn't want to take that from my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyder met Vanessa at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting in October
1996. When she relapsed, so did he, and the crime sprees started
anew. The latest arrest _ in July 1997, five months after their
wedding _ came when he and his bride were caught stealing from his
uncle in Rockwall.
</P>
<P>
   Hyder is serving six years for the Rockwall burglary and was
sentenced last month to an additional six years in another case.
His wife is serving a nine-year sentence for burglary in Denton
County and a 10-year sentence for the Rockwall crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hyder continues to hope that he will beat his addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say `real treatment.' That's not going and sitting in a room
and watching some films and stepping out the door and saying, `Hey,
I'm cured,' '' he said. ``No, you're not. You're never cured.''
</P>
<P>
   His salvation, he says, will come only from hitting bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You finally get to a point where you're sick and tired,'' he
said. ``Drug use, I can assure you, that if you use, it will lead
you to three different things: jails, institutions or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to the first two and pretty close to the third
one.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ After two days of riots and looting by mobs
in a northern province, the Indonesian military halted its
withdrawal of troops from the region Wednesday in an effort to
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   The army sent several thousand fresh troops to Lhokseumauwe, a
medium-sized industrial city in the province of Aceh, where mobs
set on Chinese-owned shops on Monday and Tuesday. Two people were
killed and at least 10 were wounded when security forces fired into
a rampaging crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face is an embarrassing setback for the military,
which had portrayed its withdrawal as a conciliatory gesture toward
Aceh, a predominantly Muslim province in North Sumatra with a
fervent separatist movement. Rather than applaud the retreating
soldiers, the Acehnese pelted them with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday witnesses said a tense calm hung over Lhokseumauwe,
with no reports of mob violence. But the rest of Indonesia has been
rattled by the most serious eruption of unrest since the riots in
May in Jakarta that left 1,200 people dead and precipitated
President Suharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the powerful military is at the eye of the storm. In
a report Wednesday, the National Commission on Human Rights accused
the military of conducting a campaign of terror against the people
of Aceh since 1989, when Suharto sent in combat troops to quell the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military operations do not have to lead to human rights
violations,'' the vice president of the commission, Marsuki
Darusman, said. ``This was a situation where people were terrorized
and intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Human Rights Commission dug up mass graves in
Aceh that it said contained dozens of victims of army killings. The
commission estimated that more than 750 people had died at the
hands of soldiers in the occupation of Aceh for the last nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Darusman presented the full report on Aceh, which
accuses the military of a catalog of crimes, including summary
executions, torture, rape and sexual assault. ``We're recommending
that the officers and soldiers who served there be brought to
justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report has no binding authority on the government. Indeed
senior military and government officials have been openly skeptical
about the claims of widespread violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the report is the latest installment in what has become a
grim excavation of the military's role in Suharto-era Indonesia. In
July the commission said that the army had stood by as gangs raped
hundreds of ethnic Chinese women in the riots in Jakarta. And in
April the panel said security forces might have played in a role in
the kidnappings of several political activists.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage of accusations has put the military in an extremely
awkward position. On the one hand it is trying to fashion a more
benign image for itself in the post-Suharto era. Last month the
army discharged Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, the fiery son-in-law of
Suharto who spearheaded many of the military's less savory
adventures, including its occupation of East Timor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the other hand the army seems unwilling to be held
responsible for every atrocity in Suharto's 32 years in power. Last
week the chief of the armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, said that claims
that the military had shot hundreds of people in Aceh were
unconfirmed. And this week he said that the military had found no
evidence of mass rapes in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said the denials were fomenting unrest in places like
Aceh, where people already view the army with deep suspicion.
``There is a sense that the riots are more a reaction to comments
made in Jakarta,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some people here said the army might have instigated
the disorder in Aceh as a pretext to remain there. Witnesses said
the worst violence broke out in Lhokseumauwe on Tuesday, the day
after the last convoy of 659 troops had left the military
headquarters. Although people threw stones at the soldiers, they
saved their real fury for Chinese-owned stores, restaurants and
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto announced that he had ordered troops to return to Aceh
after a Cabinet meeting here Wednesday. ``It is the responsibility
of the armed forces to carry out its duty in safeguarding the whole
nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the new president, B.J. Habibie, the mayhem in Aceh could
jeopardize his campaign to resolve regional conflicts that began
under Suharto. Habibie has made progress in talks with Portugal
over East Timor. The withdrawal of troops from Aceh was to have
been another old wound healed.

MARKET PLACE: BROKERAGE STOCKS FALL VICTIM TO FICKLE MARKET

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shares of Wall Street brokerage firms have been battered in
recent weeks, in some cases falling more than 40 percent, suddenly
becoming pariahs after months, even years, when they were among the
market's darlings.
</P>
<P>
   So is this an opportunity for the smart, hardy investor to
profit, or would buying mean throwing good money after bad?
Analysts' answers to that depend on their views of the overall
market. If the market stabilizes and builds on its fledgling
recovery, brokerage-firm stocks might offer handsome opportunities,
but if the market's slide continues, they might best be left alone,
according to Wall Street wisdom on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been beaten down far more than the damage to date
would justify,'' said Raphael Soifer, bank analyst at Brown
Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co., the New York brokerage firm. ``For those
people interested in a recovery play, the brokerages are safer than
the banks,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank earnings are economically sensitive, while brokerage
earnings are market sensitive,'' said Soifer, who, like many
analysts, is recommending the stocks of bigger and more diversified
brokerage firms such as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. Those, like the group as a whole, rose Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch edged up 56.25 cents, to $67.8125, still down 37.9
percent from a high of $109.125 on July 13. Morgan Stanley advanced
$1.375, to $59, down 39.5 percent from its high of $97.50 on July
21.
</P>
<P>
   But, Soifer added, some investors may prefer to wait and see
whether the current market turmoil represents a correction or a
full-fledged bear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, they were the best-performing group in the S&AMP;P
index,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, who follows brokerage firms at
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. Now, she added, ``lack of earnings clarity,
as well as absolute fear'' has made these stocks one of the
worst-performing groups in the recent downdraft. For some, she
added, citing Morgan Stanley, ``it seems to be overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krawcheck said she had cut her expectations for Morgan's
third-quarter earnings by 10 percent to 15 percent, yet the stock
has plummeted almost 40 percent. ``That's overdone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities depend on your market view,'' Ms. Krawcheck
said. ``If one expects Latin America to roll over next, then, no,
they are not a buy. But if you expect a stabilization, then they
are a buy.'' The recent widening of credit spreads has particularly
hit Wall Street's bond and high-yield debt businesses _ where firms
like Lehman Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette have had to
mark down the value of their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman gained $2.50 Wednesday, to $42.125, just less than half
its high of $85 on July 13, and its price-to-earnings ratio is an
extraordinarily low 6.68, compared with 13.83 for Merrill and 12.45
for Morgan. Donaldson, up $1.75, to $34.125, is down from a high of
$63.75 on July 13 and has a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.89.
</P>
<P>
   At Donaldson, with its big high-yield business, Ms. Krawcheck
expects earnings of 31 cents a share for the three months ending
Sept. 30, compared with $1 or more in each of the first two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, forecasting brokerage-firm revenue in a rapidly
changing market is tricky when it is not clear what the effects
will be on volatile businesses such as junk bonds and
emerging-markets securities. ``We have opened up a box that history
says causes quite a lot of difficulty in forecasting revenue
flows,'' said Sam Liss, a managing director at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some are still confident that now is the time to
buy. ``Goldman did a call to clients this morning,'' said Richard
Strauss, a brokerage-firm analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``We came
out very bullish. We have lowered our numbers,'' for estimated
profits, ``but only very mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best vehicles for playing the rebound are Morgan
and Merrill,'' he added. ``For the most part, our estimate
revisions were less than 5 percent relative to a 40 percent
correction in these stocks.'' Goldman, of course, is planning its
own multibillion-dollar initial public offering, and its market
strategist, Abby Joseph Cohen, has produced some of the most
bullish stock-market forecasts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, there is little hope that the rapid consolidation among
financial-services firms might soon resume and help buoy stock
prices of brokerage firms. ``Most buyers are scared,'' said one
Wall Street financial adviser who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. He added that more mergers of brokerage firms were
unlikely until there was a lot more pain on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mergers have to be willingly done in this business,'' said
Soifer, who cautioned that otherwise a brokerage firm's most prized
assets _ its people _ would leave. And, he added, brokerage firms
``have to have gone through quite a thin time, enough of a thin
time for their credit and counterparty risks to come under
attack,'' before they would willingly contemplate a merger. &QL;

<P>
   As heroin streams into Texas from Mexico by every means
imaginable, the mechanisms of law enforcement appear to be
outmatched. Everyone, from federal agents, military officials and
police to judges and probation officers, struggles against the
momentum of multibillion-dollar trafficking organizations.
</P>

   This week, as part of the Star-Telegram's intensified coverage
of heroin abuse, we examine the battle that federal, state and
local authorities are waging on heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of us is touched by the war on drugs, which consumes
billions of tax dollars each year. Lawmakers are facing crucial
decisions on whether to escalate the battle with more resources,
more staffing and tougher laws. But with each new effort to stop
heroin and punish those who sell and use it, traffickers counter
with their nearly unlimited resources, their constantly shifting
strategies and increasing violence.

BOON DAY FOR INVESTORS IN CANCER DRUG MANUFACTURERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCI-BREAST-TAMOXIFEN.) 
(jt) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday was a boon for investors in three makers of cancer
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration
recommended the approval of tamoxifen as a means to reduce the risk
of breast cancer, the shares of Zeneca Group PLC, which makes the
drug, and Barr Laboratories, which sells its generic form, both
rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca's American depository receipts, each of which represents
one share of the British company, jumped 13.5 percent, to $43,
before retreating in the afternoon. They closed at $38.4375, up
56.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   At Barr Laboratories headquarters in Pomona, N.J., executives
had other good news. Before the advisory committee gave a thumbs-up
to tamoxifen, the FDA itself approved the sale of the company's
Preven Emergency Contraceptive Kit. The kit is the first
FDA-approved device to prevent pregnancy within 72 hours after sex.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Barr Laboratories soared 36.4 percent, closing at
$35.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our projects have been around for a while,'' said
Bruce Downey, the chairman and chief executive officer of Barr
Laboratories. ``What we saw today is the recognition that these
projects are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech Inc., which is based in South San Francisco, also
received FDA advisory committee approval for Herceptin, the brand
name for a biological drug to treat metastatic breast cancer. The
company's shares closed at $66.75, up $1.75.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA usually follows its committees' recommendations, and
analysts usually ponder how new drugs could alter the
pharmaceutical playing field.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, tamoxifen and Herceptin are seen as the first of
a new spate of cancer drugs that could prove to be enormous
sellers. Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment firm in New York, expects sales of
tamoxifen to swell from $320 million in the United States last year
to $640 million within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen has been sold for years to treat breast cancer, and
some analysts had thought that its approval as a way to reduce the
risk of breast cancer could hurt several other drugs that may enter
the market. The most notable casualty would have been Evista, a
drug made by Eli Lilly for the prevention of osteoporosis that the
company wants to have approved for the prevention of breast cancer,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Taurel, the chairman of Eli Lilly, said that tamoxifen in
its new role would actually create a market for breast cancer
prevention drugs, thus probably helping Evista.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research
Partners, said: ``There is plenty of room for several drugs to
treat this disease. You could say that drugs for this category with
always be a growth industry. This disease is horrible for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are also eager to see how tamoxifen might affect Zeneca
as a merger target. The company has long been mentioned as ideal
for several large European drug companies, including SmithKline
Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you would change any merger valuations
based on tamoxifen's projected sales,'' Mehta said. ``But it could
have an affect on Zeneca in that it could certainly make the
company more confident.''

   PHOENIX - Were it not for the time-consuming and costly efforts
of Phoenix City Council, the good citizens of our community would
have no concept of the important work performed for us by people
like ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize it myself until shortly after noon Wednesday,
when the young thin woman took her first slow steps onto the stage
of The Jungle Cabaret in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   She strolled lazily past the kind of artificial waterfall you
might have constructed for the seventh grade science fair _ and
gotten a C _ then continued past the statue of a lioness.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped and turned, looking over her shoulder toward an
audience she probably couldn't see.
</P>
<P>
   It was dimmer than midnight inside the place, with only
occasional flashes of light, as if the room were being illuminated
by a distant thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of so patrons sat around small tables below the stage.
</P>
<P>
   None of them took note of Jesse's entrance, although it had been
announced by the amplified voice of a disc jockey shouting over the
opening strains of Prince's ``Little Red Corvette.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse wore high-heeled shoes and enough of a bathing suit to
make a slingshot, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The men seated before her had an uninterested air about them.
Perhaps it was ignorance. My guess is they hadn't attended the City
Council meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If they'd been there, they'd have been more appreciative. They'd
have understood the enormous civic obligation someone like Jesse
must carry on her wispy shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The disc jockey seemed to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on boys!'' he shouted. ``Don't be shy. Put your hands
together.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   One man in a white shirt and tie did approach the stage. Jesse
leaned over him, placed her hands on his shoulders and let her hair
brush against his face. Then she pulled the string of her bikini
away from her hip, just a little, while he slipped a dollar bill
under it.
</P>
<P>
   If the council has it's way, such exchanges will be carefully
monitored, particularly the touching part, which will be legal only
during the moment the money is exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Council wants to subject the members of
Jesse's profession to the kind of rigorous licensing requirements
and background checks usually reserved for police officers or
public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a sideshow,'' said Councilman John Nelson. ``This
is a very serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, why would our politicians spend so much of their time
and so much of your money studying the work habits of women like
Jesse?
</P>
<P>
   Why would they then devise new forms of license and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they commit the resources of law enforcement and
government bureaucracy to enforcing them?
</P>
<P>
   If Council gets its way, dancers in places like The Jungle
Cabaret will be made to obtain a special identification card.
They'll be fingerprinted and run through crime computers. They'll
go through a more rigorous screening process than it takes to get a
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   To work in retail selling weapons.
</P>
<P>
   To advise the ignorant on ``nutritional supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   To baby-sit.
</P>
<P>
   When the top of Jesse's bathing suit dropped to the floor, it
wasn't gravity that did it, but the weight of her responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would government be so interested in a person whose
background _ and foreground _ become a matter of public record
every fifth of sixth song during the average lunch hour?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Jesse's occupation has tremendous community value.
If not, if it wasn't worth a damn, it would be like all the
professions that require no fingerprint taking, no background
check, no nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapering, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   And politics. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Sept. 6,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PUPPET-FESTIVAL (New York &UR; )  &LR; _ There has been a great increase
in this high-art notion of adult puppet theater in the United
States over the last 20 years as vanguard American artists have
turned to the medium, and as work from countries where puppetry was
never ghettoized for children has been brought to the New York
stage. The most important venue for new puppet work is the biennial
International Festival of Puppet Theater, produced by Cheryl
Henson, Leslee Asch and the Henson Foundation. The fourth festival
opens Wednesday. By Andrew Solomon. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VIDEOBOYZ-MOVIES (Los Angeles) _ It has been said that anyone
could produce a movie: all you needed was money, the ability to
hire good people and very good, or very bad, taste (as long as you
were consistent). But to direct one you surely needed concrete
experience, every John Ford and Preston Sturges move at the ready
and a proven ability to handle actors. Well, that was then but
maybe not now, when a new generation of aspiring movie makers are
getting incredible opportunities based largely on razzle-dazzle.
And when overnight successes like the brothers Peter and Bobby
Farrelly (``Dumb and Dumber'' and ``There's Something About Mary,''
which together have so far earned $150 million) are flaunting their
lack of knowledge and style rather than kissing the studio grounds
on which Billy Wilder once walked. By Michelle Willens. (Moved). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HANDSPRING-PUPPET-THEATER (Johnannesburg, South Africa) _ Basil
Jones and Adrian Kohler, founders of the Handspring Puppet Company,
will lead off the International Festival of Puppet Theater in New
York with ``Ubu and the Truth Commission.'' The two men are South
Africa's premier puppeteers. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MULTI-ACT-BALLETS (Undated) _ Today, when abstractions dominate
many ballet repertories, it's tempting to proclaim plots
unimportant. Dance is an art of movement, and the best story in the
world cannot disguise unimaginative choreography. Nevertheless,
should choreographers wish to tell tales, good stories can help
make good choreography look even better. This is especially true of
full-evening productions. Recent months have offered several
imposing multi-act story ballets, ranging from Marius Petipa's
19th-century blendings of classicism and exoticism to Boris
Eifman's contemporary balletic expressionism. By Jack Anderson.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   EQUESTRIAN-DANCE (Paris) _ Equestrian art may be as old as
ancient Greece, but Bartabas, the founder and director of the
Paris-based Zingaro Equestrian Theater, still likes to think he is
doing something new. He may well be right. Carving a niche for
himself somewhere between the classical dressage of, say, Vienna's
legendary Spanish Riding School and the athletic antics of circus
horses, the 41-year-old Frenchman has created an equestrian show
that underlines the emotional power of horses. By Alan Riding.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HANDEL-OPERAS (New York) _ Handel has changed. For pretty much
two centuries after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily
as a composer of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas:
music that bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and
decisiveness. His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in
tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920s. On Friday, the second
night of its new season, the New York City Opera will present
Handel's ``Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass
during the summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas
have just appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-TEACHERS (Undated) _ Teachers come in different
shapes and sizes, and finding the right fit might sort out some of
the educational controversies going on at the Tanglewood Festival
up in Lenox, Mass. The troubles have been well rehearsed in these
pages, and are not likely to go away when the season ends this
weekend. Have Tanglewood's long-respected summer programs been
emasculated by dismissals and resignations, or have they been
reinvigorated by a new involvement on the part of the Boston
Symphony and its music director, Seiji Ozawa? By Bernard Holland.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COURTNEY-LOVE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Courtney Love's songs for Hole
on the band's third album, ``Celebrity Skin'' (Geffen), are bound
to be heard in the context of a life made for tabloid headlines.
Ms. Love is a former stripper turned punk singer and the widow of a
suicidal, heroin-using, million-selling rock star, Kurt Cobain.
After his death in 1994, she went on turn herself into a surgically
altered, couture-wearing, Oscar-nominated actress, apparently
becoming the kind of Hollywood figure that many of her punky
original fans detested. By Jon Pareles. (Moved). &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EMMYLOU-HARRIS-MUSIC (Undated) _ Emmylou Harris has always
zigged when the rest of the music world has zagged. But after doing
country long before it was remotely cool, and then getting exiled
by country radio along with virtually everyone else over 40, she
seems more adept than ever at finding the seams between the
formulas emanating from Nashville and the commercial no man's land,
vaguely known as alternative country, outside the Nashville
mainstream. By Peter Applebome. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ERNESTO-PUJOL-ART (New York) _ Moody, meticulously staged and
filled with introspective symbolism, the room-size works of Ernesto
Pujol have been fixtures on the international art circuit in recent
years and, in the eyes of many, examples of installation art at its
most evocative. In his newest work, he has branched off into
fine-art photography, and the Linda Kirkland Gallery will present
his first photographic efforts in a group show titled ``Some Like
It Hot'' _ hot as in sexy, seductive or fetishistic. The exhibition
opens Saturday and runs through Oct. 17. By Edward M. Gomez.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES-INGO-FREED-ARCH (Washington) _ Bad things happen to good
architects. James Ingo Freed is the man who designed the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum, one of the most powerful
buildings of our time. It gives me no pleasure to report that
Freed's most recent project, the Ronald Reagan Building, is a
disappointing piece of work. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MARSHALL-MEMENTOS-ART (Undated) _ Kerry James Marshall, the
black artist whose paintings depict the civil rights struggle of
the 1960s, will have his first New York exhibition at the Brooklyn
Museum entitled ``Mementos.'' By Barry Schwabsky. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EARTH-TO-MOON-TV (Undated) _ Next month, on its Signature
channel, HBO will rebroadcast ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' which
was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards (to be presented next Sunday).
Columbia House Video Library has released the series to its
members. By Peter M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-SMIGEL-TV (New York) _ Robert Smigel, who does Bill
Clinton's voice on the Conan O'Brien show, real occupation is
writing cartoons for ``Saturday Night Live.'' ``It's more like a
hobby, the stuff I do with Conan,'' says Smigel, 38, who lives in
Manhattan. ``It's just vaudeville.'' By Anita Gates. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CONAN-O'BRIEN-TV (Undated) _ In 1993, only one person in America
could possibly have foreseen the day when Conan O'Brien would be so
popular on late-night television that NBC would hand him an hour of
prime time to celebrate his fifth anniversary on the air: Conan
O'Brien _ in his wildest dreams. But if anybody has earned the
right to have his wildest dreams taken seriously it is O'Brien, 35,
who will indeed see that once stupefyingly unlikely event come to
pass on Sept. 16, when ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' hits the
big time. Right there at 10 p.m., where ``Law and Order'' usually
presides, it is going to be Conan, front and center, the man of the
hour, the host, the star. By Bill Carter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCRIMSHAWING-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The hardy seamen who took up
scrimshawing to pass the time during long voyages in search of
whales more than a century ago would probably be dismayed to learn
that their handiwork had been enlisted in the cause of feminism.
But consider the evidence. The finely engraved teeth, the whalebone
pie crimpers, bodkins and busks that they made as gifts for their
wives and sweethearts back home were tokens of affection that in
the sexual politics of today might be construed as the actions of
tough guys wanting to show their soft side. An exhibition of 52
pieces of scrimshaw is currently at Snug Harbor Cultural Center's
Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art on Staten Island. By Fletcher
Roberts. (Moved).
</P>

<P>
   PAPERBACKS (Undated) (Moved.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;

   TRAVEL-BARGAINS (Undated) _ Travel bargain deals. By Janet
Piorko. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-SANFRAN (Undated) _ In San Francisco, spruced-up
Chinatown. By Frank Bruni. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (Undated) _ Medevac policies prevent big
bills. By Betsy Wade. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ CDC warns of flu in Alaska and Yukon;
Upgrades on American to get tougher in '99; New folk art collection
on view in Santa Fe; Seattle symphony gets a new home (and view).
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Questions and answers on travel. This
week: London architecture; Notes on volts; Portrait of Tuebingen.

help. Sounds like what we used to get from our parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``very much want
Russia to succeed.'' As long as we don't have to listen to
political speeches about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the future of Russia,'' says Mr. Clinton. No
doubt he wishes he were as certain about the future of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Russians need to know, says the president, there are no
``painless solutions.'' Unfaithful husbands, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says Russia should ``reject the failed policies of
the past.'' As he himself did when he decided to tell the truth
about Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president says one reason for his trip to Russia is to
``tell them that the easy thing to do is not the right thing to
do.'' That's a sermon he might have done well to preach to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems that develop beyond our borders,'' Mr. Clinton says,
``sooner or later find their way to our doorstep.'' Where they must
compete for attention with home-grown problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our fundamental economic policy is sound,'' the
president says. But some days it sounds like a scream of someone
jumping off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation will ever have a monopoly on ideas,'' says Mr.
Clinton. True. Bad ideas come from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   September is nature's way of reminding everyone that there are
parts of the world where it's already too late to send Christmas
presents by ship.

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton signaled Wednesday that the West
would step up its aid to Russia if the Kremlin pressed ahead with
tough economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   His message, intended to encourage Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's government to stick with its capitalist-oriented course
despite the nation's deepening economic crisis, capped a two-day
summit conference dominated by a collapsing ruble and a government
that has been paralyzed by its battles with an emboldened Communist
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the reform process can be completed, then I for one would
be strongly supportive of greater assistance to Russia from the
United States and the other big economic powers,'' Clinton said
during a joint news conference with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia recently negotiated a $17 billion bailout with the
International Monetary Fund, of which $4.8 billion has been
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial turmoil that has rocked the Yeltsin government
has led the United States to think about further steps to speed and
expand Western assistance.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials do not have a detailed plan of just how much
additional aid might be provided and where the funds would come
from.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has told his aides that the United States should be
prepared to lead a new international aid effort, which could draw
on the Group of Seven industrialized nations and on international
organizations such as the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a clear movement toward reform, I'll do everything
I can to accelerate outside support of all kinds,'' Clinton said,
echoing assurances that were also provided in private meetings with
Yeltsin, according to Clinton's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Providing further assistance to Russia is far from a popular
idea within the U.S. Congress and among some U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton aides said that giving Russia billions in new aid would
be a small price to pay if it would help keep Russia's young
democracy on a reform course and prevent the rise of an
anti-Western regime.
</P>
<P>
   However, they stressed that fresh assistance would only be
provided if the Kremlin demonstrates it has the political will not
just to talk about reforms but to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely critical for the well-being of the United
States for decades to come that Russia not lurch backwards,'' a
senior U.S. official said. ``But we have also made it clear that
Russia needs to take steps to insure that the money that is here
stays here and does not leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russia can summon the determination to put its economic
house in order, however, is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yeltsin vowed to proceed with economic reforms and
reappointed Boris Fyodorov, an aide who backs a strong free-market
policy, as deputy prime minister. No sooner was Fyodorov officially
restored than he began talking about tough measures to stabilize
Russia's battered currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need from the United States is political support,
support for Russian reforms,'' Yeltsin said. ``Then all investors
who want to come to the reformed Russia will come.''
</P>
<P>
   However, few believe that gestures alone will accomplish this.
For example, Yeltsin still lacks a prime minister, leaving in doubt
the Kremlin's overall commitment to economic reform and its ability
to garner support for its policies.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's current choice for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, was decisively rejected by the Communist-led
parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another vote on Chernomyrdin's nomination is scheduled for
Friday, but his opponents say he sure to lose again.
</P>
<P>
   A third defeat would result in the dissolution of the
legislature and in new parliamentary elections, according to
Russia's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a major escalation in the Kremlin's tug of
war with the Communists. But it is far from clear whether the
politically and physically weakened Yeltsin has the will for the
fight. Wednesday, he dodged a question on his commitment to
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Yeltsin appears to be pondering whether he
should abandon Chernomyrdin for a new candidate like Konstantin
Titov, the reform-minded governor of the Samara region; Yegor
Stroyev, the head of the upper house of parliament and a Yeltsin
ally; or Yuri Luzkhov, the powerful Moscow mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The delays in forming a new government have also put off the
economic decisions that are needed to extract the nation from its
crisis and regain credibility with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, for example, was scheduled to decide whether to
distribute the next $4.3 billion installment of its loan by
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the fund's number two official, said that the
IMF would be unlikely to take up the matter before October, if not
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what we know now about the changes in the exchange rate,
of course difficulties in the banking system, possible difficulties
in the budget, it's clear that the Russians will have to do quite a
lot before that money could be released,'' Fischer told Cable News
Network program ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's timetable clashed with the Clinton administration's
promise to try to accelerate aid, pointing to the confusion in the
Western ranks about how to help Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But without a new government in place even Yeltsin's biggest
boosters found it difficult to make the case for speedy help.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the addled Russian political scene, Wednesday's summit
meeting was more substantive than many observers had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration scheduled the summit conference,
hoping to promote Russian ratification of START-2 strategic arms
treaty. It soon found the START-2 issue issue overtaken by the rush
of economic events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two leaders signed arms an accord to sharing missile
warning data, a measure to lessen the chance of an accidental
nuclear war. They also agreed to begin disposing of bomb-grade
plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his sessions with Yeltsin to encourage him to stay
the economic course.
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with opposition politicians Wednesday,
Clinton tried to persuade Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov of the
need to play by the rules of the free market. There was no sign
that Clinton made any headway on that score _ or in persuading the
Communists to cooperate with Yeltsin. However, some opposition
leaders said that Clinton did the right thing by coming.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the liberal Yabloko party, said
many Russians appreciated that President Clinton had gone through
with the summit conference, despite the nation's latest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right idea to come,'' he said. ``Clinton was a
brave man to come to Russia in the conditions we are in now.''

CRATE &AMP; BARREL ROLLS INTO PHOENIX AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - After 35 years of running the show at Crate &AMP; Barrel,
Gordon Segal could call it a career.
</P>
<P>
   He could shop for some nice beach furniture, find a quiet
stretch of sand and spend some time watching the waves. He could
live the life people dream about when they buy Powerball tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not his idea of a good time. Segal, 59, still has the
same verve for retailing that got him into the business of selling
housewares in a bare-bones store that used packing crates and
barrels as merchandise fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking to build a chain of stores. I wasn't looking
to go public and make a killing. I had none of those motivations 35
years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some neat product for cooking and dining that wasn't
available in the United States, and we thought it would be fun to
bring it here and see if we could sell it and make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel turned out to be a very neat way to make a
living. From its start in an old elevator factory in Chicago, the
company has expanded to 77 stores in 15 U.S. markets plus a catalog
business that is both a moneymaker and a marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Its next stop is Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, Ariz.
The store there will anchor a mall extension that connects to a new
Nordstrom store across the street. The mall is getting Crate &AMP;
Barrel's top-of-the-line format, the combination housewares and
furniture store that the company puts in showcase spots like
Madison Avenue in New York and Michigan Avenue in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel was a big catch for Fashion Square. It took 10
years of talking by the mall's owner, Westcor Partners, to make the
deal for a store that Biltmore Fashion Park in Phoenix also
aggressively pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel's entry in the Valley was delayed by a couple of
things. The company had other markets it wanted to get into first,
and Segal said it wanted a spot where it could put one of the
combination stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very much looking at the Biltmore at one time and
thinking should we put it there,'' Segal said. ``But when you had
to think of where would you put one store, we felt this was more
near the core between Scottsdale and Phoenix. It was a hard
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35,000-square-foot store opens Sept. 18, along with
Nordstrom and about 50 other shops and restaurants. The store's
first floor will be furniture, and the second will be housewares.
The furniture floor has street access for shoppers who don't want
to walk through the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The layout is designed to look light and airy; it has a large
staircase, as well as crating wood on the walls, a reminder of the
company's first store in Old Town Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The store itself, even without the product, is going to be
beautiful. It's just going to show off the product beautifully,''
said Terri Kail, the Scottsdale store's housewares manager.
</P>
<P>
   The store will be loaded with what Segal said is the sort of
out-of-the-ordinary merchandise that Crate &AMP; Barrel strives to
find: cookware, glassware, dinnerware, gadgets and the casual
furniture that Crate &AMP; Barrel sees as a big part of its identity as
a destination for shoppers who no longer want to live in
off-the-rack homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has gotten more sophisticated,'' Segal said.
``People want nicer things for their homes. After you get to a
certain level of having enough of everything else, you start
focusing on your home and how you furnish it and how you build it
and decorate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The retailing landscape is packed with companies trying to cash
in on the home craze. Besides traditional furniture stores, there
are superstores like Linens 'N Things and such specialty retailers
as Restoration Hardware, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel thrives by pushing to find merchandise that no
one else has and selling it for what Segal said are ``fair-value''
prices. Attitude also is important. Crate &AMP; Barrel first looks for
nice people when it's hiring, then drills them on merchandise and
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay humble; stay nervous'' is the company's motto.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retail, you're only as good as your last transaction,''
Segal said. ``You really don't have a chance to make good if you
screw up too many times with customers. People are more demanding,
and they're more critical, and there's more competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel is a private company and doesn't release detailed
financial information. Segal did say the company expects to ring up
sales of $480 million in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Catalog shopping accounts for 8 percent to 10 percent of Crate &AMP;
Barrel's business. The company uses the catalog primarily as an
advertising and marketing tool and plans to jump into Internet
retailing this year.
</P>
<P>
   Crate &AMP; Barrel recently expanded its store at Park Meadows, a
Denver-area mall, to add furniture to its housewares offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Beaudry, the mall's marketing director, said the expansion
made the store even more popular since the area, like the Valley,
is in a home-building boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're building the new home,'' she said. ``It's 2,000 square
feet. You need to fill it. Or you're working from home. And people
are doing more entertaining. It has to do with people spending more
and more time focused on their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kail thinks that shoppers will warm up to the Scottsdale store
quickly and that the company will want another Valley location in a
couple of years. She's worked for Crate &AMP; Barrel for 10 years and
has been involved in the management of four stores, unusual loyalty
in a business where turnover is common, sometimes rapid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the company,'' she said. ``I love what it sells. It's
an extremely fun place to work. I enjoy coming to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Segal says.
</P>
<P>
   After more than three decades, he still is a cheerleader for the
business, still loves to get into the stores and still gives his
trademark pep talk to the staff of every new store before it opens
on its first day of business.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't sound like a guy headed for the beach any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much enjoy this business,'' he said. ``I work at it
very hard. I very much enjoy my people. I enjoy the projects we
undertake. I enjoy the product we sell. Yes, I'm very involved. I
don't play golf. I work at my business five, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started it with enthusiasm. We've still got it. The day we
lose it we should get out of it. It's too hard if you're not
enthusiastic, if you're not having fun. It's a hard business.'' &QL;

DEALER SAYS HE SOLD TO FEED HIS ADDICTION

EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY BLANEY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALTOM CITY, Texas _ Like an evangelist, Jason M. spread his
gospel about heroin to stoke its sale to his friends and their
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, man. You gotta try this,'' he would tell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would glamorize it, and I didn't let them know what it would
do to them,'' the 21-year-old Haltom City man said. ``I was a
dealer; I didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason estimates that his sales pitch hooked at least 30 people
during the four years that he pushed heroin in Northeast Tarrant
County before he entered a court-ordered treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions, Jason filled a syringe with black tar heroin
and injected it into the veins of friends who were first-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never put the needle in their arms,'' said Jason, who
asked that his last name not be used. ``Guess what I did? And I've
got to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason was never arrested on heroin charges. But the threat that
he could get caught didn't deter him because, like most
street-level heroin dealers, he was just as hooked as his
customers.
</P>
<P>
   His only criminal conviction was for marijuana possession. Even
as he was standing in a Fort Worth courtroom being sentenced last
year, the pager in his pocket was vibrating to alert him that a
customer was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the courtroom, he paid a fine, took the first of
12 urine tests that he subsequently failed and climbed into his
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   He drove to a nearby drugstore, where he bought syringes. From
there, he headed for a club in Dallas, where he had arranged some
sales. Before he got there, Jason made sure that he found his own
steady stream of black happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason first, that was my philosophy,'' said the green-eyed,
soft-spoken father of two young children.
</P>
<P>
   Jason began doing methamphetamines and smoking marijuana when he
was 12. He dropped out of school in sixth grade. By 17, he was
doing heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, he said, he had someone injecting cocaine in one of
his arms while someone else sent heroin coursing through the veins
of his other arm.
</P>
<P>
   Jason began dealing heroin to feed his $300-a-day habit.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling in the money, he said, had as much allure as getting
enough junk to pump into his veins. He cleared $3,000 or more a
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money fosters a mentality that precludes any 9-to-5
employment efforts, said Dennis Longmire, a criminal justice
professor at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not unlike white-collar criminals. It's hard to tell
somebody that can make a million on a bank job that they need to
continue their $52,000-a-year job,'' Longmire said. ``The same kind
of thinking takes place with these street dealers. Most are young,
rational, most weigh the consequences with the alternatives, and to
them it makes a lot more economic sense for them to deal heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   From the time Jason awakened until he called his day done, he
was busy filling the needs of his customers.
</P>
<P>
   He replenished his supply every three days or so, getting as
much as 4 ounces of black tar heroin at a time from a supplier in
south Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted the help of others to distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fronted out my dope so I wouldn't have to sit on it,'' Jason
said.
</P>
<P>
   When users dialed his pager, they punched in their telephone
numbers before adding a numerical code to identify themselves to
Jason. Then they added numbers for the quantity of heroin they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, I could decide whether I wanted to mess with it,''
he said. ``I had plenty of clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients who wanted to buy a large quantity _ 15 capsules or more
of chiva, a powdered form of black tar heroin _ went to his home.
For smaller sales, Jason hopped in his Chevrolet S-10 pickup and
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Jason packed a pistol when he went on delivery rounds for fear
of being robbed, although he never was. He used only ground
telephones, avoiding cellular and cordless ones that can be
monitored on police scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had dope on me, I'd be real paranoid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the back of his mind, he said, he always knew that his
grandfather could get him an attorney on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   But after he left the area and failed to report to his probation
officer, he was ordered into a 120-day substance abuse program in
Mansfield. During his four months in the residential program, he
got counseling and passed a high school equivalency examination.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hasn't felt the opiate course through his veins in
almost six months.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jason says he has a plan for his future. Foremost, he
yearns to be with his children on their birthdays. He would like to
become a welder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a want to learn now,'' Jason said. ``I never had
anything but the desire to do my dope.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to help others who are battling drug abuse,
perhaps through counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been hurting people for so long, I feel I owe people,''
he said. ``I never cared back then what I was doing to people.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Taking up a whole page in Daily Variety recently
was a story about a young six-man Swedish advertising team known as
Traktor that had been signed to direct a feature film in the United
States. (Albeit a small one by Hollywood standards, a mere $10
million.)
</P>
<P>
   The article explained that Traktor's ``idiosyncratic
sensibilities'' had been applied to some 200 commercials. The
group, it seems, directs in pairs, giving it ``the good benefits of
being four eyes,'' the piece went on to say.
</P>
<P>
   While Traktor readies its first feature film, ``Shiny New
Enemies,'' Hype Williams, 29, will be putting the finishing touches
on his, the urban thriller ``Belly.'' The film will be released in
November by Artisan Entertainment, a production company that beat
out heated competition to nab Williams, a music video director who
is considered as good as it gets in that arena.
</P>
<P>
   And so you might ask, is this what getting to direct a movie has
come to? Win an award for a Miller Lite spot or a Sean (Puffy)
Combs video, and you're this close to a six-picture package?
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that anyone could produce a movie: all you
needed was money, the ability to hire good people and very good, or
very bad, taste (as long as you were consistent). But to direct one
you surely needed concrete experience, every John Ford and Preston
Sturges move at the ready and a proven ability to handle actors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was then but maybe not now, when a new generation of
aspiring movie makers are getting incredible opportunities based
largely on razzle-dazzle. And when overnight successes like the
brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``Dumb and Dumber'' and
``There's Something About Mary,'' which together have so far earned
$150 million) are flaunting their lack of knowledge and style
rather than kissing the studio grounds on which Billy Wilder once
walked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all supplicants in today's film world, and there's a
deplorable tendency to assume the audience's attention span of a
gnat and to look for those who can play to that,'' said the veteran
producer David Brown (``Deep Impact''), whose career spans three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we call them the gnat pack? Long on visual, short on
content and complexity. Are they responsible for the potholed plots
and one-dimensional characters prevalent in mainstream movies?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bay, the young director behind ``The Rock'' and
``Armageddon,'' is surely the scapegoat of the year, a fact that
many of his own contemporaries think is unfair and studio
executives seem perfectly willing to ignore. The latter are already
seeking out the next Bays, hoping these directors have the pulse of
American moviegoers who have grown up with the remote control and
the sound bite _ and that their high-voltage style can attract a
worldwide audience that seeks nonstop action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoping'' is the operative word here: ``It's probably true some
of these young directors will be great at transferring from
commercials and videos to movies,'' said Gareth Wigan, a co-vice
chairman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Pictures. ``But a music video
has two and a half minutes to tell a story, and the question is,
How do you hold a story for two hours?''
</P>
<P>
   Amir Milan, the president of Artisan Entertainment, acknowledged
the risks, but believes that ``the possible rewards are greater.''
``These guys think with their eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a long list of those with the thinking eyes, including
Mark Romanek, Spike Jonze, David Fincher, Mark Pellington, Scott
Kalvert, Williams, F. Gary Gray, Brett Ratner, Paul Hunter, Kevin
Kerslake, Gary Fleder, Adam Bernstein and Michele Gondry.
</P>
<P>
   A few have arrived, most notably Fincher (``Seven,'' ``The
Game''), whom many point to as the ideal model, the anti-Bay if you
will. A modern young man but one steeped in film lore, with style
and ambition to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the real deal,'' said the longtime producer Art Linson,
who is working with Fincher on his newest film, ``Fight Club,''
which stars Brad Pitt. ``He may come out of music videos and
commercials but those were always stepping stones for him; he knows
everything about the movie-making process. I'd call him the
wonderful exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell if he is the exception or if the others can also
do more than just bring in da noise. The director William Friedkin
(``The Exorcist,'' ``The French Connection'') asserts that the gnat
pack _ many of whom cite him, along with his 70s contemporaries
like Francis Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese and Hal
Ashby as role models _ far surpasses its elders technically,
largely because of the instruments at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the X factor, which is inspiration, even genius, can't be
acquired with a Steadicam or the latest gadget,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Genius may or may not come, but in the meantime their technical
prowess is often being sought not only to please restless youth but
also to compensate for mediocre material. Begging the question:
could the sinners of today's cinema instead be the saviors?
</P>
<P>
   When Gary Fleder, 35, who had made commercials and the 1995
independent film ``Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,'' was
approached by the producer David Brown about directing this year's
``Kiss the Girls,'' he was looking at pretty standard stuff. Still.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my chance to do a genre film like `Klute' and `Cape
Fear,' and I wanted to see if I could succeed,'' said Fleder, who
got to work with the stars Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. ``I
tried to turn a pretty conventional story unconventional, making
the point of view less the killers' and more the good guys'. More
of a psychological, 70s-style thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedkin said, ``He made a very familiar story about serial
killers that we all thought we'd never want to watch somehow
watchable.'' Similarly, F. Gary Gray, 28, had earned a reputation
making music videos and some smaller films (``Friday'' and ``Set It
Off'') when he was offered ``The Negotiator,'' a $50 million
feature that opened in July.
</P>
<P>
   Most reviews pointed out the routine nature of the story, but
almost all said that the director's control of tension and the
performances of his two stars, Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson,
made the film work.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Rush Hour,'' starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, is
released on Sept. 18, audiences can decide if Brett Ratner, 28, is
another video master who can turn chopped live into pate. (Or at
least is worthy of his three-picture deal with New Line.) Ratner
did what was asked of him last year, giving the middling ``Money
Talks,'' an action comedy staring Charlie Sheen, some much-needed
adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ratner makes no apologies for his style and claims it has
remained consistent through his shift of mediums. ``Even my videos
were more like mini-movies, telling a story,'' he said. ``But I do
have a short attention span, and I feel if I'm looking at my watch
it's time to cut to the next scene. The story isn't driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Others of the Millennium Generation are just saying no to
mediocre material, and holding out for something more personal, or
something that allows them to veer drastically from the fast-paced
glitz they've become associated with.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pellington, 36, had come off a very successful career doing
promos and videos at MTV (along with some commercials and
mini-documentaries) when he decided he was ready to make the move
to the big screen. He spent more than a year working with a
screenwriter to adapt Dan Wakefield's book ``Going All the Way,''
about two young Korean War veterans in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The film (starring a then-unknown Ben Affleck) did little
business last fall. But no one could accuse it of moving too fast
and not concentrating on the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Now he tries again with the forthcoming ``Arlington Road,''
starring Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins. ``There's more pressure on
the second one,'' conceded Pellington, ``this one being $25
million, the last about $3 million. I'm still learning that on the
big screen the cuts control you, while with videos I control the
cuts. I'm shedding old skins and growing new ones. But no one will
call this a quick-cut MTV movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Romanek, in his mid-30s, wants his feature debut to be
something that matches the stately, photographlike quality he
brought to videos for artists like Nine Inch Nails, Beck, REM and
others. After turning down some big screen offers, he hopes to go
long form finally with an autobiography of the photographer Diane
Arbus.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Jonze, 28, another of the most respected MTV directors of
the moment, also turned down many big-screen offers before recently
starting the offbeat comedy ``Being John Malkovich,'' for Gramercy
Pictures, starring Cameron Diaz and John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   Their admirable reluctance to leap too soon from being videoboyz
to men is partly due to a sensitivity toward the MTV-bashing as
well as watching some of their contemporaries founder. Adam
Bernstein, 38, who made some 70 videos over 10 years, got his first
movie opportunity with ``It's Pat,'' a ``Saturday Night
Live''-inspired enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Though it did lead to offers like ``Camp Wanna Barf,'' Bernstein
said he despised the lack of participation working with a big
studio and is ``determined to have more control over what I do
next.'' True to his word, Bernstein directed an independent
feature, ``Six Ways to Sunday,'' to be released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Some will surely fall out, but for now, ``they are very often
being picked over more experienced directors simply because they
haven't failed yet,'' said David Brown, who 20 years ago took a
chance on a new kid named Spielberg by giving him ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spielberg generation was considered the last truly serious
students of film, growing up at the feet of heroes like Ford and
Welles, riding every New Wave, both American and European, and
doing for film schools what Woodward and Bernstein did for
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me is that these kids don't have any interest in
much before the 70s,'' said the director Peter Bogdanovich, who
speaks often at film schools.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Daley, dean of the University of Southern California's
School of Cinema and Television, puts it slightly differently. ``We
don't graduate anyone who doesn't know his Ford, his Hitchcock, his
Bertolucci,'' she said, ``but we also want them to understand the
scope of what a career is today. We believe in expressing yourself
with sound and image, and today that may mean music videos and
television as well as movies.''
</P>
<P>
   So the time has come to consider that there are many ways to
come up to directing, through writing (Nora Ephron, Robert Benton,
Don Roos), through live television (the Sidney Lumet and John
Frankenheimer generation), through episodic television (Spielberg,
Mimi Leder). Yes, even through advertising school in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Millennium Generation claim that their Mariah
Carey or Pepsi-Cola days should not be held against them, and that
it's not their fault that studio executives are consumed with
audience attention spans or, in the words of David Brown, ``more
concerned with how many left a theater during a movie than how many
stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that respected filmmakers like Spike Lee,
Gus Van Sant and Jonathan Demme occasionally dabble in music
videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only started doing music videos to learn to master the
camera,'' said Hype Williams, who has directed videos for Will
Smith, LL Cool J and Baby Face. ``But I was born to make movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brett Ratner: ``Hey, the day they started putting
directors' names on MTV videos was the day Hollywood starting
watching us and we really began taking the work seriously. It was a
great place to experiment, another form of school. And now it's
starting to pay off.''

<P>
   The roiling of global markets continues to claim its victims
among the most sophisticated money managers, the people who manage
hedge funds. While some of these managers escaped and even profited
from the damage done by falling stock markets and the rush to safer
investments, many are telling their investors that their funds have
racked up huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   John Meriwether, the former vice chairman of Salomon Inc., who
founded Long-Term Capital, a Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund that
employs highly specialized trading techniques, is the most recent
casualty. The fund, whose partners include two Nobel prize winners
and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, told its
investors Wednesday that its bets had wiped out about half of its
net asset value so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, aimed at wealthy individuals or institutions to
pursue a variety of investing strategies, have become increasingly
popular. Despite their name, many of these funds involve
substantial risk because they borrow money to leverage their
investments. If those investments prove ill-fated, whether they are
in Russian bonds or technology stocks, the losses can be sizable.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hedge/MAR, a New York publishing company that
specializes in hedge funds, preliminary results from 155 hedge
funds suggest that roughly three quarters lost money in August.
About 42 funds had losses exceeding 10 percent. The funds that were
hardest hit, according to Lois Peltz, the managing editor, were
those invested heavily in emerging markets, especially Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, which now has about $2.3 billion under
management, appears to have incurred the bulk of its losses when
bond spreads widened between Treasuries and the rest of the market
like corporates and convertibles. Those losses seem to have been
magnified by the fund's use of heavy borrowing. The fund was also
hurt through its exposure to emerging market bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, which issued a press release, would only say
that August's losses ``occurred in a wide variety of strategies,''
involving bonds in the major industrial countries, equity-related
instruments like derivatives and emerging market debt, including
holdings related to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losses of this magnitude are a shock to us as they are surely
are to you,'' Meriwether said in a letter sent out Wednesday to his
investors. ``The losses arising from the event-driven major
increase in volatility and the flight to liquidity were magnified
by the time of the year when markets were seasonally thin.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the fund is down 44 percent for August
and 52 percent for the year. Meriwether assured investors that the
fund ``is quite liquid'' and is taking steps to reduce its risk.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the high profile of some of its partners,
Long-Term Capital had impressed investors with spectacular returns
in 1995 and 1996. At the end of last year, saying investment
opportunities were not sufficiently attractive, the fund returned
about $2.7 billion in capital to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that sooner or later that this good fortune could
not continue uninterrupted and that we as a firm would be tested,''
Meriwether told investors. ``I did not anticipate, however, how
severe the test would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the losses this year, the fund is estimated to have
had yearly returns of about 20.8 percent, net of fees, since it
started in 1994. Those results are about in line with the overall
market's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether also emphasized that the fund believes that the
current market environment is ``unusually attractive.'' Since the
fund has not bailed out of many of its positions, it could profit
handsomely if its bets end up proving right in the longer term. The
fund is now raising additional capital, according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
   As Meriwether was also quick to point out in his letter to
investors, Long-Term Capital is hardly alone in its suffering:
``Investment funds widely, many Wall Street firms, and money-center
banks have reported large trading losses with resulting sharp
declines in their share prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Several large and high-profile hedge funds, including George
Soros' Quantum Fund and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors, have
publicly acknowledged losses from exposure to the Russian markets.
Soros' fund, for example, said it had lost $2 billion through its
investments there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of blood in the streets,'' said James R. Hedges
4th, the president of LJH Alternative Investment Advisors in
Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The types of funds that appear to have done well emphasized such
strategies as short selling, in which investors are betting on a
drop in the price of a stock. Other funds that appeared to hold up
in the current market were Julian Robertson's Tiger Fund and Bruce
Kovner's Gamut Investments, according to MAR/Hedge.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned, according to advisers, is for
investors to understand the risks of these funds and their
individual strategies. ``Many of the hedge funds managers are
individuals who have been successful in a bull market only,'' said
Donald Herrema, the chief operating officer of Bessemer Trust, who
advises many wealthy individuals on where to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same lesson investors learned in 1994, when some of the
macro funds betting on global shifts posted sizable losses,
according to E. Lee Hennessee of the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory
Group. The funds most badly hurt were those investing in the least
liquid securities and using the most leverage.
</P>
<P>
   And investors, many of whom have found access to these funds
easier, may be a little more cautious in the months ahead.``It
should dampen the frenzied fascination'' with hedge funds, Hedges
said.

FDA ADVISERS RECOMMEND 2 BREAST CANCER DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GINA KOLATA and LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration voted
unanimously Wednesday to approve the use of a drug, tamoxifen, to
reduce women's risk of developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug, which is already on the market, is approved for
this purpose, it will be a milestone in efforts to prevent cancer,
some experts said. Although it is intended only for women at high
risk of breast cancer, it would nonetheless be the first drug that
could prevent cancer in healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, this is the first drug approved for the
prevention of cancer,'' said Dr. Leslie Ford, the associate
director for early detection and community oncology at the cancer
institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, the advisory panel unanimously recommended
approval for a new drug for women with advanced breast cancer.
Officials say that the drug, Herceptin, made by Genentech, is
intended for use by the estimated 30 percent of breast cancer
patients who have a defective gene called HER2/neu that makes their
cancer spread aggressively through the body.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is not a cure, but has been shown in clinical trials,
either alone or with chemotherapy, to delay the progression of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The agency typically follows its advisers' recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen is already on the market as a treatment to prevent
recurrences of breast cancer in women who have had the disease.
Since doctors can prescribe drugs for other than their approved
uses, they could give tamoxifen to healthy women even without the
FDA's approval. But approval of tamoxifen as a drug to reduce
cancer risk would allow the company to advertise and market it
widely for this purpose and would mean that health insurance
companies would be more likely to pay for it for women who have
never had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters expressed delight that women would have a new avenue
to prevent one of the diseases they dread the most. ``We're very
pleased,'' said Susan Braun, the president and chief executive of
the Susan G. Komen Foundation, an advocacy group for women with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But tamoxifen is not a panacea, experts warn, and the 11-member
advisory panel said it did not yet have enough information to
determine which women are at high enough risk of breast cancer to
make the drug's hazards, including potentially fatal blood clots as
well as cancer of the uterine lining, worth its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say they fear that the drug will be overpromoted and
that more women may be harmed than helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we try to get across is that not everyone is at
high enough risk to make this worthwhile,'' said Cindy Pearson,
executive director of the National Women's Health Network. ``It
isn't like putting iodine in your salt or chlorine in your drinking
water. Women have already died taking this drug,'' she said, adding
that it was still not clear that, in the long term, it would save
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Milbauer, who is vice president for external affairs at
Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, the Wilmington, Del., firm that makes
tamoxifen, said the company plans to advertise the drug directly to
women in 1999, after first educating general practitioners about
its use. Milbauer said tamoxifen costs $80 to $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Justice, who is acting director of the division of
oncology drug products at the FDA, said ``potentially tens of
millions of women'' could be candidates for tamoxifen. He said
Zeneca applied to market the drug for the prevention of breast
cancer at the behest of the agency and the National Cancer
Institute and called the advisory committee's decision to recommend
that the drug be approved for this purpose ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Already demand for tamoxifen is starting to build. Dr. Barbara
Weber, who directs the breast cancer program at the University of
Pennsylvania, said that ``more and more women are calling me,''
asking about the drug and that other doctors have had the same
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts had long hoped that tamoxifen might prevent
breast cancer. Its biochemistry was promising, since it prevents
the hormone estrogen from stimulating breast tissue. ``It's holding
up across the board _ in any setting where you get reduced exposure
to estrogen, you get less breast cancer,'' Dr. Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, women who start menstruating late or who reach
menopause early are less likely to develop breast cancer. But the
notion of testing tamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative in
healthy women was controversial because it would mean exposing
women to the known risks of the drug to provide a possibly elusive
benefit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cancer institute went ahead, with a large study
involving 13,388 women who had at least double the average risk of
breast cancer. Half took tamoxifen and the others took a placebo.
The institute ended the trial abruptly in April, six years after it
began, announcing that it was unethical to continue because the
data had become so clear that women who took the drug were less
likely to develop breast cancer. Eighty-five women taking tamoxifen
had gotten breast cancer as compared to 154 women taking a placebo,
a 45 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But 33 women taking tamoxifen developed cancer of the uterine
lining, as opposed to 14 of women taking the placebo; 17 women in
the tamoxifen group had blood clots in their lungs, as against 6
taking the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   And the tamoxifen picture soon became muddied. While the cancer
institute's study still awaits publication in a medical journal,
two European groups published results from their own studies in the
journal Lancet in July, and the data were not so encouraging. A
British study of 2,471 women and an Italian study of 5,408 women
found no reduction in breast cancer risk in women who took
tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, many said, the European studies were too small to see
tamoxifen's benefit. In addition, noted Dr. Ford, who directed the
tamoxifen trial for the cancer institute, the women in the European
trials were at lower risk of developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But, wrote Dr. Kathleen Pritchard of the University of Toronto
in an accompanying editorial, ``The failure of these trials to
confirm the results of the U.S. study, however, casts doubt on the
wisdom of the rush, at least in some places, to prescribe tamoxifen
widely for prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, momentum was already building for the approval of
tamoxifen for healthy women at increased risk of breast cancer. In
April, shortly after the U.S. tamoxifen study ended, officials from
the FDA, the cancer institute, and the U.S. tamoxifen study met and
decided that the agency should consider allowing Zeneca to market
tamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative, Justice of the FDA said.
``They were encouraged to submit an application to us as soon as
possible,'' he added. Wednesday's meeting was the result.
</P>
<P>
   The expert panel, headed by Dr. Janice Dutcher, a professor of
medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was unhappy
with the wording of the agency's questions, which asked if
tamoxifen should be approved as a way to ``prevent'' breast cancer.
That had not been demonstrated, the group said, noting that it
remained possible that the drug merely staved off cancers that
would eventually occur. So it changed the works to ``reduce the
risk'' of breast cancer and voted unanimously to recommend approval
for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ford said that the cancer institute and its tamoxifen
researchers have been preparing for this day, developing a computer
disk that will be available to women and doctors and that can
calculate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer as well as
compare her risk to that of the women in the large tamoxifen study.
Those who want the disk can order it through the cancer institute's
clinical trials Web site, Dr. Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   If Herceptin is approved, it will be the first genetically
engineered drug for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin has not yet been tested in earlier-stage breast
cancer, but some specialists said they believed it could also
prevent or delay the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Although Herceptin potentially delays tumor progression in less
than one-third of patients whose breast cancer has spread, or
metastasized, cancer specialists said it represents an important
step toward a new method of treatment. Unlike chemotherapy, which
kills fast multiplying cells, healthy as well as cancerous,
Herceptin targets a specific genetic alteration linked to the
cancer. Thus Herceptin has relatively few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Debu Trepathy, director of clinical trials at the breast
care center of the University of California at San Francisco and a
principal investigator of the drug, called the drug a breakthrough.
``There is no doubt in my mind that this is the beginning of a
whole new wave of biological drugs that modulate the causes of
cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herceptin is a genetically engineered copy of an immune system
protein known as a monoclonal antibody. It was developed by
Genentech Inc., based in South San Francisco, Calif., which is 67
percent owned by Roche Holdings Ltd., of Basel, Switzerland. Shares
in Genentech closed Wednesday at 66 3/4, up 1 3/4, on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Herceptin was recommended for the treatment of patients with
advanced metastatic breast cancer whose tumors produce excessive
amounts of a gene known as HER2, for human epithelial growth factor
receptor-2. When several copies of a HER2 gene exist in a cancer
cell, excessive amounts of a protein are produced on the surface of
cells.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 to 30 percent of metastic breast cancer patients
produce too much HER2. In turn, too much HER2 often means the
patient's cancer will spread faster and kill sooner than in
patients producing smaller amounts of HER2. Patients in clinical
trials of Herceptin were screened using laboratory tests to
determine who produced large amounts of HER2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to ask functional questions about cells, and about
what causes a normal cell to become malignant, and then to
intervene to fix what is broken, that has been the promise,'' of
molecular biology in cancer, said Dennis Slamon, director of the
Revlon UCLA Women's Cancer Research Program in Los Angeles. ``HER2
and Herceptin, in that context, represent to my mind the first
real-world realization of that hope,'' he said. Slamon was a
principal investigator of Herceptin.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials of patients with metastatic disease who had
not received chemotherapy, those treated with Herceptin and
chemotherapy experienced tumor progression later than those treated
with chemotherapy alone. The median time to disease progression
increased from 4.6 to 7.6 months, or about 65 percent. About 28
percent of women treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy did not
show tumor progression at one year, compared with 14 percent who
were treated with chemotherapy alone.
</P>
<P>
   A second trial, of women who were not helped by chemotherapy,
showed that Herceptin alone delayed tumor progression to some
extent in a fifth of the patients.
</P>
<P>
   For most patients, the main side effect of Herceptin was a
fever, treatable with Tylenol. In a minority, however, who received
Herceptin along with a class of chemotherapy drugs called
anthracyclines, the combination caused cardiac problems, such as
congestive heart failure. These effects typically ceased when the
drug was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big advance,'' said Larry Norton, medical director
of the breast center at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center. ``All by itself, it's definitely going to help a lot of
people, and it dramatically augments the Taxol effect,'' he said,
referring to a chemotherapy drug that has been particularly
effective in breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is not the efficacy, although that's very
exciting,'' he said. ``The key issue is that this is the beginning
of the whole new approach in the treatment of cancer.''

WOMEN GIVE HILLARY CLINTON WARM WELCOME IN BELFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NIRELAND-SINN-FEIN)

 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Introduced by a 16-year-old student
as ``a role model for young women around the world,'' Hillary
Rodham Clinton told a cheering gathering of women in Belfast
Wednesday night that it was their ``courage and strength'' that had
secured the new Northern Ireland peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wives. Mothers. Sisters. Daughters,'' she told the 450
delegates to the ``Vital Voices: Women in Democracy'' conference.
``Few were household names,'' she said. ``But having seen their
lives and communities torn apart by violence, women came together
as women have always done _ around kitchen tables, at the market,
in gatherings like this. It was women whose whispers of `enough'
became a torrent of voices that could no longer be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton arrived here Wednesday from Moscow a day ahead of
President Clinton. The speech was her first since his televised
admission on Aug. 17 of an ``inappropriate relationship'' with a
White House intern. She strode onto the stage of Waterfront Hall to
a burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   With only two fleeting mentions of the president's pending
arrival, Mrs. Clinton talked for 40 minutes about the rights and
achievements of women and duty toward the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, our children are why we are here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Clinton's third trip to Northern Ireland in four
years, and she is a known and appreciated figure here, particularly
among women. Her defense of her husband, which has raised some
questions among women elsewhere, has not diminished enthusiasm for
her here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, where have those women in America been,'' said Monica
McWilliams, 44, a professor at the University of Ulster who is a
founder of the Women's Coalition political party and a member of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly. ``Women have to have survival
skills, and people have to put things back in place when mistakes
get made, and we know about that only too well in Northern
Ireland,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McWilliams and her fellow negotiators in the 26-month-long
peace talks were called ``silly women,'' ``dogs'' and ``scum'' by
their male counterparts from other parties. Some mooed like cows
when the women took their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McWilliams said that the president's behavior and Mrs.
Clinton's response to it had come up in a meeting before the
conference and that the women present had agreed that the most
important thing for a woman is to have ``an independent project''
to turn to at such times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very traditional male-dominated society and they
don't know how to handle a Hillary Clinton,'' she said, adding,
``Oh, do we need this woman here now.''

PLAYERS AND OWNERS, AMID GROWING PESSIMISM, TO MEET AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their economic game of chicken, neither the
National Basketball Association team owners nor the players will
blink. One month before training camps are scheduled to open and
two months before the start of the regular season, the bargaining
table is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting increasingly pessimistic,'' the league's deputy
commissioner, Russ Granik, said. ``It's not like we've committed
ourselves to losing games. We want a new agreement. But whether
that happens or not remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties reconvene in a Manhattan law office Thursday
morning for the arbitration hearing which will decide whether
players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the
lockout. The arbitrator, John Feerick, has scheduled Thursday,
Friday, next Tuesday and possibly Wednesday for the remainder of
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Klempner, an attorney with the Players Association, is
scheduled to continue his testimony. The union's executive
director, Billy Hunter, is also scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   After the arbitration ends and post-hearing briefs are filed,
Feerick has 30 days to render a decision. Officials on both sides
have privately said they expect to meet again before the
arbitrator's decision. But with no progress in sight, the chance of
losing games to labor strife for the first time in NBA history
increases exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the season to commence on time, I would think we
would have to have a deal in place by Oct. 1, or at least the
outlines of the deal,'' Hunter said. ``With training camps
scheduled to open then, I would hope we could get serious before
the last week of September.''
</P>
<P>
   The first casualty may be the league's rookie orientation, which
is scheduled for the last week of September. The season is
scheduled to open Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have any hope?'' Hunter said. ``Not at this point.
They're convinced that once the players miss a paycheck, they're
going to cave. And that's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block in negotiations has been the players'
refusal to budge on any proposal that would put a ceiling on
salaries. The owners walked out of a meeting on Aug. 7 after they
heard a new round of proposals from the players. While several
provisions were addressed, the central issue of playing under a
hard salary cap _ which the owners deem paramount _ was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those proposals were all ancillary issues,'' Granik said.
``The key is that the owners cannot afford to play the season under
a totally open-ended system. When it comes to that, we haven't made
any progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunter, ``We're determined not to play under the hard cap.
We don't want a closed-in system.''
</P>
<P>
   During the arbitration over the next few days, Granik,
Commissioner David Stern and the NBA's legal team will most likely
exchange amicable pleasantries with Hunter and his staff of
attorneys. From one of those conversations may emerge a forthcoming
bargaining session.
</P>
<P>
   But with two sides adamant on sticking to their own idea of good
league economics _ the players determined to keep playing for
whatever the market holds and the owners steadfast in curbing
exorbitant salaries _ the possibility for a September
reconciliation seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go back to the bargaining table tomorrow if we felt we
could get anywhere,'' Granik said. ``The real problem right now is,
there does not seem to be any reason to bargain.'' &QL;

MAIN PLAYERS SELDOM FALL INTO DRUG AGENTS' NET
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The police officer became leery when he smelled the strong scent
of deodorizer in the car he had pulled over in a routine traffic
stop along Interstate 40 in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Mike Garbo became more suspicious when he asked to
search the car, and the passenger fainted.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling back the armrest covers in the back seat, Garbo
and other officers in a drug task force found 44 pounds of
Colombian white heroin, the largest amount of heroin ever seized by
such an agency in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin, confiscated in August 1997, was 96 percent pure and
worth an estimated $40 million on the streets, officials said. It
gave the Nashville Police Department reason to tout the drug task
force, formed five months earlier as part of a growing cadre of
highway patrols across the nation targeting drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, a Dallas jeweler suspected of being the main
heroin supplier remains at large after Tennessee and federal
authorities suffered a series of setbacks. The case exemplifies the
difficulties faced in tracking down the main suppliers and
distributors in a drug organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug,''
said John Zimmermann, a Nashville assistant district attorney who
is working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The first mistake in the case came when authorities, because of
botched test results, initially charged both men with possession of
cocaine instead of heroin, slowing the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we thought it was cocaine,'' Garbo said. ``We had
never seen heroin of that quantity, and it was wrapped in plastic
and duct tape like a kilo of cocaine. It was a very big surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor commmunications among local law enforcement agencies also
hurt the case.
</P>
<P>
   When they were arrested, both men _ Herman Zapata, a 22-year-old
from Colombia who lived in Flower Mound, Texas; and Omar Amaya, a
24-year-old from Colombia who lived in Dallas _ said they wanted to
cooperate with police. They gave the following account, which
became part of court documents obtained by the Star-Telegram:
</P>
<P>
   Amaya, who was unemployed, said he agreed to drive to New York
at the request of a friend in Dallas, knowing that he was being
paid to transport something that might be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the friend, 44-year-old Nestor Marulanda, who owned
a Dallas restaurant and jewelry store, gave him $4,200 cash to buy
a used car for the trip. Marulanda also promised an additional $800
when Amaya returned.
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda told Amaya to call him when he arrived in New Jersey,
and he would then give Amaya the telephone number of a man named
Lucio. Lucio would meet Amaya in New York and load the car with
``party hats and party decorations'' to bring back.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya said that as he was leaving Marulanda's house on Forest
Lane in Dallas, Marulanda cautioned him that there was ``something
in the car and to drive slow and be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaya said he then picked up Zapata in Flower Mound and the pair
began their trip north.
</P>
<P>
   After Amaya made his statement, he and Zapata told authorities
that they would deliver the heroin so police could nab the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Police, with the assistance of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, told Amaya to call Marulanda at his Dallas jewelry
store, Innovations. But when Amaya reached Marulanda on his
cellular phone, the jeweler was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you guys got busted in Nashville,'' he told Amaya.
</P>
<P>
   Police then learned that county jail officials that morning had
allowed Zapata to call his wife, who quickly called Marulanda.
</P>
<P>
   By the time DEA agents in Dallas went to Marulanda's house the
next day, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been approximately over 100 man-hours concentrated on
finding him,'' said Paul Villaescusa, a DEA spokesman in Dallas.
``But he wasn't located.''
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda, who in the 1970s was running from the law on cocaine
charges in New York, is a federal fugitive again and is believed to
have fled to Cali, Colombia. His businesses, which are now closed,
are believed to have been covers for drug trafficking, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities were successful in tracking down
Lucio, the New York contact.
</P>
<P>
   They told Amaya to call him and set up a meeting. Luis ``Lucio''
Jimenez-Zuleta, a 59-year-old New York resident originally from
Colombia, arrived with $32,000 cash, and agents arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez-Zuleta was recently sentenced to 30 months in federal
prison for conspiracy to distribute heroin, instead of the maximum
10-year sentence. His attorney, Jose Castaneda, had argued that
Marulanda lured him into drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about an unsophisticated individual, someone who
sold T-shirts on the street, doesn't speak English and is a
diabetic,'' Castaneda said. ``The big guys are too smart to get
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office sought federal charges against Zapata
and Amaya. But the federal magistrate dismissed the case against
Zapata because of insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A district attorney's office in Tennessee has charged both men.
The state case is set to go to trial Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents said that with large heroin operations, multiple
smugglers and distributors are often involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously with that amount of heroin, you have several runners
_ one guy would have 10 people running distribution,'' said Coleman
Ramsey, the DEA resident-agent-in-charge of the Nashville, Tenn.,
office. ``It's very difficult to catch them on both ends.''

AS TEACHERS, THE BEST ARE OFTEN THE LEAST  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (af) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND 
   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teachers come in different shapes and sizes, and finding the
right fit might sort out some of the educational controversies
going on at the Tanglewood Festival up in Lenox, Mass. The troubles
have been well rehearsed in these pages, and are not likely to go
away when the season ends this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Have Tanglewood's long-respected summer programs been
emasculated by dismissals and resignations, or have they been
reinvigorated by a new involvement on the part of the Boston
Symphony and its music director, Seiji Ozawa?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping score is not easy, for good things can happen at the
same time damage is being done. The first question for all parties
is simply, ``What is it that music teachers do?'' ``Teach music''
is no answer. There are too many kinds of teaching going on.
</P>
<P>
   Let's begin with the celebrities. They divide into two
categories: performers with public profiles, and teachers whose
powers of connection attract exceptional students. Great performers
are occasionally great teachers, but not often. Yet their presence
in academia (when they are not off giving concerts) is a strong
attractant.
</P>
<P>
   Just as law firms hire former cabinet members to drum up
clients, so music schools use the famous name as a kind of logo.
The student prospers, too, for no matter how little he or she
learns, the advertisement can read, ``Student of the Great
So-and-So.''
</P>
<P>
   My piano teacher at the Paris Conservatory _ a woman of
astonishing technique, minimal teaching skill and sublime ignorance
of any style but her own _ had once, over a period of three or four
lessons, played the keyboard pieces of Ravel for the composer.
</P>
<P>
   Ravel, she told me, corrected the many typographical errors in
the Durand edition, suggested tempos and interpretive ideas,
collected his substantial fee, then saw the lady no more. An
abbreviated course of study, not cheap, but there was a reward.
``Student of Ravel'': think of the authority that title conveyed on
her interpretations, no matter what nonsense she superimposed on
the master's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity performer and celebrity teacher are doorkeepers,
with access to important managers and intendants. Students find
their way under such wings, grateful for the connections and happy
for any learning at all. (It often comes in the form of tips: how
to finger that hard passage in the Chopin G minor Ballade, what to
leave out in the Brahms Second Piano Concerto.)
</P>
<P>
   Performers typically charge fees in the hundreds of dollars per
hour simply to discourage applicants. They would rather be
practicing. Celebrity teachers charge big fees because they can get
them. Amend ``There are no great teachers, only great students'' to
read, ``Teachers succeed professionally by their ability to attract
great students.''
</P>
<P>
   Another category of teacher is the kind Tanglewood seems to have
lost in considerable numbers during the recent unpleasantness: the
teacher of music, a performer who might operate on the fringes of
the public music world or might not play concerts at all.
</P>
<P>
   Like coaches in major league baseball, they are eloquent
purveyors of information, for struggling with their own hard-earned
skills has forced them into a self-examination largely foreign to
the easy virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers of music are less interested in the careers of their
students than in the passing-on of styles and traditions. Achieving
the right balances in a Haydn string quartet supersedes winning an
audition before a 57th Street manager.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher of music is less a reservoir of useful tricks than a
purveyor of information: which tempo might work, how harmony
affects accentuation, what a phrase mark means, how ``allegro'' in
1780 and ``allegro'' in 1880 mean different things. I learned
something about piano playing from my Paris teacher simply by
standing behind her and watching. I learned more about music from
an unpleasant and disheveled old man in Pittsburgh than from any
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   I am delighted to hear of the euphoria with which the ``new''
Tanglewood seems to have been greeted this summer. Ozawa and his
Boston players are evidently doing good things. Robert Spano will
still be teaching conductors, asking questions of his students, so
that they will find their own answers.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere at Tanglewood there is a broader question to be
asked: What is the purpose of a music school altogether? Is it
preparation for jobs, or is its first aim to deepen understanding?
</P>
<P>
   I am troubled by the idea of classes teaching violinists how to
be concertmasters. These are practical skills better won by sitting
in the second-violin section of an orchestra and observing. Would
not such class time at Tanglewood be better spent pondering
Beethoven's ambiguous accent marks and Mozart's overlapping slurs.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of offending my journalistic colleagues, if I were a
newspaper executive faced with hiring either a journalism-school
graduate trained in news-gathering or a good writer steeped in
economics, history and political science but with no news
experience, I would choose the latter every time. The difference
between knowledge and expertise is misunderstood these days.
</P>
<P>
   I know I shall also offend the Guarneri String Quartet by
questioning its recent addition to Tanglewood's faculty. The
Guarneri has a distinguished past and a high public profile, and
maybe its players are splendid teachers despite their persistently
crude performances in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the troubling possibility remains that their presence has as
much to do with public relations as with musical substance. At any
rate, the gain of these four players and the loss of Gilbert
Kalish, Leon Fleisher, Joel Krosnick and Julius Levine seems not an
equal trade.

   NEW YORK _ Moody, meticulously staged and filled with
introspective symbolism, the room-size works of Ernesto Pujol have
been fixtures on the international art circuit in recent years and,
in the eyes of many, examples of installation art at its most
evocative.
</P>
<P>
   His work is composed of original, sculptured-clay pieces and, as
shown at the 1997 Havana Bienal, of articles of furniture or
clothing that he borrows from families in the cities where he goes
to create installation works for public display.
</P>
<P>
   His art has been shown at several biennials, including those in
South Africa and even Estonia, and in museum shows in the United
States and Europe. But with the exception of two recent shows,
Pujol's largest works have rarely been seen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his newest work, he has branched off into fine-art
photography, and the Linda Kirkland Gallery will present his first
photographic efforts in a group show titled ``Some Like It Hot'' _
hot as in sexy, seductive or fetishistic. The exhibition opens
Saturday and runs through Oct. 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people describe installation as a strategy for making
art,'' said Pujol at his studio in Brooklyn Heights. ``But for me
it's a medium of expression in its own right that, at best, is made
up of other art forms, and of basic elements such as color, light,
design and sculptural space.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As an immigrant child _ he was born in 1957 in Cuba and grew up
in Puerto Rico, where his parents fled when he was 4 _ he wrestled
with the meanings of displacement, nationality and cultural
identity. After earning a fine-arts degree in Puerto Rico, Pujol
came to New York to study media and art therapy and, as an openly
gay man, became immersed in AIDS activism.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons from that experience also informed his mature art, which
looks at the way in which society and the family shape popular
notions about masculinity, race and culture. ``All of this is
wrapped up in memory,'' the artist explains. ``Memory is my big
theme.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Yee, a curator at the Bronx Museum, noted that ``Ernesto
doesn't lift directly from advertising or pop culture; his work has
a psychic charge that comes from common references linked to the
home.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, his recent installation called ``The Picnic''
alludes to how gender roles are shaped within the family during
childhood. The work consists of side-by-side picnic tables, one
covered with hunters' tools (``Father's Table''), the other by
plates and silverware (``Mother's Table''), and prepubescent
phalluses sculptured from clay. ( Pujol will re-create the
installation next spring at the Kunsthalle in Vienna.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernesto's work is intimate; you feel a real poetic sense of
the materials he uses,'' said the artist Faith Wilding, a visiting
professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has exhibited alongside
Pujol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his new photographic works, Pujol has shifted his focus
from childhood to adulthood. His triptych ``Front and Back,'' for
example, takes on an anti-fashion, even clinical look at the male
figure, which he depicts from the waist down clad only in
underwear, socks and a businessman's leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not erotic, but they address the idea of maleness,''
said Pujol, who will teach this fall at the Cooper Union and
lecture at the Art Institute of Chicago on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Pujol is enjoying his foray into photography, his
efforts, he said, remain deeply rooted in the ideas that have
fueled his installation projects. ``I found my voice in
installation art, which is part spectacle, part poetry and often
very ephemeral,'' he said. ``Because in its use of found objects,
it echoes who we are at this historic moment: we're all inescapably
consumers, and in that way it's very relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   In a modest tone that quickly becomes assertive, Pujol added:
``There are still those of us who believe that any art must be
relevant to something.''

CLINTON TOOK INTEREST IN RETURNING LEWINSKY TO WHITE HOUSE,
TESTIMONY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told the grand jury investigating
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he was troubled by her
transfer out of the White House and discussed bringing her back
last summer, according to people familiar with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified on Aug. 17 that he spoke about his worries
over Ms. Lewinsky's situation with Marsha Scott, a senior aide in
the White House personnel office and a friend of his since high
school, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion, in July 1997, is the first indication that
Clinton took an interest in returning Ms. Lewinsky, a former
intern, to the White House from the public affairs job at the
Pentagon, where she was transferred against her wishes in April
1996. Clinton's apparent sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky is starkly at
odds with the views of some White House staff members, who
suggested as recently as this spring that she had been shadowing or
even stalking the president, which is why they said they thought
she should leave.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not order Ms. Lewinsky's return and did not
ask aides to give her favorable treatment, one adviser
knowledgeable about his testimony said. And despite her own pleas
to White House officials, Ms. Lewinsky did not receive a position
there. Ms. Scott met with Ms. Lewinsky twice last summer to talk
about her career, even though she was not responsible at the time
for administration jobs outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told grand jurors that, as early as spring
1996, at the time she was transferred, Clinton assured her that he
would bring her back to the White House after the presidential
election that November, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies and Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, have seized on Clinton's conversation with Ms. Scott for
opposing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To the president's team, the talk is evidence that Clinton was
concerned, as any man might be, for the well-being of a woman he
had been intimate with. They argue that if he was intent on buying
her silence, he would have surely insisted that his aides rehire
her.
</P>
<P>
   But allies of Starr say that prosecutors view Clinton's stated
interest in Ms. Lewinsky's return to the White House as a possible
abuse of his office, a likely accusation in a report that Starr is
preparing for Congress. They may also cite the conversation as an
attempt by the president to obstruct justice by keeping Ms.
Lewinsky mollified and silent about their relationship, the allies
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the prosecutors, the timing of the conversation is
significant. Weeks before, on May 27, 1997, the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously that Paula Jones' sexual misconduct suit could proceed
against Clinton while he was in office. Days later, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers said that they planned to seek testimony from other women
linked to Clinton. That effort eventually led them to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted an inappropriate physical relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, but he has denied obstructing justice or breaking any
other laws. Ms. Lewinsky also denied an affair under oath during
the Jones lawsuit, but later acknowledged an 18-month sexual
relationship with the president to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton expressed an interest in bringing Ms.
Lewinsky back to the White House, he had ended their affair,
according to his advisers. They said the president broke off their
physical relationship in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Lieberman, a former deputy chief of staff, has said she
removed Ms. Lewinsky from her White House job in April 1996 because
of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet allies of the president said that he felt that Ms. Lewinsky
had been treated unfairly, and that her transfer might be a blot on
her resume. One adviser to Clinton said that the president had a
further worry about Ms. Lewinsky. ``He was concerned about her
talking with people,'' the adviser said, describing that concern as
``a natural feeling'' that anyone involved in an extramarital
relationship might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't order anyone to bring her back,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, the Jones lawyers were not the only people
inquiring into Clinton's relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, according to those familiar with her testimony,
Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton that a Newsweek reporter had
contacted her friend, Linda Tripp, who also worked at the Pentagon.
The reporter was pursuing claims by Kathleen Willey, then a White
House volunteer, that Clinton had made a sexual advance toward her
in the private hallway outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that she pressed Clinton to have his senior
aide and confidant, Bruce Lindsey, call Mrs. Tripp to advise her on
how to respond to the reporter, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
A day later, Lindsey called Mrs. Tripp, according to lawyers
familiar with the testimony of both women.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had that
conversation with Clinton before or after he expressed an interest
in bringing her back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott has testified on at least two occasions to the grand
jury inquiring into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She
described meeting twice last summer with Ms. Lewinsky, who implored
her for a White House job, according to lawyers familiar with her
testimony. Ms. Scott testified that she met with Ms. Lewinsky at
the request of Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   During their second meeting, Ms. Scott testified, Ms. Lewinsky
indicated that she was angry about her transfer across the Potomac
to the Pentagon, and attributed it to what she called untrue rumors
that she was involved with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott said that she advised Ms. Lewinsky that, because of
her detractors in the White House, it would not be a good career
move for her to return there, according to people familiar with her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott did not recall discussing Ms. Lewinsky with the
president, according to her lawyer, Stuart Pierson. ``She could
very well have talked to the president about her conversations with
Monica, but she had no specific recollection of that,'' Pierson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's interest in efforts by Clinton to bring Ms. Lewinsky
back to the White House had not been not previously revealed. Some
White House aides, worried about the potential impact of Starr's
report, believe that they should disclose potentially sensitive
information to present their gloss on the facts before the
prosecutors do.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also been examining efforts by Clinton's friends and
administration officials to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New
York. The president acknowledged under oath that he had asked aides
last winter if they could provide Ms. Lewinsky with a favorable job
recommendation for her White House work, according to people
familiar with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly complained to Clinton in early 1997
about her transfer out of the White House, according to people
familiar with the testimony of both. She was said to have been
worried that prospective employers might interpret her transfer to
the Pentagon as a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a girl who is very concerned about what people think,''
one associate said. ``And she did not want it to be seen that she
was run out of the White House. I know she wanted to come back, and
she did not like being over at the Pentagon.''

MARKET FRAILTY ISN'T MEXICAN, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria runs an economy
that is growing vigorously, with most exports surging and thousands
of new jobs opening every day. But ask him whether the Mexican
stock market will rise or plunge tomorrow and he shakes his head in
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the Duma; ask Mr. Chernomyrdin,'' Gurria said in an
interview Tuesday, referring to President Boris Yeltsin's embattled
choice for prime minister and the house of the Russian parliament
that has so far refused to approve him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with Mexico,'' he said. ``That is what is
very dramatic. Sometimes there is this feeling that there's not
very much you can do. Basically, you are in the presence of forces
you can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurria vented frustration felt by leaders of several Latin
American countries _ including Brazil, Chile and Argentina _ that
took tough, often unpopular measures in recent years to stabilize
their economies but have been dragged into the global market
turmoil nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of differentiation,'' Gurria said, lamenting
that international investors had sold Latin securities in response
to worries generated by Russia and Japan, without bothering to
examine conditions in individual nations of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Latin American markets again showed that they are
tied to trading in the United States as several of them rose or
held steady, a day after Tuesday's rebound in the Dow Jones
industrial average. (The Dow fell 45 points Wednesday after rising
288 on Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where there was no trading Tuesday because of
President Ernesto Zedillo's State of the Union address, the stock
market rose Wednesday by 186.63 points, or 6.24 percent. Mexican
stocks had dropped 5.14 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin market performance came in spite of a controlled
devaluation overnight Tuesday in Colombia. The authorities there
widened the daily exchange rate band for the Colombian peso by 9
percent, saying they would allow it to depreciate 23 percent
annually against the U.S. dollar, compared with 14 percent before.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia had spent about $1 billion of its foreign reserves this
year to shore up its currency, which was weakened by a budget
deficit equivalent to about 6 percent of the gross domestic
product. A new president, Andres Pastrana, took office there Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Colombia devalued anticipating a similar move in
neighboring Venezuela, where economists say the bolivar is
overvalued by as much as 40 percent. But Venezuela weathered the
storm Wednesday, with its stock market closing up 3.82 percent. The
bolivar was barely lower.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria, who spoke in English, said that beneath wavering Mexican
markets lay a sound economy that expanded 5.4 percent in the first
half of this year. Despite a big drop in petroleum prices, the
Mexican government, which relies on oil for a third of its revenue,
posted a small surplus for the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's foreign debt, the finance minister said, would remain
well under control even if international markets were unsteady into
next year. Mexico easily refinanced $4.5 billion in capital
payments it owed this year, and those due in 1999 are smaller, at
$1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gurria said he was concerned that prolonged high interest rates
could deal new blows to the Mexican banking system. Earlier this
week, annual rates on overnight Treasury bills went to 38 percent.
But so far, no bank collapses are looming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he declared that threats to financial stability from outside
the country were giving fractious lawmakers reasons to settle their
differences over a proposed multibillion-dollar bank bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing awareness by all parties that we can't play
games here, that if you stretch the rubber band a bit too far, it
could snap,'' Gurria said. The bank bailout debate, in which the
opposition has accused the government of rescuing wealthy friends
and colleagues at the expense of Mexican taxpayers, has dragged on
since March.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the global economy and finances, Gurria said:
``What worries me is who is running this show. There is an enormous
vacuum of leadership worldwide. Where are the consensus-building
and decision-making mechanisms to face situations like Russia and
Japan? And how do you reward countries that perform well, like
ours?''
</P>
<P>
   He defended the $50 billion international rescue effort that
saved Mexico from financial collapse in 1995. At a meeting of Latin
finance ministers called for Friday by the International Monetary
Fund, he plans to urge the IMF and the advanced economies to once
again come to the aid of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem of contagion to the rest of the world's
economy,'' Gurria said. ``You're talking about a country which may
qualify as too big to fail.''

VOLUNTARY BUYOUT OFFER EXTENDED BY BELL ATLANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only weeks after agreeing to a new contract with its unionized
workers, Bell Atlantic Corp. has extended a voluntary buyout offer
to some of its management employees.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal message dated Tuesday, one senior Bell Atlantic
executive said that involuntary layoffs might become necessary
later this year if the voluntary program did not attract enough
employees.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local
telephone company, said there was no plan to cut jobs across the
company. Instead, she said, some departments were offering the
buyouts to cut their work force in an effort to meet existing
financial targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a massive effort to lay off 20,000 people,'' said
Susan Kraus, the spokeswoman. ``There was a top-down effort to get
everyone to meet their budget targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all within the normal course of business. We
continually look at ways to streamline and adjust our force.''
</P>
<P>
   About 47,000 of Bell Atlantic's 142,000 employees are not
unionized. It was unclear Wednesday how many of those management
employees would be eligible for buyout programs and how many jobs
the company planned to cut. Wednesday night, Ms. Kraus said it was
unclear how many of the company's departments had recently started
buyout programs.
</P>
<P>
   But in a printed message dated Tuesday to ``all management
employees'' in the finance group for the unit that runs the
company's communications network and the unit that sells
communications services, Doreen Toben, the units' chief financial
officer, said the buyout applied to ``all director level and below
management employees in my organization with limited exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No cap will be placed on the number of employees who will be
allowed to accept the offer,'' her memo said, adding that the
buyout plan was necessary to help her department meet a goal of
reducing costs by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the voluntary buyout plan, called the ``force
management program,'' the message said, ``If a sufficient number of
employees do not take advantage of the FMP offer, an involuntary
reduction in force (RIF) may be required later in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, employees will have until Oct. 14 to
accept the offer, and those who join the program will be released
from the company's payroll as of Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   In a voice-mail message early this week to ``all business
marketing personnel,'' Ron Rothenbach, a vice president for
marketing to business customers, suggested that major parts of Bell
Atlantic might feel pressure to cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his boss, Bruce Gordon, the group president for
retail marketing, Rothenbach said, ``I do have additional
head-count challenges, challenges that have been leveled against
the entire Gordon organization, and therefore, of course, mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've grown from 1.5 percent to 3 percent in revenues,''
Rothenbach said, referring to his department's annual growth
targets. ``We're still not making the revenue targets of 4.4
percent and as a result need to downsize so that the corporation
can stay financially viable and be able to compete in the
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kraus said that Rothenbach was speaking for himself and not
for the corporation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major benefits contemplated in the merger of Bell
Atlantic and Nynex was the ability to eliminate certain duplication
in employees, and some force reduction is not therefore a
surprise,'' said Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at
Paine Webber. ``However, if it is true that revenue targets are
coming below expectations this would by definition not have been
anticipated and potentially suggests some other issues at work,
potentially the effects of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kraus did not estimate the size of Rothenbach's department.
She said that Ms. Toben's finance organization had between 500 and
600 management employees.
</P>
<P>
   In his message, Rothenbach said he planned to come up with a
more detailed buyout plan for his department by the end of
September.

INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY CLUB IS SEIZED HERE AND ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Calif., Maine, Texas, Utah)  (jt) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police in 22 states and a dozen countries late
Tuesday and early Wednesday swept down on scores of homes belonging
to young and old, professional people and factory workers, all
suspected of belonging to a huge Internet club trafficking in child
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen people were arrested, but officials said they
expected more than 100 to be charged as law enforcement officers
with expertise in computers downloaded the contents of hard drives
and floppy discs that were seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume is enormous,'' Ray Kelly, the commissioner of the
United States Customs Service, said Wednesday, noting that the
investigation had turned up a data base of more than 100,000 sexual
photographs of naked boys and girls, some younger than 2, some
engaged in sexual acts with adults.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the material went far beyond anything that could
remotely be called art, and a British police official agreed.
``It's stomach-churning,'' said Detective Superintendent John
Stewardson, who led the British phase of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in the United States and Britain called the
operation one of the largest against the spreading netherworld of
child pornography in cyberspace. The suspects were believed to
belong to the Wonderland Club. A membership requirement, police
officials said, was possession of pornographic photographs of
children and a willingness to share them.
</P>
<P>
   The raids in the United States took place in places as diverse
as Brooklyn, N.Y., Salt Lake City, Dallas, Kennebunk, Maine, West
Orange, N.J., and Norcross, Ga. They yielded a half-dozen arrests
and a treasure trove of computer equipment that will be used as
evidence, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those arrested was a University of Connecticut teacher
seized at his home in New Britain, said an official familiar with
the operation. Another raid, in Missouri, turned up a cache of
weapons as well as child pornography in a heavily fortified
trailer, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, which coordinated the U.S. raids in
connection with local authorities, did not release the names of the
arrested. The accused face federal child-pornography charges that
could bring up to 10 years in prison, said a Customs agent, Bill
Anthony. They could also face local charges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, Wonderland Club members are believed to have
posed their own children for pictures, Anthony said. In other
cases, parents may have taken money to let their children be used,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the children, where they are now, whether they
can be saved _ these are among the questions investigators are
agonizing over and will be for weeks as the inquiry unfolds,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said law enforcement's knowledge of the Wonderland Club
grew out of a 1996 investigation in San Jose, Calif. In that case,
16 people in the United States and abroad were charged with taking
part in an online pedophilia club.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and Anthony said some of those implicated in the 1996 case
began cooperating with investigators. The information thus gleaned
proved invaluable, especially when it was shared with British
detectives, who earlier this year discovered pedophiles downloading
child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Over many months of looking into the Wonderland Club,
investigators learned how its members communicated by code and on
some occasions were able to follow cybertrails back to their points
of origin, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said the raids were timed to minimize the risk of
Wonderland members' warning one another. They began around 5:30
a.m. Wednesday in Britain, when it was late Tuesday on the East
Coast of the United States. Homes in Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Portugal and Sweden were
also raided.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Packham, the deputy director general of Britain's National
Crime Squad, was pleased afterward. ``I am unaware of another
police operation that has ever pulled together so many law
enforcement agencies worldwide to effect simultaneous raids and
arrests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Customs special agent, Dick Weart, offered a perspective
on how hard a fight lies ahead. Where, he was asked, is the
headquarters of the Wonderland Club?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based in cyberspace,'' he replied.

LIVENT HIRES ARTISTIC DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their first major move since disclosing serious
accounting problems and suspending two company executives,
officials of the theater production company Livent Inc. announced
Wednesday that they had hired Todd Haimes, artistic director of the
Roundabout Theater Company, as their artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   In appointing Haimes, they effectively supplanted Garth
Drabinsky, the company's co-founder and the producer of ``Ragtime''
and several other lavish musicals that Livent brought to Broadway
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and a company vice president, Myron Gottlieb, were
suspended on Aug. 10 after the company's new management team,
headed by the former Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz and the
New York investment banker Roy Furman, said they had found
accounting irregularities dating back several years that concealed
the company's extravagant expenses. The irregularities are said to
involve several millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, securities regulators in Canada have begun a formal
investigation of Livent, which is based in Toronto, and trading of
its stock has been halted.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky, who remains suspended pending an investigation
ordered by the company, has denied the reports of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes, 42, has been credited with building the once-bankrupt
Roundabout into the nation's second-largest nonprofit theater
company and successfully moving a string of shows and revivals,
including ``Cabaret'' and ``A View From the Bridge,'' from
Roundabout's smaller theaters to larger Broadway houses.
</P>
<P>
   Though the appointment is ostensibly an artistic one, Furman
said that Haimes' fiscal successes were a key element of his appeal
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he provides an excellent artistic vision, a fine
creative mind and understanding of what it is to handle several
shows running at once,'' Furman said. ``That combined with
financial discipline is a total package that is very positive for
Livent.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual arrangement, however, Haimes will remain the
director of the Roundabout until next year to oversee the company's
move into its new home at the Selwyn Theater on West 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Haimes said he saw no conflict of interest in running two
competing companies at once because ``the Roundabout does small
productions and Livent does larger commercial productions.''
Supervision of musicals already scheduled by Livent, including
``Parade'' and ``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance,'' will
fall to Marty Bell, who was promoted Wednesday to the position of
senior producer at Livent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haimes added it was too soon to say what his artistic
vision would be at Livent, he also said, ``I actually get a great
deal of enjoyment out of doing things as well as possible for as
little money as possible.''

TREATMENT PROGRAM GIVES ADDICT HOPE FOR TOMORROW

EDS; One of 22 articles (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In the next month, Christopher Cook plans to
get a job, open a savings account, find a place to live and buy a
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   If his goals appear ambitious, the 24-year-old already has
achieved a more formidable objective: completing 20 months in
residential drug treatment for his heroin addiction. He is almost
ready to move into the next phase of the treatment program at
Cenikor Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' Cook said. ``I wonder how it'll be on
my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook began using heroin at 18, and at one time he had a
$200-per-day addiction. He sold marijuana, LSD and heroin to pay
for his habit.
</P>
<P>
   To get more money, Cook stole building materials from
construction sites, reselling them to hardware stores. He took
electronic equipment and jewelry from his family.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was arrested so many times that he can't remember the exact
number. But his last jail stay in 1996 persuaded him to seek help.
He checked into Cenikor in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, he was a very irresponsible person who
let everything bother him,'' said Harold Fair, Cook's counselor at
Cenikor. ``This was someone who couldn't even get up in the morning
on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one day, it was like a light came on in his head. He
changed, and he's never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said it wasn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people who I've seen come here don't finish,''
he said. ``It's highly structured and you have to be ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past 20 months, Cook has been on a three-member
landscaping crew that leaves the Fort Worth facility at sunup and
returns at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it doesn't seem like I've been here that long,''
Cook said. ``It was rough at first, but I know even after I leave
that I'll remember where I came from.''

CHASING THE GREAT WHITE WHALEBONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 6) 
(bl) 
 By FLETCHER ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hardy seamen who took up scrimshawing to pass the
time during long voyages in search of whales more than a century
ago would probably be dismayed to learn that their handiwork had
been enlisted in the cause of feminism. But consider the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The finely engraved teeth, the whalebone pie crimpers, bodkins
and busks that they made as gifts for their wives and sweethearts
back home were tokens of affection that in the sexual politics of
today might be construed as the actions of tough guys wanting to
show their soft side. Then there was the act of scrimshawing
itself. How different was it from the embroidery, needlepoint and
sewing, the so-called domestic pursuits, that women of the day
engaged in?
</P>
<P>
   Such intriguing possibilities are raised by an exhibition of 52
pieces of scrimshaw at Snug Harbor Cultural Center's Newhouse
Center for Contemporary Art on Staten Island. The collection is
part of a larger, multimedia exhibition _ and here context is key _
with the provocative title ``Ahab's Wife,'' a reference to an
unnamed character mentioned only once by Herman Melville in
``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Georgia, director of visual arts at the Newhouse Center
and an organizer of the exhibition, which closes Oct. 4, said the
conceptual underpinning for ``Ahab's Wife'' was the creation a
``heroic role'' for the wife, a kind of reimagining of Melville's
epic tale from a woman's perspective. That theme is suggested in
the work of the half-dozen contemporary artists and several
historical exhibits, like the one devoted to scrimshaw, that are
presented in the show.
</P>
<P>
   If the whaling industry had its golden age from roughly 1825 to
1865, much the same can be said of scrimshaw. It was during this
period that whalemen, often at sea for three to five years at a
time, turned to scrimshaw for relief from the boredom and the
feelings of separation from loved ones. The whaling industry waned
in the latter part of the century after petroleum and electricity
replaced whale oil as fuel for lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Using pocket knives, handmade jigsaws and other crude tools,
scrimshanders, as they were known, cut the bone and ivory to size
and, on surfaces, engraved images; fashionably dressed women,
famous people and sailing scenes were common. Lampblack, India inks
and tobacco juice were used to color the carvings. The seamen
produced a range of objects, both utilitarian and decorative: from
whalebone spoons to ivory picture frames.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados see scrimshaw as an expression of the heart, devoid
of today's commercialism. As with other folk arts, this link to an
idealized past in part accounts for their long love affair with
scrimshaw. But it was President John F. Kennedy who helped
popularize scrimshaw by displaying several of his favorite pieces
on his desk in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Druckman, director of American folk art at Sotheby's in
New York, said that a ``fairly significant'' market existed for
scrimshaw, particularly among collectors of marine art, for whom it
represents ``the jewel in the crown.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, she noted, a whale tooth engraved with a naked
odalisque figure sold for $45,000, a record for scrimshaw. Less
expensive pieces are available, however. A pie crimper with a
serpent-shaped handle and fluted wheel might run to $1,000, while a
clothespin would go for under $100. She said the most coveted _ and
the earliest _ scrimshaw was a series of engraved teeth known as
``Susan's Teeth,'' which depict scenes from a whaler named Susan's
stay off the coast of Japan in the late 1820s. One such tooth
fetched $44,000 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Druckman said that increased market activity carried with it
a new risk. ``There are a lot of fakes,'' she said, noting in
particular plastic reproductions from the Azores.
</P>
<P>
   While the authenticity of the pieces on view at the Newhouse
seems beyond question (they are on loan from the Berkshire
Athenaeum in Pittsfield, Mass., the South Street Seaport Museum in
Manhattan and Mystic Seaport in Connecticut), their original
provenance isn't. Ms. Georgia said she had no information about
when, where or by whom the objects were made, not surprising in a
field in which few works were signed or dated.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most arresting objects on view is a tiered sewing box
that resembles a wedding cake. Made of wood and tortoiseshell with
hand-turned ivory posts to hold spools of thread, it has a
pincushion at the top and two drawers for storing sewing
accessories at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Also of interest is a crownlike sewing basket with whalebone
tines and a five-pointed star engraved on its wooden base, and an
inlaid box of wood, ivory and baleen with two large carved ivory
fists crushing snakes mounted on its lid adding an air of mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to what Ms. Georgia calls ``role reversal'' in men
making scrimshaw, she finds another irony. Scrimshaw was created
from the bones of killed whales. ``Scrimshaw is a testament to how
art transforms the more violent parts of our lives into something
beautiful,'' she said.

ANGER AMONG DEMOCRATS GROWING OVER SUPPORT FOR CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE and LIZETTE ALVAREZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Wednesday that
he had been contemplating calling for the censure of President
Clinton. But, he said, Erskine Bowles, the White House chief of
staff, called him on Monday and implored him to hold off making any
comment at least until the president had returned from his trip to
Russia and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said other Democrats, including Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, were so worried that
Lieberman would go to the Senate floor and call for censure that
they also intervened on Monday to stop their colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about censure but was not ready to go to the
floor, and I'm still not,'' Lieberman said in an interview, adding
that Daschle urged him to consider the consequences of what he was
going to say.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, of Delaware, another leading Democrat, said
Clinton's further public comments Wednesday and last Friday about
Monica Lewinsky were starting to clear the air, ``slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Bob Graham of
Florida, both Democrats and both seeking re-election, disagreed.
They said the brief, repeated statements, were not working _ and
that the president must do something more.
</P>
<P>
   In the inner caucuses of the Democrats, the angst is deepening
and the added remarks from Clinton last week from Massachusetts and
Wednesday from Moscow do not seem to be calming the waters. If the
president cannot turn to his own party for support, he could find
it particularly difficult to exert influence on legislation, build
support for his own initiatives, or mute critics calling for his
resignation or impeachment. Democratic lawmakers also face their
own perils, with elections approaching in November.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many party leaders and candidates said they did not see
any great political value at this point in Clinton delivering a
nationwide address or sitting down for a major interview to make up
for his initial performance two weeks ago. Those comments were
denounced even by some in the White House as too combative and not
sufficiently contrite.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials at the White House and in the Democratic
Party are most nervous about Lieberman, as evidenced by the fact
that Bowles took the unusual step of pleading with the senator to
hold off commenting on Clinton. Lieberman said Bowles told him he
first learned of the senator's possible intentions on the radio on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman had called for censure on Monday, party officials
said, such a move would have drawn huge press attention and been
quite damaging to the president and his party. Some of Lieberman's
colleagues have privately expressed disapproval about Lieberman's
deliberations, saying that if Lieberman speaks out that would press
other Democrats who are facing re-election to scold the president
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he has decided that it is premature to consider
censure or any other kind of legislative action before independent
prosecutor Kenneth Starr releases his report to Congress. But
Democrats should not rest easy: The senator said he planned to
release a statement or deliver a floor speech by the end of this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all very difficult and very personal,'' Lieberman
said. ``In a lot of ways, he's trying to repair his relationship
with his own family and the larger American family. I'm trying to
put together my thoughts on the whole experience and the
implications of what the president acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he was not influenced by Daschle's pleas at a
luncheon of Senate Democrats on Tuesday that lawmakers should
stress the issues and not lambaste Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is to urge people to be restrained and not leap
ahead,'' Lieberman said. ``But people are talking about it and we
have an obligation to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman is still weighing what he should say publicly,
Dodd was not timid. He said the president's amplified comments were
not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, the president is going to have to address this
again,'' he said. ``It doesn't help for every day to have a little
piece of this. He needs to pick a time and a place where it will
have maximum effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham agreed. ``He needs to have a conversation with the
American people that is more than a single speech to overcome the
unfortunate speech of Aug. 17,'' he said. ``I think it was a
failure. It's not hard to apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graham expressed reservations about calling for Clinton's
censure. ``My threshold concern is that we already have a president
whose leadership has been eroded,'' he said. ``Will this further
undermine his capability to deal with a staggering number of
serious issues?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While many Democrats insist that they were still disappointed,
even furious, at Clinton, they said he has past the point where a
deep apology to the nation would do any good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he's done is inexcusable,'' said Ken Lucas, a Democrat
running for the House in Kentucky. ``But to keep talking about it,
I don't know what that accomplishes. How much can you beat on this?
It doesn't change what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the national chairman of the Democratic
Party, had also complained that Clinton's initial remarks did not
go far enough. But Wednesday, he pronounced himself satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is enough _ it is sufficient,'' Romer said. ``He's been
very sincere in the times he's spoken about it. People ought to see
that even in a trip to Russia he repeats, `I've asked for
forgiveness.' What more can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   But as Romer and other party leaders work to keep their own
ranks unified, they are at odds over what the president should do
next.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who attended the luncheon on Tuesday said the most
emotional comments were from Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California,
who repeated her public statement of two weeks ago that Clinton had
shattered his own credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But some leaders in the party applauded the president for his
comments in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he references to it, it becomes clear to the public
that he really is ashamed,'' Biden said. ``To seek forgiveness and
have it granted requires real contrition. What comes across is this
sense of contrition _ slowly. What I see is shame. That's not a bad
thing for the American people to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden added, ``You can't say, `Yep, that's it.' You will end up
having to necessarily mention it 50 more times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., also said the president's comments
Wednesday will only help. ``He's getting closer to saying, `I'm
sorry,''' he said. ``What he said the first time was not well said.
Any time he clarifies or elaborates, it helps.''

SNIFFER DOGS DO WHAT MACHINES CAN'T
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON DICKSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most efficient drug detectors is one of the cheapest.
It is sophisticated enough to differentiate the aroma of the
tiniest amount of contraband from hundreds of other smells.
</P>
<P>
   Police dogs are doing what machines can't.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs are so effective that drug trafficking organizations
buy them to ``dog proof'' shipments before sending them to the
United States, said Raphael Lopez, special agent for the U.S.
Customs Service in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Traffickers take other measures to counter dogs' effectiveness.
In Laredo, Texas, one pooch was so renowned for its narco-busting
nose that drug traffickers offered a reward for its death,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In North Texas, dogs have played a major role in some of the
biggest heroin busts.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two men were arrested at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
after Smokey, a drug-sniffing dog, alerted officials to their
luggage. Police found more than $5 million worth of white powder
heroin sewn into clothes. The suspects, one from Mexico and one
from the Dominican Republic, were en route from McAllen to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   While some detection methods bring up questions of privacy
invasion, police dogs have the courts on their side.
</P>

   ``Most courts won't even consider the sniff to be a search,''
said Phillip Lyons, a criminal justice professor at Sam Houston
State University in Hunstville, Texas. ``The dog is just sniffing
the air.

   ``As long as the dog has the credentials to identify drugs, the
sniff can be probable cause for the police to conduct a search.''

NORTHWEST LAYS OFF HALF OF WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Minn., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that is likely to turn the 5-day-old pilots strike
against Northwest Airlines into a more protracted battle, the
company laid off more than half of its 51,000 workers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs are likely to spread the economic disruption of the
strike, increasing pressure on President Clinton to intervene, an
action for which the company has been quietly lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said that with its 1,700 daily flights grounded since
Saturday by the walkout, it had no work for a full work force. The
27,500 employees being laid off, including mechanics, flight
attendants and customer-service representatives, are also in
contract negotiations with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, as Northwest canceled all its flights through
the Labor Day weekend, the Department of Transportation said that
two commuter airlines affiliated with Northwest had violated
federal law by suspending service to 17 small cities in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The department ordered the airlines, Mesaba Airlines and Express
Airlines I, which connect the cities with Northwest's hub airports
in Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tenn., to resume flying
Thursday. The commuter airlines' pilots are not on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The large layoff means that Northwest, which is the United
States' fourth-largest carrier and dominates much of the Midwest,
will not be flying again anytime soon, even if it reaches a
settlement with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier estimated that it would take eight to 10 days to get
all its planes back in the air once the pilots returned to the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed Wednesday to meet with a federal mediator on
Saturday, though it was not certain that negotiations would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The major issues in the strike are pay and job security. Before
negotiations broke off on Friday, the union was seeking a 15
percent raise over three years. Northwest's last offer was a 10
percent raise over four years. Northwest pilots' yearly average
salary is $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Magdalena Jacobsen, the chairwoman of the National Mediation
Board, who is supervising the negotiations, invited the two sides
to meet with her in Chicago on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Armshaw, a spokesman for the board, which is an independent
federal agency that supervises the airline and rail industries,
said that the meeting was not a resumption of negotiations but an
attempt to see whether there was enough movement on either side for
new talks to be productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exploratory meeting,'' Armshaw said. ``If it can go
beyond that, it will.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced a day after Rodney Slater, the
secretary of the Department of Transportation, met with the chief
executive of Northwest, John Dasburg, and the president of the Air
Line Pilots' Association, Randolph Babbitt, separately and together
for nearly five hours in his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Slater seemed to believe the two sides showed some willingness
to compromise, but neither the company nor the pilots indicated
that on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Foley, Northwest's vice president for communications,
said: ``Dasburg made it very clear that ALPA's position on pay is
unachievable.They gave no indication that they will move on that.
Until they do, we can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots reiterated their position that they were waiting for
Northwest to make a move. ``It has always been our preference to
negotiate,'' said Paul Omodt, the union's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first strike to cripple a major airline since flight
attendants went on strike at American Airlines five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest pilots say that they saved the airline from
bankruptcy in 1993 when they accepted a 15.5 percent wage cut in
exchange for stock along with the other unions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Northwest has registered four years of record
profits and the airline's executives have cashed in stock options
worth tens of millions of dollars, while the pilots' salaries have
merely returned to the pay levels before their concessions. After
two years of negotiations, the pilots say they are seeking an
``industry-leading'' contract that would vault them over their
counterparts at American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that it cannot afford to pay the pilots
more than its three competitors, which are much larger, pay their
pilots,
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 15 percent raise, the pilots are seeking a
lump sum of $86 million to make up for the past two years, an end
to a two-tier wage scale in which newly hired pilots are paid less
than those who have been at the airline more than five years, and
limits on the number of small, regional jets Northwest can add to
its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 10 percent wage increase, Northwest has
offered a lump sum of $57 million, a reduction of the two-tier wage
scale to three years from five, profit sharing and improved pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say the difference between the two offers amounts to
$70 million a year; the company estimates the difference at $170
million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest is also in the midst of negotiating new contracts
with its five other unions. The airline has said that if it meets
the pilots' demands, it will be forced to be equally generous with
its other workers, saddling it with high costs at a time when a
weakening global economy threatens to end the current boom in the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strike has caused fewer problems than many had
predicted. Under the Railway Labor Act, which also governs union
contracts in the airline industry, the federal mediator must
declare a 30-day cooling-off period before an airline union can
strike. That gave businesses and consumers more than a month to
prepare for life without Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the strike drags on beyond the Labor Day holiday, a heavy
travel period, it promises to cause increasing disruption as
business people resume heavier travel schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has repeatedly warned of the disastrous effects of a
strike in the hope of convincing Clinton to intervene. The White
House has the power to force the pilots back to work for 60 days
while a special emergency board tried to negotiate a compromise
acceptable to both sides. But Clinton, who ended a pilots strike at
American Airlines last year, has declined to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said Wednesday that it regretted having to lay off its
workers. ``This is a sad day for Northwest Airlines,'' said Dwayne
Tucker, Northwest's vice president for human resources. ``We hoped
never to have to exercise this option.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots accused the company of exaggerating the impact of
the strike in order to get Clinton to intervene. The union said the
layoffs were ``simply the next step in a carefully contrived plan
by management to inflict pain on everyone _ the traveling public,
the pilots, and indeed, all Northwest workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has also said that there was no reason for Mesaba and
Express to stop flying just because Northwest was grounded.
</P>
<P>
   In its order Wednesday, the Transportation Department said that
under a federal program that pays subsidies to airlines to fly to
underserved areas, Mesaba and Express are prohibited from
suspending service below a minimum of two round trips a day to a
major hub airport six days a week without first giving 90 days
notice.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many passengers would be affected by the
order, though it is probably small.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Wilkinson, a spokesman for Mesaba, which is effectively
controlled by Northwest, said that it made no economic sense for
the airline to fly without being able to connect passengers to
Northwest. He added that Northwest also provides many essential
services to Mesaba, such as its reservation system, scheduling and
ground handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northwest just furloughed 27,000 employees,'' he said. ``There
is no one to provide these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing their own negotiations with the company, Northwest's
other unions have supported the pilots. ``We do stand behind
them,'' said Kathy Jo Smith, a business agent for Local 2000 of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents
Northwest's 11,000 flight attendants. ``They're sort of paving the
way for us. We want them to stand hard and firm.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that thousands of workers are losing their jobs, the
pressure on both the union and the company to reach a settlement is
sure to increase. Few Northwest workers make anywhere near the
pilots' average yearly salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time alone changes these things,'' said one person involved in
the talks who insisted on anonymity. ``But it is important that
neither side be too far ahead of its troops.''

`MILLION YOUTH MARCH' COULD DRAW FAR FEWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and MONTE WILLIAMS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With just two days to go before Khallid Abdul
Muhammad's planned youth rally in Harlem, the event's organizers
have done little to draw a strong turnout despite their contention
that people will be flooding into Harlem from around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, organizers of the rally have drastically scaled
back their initial estimates that more than 1 million young people
will show up for what they are calling the Million Youth March.
Now, they are saying that they expect no more than 50,000 to attend
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but black elected officials and community leaders
in New York City and beyond say that the rally's organizers have
provided them with so little information about the event that they
do not know what to expect of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though I am in the dark'' about the rally, said
Democratic state Sen. David Paterson of Harlem. ``I just haven't
seen the kind of preparations that as a public official I usually
see when a large event like this is being planned.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent lack of preparation is in striking contrast to the
days preceding the Million Man March in Washington, in which scores
of chartered buses and caravans of cars helped transport hundreds
of thousands of people to the nation's capital for the 1995 rally
organized by the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Sadiki Kambon, head of the Black Community Information Center in
Boston and former organizer of Boston's Million Man March
Organization Committee, said he had not been contacted by the
organizers of the New York event despite being no more than a
four-hour car ride away. ``I'm not aware of youth going'' from
Boston, Kambon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the event's most prominent
supporters, insisted that the organizers were making arrangements
for people to attend, and a lawyer for the organizers said that
dozens of buses would be transporting people to Harlem for the
event, but he refused to offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relative lack of organization, the furor over the
rally could prove to be the wild card that draws attention, and
turnout, to the event. Over the last month, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has vehemently attacked the rally's leader, Muhammad, and branded
the event ``a hate march.'' Since then, several more moderate black
leaders have said they support the idea of the march, and have
encouraged people to turn out to assure that the rally is peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Wright, a Democratic assemblyman from Harlem, said the
rally had received fairly little attention until the mayor began
speaking out. ``The fight with the mayor has put this march on the
map,'' he said. ``The people who live here in Harlem are not
involved in the planning of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally's organizers continue to insist that their event will
be well attended and that their confederates in other states have
chartered between 50 and 100 buses to ferry people to Harlem. But
the organizers did not respond to a request to provide names of
organizers in other cities, and black leaders in other urban areas
said local residents were not showing enthusiasm for the event.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for instance, the head of a major youth group that
works with gangs, the National Ten Point Leadership Foundation,
criticized the rally, and said he saw little evidence that young
people from there would attend. In Washington, the president of the
NAACP's local chapter said that organization did not plan to send
anyone to the march. The same was true in Philadelphia, where the
youth adviser for the local NAACP branch said the organization
would have nothing to do with the event.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that there is extensive grass-roots organizing
going on, it is among community leaders and elected officials in
Harlem. Bracing for the worst, they have recruited volunteers to
act as a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing this in support of or in conjunction with
Khallid Muhammad,'' Bill Perkins, a City Councilman from Harlem,
said. ``They have offended the neighborhood leadership. They don't
have much of a base in Harlem. Civic, religious, business and
community organizations were not consulted, so as a result there is
no base in the community. We realize we are going to have something
in our neighborhood so we want to be helpful in avoiding
altercations.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Green, who heads the Crown Heights Youth Collective,
said his organization was publicly opposed to the rally but, for
safety reasons, was counseling parents to accompany their children
to the event if they were planning to let them attend.
</P>
<P>
   Another black leader who spoke on condition of anonymity put the
matter more bluntly. ``In my opinion, this is a hate march, and we
don't participate in anything that smacks of hatred,'' the official
said.

CHANG IS UNSEEDED, BUT OPTIMISTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1996, Michael Chang played in the final of the
U.S. Open in Louis Armstrong Stadium. That stadium, now sliced
nearly in half and overshadowed by one named for Arthur Ashe, is no
longer the center of attention at this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is Chang, but there he was on Wednesday, back on the
hardcourt surface of his old yet new stomping ground in the first
round. Chang's thigh muscles still bulge; his straight black hair
still bounces on his head as he hustles from corner to corner. What
is missing this year is a number next to his name.
</P>
<P>
   He was seeded second a year ago: the year he blinked against the
eventual champion, Patrick Rafter, in the semifinals with his first
U.S. Open title and second major championship title clearly,
tantalizingly in view. Twelve often frustrating months later, Chang
is not seeded at all. There have been mysterious losses; there have
been multiple injuries, and now there are multiplying doubts about
Chang's ability to contend at a tournament where he has reached the
quarterfinals or better in five of the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 20th-ranked Chang has lost faith, and as he
answered questions on Wednesday after his very routine 6-1, 6-3,
6-1 victory over Eyal Erlich of Israel, he sported a T-shirt that
read, ``Jesus Loves You,'' and a relaxed, buoyant attitude that
said, ``Don't Forget Me Just Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have as good a shot as anybody out there,'' he
said, ``and I have gotten close in the past, so why not have the
attitude that I can come out and play great tennis and maybe even
win this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chang's optimism comes from winning at Brookline, Mass.,
on Sunday. It was Chang's first tournament victory in more than a
year, and although he hardly swept through the draw _ requiring
three sets to defeat three of his five opponents _ he and his
brother and coach, Carl, are much more obsessed with tennis points
than style points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I think Michael turned the corner last week,''
Carl said.
</P>
<P>
   Chang might not have Goran Ivanisevic's serve, Pete Sampras'
forehand or Rafter's volleys, but in an era when weapons are a
prerequisite for membership in the top 10, he has long been able to
rely on his legs. Chang is among the quickest players, and with the
exception of a hip fracture in 1989, he has been relatively free of
injuries during his career.
</P>
<P>
   This year, his luck has run out. In January, he strained a
stomach muscle shortly before the Australian Open. In March, he
bruised his foot and then partly tore the medial collateral
ligament in his left knee when he slipped while training with
Andrei Medvedev in Indian Wells, Calif., after a sprinkler system
began operating on an adjacent clay court.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said he tore ``25 percent'' of the ligament, which allowed
him to forgo surgery but not a three-week layoff. ``My knee feels
good right now,'' he said. ``I am definitely able to move about
whichever way. I have lost a little bit of flexibility, but the
doctors say with any kind of torn ligament it is not uncommon for
the injury to take 16 months to be 100 percent healed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the knee injury, Chang has also experienced tendinitis in
his left wrist, which hampers him on his two-handed backhand, and
he is nursing a slight groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   But if the injuries help explain Chang's forgettable 1998
season, they do not explain his disastrous autumn last year, when
he struggled mightily except for some fine play in the Davis Cup
semifinals against Australia. It was as if his disappointment at
failing to win the U.S. Open had seeped into his tennis. But Chang
and his brother reject this theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, maybe after Pete had lost, I definitely
felt the pressure to be able to win this event,'' Michael said. ``I
knew I had a great opportunity. I had some tough matches in the
round of 16 and quarters and Pat was just too good there on the
semifinal day. I think I could look back through the past few years
at missed opportunities and stuff, but one thing I have learned is
not to dwell on missed chances or times where you have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang said he never trained harder in an off season than he did
last winter. The question is whether he pushed his body too hard
and whether his body and psyche are ready for the French Open
champion, Carlos Moya, in the second round here. Moya is seeded
10th, but being an underdog in a major championship is not
necessarily a problem for Chang. It agreed with him quite nicely
back in 1989 when he won his first and only major title at the
French Open at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Michael, you know that he loves these kind of
challenges,'' Carl said. ``And you also know that if you look at
the guys ahead of him in the rankings right now, he has beaten them
all before.'' &QL;

<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ During these pogo stick days on Wall
Street, Stanley Walker, a retired mechanic with a good chunk of his
life savings in the stock market, has thought once or twice about
his boyhood in the Depression years.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no desire to have pockets so empty, as his own father
did, that Sunday dinner means pig tails and sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it time to pull the rip cord?'' Walker, 77, nervously asked
his broker on Monday, as the market dived 500 points, before making
its strong rebound. ``I like to be able to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   His broker told him to relax. And Walker, who did not sell a
single stock, is trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some jitters, there is no panic on Main Street this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are becoming old veterans at this,'' said Doug Reese, a
broker here for Edward Jones. ``They've been through all of this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most of America, the stock market has become everybody's
game in this pleasant Iowa courthouse town. Inside the Muddy Waters
coffee shop, people were echoing all of the financial analyst
cliches _ the economy's strong fundamentals, great buying
opportunities and, of course, the importance of ``staying in for
the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have even become a bit blase about the market's
gyrations. Mark Engle, a 44-year-old high school Russian teacher,
kicked his boots up on a chair and rattled Wednesday morning's
edition of the Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
   On the front page, there was a cartoon about Wall Street that
showed a bunch of little chickens screaming about a falling sky,
with a frightened looking bull. But Engle skipped right past the
stories about the market. He turned, instead, to the sports section
to read about Mark McGwire, the home run king who is having a much
better year than the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' said Engle, who lets the managers of his
pension plan worry about stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the market has hit plenty of home runs in recent years for
people in this town of 26,000, about 40 miles northeast of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains allowed Barb Collins to retire from a factory
job at age 57, vacation in France, England and Italy and take a
cruise to the island of Crete. She even has a vacation home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   To people like Mrs. Collins, now 63, who was pushing her
one-year-old grandson, Ariaus, in a stroller on this sunny day,
complaining about a bumpy stretch of road on an otherwise
magnificent run, would seem a bit greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you do have to keep on top of things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, she checks the Register for the prices of her
stocks and mutual funds, and watches one of the financial
television networks just about every day.
</P>
<P>
   During the steep drop on Monday, however, she was at her
vacation home, taking a respite from the news. Late that afternoon,
she climbed into a boat to fish for walleye with some friends. One
of them asked, with an ominous tone, ``So, what about this stock
market?''
</P>
<P>
   She confessed to some anxious moments, but never considered
selling off her stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It helps calm the nerves to recall scary days in the stock
market's recent past. Best of all, the big jump in stock prices on
Tuesday showed there is still confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on Main Street are not traders, but investors,'' said
Reese, the stock broker, noting that people who hold their cards
usually end up with a strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   DyAnne Henry, 49, who owns an embroidery shop, ``In Stitches,''
said the stock market was a lot like life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have some highs and you have some lows,'' she said,
between bites of pancakes at Monica's coffee shop. ``But if you
have patience and keep the faith, everything mellows out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general buoyancy, however, Reese noted that some
nettlesome developments have given investors some uneasy moments.
Besides the economic crisis in Asia and the political turmoil in
Russia, there is the specter of a weakened President Clinton,
tarnished after acknowledging that he misled the public about his
relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a place like Iowa, which exports plenty of grain and
agriculture-related machinery, among other goods, a crisis halfway
around the globe can come home to roost in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to economics, Iowa is by no means isolated,''
said Engle, the Russian teacher. ``How we do depends a great deal
on how people in other countries are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mueller, a 47-year-old insurance salesman who sported a blue
blazer and a deep tan, expressed few worries about the strength of
the American economy. He had doubt about President Clinton's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but think he's not the same leader that he was
four or five weeks ago,'' said Mueller, who got up early today to
watch Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on television.
``He doesn't come across as being so confident anymore. Is that
going to hurt our standing around the world?''
</P>
<P>
   In general, people did not seem to think Clinton's problems
would hurt the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Making a connection between the Washington soap opera and the
profits at Fortune 500 companies seemed, at least to someone like
69-year-old Shirley Duffy, ``a bit of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Duffy, who operates tours for Iowans to places like Nova
Scotia, Alaska and New York, said she was not going to take a penny
out of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Wallace Duffy, became alarmed during a
sudden downturn two years ago, and shifted much of their holdings
to fixed-income accounts. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned our lesson, so we're going to sit tight,'' said
Mrs. Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Reese and other stock brokers have been talking to customers
about the silver lining in any downturn. For much of the past few
years, he had been trying to damp down expectations of investors,
many of whom expected whopping gains in a matter of weeks. Now with
prices on many stocks down 15 to 20 percent compared to a few
months ago, Reese has been encouraging investors to think about
adding to their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   John Kraft, a 38-year-old painter, said he would like to jump
into the market, but will not, out of respect to his wife's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She doesn't like the idea,'' he explained, ``that you can end
the day with less money than you had yesterday.''

   DALLAS _ For 20 years, Julio Mercado has tracked the heroin
trade from Mexico to the Middle East, from the inner-city streets
of New York to the suburbs of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the purity level go from 1 percent to 90 percent,
and the face of users change from hardened street addicts to
baby-faced teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   As an agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mercado,
49, has watched the federal agency constantly add resources to try
to keep up with the changing heroin trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I've made some difference,'' said Mercado, special
agent in charge of the Dallas DEA office. He has made 700
drug-related arrests, most involving heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we didn't get the dealer on every investigation I was
on, but I feel confident that in time that dealer was going to be
arrested by some agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado can trace the evolution of the heroin trade through
volumes of court papers on the agency's investigations during the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The source has changed: One investigation involved a
Massachusetts heroin ring in the early 1980s that distributed the
drug nationwide, according to federal court records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation led us to Lebanon, and that was the first
time we had seen heroin coming from there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Middle East countries remain sources of heroin for
this country, particularly in New York. But Mexico has become the
No. 1 heroin supplier in Texas, and Colombia is pushing out Asian
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The dealers have changed: ``Back then, the big fish stayed in
the United States,'' Mercado said. ``Now, they're in foreign
countries shipping it here.''
</P>
<P>
   The addicts: ``Users in the 1970s knew that they had to call 911
immediately to give their overdose friends a chance to survive,''
Mercado said. ``Users these days don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The methods: ``Beepers weren't around back in the 1970s,''
Mercado said. ``If a dealer wanted to reach someone back then, he
may call or he would just walk into a neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The price: Five years ago, dealers were selling a kilogram of
heroin for $180,000 to $240,000. These days, a kilo of heroin sells
for $700,000 to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What all that has meant is that we've had to pour in more
resources and work more with local and state agencies,'' Mercado
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some criminal justice experts, noting that 80 percent of federal
money used in the war on drugs has gone to enforcement, say the
spending is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DEA and other agencies deal with the suppliers, but you
block one artery and another will soon be created to supply the
user,'' said Sheila R. Maxwell, an assistant professor of criminal
justice at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich.
``Research has shown that curtailing the demand is much more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement agencies say they rely on the federal help
to bust major traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local drug agents can go after the street dealers, but we
need the DEA to go after the higher-ranking drug dealers,'' said
Police Chief Gary McKamie of Euless, whose department is a member
of two DEA task forces, one in Fort Worth and another at
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. ``The federal resources are just greater
than what we have locally.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, a heroin investigation has meant nonstop work for six
to eight months for DEA agents.
</P>
<P>
   For Mercado, who was born in Puerto Rico and is the only member
of his family in law enforcement, it's a beloved yet tedious
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You woke up early in the morning to follow the heroin
dealer,'' Mercado said. ``And you put him to bed at night. In
between, you find out about his friends, the telephone calls, the
restaurants and all the other stops.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Mercado acknowledged, friendly relationships developed
with relatives of dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You visit with a dealer at his home 10 to 15 times in an
investigation,'' Mercado said. ``You play with his kids. You would
feel for the kids and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mercado said his job came first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, you would remember what you were there to do,''
Mercado said. ``You would remember that this dealer is spreading
all this poison. I had to make that arrest.''

 RUSSIA'S IMPACT ON U.S. BANKS DWARFED BY '80s LATIN CRISIS  
(bl) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Chase Manhattan Corp. and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
on Wednesday joined the chorus of financial services companies
announcing losses on their business in Russia, investors may soon
be able to breathe more easily about the Russian impact.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of American banks' exposure to Russia, analysts say,
pales in comparison to the hits taken as a result of the Latin
American debt crisis in the 1980s. And quick action by several
American financial institutions in recent days to mark down their
possible losses by as much as 85 percent, should limit the damage
to their bottom line, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad quarter,'' said Carla D'Arista, a managing director
and banking analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. in
Arlington, Va. But, she added, ``It's in no way meaningfully
derailed the fundamentals of the largest U.S. banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Chase Manhattan said it expected to take a $200
million charge in the third quarter, primarily for losses in Russia
and Asia. Its direct Russian exposure was about $250 million, with
the bulk of that, about $140 million, related to commercial banking
activities, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to institutional investors and investment funds
collateralized by ruble-denominated Russian treasury securities was
about $210 million, Chase said, with the majority of this exposure
backed by ``significant'' non-Russian assets.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also reported trading revenues for July and August of
approximately $160 million. Analysts said that was a significant
drop from average monthly trading revenues of about $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have captured most of what can be the impact of
Russia,'' said Chase executive vice president and treasurer Dina
Dublon.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, which has an inventory of about $50 million of Russian
securities remaining, still expects to post ``substantial''
earnings in the third quarter, Ms. Dublon said.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette said Wednesday that it earned about
$40 million before taxes during the first two months of the third
quarter, after taking into account losses in Russia. A spokeswoman
declined to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner Bank AG, Germany's third-largest bank, said Wednesday
that its unsecured credit exposure to Russia totaled 1 billion
marks, ($571 million), bringing the total for the big four German
banks to less than 4 billion marks of unsecured lending. Dresdner
bank has already made provisions to cover about 60 percent of its
Russian loan exposure. Recently, Commerzbank AG has reported 1
billion marks in exposure; Deutsche Bank AG said it had 1.35
billion marks, and Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank AG 500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities also reported heavy losses
on Russian business. Among the largest were those of Salomon Smith
Barney and Bankers Trust. Salomon, a unit of the Travelers Group,
said it lost an estimated $360 million after taxes in its arbitrage
and Russian-related credits businesses, while Bankers Trust put its
pretax trading loss at $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   But State Street Bank Corp. in Boston said Wednesday that recent
events in Russia, Asia and Latin America had had no significant
impact on its revenue and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week BankBoston Corp. said that it lost $30 million this
quarter in United States and international trading, including $10
million in Russia. BankAmerica, and J.P. Morgan also reported
trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their Russian exposure, most banks, with the exception
of Bankers Trust, should report positive earnings for the third
quarter and see minimal impact in 1999, said Thomas Hanley, a
managing director at Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks have thrown in the kitchen sink in the third
quarter,'' he said. ``They faced up to the problem this time
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1998, foreign bank lending to Russia
totaled about $61.4 billion, according to the Bank for
International Settlements.
</P>
<P>
   German bank exposure equals about one half of that, Hanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, major American money center banks have about $1.6
billion of pretax losses from Russia, Hanley estimated. Prior to
the Russian crisis, the banks' total exposure was about $6.4
billion. Pretax losses and withdrawn lines of credit have reduced
their net exposure to about $3.3 billion, he said, a modest
percentage of the banks' total capital of about $92 billion and
their total reserves of $15.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, at the height of the Latin American debt crisis
in 1984, loans from money center banks totaled about $58.5 billion,
outpacing the banks' total capital of $26.7 billion and reserves of
$4.1 billion, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
report.
</P>
<P>
   Banks needed several years to recover from the losses, Hanley
said.

AIRLINES ARE IN FOREFRONT OF DRUG FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most drug shipments from Latin America come into the United
States on planes, drug enforcement officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every illegal drug is smuggled aboard airliners. But
heroin ``is the hot topic right now,'' American Airlines spokesman
Tim Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the smuggling is done by passengers, federal officials
said. But air carriers are also faced with employees who sneak
contraband on board.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, seven American Airlines mechanics in Miami were
charged with smuggling after millions of dollars worth of heroin
and cocaine from Colombia were found in fishnet-type material
behind panels in the ceilings, lavatories, kitchens and cockpits of
several American Airlines jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrests came just after nine Delta Air Lines employees
were indicted on charges that they helped smuggle almost $1 billion
worth of cocaine for a Colombian cartel.
</P>
<P>
   To combat such smuggling, American Airlines _ which has
extensive Latin American operations from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
and Miami _ has more than 1,100 people systemwide assigned solely
to anti-drug activities, Smith said. The airline is the biggest
passenger/air cargo shipper to the Fort Worth-Dallas Metroplex from
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have anti-drug people in 29 countries, and we spend in the
neighborhood of $1 million a month on drug security,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, which began extensive Latin American operations during
the past year, has anti-smuggling efforts at its Atlanta hub and in
the Latin American cities it serves, said John Otto, a retired FBI
agent who is the airline's director of corporate security. Routes
have opened into Mexico; the U.S. Virgin Islands; San Juan, Puerto
Rico; Central America; Caracas, Venezuela; Sao Paulo and Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil; and Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Delta does not serve Latin America from Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport, although its partner, Aeromexico, flies to Mexico from
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, American Airlines' efforts have led to
the seizure of 30,000 pounds of drug contraband with a street value
estimated at $600 million to $700 million, and have led to about
800 arrests, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, passengers carrying drugs are much more common than
people trying to put something on an airplane, but that activity
does occur frequently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Airlines and the Customs Service entered into the
Super Carrier Initiative in 1990,'' he said. ``This program
essentially says that the Customs Service recognizes our abilities
and efforts in helping them intercede in the flow of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta, United and Continental airlines also participate in the
initiative, and the four airlines routinely share tactics and
intelligence information to stem the illegal drug trade, Otto said.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes good business sense. Airlines that make a
good-faith effort to stop drug trafficking are less likely to lose
a $100 million aircraft to government confiscation if drugs are
found on board. ``If we're doing our part, they'll give us our
plane back,'' Otto said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' efforts include pre-employment screenings of
personnel who have access to parked aircraft; security guards to
watch aircraft parked overnight at foreign airports; and heavy use
of drug-detection dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping customers from shipping illicit drugs in cargo may be
the more formidable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   American X-rays all of its cargo and inspects every package for
explosives, but that doesn't work for drugs, airline officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put special emphasis on packages shipped by people we don't
know,'' said David Brooks, president of American Airlines' cargo
division. ``But mostly we have to rely on the declarations of the
contents provided by the people who ship the goods.''

BOEING WILL USE LONDON AIRSHOW TO FLEX ITS MUSCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the world's biggest and most important airshows kicks off
Monday outside London, England, with Airbus Industrie strutting in
on the heels of recent headline-grabbing victories over The Boeing
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based aerospace giant, on the other hand, arrives at
the biannual Farnborough International show with its image
tarnished after one of its worst years ever, its reputation on the
line and a new management team taking over the company's core
business of building commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But if an animal is most dangerous when wounded, look out for
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year at the Paris Air Show, where Boeing
deliberately kept a low profile because of European concerns over
its then-impending merger with defense powerhouse McDonnell
Douglas, Boeing will use the Farnborough stage to flex its
considerable military, space and commercial muscles. The world's
largest aerospace company also will showcase many of its products,
from the new 777-300 to its stealthy RAH-66 Comanche scout and
attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Farnborough, Boeing and Airbus
convince customers to hold off announcing new orders until the
show, then both companies try and out duel the other for the
attention of the world's aerospace press, who every two years flock
to Farnborough, the home of British Aerospace some 30 miles outside
of London. It will be no different this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is expected to announce major orders for two of its
planes that are flying for the first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is the Boeing Business Jet, a corporate version of
the 737. So far, Boeing has 29 firm orders, including one from
professional golfer Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently decided that it needed more room for
production of its next generation 737 in Renton and is moving final
assembly of the business jet from Renton to the former Douglas
plant in Long Beach, Calif. But any new orders for the business jet
will also be good news for workers in Renton, who build the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of the Boeing Business Jet in Long Beach should get
under way next month, with an initial production rate of 3 planes a
month by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The business jet, which will compete in a market now dominated
by Gulfstream and Bombardier, will make its inaugural flight Friday
from Renton.
</P>
<P>
   The other new Boeing plane that could find customers at
Farnborough is the 717, which made its first flight Wednesday in
advance of the airshow.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-passenger 717, Boeing smallest commercial jet, took off
on its maiden flight from the Long Beach plant where it is built
and later landed at Boeing's flight test center in Yuma, Ariz. The
flight had been delayed from earlier this summer because of
problems with a new engine developed for the 717. After a test
program and certification, the first of 50 planes is scheduled to
be delivered to launch customer AirTran Airlines in the third
quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only AirTran, formerly ValueJet, has placed any
significant order for the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is expected to announce at the airshow that it, too, has
decided to develop its own 100-seat jet to compete with the 717.
The Airbus plane will be a smaller version of its A319.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing several commercial aircraft orders,
Boeing will also hold press briefings throughout the week-long show
on everything from its plans to eventually build a bigger 747 to
its battle with Lockheed Martin to win what could be a $200 billion
Pentagon contract for the next generation Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   But missing from this year's show will be the imposing figure of
Boeing's Ron Woodard, the plain-speaking, 6-foot-5 master airplane
salesman who until Monday headed the company's Commercial Airplane
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most significant management shakeups in Boeing's
history, Chairman Phil Condit sacked Woodard because of continuing
production problems. Woodard was replaced as group president by
Alan Mulally, the former 777 program manager who has been heading
the company's defense and space business.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing has offered Woodard another position within the
commercial group, he has not yet decided he wants to remain with
the company, a Boeing spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other executives in the commercial group were ousted in the
shakeup and several were moved to different jobs as Boeing
struggles to recover from production snarls that resulted in the
company's first annual loss in 50 years in 1997 and a decline of
almost 50 percent in the company's stock price over the past 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   With Woodard out, Boeing has had to play a musical-chairs game
with its executives as it prepares for the important Farnborough
show.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the opening day, Boeing and Airbus take center stage
with back-to-back news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Until Woodard was removed, the plan was to have him give the
presentation on the company's commercial business, with Boeing
President Harry Stonecipher talking about defense and space as a
substitute for Mulally, who is skipping Farnborough because of a
family reunion that has been planned for many months.
</P>
<P>
   The task of talking about Boeing's ailing commercial division
has fallen to Bruce Dennis, the group's vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The news conferences will take place against the backdrop of a
changing European aerospace industry, in which the Airbus
consortium of four separate companies will soon to be transformed
into a single corporate entity to better compete with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing still dominates commercial aviation, Airbus has
become a much more formidable opponent in the last two years. And
it arrives at Farnborough fresh off a major coup over Boeing. Last
week, British Airways, one of Boeing's most loyal customers,
decided it will buy planes from Airbus for the first time. Some
analysts believe this could be the year Airbus lands as many new
airplane orders as Boeing.

SPORTS COLUMN: OVERCOMING, NOT JUST SURVIVING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alone, with a magazine and her private thoughts.
That's how Monica Seles spent the time before she was summoned onto
the Arthur Ashe Stadium court Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the bustling players' lounge, she stretched herself out by
the window in two facing chairs, draped a towel across her ankles,
and remained in that detached position longer than most
24-year-olds could.
</P>
<P>
   You wondered how many times she might have drifted off to a sad
remembrance of her father, or even the terrible stabbing event that
five years ago nearly shattered and certainly reconfigured her
life. But then a new man in her corner said this would be missing
the essential point about one of the most fascinating and estimable
figures in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica deals with things,'' said Gavin Hopper, her new coach,
after Seles arranged Joannette Kruger's routine departure from the
United States Open, with a 6-2, 6-3 victory in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   It took Hopper one tournament, one fortnight, to realize the
depth of her ability to cope. Karolj Seles succumbed to stomach
cancer, at 64, one week before the French Open last May. A grieving
Monica wore the wedding ring of Karolj _ her father and best friend
and coach _ around her neck, and strung together a chain of
victories that took her all the way to a three-set defeat in the
final to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. If anything, this was a rousing
triumph of the will.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hadn't been on the court for months,'' he said. ``But the
thing about Monica is that she was prepared by her father to take
control of situations by herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that what every parenting deal is, or ought to be? As it
applies to tennis, the temptations are often too great, the
emotions too wild. The fine line between earnest coach and abusive
parent is recklessly crossed. This is an offense that just keeps
repeating itself, especially when young tennis girls are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pierce resurfaced here Tuesday after a five-year ban as the
mentor of someone else's child, but he was still lobbing verbal
grenades at his estranged daughter, Mary; still telling her that
she remains a nobody as long as she isn't No. 1. And then there is
the latest tennis teen-ager to flee daddy dearest, Mirjana Lucic,
with her mother and siblings, amid charges of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is between her and her dad and her family,'' Seles said
curtly when asked about Lucic. But could it just be coincidence
that Seles, herself prematurely forced to adulthood, is partners
with Lucic in women's doubles here this week?
</P>
<P>
   For all her cuts and slings and arrows, Seles, by all accounts,
had a demanding coach but no insufferable dad. Karolj Seles, she
has said, never forced her to the court when she didn't want to
play, never burdened her with the responsibility of winning for
anyone but herself. He even presented her the option of getting out
for good as she nursed the scars of being attacked in Germany by a
deranged fan of her rival, Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   External wounds heal much faster than those to the heart. Cheap
psychology, yes, but, in Seles' case, probably on the money. She is
not No. 1, may never be again, but Hopper wanted to say she is much
more than a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at a tape of her playing Sabatini in 1991 and then
switched to one of her playing Venus Williams three weeks ago,'' he
said. ``It's true, she's not in great shape right now, but she is a
better player than she was. It's just that the other players got
bigger, stronger. They caught up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper, an Australian, formerly coached Amanda Coetzer but
signed on to chaperon Seles along the road to a fitter place, from
where she might add to her nine Grand Slams. He has two young
daughters himself, and one, 7-year-old Jade, is something of a
prodigy at the Bollettieri Academy in Florida, where Seles once
happened upon them. Hopper's firm but gentle style reminded her of
Karolj.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw that I wasn't the mean tennis dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At her father's urging, Seles made a call, and Hopper was soon
at the Seles homestead, trying to bridge a language gap with a
dying man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last few weeks of his life, Karolj kept saying that
Monica's life after tennis was what he was most concerned with,''
Hopper said. ``He wanted her last years in tennis to be happy. Of
course he wanted her to try to get the most of her ability, to put
in the work, but only if she could again love doing the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper was asked if he recalled any last request Karolj Seles
had made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I want my daughter to enjoy the here and now.'''

GIANTS-REDSKINS RIVALRY VIBRANT AFTER 66 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants safety Percy Ellsworth on
Wednesday offered this summary of the appeal and importance of
Sunday's season-opening game with the Washington Redskins:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a home game, it's a game against the team most people
think will win our division and it's a game against a team we hate.
The Redskins are going to come up here mad and they're going to
come up here trying to kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man,'' he said, ``it's the best opening game we could possibly
ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   The season hasn't even started, but the Giants-Redskins rivalry,
which dates to 1932, is already in midseason form.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, via a conference call with reporters, Redskins Coach
Norv Turner said that he expected a physical and emotional game.
His counterpart, Jim Fassel of the Giants, called Sunday's matchup
``a huge game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Redskins have a bad taste in their mouths because we beat
them for the division and then they had to watch us celebrate. We
know they want revenge. But if they think it's going to be a
cakewalk, they're in for a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   There has rarely been anything ordinary about games between the
Giants and Redskins, who have met 130 times. They have had
important, weighty struggles, and games that bordered on the inane.
Thirty-two years ago, Washington defeated the Giants, 72-41, the
most points scored by a National Football League team in a
regular-season game and the most points scored by two teams in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the Giants won the National Football Conference
East title with a stirring 30-10 victory over Washington at Giants
Stadium. It was a game that left the Redskins out of the playoffs
for a fifth successive season and it moved Washington to rework its
roster with the Giants in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants rushed for 287 yards in their two games against
Washington last year. Like other teams Washington faced, the Giants
found the Redskins' defense soft up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Washington spent $57.4 million to lure the
free-agent tackles Dan Wilkinson and Dana Stubblefield to bolster
the defensive front four. It is the biggest reason Washington has
emerged as at least co-favorites in the NFC East with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a normal football response,'' Fassel said of the
Redskins' off-season acquisitions. ``Who won the division? What do
they do? We've got to stop what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants no doubt will still test the middle of the Redskins'
line with fullback Charles Way, who had two of his best games last
season against Washington, rushing for a combined 133 yards on 28
carries.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants will surely test the edges of the Redskins'
defense as well. A short passing game could be crucial, too, since
the Giants' running backs may offer a speed mismatch against the
Redskins' linebacking corps.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, expect a spirited game, with the bad blood between
the teams resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Washington quarterback Gus Frerotte left the first
meeting, a 7-7 tie, between the teams last year with an injured
neck when he head-butted a retaining wall after scoring a
touchdown. Ellsworth said he would be sure to remind Frerotte of
that blunder Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I'll bring that up to him,'' Ellsworth said. ``That
was a crazy thing to do and I'm going to mess with him about it. We
have a lot of guys who talk out there, and so do they. You watch
closely, you'll see who dislikes who pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth was asked to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it's a healthy dislike all the way around,'' he
said. ``Throw everybody in there. You've got two good teams
fighting for the same thing. That's what makes a real rivalry.''

 &HT;    Texas Gov. Bush backs Millner at posh fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush touted Guy Millner before
about 550 Republican activists Wednesday, bolstering the GOP
gubernatorial candidate's campaign bank account and racking up IOUs
the Texan can call in if he decides to run for the presidency in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, who paid $1,000 per person, dined on steak and
salmon in a private dinner before hearing from the son of former
President George Bush, an event Millner's campaign predicted would
add about $500,000 to its already bulging coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a winnable race. Guy Millner is a good candidate, and
one I think the people of Georgia will support,'' Bush said,
speaking to reporters in a news conference at Peachtree-DeKalb
Airport before heading to the pricey event at the Grand Hyatt hotel
in Buckhead. ``There's one thing I can help do, and that is raise
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, considered a leading contender for the GOP presidential
nomination in two years, spent much of the morning on a similar
mission for Republican U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, holding press
conferences and fund-raisers in Columbus and Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first of at least five potential presidental
aspirants scheduled to campaign for Millner before the November
election. Publishing magnate Steve Forbes, former Vice President
Dan Quayle, 1996 presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander and Tennessee
Sen. Fred Thompson also will stomp for Millner in his contest with
Democrat Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it helps to show leadership around the country
recognizes the importance of this race,'' Millner said, noting that
Republicans are trying to break the Democrats' 129-year lock on the
governor's mansion in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   But the visits could be almost as important to would-be
presidential contenders who want to make contacts with the party
faithful in a state that can deliver considerable electoral votes
in an early primary, political scientists said. Bush, who this year
is trying to make history as the first Texas governor to be
re-elected to a four-year term, said he is still undecided about a
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats panned the visit as an overt attempt by a presidential
hopeful to gain ground for the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Though President Clinton has appeared in an event for
Coverdell's opponent, Democrat Michael Coles, Barnes said he never
planned to solicit support from Vice President Al Gore or Clinton,
whom he's roundly criticized for the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barnes said, Gov. Zell Miller and former Sen. Sam Nunn,
both highly respected Georgia Democrats, will headline his
fund-raising efforts.

 &HT;    Hurricane Earl's Entry Expected
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurricane Earl was expected to saturate Georgia today and Friday
after slamming ashore along Florida's panhandle, prompting
emergency officials to start bracing for floods.
</P>
<P>
   Though still offshore, Earl's effects were already being felt
along the Florida's Gulf Coast by early Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On Santa Rosa Island, outside Pensacola, cars plied flooded
streets while trash cans, roofing shingles, small plants and realty
signs flew through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusted up to 50 mph as Panama City Beach residents boarded
up homes and businesses. Many tourists packed up and left.
</P>
<P>
   Apalachicola to the east was practically deserted as stores and
even the bank closed up.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, hurricane-force winds extended out 90 miles to
the east of the center of the storm and tropical storm-force winds
of 39 mph extended out 175 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Earl, which was expected to hit the northwest
Florida with winds of 90 to 100 mph early today and then cut a wide
path northeast through Georgia to South Carolina, is that it's been
an erratic hurricane. The Georgia Emergency Management Agency was
preparing for the possibility that the Flint River may overflow
around Albany, but weather officials said that right now the state
is likely only to get a healthy rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The river levels are down, so southwest Georgia may escape
severe flooding,'' said GEMA spokesman Buzz Weiss. ``We're
preparing for the worst because we've had this experience before...
Alberto, our old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Alberto brought a flood that was the worst
natural disaster in the state's history after it dumped 24 inches
of rain in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Earl also is expected to cool off Atlanta. The forecast for
today was a high of 80 degrees, with a 60 percent of chance of
showers during the day, and lows in the upper 60s, with an 80
percent chance of rain tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl is a bit sluggish,'' he said. ``That's concerning because
Tropical Storm Alberto was sluggish and it stalled over southwest
Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for
southwest Georgia and said Earl was expected to bring 5 to 6 inches
of rain along its arch from Panama City, Fla., to Macon to Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   John Feldt, the hydrologist in charge of the Southeast River
Forecast Center in Peachtree City, said several inches of rain
could mean ``problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think we're going to get a very welcome rain,''
he told The Associated Press Wednesday afternoon. ``As far as
flooding, I would say unless it stalls or slows down, we should be
in acceptable shape.''

PARENTS STRUGGLE TO HANDLE TEEN'S UPS AND DOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE LEE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kristen Taylor is back in rehab, almost nine months after her
parents had her arrested and jailed in a last-ditch attempt to
break her three-year heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor served 28 days in Tarrant County Jail in December and
January before being released to a treatment center and then to her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   She was doing well, working and attending counseling sessions,
but had a relapse in May, her parents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her why she did. She said, `Just no reason,' '' said
her father, Tommy Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is part of Tarrant County's drug court program,
Kristen Taylor, 19, was not arrested for violating the terms of her
probation. Instead, she was sent to a six-month rehabilitation
program in Little Rock, Ark., Tommy Taylor said. Her parents are
paying for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The judge chose Little Rock to isolate the teen-ager from her
friends, many of whom are former or current drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the thing; she kept running into people,'' her father
said. ``One of the times when she relapsed, she ran into someone
(with heroin) at a filling station. I'm sure it is just as readily
available up there, but those daily temptations are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Taylor and his wife, Barbara, were not allowed to write or
visit their daughter for her first few weeks at the rehab center.
They got together on the July Fourth weekend, but Kristen Taylor
was not allowed to leave the center.
</P>
<P>
   The teen has since moved to a halfway house and is scheduled to
be released this month. Her rehabilitation term was reduced because
of the progress she is making, her father said. She and her parents
keep in touch through letters and telephone calls. Tommy Taylor
said his daughter is considering getting a job in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Taylor could not be reached to comment because of
confidentiality rules at the treatment center.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy and Barbara Taylor are still getting used to the
adjustments they made to cope with their daughter's addiction. They
moved into a smaller home this summer in Bedford, Texas, partly to
defray the costs of the treatment and a defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Taylor, an insurance salesman who is on the
Hurst-Euless-Bedford school board, started teaching this semester
in a vocational program at O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed it. He was really starting to withdraw, dealing with
Kristen all the time,'' Barbara Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Taylor said he has no regrets about his decision to have
his daughter jailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went up there to visit ... a man came up and said,
`You're Tommy Taylor. I want you to know that what you did helped
me,' '' Taylor said. ``He had had his son arrested, and he said,
`It saved my son's life.' ''

 &HT;    Shortstop DeRosa gains opportunity
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years removed from the University of Pennsylvania campus,
Mark DeRosa had made good progress through the Braves system, but
nothing that suggested to him that a Tuesday night phone call would
be summoning him to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, such is Atlanta's state at shortstop. With Walt Weiss
sitting out a week after a cortisone treatment for a chronic left
quadriceps, with Ozzie Guillen nursing a sore thumb, the Braves
purchased DeRosa's contract from Class AA Greenville to protect
themselves at short in a September surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It might also mean an end to outfielder Damon Hollins' days with
the organization. To make room on the 40-man roster for DeRosa, the
Braves designated Hollins for assignment, meaning he can be claimed
by any team over the next five business days. A seven-year veteran
of the organization, Hollins hit .264 at Class AAA Richmond and at
age 24, had not made substantial progress toward making the Atlanta
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still young. He has a future,'' said general manager John
Schuerholz. ``But he had not played as well as he might have this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRosa hit .267 with Greenville with 26 doubles, eight homers
and 49 RBI. But he made 20 errors in 125 games, which interests the
Braves most. Invited to the major league camp last spring, he made
a strong first impression but never envisioned finishing the season
in Atlanta. Until Weiss recovers, he may see playing time through
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't played a lot (2 1/2 minor league seasons) but he's
an athlete,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``He's been playing very good
defense. He had a solid year with the bat. He's going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Odalis intro
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are not planning any further September call-ups,
after third baseman Wes Helms is recalled today. But left-hander
Odalis Perez already scored the first strong impression, after
throwing a scoreless seventh inning Tuesday night. He said he was
nervous but for just one pitch. His fastball topped out at 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rings and they tell me I'm up,'' Perez said. ``So,
this is my opportunity. I've got to do my job. I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez threw a 156 1/3 innings this season (23 starts in
Greenville and 13 relief appearances in Richmond). Though he
experienced some shoulder trouble in April _ he worked on strict
pitch-counts in 1997 to avoid arm problems _ Perez wound up
striking out 165 with just 60 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Javy, meet Doggie
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez caught Greg Maddux for the first time all season
Wednesday night, taking over Eddie Perez's usual duty. The purpose
was two-pronged. Lopez will be teamed with Maddux during the
postseason, which gives them at least one game to re-acquaint
themselves on the field. The other is related to offense, since
Andres Galarraga began serving his suspension Wednesday night and
Lopez entered the game with seven homers in his last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galy's out of the lineup,'' said Cox. ``You can't sit 80 home
runs, I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez hit in Galarraga's clean-up spot.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's limp
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Keith Lockhart is hopeful sitting out Wednesday,
combined with today's off-day, will be enough to cool off a
strained right hamstring he sustained Tuesday night while trying to
field a Derek Bell grounder. Already slated for left (non-throwing)
shoulder surgery after the season to repair a torn rotator cuff,
Lockhart has never encountered hamstring trouble before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 13th season and I played 11 without really
anything,'' he said. ``It's just tough to be consumed by an injury
all the time, whether it's a shoulder or whatever. You try to mask
it as much as you can.''

 &HT;    No reduction for Galarraga
 &HT;    ByThomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fax was in his clubhouse letter box waiting for him, but
Bobby Cox gave Andres Galarraga the news Wednesday before he got to
the envelope: Take some time off. Now.
</P>
<P>
   National League president Len Coleman denied the Braves first
baseman's appeal of his suspension, letting stand without comment
Galarraga's three-game penalty for ``instigating a bench-clearing
incident,'' as Coleman's letter called it, on Aug. 22 against Los
Angeles. Also upheld was the $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping at least one day (in reduction),'' Galarraga
said. ``I was expecting two days, max. I think it's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was instructed by Coleman to begin serving the
suspension immediately, which means he missed Wednesday night's
final game with Houston and will miss the first two of four games
against the Mets in New York this weekend. Darren Dreifort, the
Dodgers pitcher who hit Galarraga on both Aug. 15 and 22, when the
fight ensued, was not penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite interim Dodgers general manager Tommy Lasorda's demand
that manager Bobby Cox also be punished for threatened retaliation,
Cox never was included in Coleman's judgement. But it did not mean
that Cox accepted Wednesday's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let it drop at this,'' he said. ``It was intentional both
times. I don't give a damn what anybody says. And that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves made a 45-minute appeal to Coleman on Tuesday,
including video tapes of both Dreifort plunkings. Although the
incident seemed to stem the barrage Galarraga had been withstanding
_ he has been hit just once in the 10 games since the fight _ it
could not have helped his case that Galarraga served a three-game
suspension for the same offense just last year. He has charged the
mound three times in his 13-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though (the hearing) would do a little bit of good,
presenting our story, which is the truth,'' Cox said. ``But it
didn't get us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to tell everybody,'' Galarraga said, ``(that)
we can't charge the mound, no matter what.''

 &HT;    Carolina tries West Coast style
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Atlanta Falcons line up against Carolina on Sunday in
the season opener, the Panthers will offer something different. The
West Coast passing offense will be nothing like the more
traditional look Carolina offered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the Panthers replaced offensive coordinator
Joe Pendry with former Green Bay receivers coach Gil Haskell, and
he brought with him parts of the offense devised by, among others,
former 49er and Stanford coach Bill Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the passing offense relies more on short, timing
routes, and quarterback Kerry Collins is called upon to take a
shorter drop, generally three to five steps, and get rid of the
ball in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina coach Dom Capers said the decision to change wasn't
difficult. After watching the 49ers run circles around the NFC West
for years, and seeing other teams have success with versions of the
same game plan, he called Haskell and offered a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always go back to the things you have the hardest time
defending,'' Capers said. ``I have great respect for what (Packers
coach) Mike Holmgren (a former 49er offensive coordinator) has done
... and playing against them the last two years, we had as tough a
time defending them as any team we played.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense will take advantage of Carolina tight end and
Falcon-killer Wesley Walls' ability to find seams in coverages and
get yards after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who had the 26th-ranked passing attack in the NFL
last year when they averaged 177.8 yards per game, ran it well in
the preseason, completing 91 of 149 passes (61.1 percent) for 1,146
yards, six touchdowns and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   But the running game has struggled, averaging just 78 yards per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not running the 49er offense; let's make that clear,''
said Rich Brooks, Falcons assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator. ``The passing game is the biggest change. The running
game is a mixture, probably leaning toward what they did a year ago
(with a lot of fullback-lead plays).
</P>
<P>
   ``(The passing game is) a problem because the ball is out so
quick,'' Brooks said, ``unless you can reroute some receivers,
disrupt the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta right defensive end Chuck Smith, who has five sacks in
six games against Carolina, is not happy about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to have a good secondary; they got to hold (receivers)
up,'' Smith said. ``You're going to have to blitz some. They just
drop, 1-2-3, boom! and the ball's out.''

BALLOTS COUNTED AND FOLEY IS CAPTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ His teammates are convinced that Glenn Foley
is not only their quarterback but their leader, too. Wednesday they
elected him the offensive captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor, obviously. I didn't expect it,'' said Foley,
who has had only five previous career starts before Sunday's
regular-season opener against the 49ers in San Francisco. ``It's
been a rocky road to become the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Foley suffered two season-ending injuries. In
1995, he suffered a dislocated shoulder and last season he tore
knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the title of captain is merely an honorific. Last
season, it was quarterback Neil O'Donnell. But it took Joe Namath
four years to be voted the captain by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariucci, the 49ers' head coach, was asked Wednesday,
``What do you think of Foley?'' Mariucci knows the Jets' personnel.
He was able to point out the first and last names of each member of
the Jets' defensive backfield, including the rookie free safety,
Kevin Williams. But Mariucci, a former quarterback coach, froze on
Foley's first name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane Foley? I think Shane Foley's a good player,'' said
Mariucci. ``A smart guy and a good decision-maker. I worked him out
in college. I think he's doing well for himself. I think he's in a
perfect situation for what he's playing. They're going to run the
football which I think is an ideal situation for a quarterback to
be in.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand if the name Glenn Foley doesn't come as
easily as, say, Steve Young or even Neil O'Donnell. But to his
teammate Keyshawn Johnson, Foley was the obvious pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him,'' said Johnson. ``Everyone likes him. You
look at him. He's the quarterback. It makes a lot of sense. You
want him to be the leader. I think he likes being the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been one to play hard and have confidence,'' he
said. ``You have to perform consistently every day, and leadership
qualities go with that. This is a big honor for me. It's the guys I
work with. It's not height or weight or experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not have an abundance of those _ he is 6 feet 2 inches
tall. He put on 15 pounds to tip the scales at 220. He has never
produced a complete-game victory. Over all, he has seen action in
parts of 13 games since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Parcells told Foley that he had been elected captain,
the coach added, ``now you're going to have to talk to me.'' That
was a response to Foley, who has complained to Parcells that, ``I
play better when I don't have to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the vote says something about Foley, Parcells
replied, ``absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a secret ballot,'' he said. ``There's no raising
hands. We bring in the papers and make them vote. There's no time
for lobbying in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets you motivated,'' said Wayne Chrebet. ``He's not afraid
to say how he feels. He'll stick his nose in there, and if guys are
banging heads, he's banging heads, too. He's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the inexperienced Foley, a pair of senior
linebackers each got the same number of votes and were elected
defensive co-captains: Mo Lewis, a Jet since 1991, and 34-year-old
Pepper Johnson. Johnson had the honor last year. &QL;

 USWeb, CKS Group in $300 million deal   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
In a merger of Bay Area Internet-consulting pioneers, design firm
USWeb Corp. yesterday agreed to buy advertising agency CKS Group
Inc. in a stock swap worth about $300 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The combined company will resurface under the new name Reinvent
Communications Inc., which company officials hope will take
advantage of the two firm's strengths _ USWeb's technological
acumen and CKS's creative marketing prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies have lost client opportunities because we've
lacked each other's depth'' of services, said Joe Firmage, chief
executive of Santa Clara-based USWeb.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage will take the same role with Reinvent when the deal is
completed around year end.
</P>
<P>
   Cupertino-based CKS Group Chairman Mark Kvamme will be chairman
of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on a cell phone while they were driving from one
headquarters to another, Kvamme and Firmage scoffed at reports that
they would bump heads on strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We immediately saw the opportunities and came together very
quickly,'' Kvamme said. ``We have a complete vision lock, kind of
like a mind meld.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said the deal makes strategic sense in a
rapidly changing Internet advertising market.
</P>
<P>
   However, they also said USWeb faces the challenge of reinventing
its own brand image and potential pitfalls in assimilating the
creative culture of CKS Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one fell swoop, USWeb has considerably bolstered their
creative capabilities,'' said analyst Ullas Naik of First Albany
Corp. ``The problem is they have spent a lot of money investing in
the USWeb brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   Each company has about 800 employees, and Firmage said there are
no plans to cut back staff. The companies have not decided where
its new headquarters will be located.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest purchase yet for USWeb, which has grown
largely through acquisition. USWeb provides Internet consulting and
design services for companies like Chevron, Charles Schwab and
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   But Firmage said his firm recently lost a major account, which
he declined to name, because USWeb could not provide a creative
marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme, meanwhile, said CKS found it could not even submit a bid
recently because the potential client required a powerful computer
CKS did not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen in the marketplace is the need for a company
that can truly integrate creative capabilities with technology,''
Firmage said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Reinvent will have the expertise to deal with a
client's company technical and marketing executives _ an important
strength as businesses move toward Web commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given where the market was going, I felt they needed to beef
up their technological side,'' said Steven Horen, an analyst with
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb will exchange 1.5 shares for each of CKS Group's 15.9
million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   CKS stock, which last year hit a high of $46.25 per share,
closed up $1.13 at $15.25 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   USWeb shares dropped about 14 percent, closing down $2.13 at
$12.32.

 Intel Insider Tells How Chipmaker Stays on Top   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Intel's rise to the ranks of a superpower in the semiconductor
industry has been due in part to a willingness to take risks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a senior vice president and the man in charge of Intel's
microprocessors, Albert Yu details some of those risks in his new
book, ``Creating the Digital Future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yu's book leaves out the one story that illustrates his own
risk-taking credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year career veteran at Intel left the chipmaker briefly
in 1977 to start a company called Video Brain that turned out to be
an unsuccessful attempt to build home computers six years before
anyone was ready for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable task,'' Yu said in an interview. He
said when the home PC finally became a hit in 1983, ``it was
basically no different than what we had put together, except we
used audio tape, not a floppy disk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a risk,'' Yu said. ``Financially, I didn't do well.''
</P>
<P>
   But that experience provided him with some valuable lessons,
including the need to keep an entrepreneurial edge. ``Intel is a
30-year-old startup,'' Yu said. ``A lot of our success is due to
the way we manage.''
</P>
<P>
   His book provides some management tips to maintain that edge,
including the company's legendary cubicle culture. Everyone,
including chief executive Craig Barrett, works in a standard gray
cubicle. ``We have no doors,'' Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the modern startup, which tends to have a loose informal
culture, discipline plays an important role in Intel's corporate
culture. ``Meetings start on time,'' Yu said. ``If someone's not
there on time, we look at that guy funny. ... The point is, the
customer expects us to do certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees are also encouraged to practice ``constructive
confrontation.'' For example, when Intel was struggling to put out
the latest version of its 386 computer chip _ a precursor to
today's popular Pentiums _ Yu fought efforts to remove cache memory
functions from the chip.
</P>
<P>
   People ``presented me with data showing they could get the chip
out much faster, and manufacturing would be much easier'' without
the cache, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu said they were right and the company went on to create a
successful chip without cache memory. ``Just because I have a
position of power doesn't mean I'm right,'' Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu's book is not a tell-all, and he doesn't use it to criticize
anyone other than himself. That's understandable since he still
works at Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``His book really outlines some of the challenges Intel has
faced, and how they've overcome them,'' said Linley Gwennap, editor
of Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter.

HEROIN SUPPLY SHIFTS SOUTH, PUTS PRESSURE ON TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR and SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a dramatic shift, Mexico and Colombia have edged out Asia as
leading U.S. suppliers of heroin, prompting more drug traffickers
to use Texas as a major heroin smuggling route, Drug Enforcement
Administration reports show.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of European lab technicians, Colombian traffickers
hit on a formula in 1993 for producing high-grade heroin, according
to authorities. Forced to compete, Mexican drug organizations began
producing larger quantities of better-refined black tar heroin two
years ago for U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin has also come across from Mexico for a long time; it's
one of the older drugs,'' said Roberto Medina, U.S. customs
associate special agent in charge in El Paso. ``What's made it more
popular and common is its better refinement.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what authorities describe as a marriage of convenience,
Mexican and Colombian drug kingpins have joined forces to push pure
heroin into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies suspect that Colombian drug cartel lab
technicians have been teaching Mexican drug organizations how to
better refine opium poppies to produce white powder heroin, which
is even more potent than black tar or brown powder dope. Mexican
drug organizations usually skip the chemical treatment and
filtering steps that turn heroin into a white powder.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, heroin addicts have traditionally preferred
inexpensive Mexican black tar, even when it was only 30 percent
pure.
</P>
<P>
   Black tar heroin, still considered cheap, is now hitting the
streets at 70 percent pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border is wide open, everything is coming from Mexico. The
dope is just pure,'' said John Hyder, a heroin addict and a
prisoner in Lew Sterrett Justice Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian traffickers first turned to Mexican syndicates after a
crackdown against the cocaine empire in south Florida in the late
1980s forced them to find new routes. At first, Mexican syndicates
were content to be paid per haul of cocaine to allow Colombian drug
lords to use their established routes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, impatient with the deal and bolstered by their increased
wealth, Mexican cartels demanded half the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant the Colombians had to give up territory and cities
in the U.S.,'' said Don Ferrarone, a retired Drug Enforcement
Administration official who led the Houston office. ``They had to
say to the Mexicans, `OK, if you sell on the street, we're not
going to come after you, we're not going to kill you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Colombian drug lords eventually want to monopolize the U.S.
heroin market, just as they do in the cocaine trade. They even
require cocaine dealers to sell heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a buyer and you want to buy 250 kilos of cocaine,
the Colombians say, `We're going to give you 2 kilos of heroin and
you're going to sell it for this price,' '' Ferrarone said.

   D/FW AIRPORT _ The woman with a Panamanian passport in her hand
and a baby on her hip made a blip on Jeff Trahan's internal
drug-seeking radar as he scanned the crowd in the international
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Trahan, a U.S. Customs Service inspector, stopped the woman as
she got off a flight from Panama City _ a place on the ``hot list''
for smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Her answers to his questions raised more red flags.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had traveled from Panama City to San Jose, Costa Rica,
to Guatemala to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. When she said she had
only been to the United States twice, Trahan wondered why she spoke
English so well. Then, there was the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trend,'' he said. ``Smugglers travel with kids to throw
you off the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Politely but persistently, Trahan questioned the woman and
searched her luggage, but found no evidence of drugs and told her
that she was free to go. He switched his radar back on.
</P>
<P>
   With their appointed roles as front-line troops in the war
against drugs, customs inspectors have much broader search and
seizure powers than other law enforcement agencies. They can search
any traveler in the airport _ any time _ without a warrant, and
they can send suspects to the hospital for X-rays to see whether
they have swallowed drug-filled balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their challenge is daunting: pinpointing the ``mules''
bringing in heroin and other drugs among the millions of passengers
that travel through D/FW's international terminals each year.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, as many as 40 customs inspectors scrutinize 4,000
baggage-toting travelers looking for clues to the potential drug
smugglers. Could it be the businessman with callouses? The
grandfather who appears jittery and avoids eye contact?
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, D/FW customs inspectors seized 382 pounds of
narcotics, including 22 pounds of heroin, said Anne Marie Spiess,
director of passenger operations for customs at D/FW. A year
earlier, they seized 5 pounds of illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although computers generate profiles of potential smugglers,
experienced inspectors say that instincts, tips and detective work
are better indicators. Because even tiny quantities of heroin can
be profitable, the drug can be hidden almost anywhere, and
smugglers change their methods as quickly as inspectors detect a
technique.
</P>
<P>
   D/FW agents have found heroin and cocaine in false bottoms of
suitcases, in surfboard bags, in shampoo and deodorant bottles, in
a skullcap woven to a woman's hair, in a 50-pound bag of rice.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, inspectors once detained a man who had had his thigh
surgically opened and filled with cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy couldn't walk by the time he got off the plane,''
Spiess said.
</P>
<P>
   But inspectors also must be on the lookout for counterfeit
trademarks, pornography, undeclared cash and harmful plants. And
they have a commitment to ensure that the majority of passengers
are cleared within five minutes of picking up their baggage, Spiess
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationwide, every customs office will tell you we never have
enough sets of eyes and brains out there,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a mad 2 p.m. rush on a recent weekday at D/FW, hundreds of
passengers clogged the baggage claim area after arriving from
Caracas, Venezuela; Frankfurt, Germany; London and Manchester,
England; Monterrey, Mexico; Panama City; and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Trahan and two other inspectors quickly scanned the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough _ especially on the weekends when you have 1,000
people at four carousels and an eight-man team of inspectors,''
Trahan said.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his eye on luggage tags to see where the travelers were
going. He reviewed passports, looking for travelers from Colombia.
He interrogated a young man in a wheelchair who was en route to New
Orleans from London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people use wheelchairs to throw you off, like the
babies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of smugglers tend to be foreign nationals, Spiess
said. The ``hot'' flights to watch come from Brazil, Chile,
Guatemala and Panama, and from Caracas, Venezuela, Mexico City and
Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But as politics change, so do the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eventually you will see Russia being used as a transit
area or Cuba, if things get settled there,'' Spiess said.
</P>
<P>
   Because smugglers often travel at short notice, many have new
passports and clothing. In some cases, inspectors have seen a
passenger with a price tag hanging from his suit.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors pepper any suspect with questions about
passports, tickets, travel plans and other issues for clues. In
many cases, smugglers don't buy their tickets, so they may be hard
pressed to answer inspectors' queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you catch them in an outright lie, they fall apart,'' said
Trahan, 32, who worked six years on the Texas-Mexico border as a
customs inspector and canine enforcement officer before joining
D/FW agents last year.
</P>
<P>
   With their sweeping search authority, customs inspectors can
look through a traveler's wallet, ask a man to lift up his pants
leg or open gift boxes in luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Wallets can be a gold mine of information, Trahan said,
especially when it leads to the discovery of the ``$2,000 money
trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Colombia drug dealers pay their smugglers $2,000, he said.
The smuggler must pay $40 in airport taxes to leave Cali, Colombia,
and then has $1,960 left over _ most of it in $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   Spiess once nabbed a heroin smuggler through her keen ear for
accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a man who said that he was Puerto Rican,'' Spiess
said. ``I grew up in New York and realized his accent was not
Puerto Rican.''
</P>
<P>
   She checked into his ticket and found discrepancies in his
frequent flier number and passport. After some digging, she
pinpointed his identity: a cocaine trafficker who had escaped from
an Ecuadorean jail. This time, he had heroin hidden in the false
bottom of a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say they lack the latest technology to help
nab drug traffickers. If North Texas is designated as a
high-density drug trafficking area, an estimated $5 million in the
first year would help pay for additional law enforcement resources,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an agency, we are very enforcement-minded and want to take
drugs off the street,'' said Judy Turner, a spokeswoman for the
Customs Service in Houston. ``No matter how much we seize, we want
to be finding more.''

EX-GENERAL FIGHTS FOR SCHOOLS, AND FOR HIS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle made an unusual choice three years ago when it
tapped John Henry Stanford as superintendent of public schools. He
had no background in school administration, but the former Army
general and director of logistics in the Persian Gulf war did bring
a Patton-style intensity to his crusade to improve public education
here.
</P>
<P>
   He inspected schools as though they were platoons, rallied
corporate Seattle to create a charitable arm for public education,
and cajoled voters into approving a $150 million school levy that
they had rejected just months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If Stanford's can-do spirit seemed a tad too self-assured at
times _ ``Perfect and improving'' was his standard response to a
``How are you?'' greeting _ people in Seattle by and large seemed
thrilled to have the retired two-star general in charge.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford, who liked to boast that he had not missed a single
day of work in 38 years, is now fighting a more personal crusade,
one that has drawn an extraordinary amount of local attention and
that he is using to try to teach the schoolchildren of Seattle yet
another lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Stanford can do this, you know, you can do anything too,''
said the 59-year-old general, speaking by telephone in a raspy
voice, weakened by treatments he is undergoing for myelogenous
leukemia, a type of blood cancer, that was diagnosed this past
spring like a bolt from the blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a man who is not giving up,'' he continued, referring
to himself, as he is inclined to do, in the third person. ``So why
would you ever give up, just because you have a problem you don't
understand? Stanford's undergone three chemotherapies and a bone
transplant, and he's not giving up. He says he's coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the chemotherapy was deemed unsuccessful, Stanford
underwent an operation a few weeks ago, in which doctors injected
cells from his older sister's blood in the hope of regenerating
healthy cells in Stanford. But the doctors have put the odds of a
successful recovery at somewhere between 1 and 4 and 1 in 5.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's fight with leukemia has been the subject of extensive
newspaper and television coverage, and has set off a wave of public
support. The Stanford Book Fund, established by a foundation that
supports the public schools and widely publicized with a $78,000
contribution from Pearl Jam, the alternative rock group based here,
has quickly collected more than $500,000 _ more than enough to meet
the district's goal of buying at least one new book for each of its
47,500 students.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, Seattle plans to hold a citywide ``100 percent
back-to-school rally,'' largely to honor Stanford, who, as a black
general and the ambitious son of parents with a grade school
education, has frequently been compared by the Seattle media with
his famous friend Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Even from his hospital bed, Stanford said, he is carrying on as
much of the work of superintendent as he can. Visitors are limited,
but he speaks by phone with principals and other administrators and
says he is looking forward to two-way videophone conferences when
he returns home from the hospital in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   But the broader question for Seattle's roughly 100 public
schools is whether Stanford can successfully use his personal
struggle to galvanize further action on the promises he made when
he came here from the county manager's job in Atlanta, or whether
his illness will impede his efforts to change a system that has
been struggling to prevent middle-class flight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He is frequently on the telephone, still full of ideas. ``He
just called one day,'' after checking into the hospital this
spring, said BiHoa Caldwell, principal of the 625-student South
Shore Middle School in southeast Seattle. He wanted ``to know how
the kids were doing, what progress we were making. But it was
clearly tough on him, not to be out and about. He's a very
action-oriented person.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the attention given to his current plight gives him an
educational platform, Stanford is unable to cut the figure with
children that he did when he was healthy. He sometimes engaged in
wall-climbing exercises, and even flew a helicopter onto school
grounds for the children to reward them for their reading. When a
student asked him how much money he made, Stanford said: ``I make
$175,000 a year, and so can you if you read, read, read.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford has generally drawn praise for injecting a new sense of
vitality and optimism into the schools. When he first arrived, he
was a constant presence, giving speeches or appearing at community
events, always with the same message: ``You will doom this city
that you love if you fail to support the public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have tried to get that point across,'' he said.
``Everyone should feel a stake. You cannot do this business of
public education without the taxpayers who don't have children in
schools, parents who do have children in the schools, without
business, churches, temples and mosques, nonprofits, the government
at every level.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite some benchmark improvements _ SAT scores rose
recently for the third year, climbing above the national average,
and dropout rates have declined _ Stanford's mission is far from
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, especially whites, still send their children to
private schools. The student population in the district is about 40
percent white, and the minority population, except for small
percentages of Hispanic and American Indian students, is roughly
split between blacks and Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of all parents with school-age children in
Seattle send them to private schools, compared with a national
average of around 14 percent. Overall, Seattle once had about
100,000 students in its public schools, but despite its population
boom in recent years, the number of children in the public schools
is less than half that. While some of the drop is attributable to
decreased family sizes, it also stems from declining confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were Stanford's ideas universally acclaimed here. His
suggestions that all public school students wear uniforms and that
parents be assessed with ``report cards'' on how well they prepare
and encourage their children, did not go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   One disgruntled teacher even established a Web site critical of
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Still the evidence of good will now, during his illness, is
overwhelming. He has been deluged with letters and hats, and his
request that well-wishers buy books for the schools instead of
flowers for him has obviously caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Pasquarella, president of the Alliance for Education, a
nonprofit organization that supports public education here, said
she believed his message was being heard. ``This city rallied
behind him even before he got sick,'' she said. ``That's the
important part of this story.'' &QL;

U.S. DEFENDS ATTACK ON SUDANESE DRUG PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER and STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the United States launched cruise missiles
against a factory in the Sudan on Aug. 20, it was unaware that the
plant made medicines, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that the incomplete intelligence was irrelevant
to President Clinton's decision to destroy it. He said the attack
was justified by information showing that the plant made Empta, a
key ingredient for VX, a nerve agent, and might be linked to Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire suspected of ordering the bombing of
the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The financial connection between the plant and bin Laden was at
most ``indirect,'' Cohen said Wednesday, modifying his assertion on
the night of the attack that ``he had contributed to this
particular facility.'' In the decision to destroy the factory, ``we
decided that if he had a connection, as we believe he did, it would
be wise to take it down,'' Cohen said Wednesday during a visit to
Fort Drum in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the attack, Sudan's ambassador to the United States
said Wednesday that it showed Washington's ``Wild West,
shoot-first-boys-and-ask-questions-later philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the United States did not learn until at least three
days after the attack on the plant that it made medicine. Other
officials said intelligence officers had searched the factory's
Internet site and commercial databases and did not find lists of
medicines for sale.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with senators Wednesday, the CIA again asserted
that its reported discovery of Empta near the factory was proof
that the plant could be used by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as January, senior U.S. officials had no hard
evidence linking the Sudan to chemical weapons, according to
testimony before the Senate intelligence committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA sent an agent to the plant, and that agent stole a
soil sample from inside the plant's gates, a few yards from the
building, officials said. The soil contained more than twice the
level of Empta that would be considered a trace, the director of
Central Intelligence, George Tenet, told senators Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Empta is a rare chemical used in the production of VX. The
United States insists there is no reason for it to be found in a
pharmaceutical plant. Others, however, say it could be confused
with pesticides that have similar characteristics. And the
international body that seeks to eliminate chemical weapons says
that theoretically there are other uses for Empta, though it does
not know of any commercial products using it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sudan's ambassador, Madhi Ibrahim Mohammed, insisted
Wednesday that the plant was not part of an Iraqi-backed effort to
make weapons for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plant was not manufacturing chemical weapons for
terrorists,'' he said in a speech at the National Press Club. ``It
was engaged in manufacturing human and veterinary medicine, and was
an approved supplier of export medicine under the U.N.'s
food-for-oil program. The U.N. licensed the Sudan to send medicine
under that program, under the supervision of the U.N., to Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Wednesday that the contract, awarded in
December, has never been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed said his nation would have been glad to help root out
suspected terrorist operations if Americans had asked. ``They
instead organized a strike team and sent Tomahawk missiles soaring
into our capital, killing and maiming innocent civilians and
destroying private property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, who said his superiors had approached the White
House, the State Department and the FBI offering to help fight
terrorism over the past two years, said his government was
recalling him to Khartoum in protest of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed met on Tuesday with Susan Rice, assistant secretary of
state for African affairs. She told him the attack was ``not
against the Sudanese people, and not against the Sudanese
government, but against a facility where we had very credible
evidence that this chemical was being produced,'' said an American
official at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting and Mohammed's speech Wednesday disclosed how deeply
the two countries disagree over whether the Sudan has been an eager
backer of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at the request of the United States and Saudi Arabia,
the Sudan expelled bin Laden, who moved to Afghanistan. It handed
over the fugitive terrorist known as Carlos to France in a CIA
operation.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough to remove the Sudan from Washington's
short list of states it considers sponsors of terrorism, where it
landed in 1993. Sudanese leaders and diplomats stand accused by the
United States of taking part in conspiracies to blow up landmarks
in New York and to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
The American Embassy in Khartoum, closed in 1996 after a terrorist
threat, is shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   The Sudan remains on the list because it never carried out
promises to fight terrorism, said an American official who met with
Mohammed on Tuesday. ``The Sudan did not follow up against other
groups and the remnants of bin Laden's organization,'' the official
said. ``The Sudan and its supporters are now engaged in a public
relations campaign to convince the world that the Shifa plant was
not a legitimate target.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Sudanese officials that the plant produced
roughly half of the medicines used in the Sudan, one of the world's
poorest nations, has elicited some sympathy among European,
African, Arab and Asian diplomats. But the soil sample said to
contain Empta has convinced the United States government that the
plant was a legitimate target.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBERS SENT TO TRAIN ON GUAM
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The Pentagon announced Wednesday that it was
sending three B-52s and three B-2 stealth bombers on a training
mission in Guam that officials characterized as a show of force
aimed at terrorist groups associated with Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The six bombers _ along with tanker aircraft and 250 aviators
from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana and Whiteman Air Force
Base in Missouri _ are to arrive on Sunday and stay for about a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching cruise missiles against a paramilitary base in
Afghanistan and a factory in the Sudan, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and other administration officials have refused to rule out
the possibility of strikes against other sites associated with bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The B-52s and B-2s are powerful bombers, capable of dropping
thousands of pounds of nuclear or conventional bombs. But the B-2s,
which cost $2.3 billion each, have never taken part in a combat
mission. The deployment to Guam will be only their second training
mission overseas; its first came earlier this year when two of the
black, bat-shaped bombers spent five weeks on training flights from
Guam.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator in 1989, Cohen derided the idea of using the B-2
against terrorists. ``It's the equivalent of saying we're going to
send a Rolls-Royce down into a combat zone to pick up groceries,''
he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Air Combat Command said the six bombers would
carry only conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes only two days after North Korea tested an
advanced medium-range missile by firing it over Japan. The test has
inflamed tensions, but a military official discounted the link
between the deployment and North Korea's test.

FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, JUST WRITE ABOUT JEFF GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more Jeff Gordon wins on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, the
harder he is making my job. Because it seems that there is just no
right way to write about Jeff Gordon anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After Gordon won the Brickyard 400 last month, an anonymous
woman caller left a message on my voice mail at the office. This
fan chastised me for writing a story about offers made to Gordon to
race in Formula One and the CART open-wheeled series. Instead, the
woman suggested that I should be investigating the illegal chassis
she is convinced Gordon is using to cheat his way into Victory
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   This was a veiled reference to the ``T-Rex'' Chevrolet Gordon
drove to victory in The Winston all-star race at Charlotte Motor
Speedway in May 1997. That chassis was so slick out of the box that
NASCAR officials ``suggested'' to the management at Hendrick
Motorsports that they not bring it back without modifications.
</P>
<P>
   The recent paranoia surrounding Gordon, the Winston Cup points
leader, continued the week after the Brickyard 400 when the series
visited Watkins Glen, N.Y., for the second road-course race of the
season. My Sunday advance story on the viability of road racing in
NASCAR included a line that stated Gordon ``whines'' on his in-car
radio during conversations with crew chief Ray Evernham. A Gordon
fan in Arlington criticized me in a letter for that observation,
which he took as a huge slap at a nice young man.
</P>
<P>
   I did not write, or suggest, that Gordon could not drive a stock
car. Hey, the guy whines in his race car. That doesn't mean I have
an agenda either for or against Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But now NASCAR is having an independent laboratory investigate
Gordon's racing tires. What should we all make of this?
</P>
<P>
   Led by rival Ford team owner Jack Roush, some competitors
believe that someone at Team Hendrick is illegally ``soaking''
their allotted Goodyear Eagle radials in some kind of undetectable
chemical. Or maybe a secret bearnaise sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that softer tires have more grip, especially
through the corners, which is where the winners are separated from
the whiners in Winston Cup. The alleged soaked tires supposedly are
allowing Gordon to take on only right-side hides late in a race and
still whip the quarter-panels off cars that have taken on four
fresh tires.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory in the CMT 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway on Sunday _ his ninth of the season and fifth in the past
six races _ prompted NASCAR's decision to impound his tires for
postrace examination.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the Cup champion in two of the past three years,
addressed the issue on the radio show ``NASCAR Live'' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to stir up all this controversy, but all we're trying
to do is win races,'' said Gordon, who has 38 victories in 179
career Cup starts _ or a victory every 4.71 starts. ``I have a lot
of respect for (runner-up) Mark Martin and all the guys on the
Valvoline team. They race us hard. I feel like they're within the
rules, and we're within the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only disappointing thing to me is Jack Roush kind of took
away from our win. I lost a lot of respect for Jack. I hope he'll
apologize to our team. They don't deserve that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardon Roush if he waits until the results are in.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR rules stipulate a minimum fine of $200 a tire if a
violation is found. That's chump change to anybody competing in
Winston Cup today. But a driver could be thrown out of an event if
found to be fudging on the rules, and the loss of any precious
race-day points should serve as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Recall that in 1995 Evernham and the team were fined after the
Coca-Cola 600, where a ``non-approved'' wheel hub was found on the
car by NASCAR after Gordon crashed. Racers traditionally have
interpreted the NASCAR rule book to their specifications. But even
the tenacious Martin, who trails Gordon by 67 points, said he did
not see any big deal in NASCAR's decision to impound and inspect
his tires. Or Gordon's tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll find anything,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I, because I don't think Gordon's team is cheating. I
don't think Gordon has misled people. I doubt anyone will find a
bottle of androstenedione in his motorhome. I hope that Jeff
flosses daily.
</P>
<P>
   But just for the sake of argument, whatever happened to the
T-Rex? &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL; 
NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Jack Roush's ire over the alleged tire-soaking going
on at Hendrick Motorsports is interesting in light of comments he
and ace driver Mark Martin made before the running of The Bud at
The Glen last month. Recall that Gordon was coming off his
Brickyard 400 victory over the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor
Speedway, where Martin finished second. Martin had this observation
about Gordon's No. 24 DuPont Refinishes Monte Carlo: ``They're on
top of their game on their engine program. They've got that (SB2)
cylinder head working for them right now, which is what we
expected. They started off the year with some things to learn about
it and looks like they've learned their lessons well.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Roush, a guru of the Ford V-8 engine, said his powerplants have
been durable and have produced good fuel mileage. ``But
historically, we haven't dazzled the field with speed,'' Roush
said. ``The SB2 engine, the cylinder head is better than anything
I've seen. If they haven't found all the power, certainly it's
there for it. I've had a chance to look at all the components and
the airflow and build an (SB2) engine, and there's areas GM has
left for the teams to develop. In Jack's world, that will give it
15 more horsepower over anything that Ford has until we get a new
cylinder head and manifold.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Four consecutive top-five finishes have allowed Dale Jarrett to
remain in third place in the Cup points chase, 238 behind Gordon
and 171 behind runner-up Martin. During that period, Jarrett has
dropped 39 points to Gordon. After 23 races last year, Jarrett also
was in third place behind leader Gordon and runner-up Martin. But
Jarrett was 143 points behind Martin and 168 in back of Gordon.
With nine races remaining, Jarrett is plugging himself into the
``win-win'' mode heading into the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington
(S.C.) Raceway. ``What we have to do is just race to win,'' said
Jarrett, winner of spring races at Darlington in 1997 and 1998.
``Winning the race is the only way that we can ensure ourselves of
gaining points, so things are no different than what they've been
the last two years for us. We've put ourselves in this position of
being behind and playing catch-up, so we just have to go try to
win.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Heilig-Meyers Co. will not renew its sponsorship contract with
team owner W.C. ``Junie'' Donleavy in 1999. Veteran Dick Trickle is
27th in Cup points in the No. 90 Heilig-Meyers Ford Taurus. ...
Kenny Wallace started fourth and finished sixth at New Hampshire
International Speedway on Sunday, his best Winston Cup results in
the No. 81 Square D Ford during an otherwise abysmal season. &QL;

   Retiring three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal believes his
hand-selected replacement, Max Papis, is a victory waiting to
happen. That factor, Rahal said, was significant in why the Italian
landed the ride in the No. 7 Miller Lite Ford/Cosworth beginning in
1999. Papis won out over a list of candidates that included
Americans Jimmy Vasser, a former Championship Auto Racing Teams
champion, and Indy Racing League long shot Greg Ray of Plano.
``Really, the single biggest criteria that we were looking for is
we needed somebody that we felt was capable of winning,
irrespective of nationality or what have you,'' said Rahal, whose
24 CART victories are exactly 24 more than scored by Team Rahal
proteges Papis and holdover Bryan Herta. Papis, 28, has recorded a
best finish of eighth in 34 career CART starts for Arciero-Wells
Racing, where he has been developing the Toyota RV8C engine. It
remains the only American-built and designed engine in the FedEx
Championship Series. ``Any development situation is a tough one. I
know that first-hand,'' said Rahal, 45, who took on a series of
engine and chassis projects throughout his 17-year career. ``I
think one of the things that also struck me about Max is the fact
that amid all the difficulties that development situations entail,
you never heard him once be critical. He was definitely a team
player.'' &QL;

   Shelly Anderson's family-based drag racing team will necessarily
be taking a genteel approach to the 44th annual U.S. Nationals at
Indianapolis Raceway Park this weekend. The National Hot Rod
Association's oldest and most prestigious race is scheduled to be
Anderson's first outing since she suffered burns and injuries in a
crash during the Autolite Nationals at Sears Point Raceway in
Sonoma, Calif., on July 24. Anderson received medical clearance to
drive last week, but is only allowed to walk two hours a day for
the next two weeks. Her burns required two sets of skin grafts to
both ankles, her hand and left arm. Because those areas still are
tender, she has not been able to put on a fire suit and test-drive.
Tomorrow night's opening round of qualifications will be her first
time down the track since the crash. ``Safety has been my dad's and
my crew's No. 1 concern,'' said Anderson, 32, driver of the Parts
America Dragster. ``My dad (Brad) bought Kenny Bernstein's new
McKinney car as a backup, put that together, and put an on-board
fire extinguisher in the driver's compartment. It's not mandatory
in Top Fuel, but it is in Funny Car. Also, they've made a different
type of seat. The fire had melted the carbon fiber seat and it
trapped me in the car so that I couldn't get out. They've actually
put a different seat in between the roll bar and the carbon fiber
seat, so the seat won't be exposed to flames if there is a fire.''
Anderson also plans to wear a new pair of specially made Funny
Car-style boots, to further protect her ankles. &QL; 
FAST LAPS &QL; 
CUP SCHEDULE SHAPES UP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's 1999 Winston Cup schedule will grow to 34 dates today,
when the Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex in Florida will
officially be added to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president of competition, is set to
preside over a news conference scheduled to include reigning Cup
champion Jeff Gordon and former champion Rusty Wallace. The entire
schedule might be announced today, or held for a big splash during
the running of the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative copy of the schedule compiled by Knight Ridder
Tribune has NASCAR retaining all venues from last year, and none of
those tracks has lost or added a date. The new schedule features
five open dates designed to keep the teams fresh. According to
Knight Ridder, the new race in Florida is scheduled for Nov. 14 _ a
week later than the 1998 season ender at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
The 1999 season will end at AMS on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, vice president and general manager of Texas Motor
Speedway, announced in July that the Primestar 500 would run in
Fort Worth on March 28, 1999. Gossage said there was no surprise
that TMS will operate with one Cup date for the third consecutive
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said it publicly we'd only have one Winston Cup date in
1999,'' Gossage said. ``We're not through with surprises though.
We've got something up our sleeve (with regard to 1999). But it's
not a second Winston Cup date.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said that will not prevent him and the management of
Speedway Motorsports Inc. from lobbying NASCAR president Bill
France Jr. for a second date.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as getting a date for 2000, I don't know how to
handicap it,'' Gossage said. ``I don't have a clue. I have been
told by NASCAR that Texas Motor Speedway will have a second date. I
don't know when.''

ANALYSIS: DOUBTS ABOUT FIREWALL TACTIC TO CONTAIN CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside the Treasury Department, some of the
strategists desperately seeking to contain spreading outbreaks of
financial chaos once called their approach the ``firewall
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was straightforward and born of U.S. success in
containing the Mexican peso crisis in 1995. As foreign currencies
plummeted and investors fled _ first from Thailand, then Indonesia,
then Korea and now Russia _ the Treasury and the International
Monetary Fund would stitch together a bailout that insisted on
far-reaching reforms, which would rebuild national economies in
America's image.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that the emergency support from the IMF would buy
some time, and the promise of change _ cleaning up failing banks,
imposing austerity and ending corruption and crony capitalism _
would lure back investors and protect the United States and other
countries from economic contagion.
</P>
<P>
   But now firewall strategy is coming undone. It has collided,
some Clinton administration officials concede, with the inability _
or unwillingess _ of weak or inexperienced foreign governments to
give stock and currency markets what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political price of complying with the markets' demands are
finally hitting home,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which was an investor in Asia and has been
deeply involved in the bailouts of South Korea and Russia. ``And
they simply seem too high.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, firewall strategy has never amounted to more than a
few haphazardly placed bricks. The Parliament has refused to enact
many of the IMF's conditions; the central bank has virtually run
out of dollars to defend the ruble, and the Western aid that was
sent in late July _ $4.8 billion _ has seemed to vanish. .
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich drove the point home Wednesday in
demanding that the Clinton administration explain why Congress
should give $18 billion more to the IMF. ``Where has all this money
gone?'' he asked Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in a letter. ``How
much of this money has left Russia? How much of this money is in
the hands of corrupt officials or their corrupt business
associates?''
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, the firewall was built of straw and was
immediately ignited. Now, with a government barely hanging on,
rioters targeting the Chinese minority, which brought much foreign
investment into the country, and the army reeling, the IMF's
program is at a virtual standstill.
</P>
<P>
   And this week Malaysia became the first country to reject the
IMF's advice _ and Rubin's _ in explicit terms, deciding to turn
its back on the free market and virtually halt currency trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been told that the country's currency cannot be
traded outside the country _ all of it must be returned to Malaysia
by Oct. 1 or it will be declared worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad dismissed
his presumed successor, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has
been an advocate of free-market strategies and a champion of
financial modernization in Asia. Anwar's house has been cordoned
off by police, and there is widespread speculation that he may soon
be arrested for sedition.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Clinton administration official Wednesday called the
turn of events in Malaysia _ a country where firms like Intel,
Motorola and Matsushita have built huge factories _ ``a tragedy.''
Others said it was the inevitable clash between the power of
government and the power of markets, and they predicted that
Mahathir's effort to isolate Malaysia from world financial markets
would be a spectacular failure.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir saw it differently. ``Malaysia is facing terrible
problems because of the Western capitalist system, which has gone
wild,'' he said on Saturday. ``Financial instruments have become as
good as gunboats for colonizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has always ranked among the most vocal critics of what
he views as Western efforts to dominate Asia, and in brighter times
he was a leading advocate of promoting ``Asian values.'' But the
Asian values debate was largely about cultural and legal issues _
the U.S. emphasis on individual rights, for example, versus an
Asian insistence on the importance of stability and the good of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The current argument, while couched in terms of IMF plans and
currency conversions, is an offshoot of that debate. In Russia,
Malaysia and even Japan, the United States is insisting on reforms
that would essentially give power to investors to move their money
across borders at will, instead of to governments seeking to
control their destinies.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, a man trained on the trading room floor, has cast this
choice in stark terms: countries that try to interfere with the
freedom of markets will be cut off by international investors and
starved for lack of international capital. His speeches and
President Clinton's stiffly worded speech in Moscow on Tuesday make
it clear that the United States and the IMF will only aid countries
that adopt reforms along the lines the IMF has prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time Rubin has had to face a series of
political revolts to his plans,'' one White House official observed
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's team insists that the country-by-country approach _
getting the fundamental economics right, forcing the disclosure of
more financial information _ still works. Thailand and Korea, his
aides say, recently managed to lower interest rates, and there is
hope that this will help spur their economies in 1999. In Latin
America, they argue, countries like Brazil have taken preventive
measures, which have helped ward off the kinds of disasters that
struck Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, has said many times in
recent months, ``We can't want reform in any country more than its
government and its people do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is essentially what is beginning to happen now. The
United States is virtually screaming at Japan to end seven years of
economic paralysis, and it will repeat the message Friday night
when Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan meet in San
Francisco with Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister and a
40-year veteran of U.S.-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
   But dragging Japan, the world's second-largest economy, toward
politically painful reforms has been almost as difficult as
dragging Russia and Indonesia in that direction. And, increasingly,
there is a sense inside the Treasury that, in the words of one top
official: ``We don't have much time,'' Japan could touch off
another, far more serious round of financial crises if it fails to
deal with its problems.

TURMOIL HAS TRADERS CONFUSED ABOUT FUTURE OF AT&AMP;T-TCI MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chaotic stock market has pummeled arbitragers this summer as
fears that merger deals would fall apart have sent prices of some
takeover companies tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no deal is causing more confusion among traders, who
make their fortunes betting on takeovers, than the pending AT&AMP;T
Corp. acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. On June 24, AT&AMP;T
agreed to acquire Tele-Communications for 0.7757 share of AT&AMP;T
stock for each TCI share, or a total of $31.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the deal was announced, however, Tele-Communications stock
has fallen 15 percent, to $33.9375, while shares of AT&AMP;T have
fallen 13 percent to close Wednesday at $60. The dramatic decline
of TCI has some arbitragers worried that TCI's mercurial Chairman
John C. Malone may not go through with the deal. It was his
constant tinkering with the terms of the company's 1994 planned
merger with Bell Atlantic that finally ended that deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, a TCI spokeswoman said Wednesday that the merger was
proceeding as planned and was expected to be concluded in the first
half of 1999. And Ray Katz, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, sent out a
note to clients Wednesday saying he believed the deal would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that gave little comfort to one arbitrager Wednesday.
What has made him and others nervous is the recent near collapse of
a planned merger in which Tellabs was set to buy the Ciena Corp. in
a one-for-one swap in June that valued Ciena at $65.88 a share, or
$7.1 billion.The deal nearly came unraveled largely after Ciena
warned that its third-quarter earnings would be less than half the
estimates and that AT&AMP;T would not give it the business that the
company had anticipated. Now the deal has been reduced, so Tellabs
will pay $4.74 billion, or $46.25 a share,
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the last minute, traders were getting comfort from
the companies that the deal was on track, '' said one arbitrager,
who requested anonymity. ``That has really spooked them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbitragers who bought the stock of Ciena at a high price have
been hurt. At the same time they had shorted the stock of Tellabs,
but that stock has not fallen nearly as much, so that the ratios on
which their initial investment was premised have changed
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the deals announced in recent months, the ones that
have been damaged the most by the decline in the stock market are
cash buyouts, said George Kellner, a partner at Kellner DiLeo, a
merger and convertible arbitrage firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spreads all over the place are wider than you can get a
truck through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fear connected to cash deals is more obvious. ``Cash
deals have been hurt more because the stocks decline in tandem in a
falling market,'' Kellner said. As a result the buyout ratios do
not change. ``But in a cash buyout, the cash consideration was set
in more optimistic times. There is a fear that the buyer will see
what is going on and attempt to renegotiate and buy the target
company at a cheaper price,'' DiLeo said.

<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ During these pogo stick days on Wall
Street, Stanley Walker, a retired mechanic with a good chunk of his
life savings in the stock market, has thought once or twice about
his boyhood in the Depression years.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no desire to have pockets so empty, as his own father
did, that Sunday dinner means pig tails and sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it time to pull the rip cord?'' Walker, 77, nervously asked
his broker on Monday, as the market dived 500 points, before making
its strong rebound. ``I like to be able to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   His broker told him to relax. And Walker, who did not sell a
single stock, is trying to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some jitters, there is no panic on Main Street this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are becoming old veterans at this,'' said Doug Reese, a
broker here for Edward Jones. ``They've been through all of this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most of America, the stock market has become everybody's
game in this pleasant Iowa courthouse town. Inside the Muddy Waters
coffee shop, people were echoing all of the financial analyst
cliches _ the economy's strong fundamentals, great buying
opportunities and, of course, the importance of ``staying in for
the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have even become a bit blase about the market's
gyrations. Mark Engle, a 44-year-old high school Russian teacher,
kicked his boots up on a chair and rattled Wednesday morning's
edition of the Des Moines Register.
</P>
<P>
   On the front page, there was a cartoon about Wall Street that
showed a bunch of little chickens screaming about a falling sky,
with a frightened looking bull. But Engle skipped right past the
stories about the market. He turned, instead, to the sports section
to read about Mark McGwire, the home run king who is having a much
better year than the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing,'' said Engle, who lets the managers of his
pension plan worry about stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the market has hit plenty of home runs in recent years for
people in this town of 26,000, about 40 miles northeast of Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   The capital gains allowed Barb Collins to retire from a factory
job at age 57, vacation in France, England and Italy and take a
cruise to the island of Crete. She even has a vacation home in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   To people like Mrs. Collins, now 63, who was pushing her
one-year-old grandson, Ariaus, in a stroller on this sunny day,
complaining about a bumpy stretch of road on an otherwise
magnificent run, would seem a bit greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you do have to keep on top of things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, she checks the Register for the prices of her
stocks and mutual funds, and watches one of the financial
television networks just about every day.
</P>
<P>
   During the steep drop on Monday, however, she was at her
vacation home, taking a respite from the news. Late that afternoon,
she climbed into a boat to fish for walleye with some friends. One
of them asked, with an ominous tone, ``So, what about this stock
market?''
</P>
<P>
   She confessed to some anxious moments, but never considered
selling off her stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It helps calm the nerves to recall scary days in the stock
market's recent past. Best of all, the big jump in stock prices on
Tuesday showed there is still confidence in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on Main Street are not traders, but investors,'' said
Reese, the stock broker, noting that people who hold their cards
usually end up with a strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   DyAnne Henry, 49, who owns an embroidery shop, ``In Stitches,''
said the stock market was a lot like life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have some highs and you have some lows,'' she said,
between bites of pancakes at Monica's coffee shop. ``But if you
have patience and keep the faith, everything mellows out in the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the general buoyancy, however, Reese noted that some
nettlesome developments have given investors some uneasy moments.
Besides the economic crisis in Asia and the political turmoil in
Russia, there is the specter of a weakened President Clinton,
tarnished after acknowledging that he misled the public about his
relationship with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a place like Iowa, which exports plenty of grain and
agriculture-related machinery, among other goods, a crisis halfway
around the globe can come home to roost in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to economics, Iowa is by no means isolated,''
said Engle, the Russian teacher. ``How we do depends a great deal
on how people in other countries are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mueller, a 47-year-old insurance salesman who sported a blue
blazer and a deep tan, expressed few worries about the strength of
the American economy. He had doubt about President Clinton's
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but think he's not the same leader that he was
four or five weeks ago,'' said Mueller, who got up early today to
watch Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on television.
``He doesn't come across as being so confident anymore. Is that
going to hurt our standing around the world?''
</P>
<P>
   In general, people did not seem to think Clinton's problems
would hurt the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Making a connection between the Washington soap opera and the
profits at Fortune 500 companies seemed, at least to someone like
69-year-old Shirley Duffy, ``a bit of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Duffy, who operates tours for Iowans to places like Nova
Scotia, Alaska and New York, said she was not going to take a penny
out of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Wallace Duffy, became alarmed during a
sudden downturn two years ago, and shifted much of their holdings
to fixed-income accounts. That was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned our lesson, so we're going to sit tight,'' said
Mrs. Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Reese and other stock brokers have been talking to customers
about the silver lining in any downturn. For much of the past few
years, he had been trying to damp down expectations of investors,
many of whom expected whopping gains in a matter of weeks. Now with
prices on many stocks down 15 to 20 percent compared to a few
months ago, Reese has been encouraging investors to think about
adding to their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   John Kraft, a 38-year-old painter, said he would like to jump
into the market, but will not, out of respect to his wife's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''She doesn't like the idea,'' he explained, ``that you can end
the day with less money than you had yesterday.'' &QL;

ADDICT TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL LEWIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Kogge, a 23-year-old Colleyville woman who was in
treatment for heroin addiction at a California recovery center, has
relapsed twice since the Star-Telegram wrote about her in April,
her father says.
</P>
<P>
   But she has been clean the past 60 days, working in a French
restaurant and living at Safe Harbor House in Costa Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Kogge, who visited his daughter this month at the recovery
home for women, said he has learned to take her recovery one day at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuous struggle,'' he said. ``To them, relapsing is
like smoking another cigarette; it's no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's the possibility of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Kogge has been battling heroin addiction for more than
five years. She overdosed on the drug in October 1996 and began
injecting it into her veins within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering treatment last year, she was living on the
streets, surviving on Snickers candy bars and the heroin she pumped
through the veins in her bony arms. She had lost 45 of her 120
pounds. Her parents were convinced that she was a heartbeat from
death.
</P>
<P>
   Safe Harbor House is not as structured as the first private
California center that Kogge was in. Daily Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and the other women at the house,
provide support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lock-down structure,'' said William Mangan, the
house's co-owner. ``It's halfway between being in treatment and
being on your own. It gets them acclimated to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his daughter is in recovery, Chuck Kogge does not
believe that the battle is won.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she relapses, it is scary. It makes me feel sick,'' he
said. ``It's very tough to divorce yourself completely.''

 Bay Area's High-Tech Trade Publishers Feeling the Squeeze   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Some of the same factors spooking Silicon Valley _ the Asian flu
and the stock market jitters _ are also slowing the growth of the
advertising manna that feeds the Bay Area's high-tech trade
publishing world.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With more than 2,200 local scribes covering every aspect of
technology, from chip-making to home PCs to the corporate
enterprise, writing about the industry is practically an industry
in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech pubs had gotten use to double-digit growth in ad
pages and revenues, but in the first half of this year the market
has stalled,'' said Sheila Craven, president of Adscope, which
tracks high-tech print ads.
</P>
<P>
   Although advertising pages were flat, rate increases boosted
total ad revenues 9 percent, to $1.3 billion, in the 250 magazines
Adscope tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The page slowdown, though slight, seems to have caused a slight
shift in the balance of advertising power among the trade press'
Big Three: IDG Corp., Ziff-Davis and CMP Media. ``For the first
time, CMP topped Ziff in total ad page count,'' Craven said.
</P>
<P>
   CMP President Michael Leeds said one reason for the shift was
that CMP pubs like Information Week and Computer Reseller News
focus on corporate computing whereas Ziff has more of a consumer
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done better in a tough time to hold advertising,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis president Claude Sheer offered a different
perspective. First off, he noted that CMP's page count includes
advertising it bought when it acquired several McGraw-Hill pubs,
while Ziff ``lost'' pages this year because it spun off two Mac
magazines into a jointly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he said even if it lost ground in the page
battle, Ziff pubs like PC Magazine are still winning the dollar
wars, with $324 million in total revenues versus $267 million for
CMP, according to Adscope.
</P>
<P>
   IDG President Kelly Conlin brushed aside the fact that his firm
is a distant third in U.S. ad pages and revenues. Noting that the
``I'' in IDG stands for International, he said IDG is tops in
high-tech publishing when its overseas revenues get counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike our competitors, who operate primarily in the U.S.,
we're in 75 countries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, despite the ad slowdown in the United States, employment
in the Bay Area tech trades has continued to grow, with IDG
founding new magazines, like the Industry Standard, and Ziff
growing new pubs like its forthcoming joint venture with Excite.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ad drought isn't broken in the second half, the job
picture could change. Earlier this year, for instance, CMP cut 50
jobs at its Long Island headquarters, blaming it on the ad
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Nesting strategy:  &LR; CNet Television is set to leapfrog its
rival, San Francisco's ZDTV, in the battle to become the national
network for computer shows.
</P>
<P>
   CNet TV manager Dan Sexton said starting September 20, CNet will
begin airing two hours of computer TV, every Sunday beginning at 6
a.m., on the USA Network.
</P>
<P>
   Although that early bird slot isn't prime time, being on USA
will give CNet access to 73 million households nationwide,
including millions of Bay Area cable viewers who still can't see
ZDTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to really expand the CNet brand name, and our
talent,'' said Sexton, starting with Richard Hart, co-host of CNet
Central, the company's flagship show.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, CNet Central has aired mainly on the Sci-Fi Channel.
It will keep that slot even after it joins the USA schedule along
with three other CNet shows: ``The Web,'' hosted by Australian star
Sofie Formica, ``The New Edge,'' starring Ryan Seacrest and ``Cool
Tech'' with Daphne Brogdon and Desmond Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sexton downplayed the rivalry with ZDTV, CNet has
clearly shifted its strategy in an attempt to get a national
audience for computer television before its cross-town rival.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when CNet TV started, the company wanted to
create a 24-hour cable network. But Sexton said TV production costs
and the task of getting the shows carried on thousands of separate
cable franchises convinced CNet to take a different tack.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it has become a production house, turning out TV
shows that it sells to established cable networks like Barry
Diller's USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this a nesting strategy,'' he said, adding that CNet's
50-person TV operation now turns a small profit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ZDTV _ which aims to be a network _ is spending money
like mad to create enough shows to fill a schedule while it
persuades more cable operators to give them a channel. So far ZDTV
reaches 8 million households, but its biggest markets are in
Louisville, Nashville and the New England region.

ANALYSIS: RENO SHIFT A CHANGE OF HEART OR BID TO BLUNT GOP?

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Buffeted for 18 months by Republicans in Congress
over her refusal to allow an independent counsel to examine how
Democrats financed President Clinton's re-election, Attorney
General Janet Reno has abruptly reversed herself, opening two
preliminary inquiries in a week that could lead to the appointment
of an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some law-enforcement officials said that within the
next week Reno would decide whether to begin another preliminary
inquiry into whether an independent prosecutor should investigate
how the Democratic National Committee funneled money to state
parties to indirectly help the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the attorney general's approach does appear to be
under way. But what is uncertain is whether she has changed her
mind about the need for an independent counsel or, as some in
Congress suspect, is trying to blunt the fierce attacks by the
lawmakers on her competence and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Reno has ordered two 90-day preliminary investigations,
one focused on Vice President Al Gore, and the other on former
White House aide Harold M. Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden decisions to begin the inquiries suggested that
Reno's resistance could be weakening.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the changes was a report sent to Reno in late
July by Charles La Bella, the former head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance unit. La Bella's report set off a
bitter fight within the Justice Department and reignited Republican
criticism of Reno for, in effect, standing by the Clinton White
House in the face of a recommendation of a career prosecutor
closest to the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Reno tried to dampen the furor in Congress by meeting
with lawmakers who had demanded that she turn over a copy of La
Bella's report along with one given to Reno last fall by FBI
Director Louis Freeh, who also urged Reno to seek the appointment
of an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno allowed the lawmakers to read a version of La Bella's
report on the understanding that they would not discuss it
contents. The version was edited by La Bella to remove references
to evidence presented to a federal grand jury and passages that
discussed the direction in which the inquiry was likely to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella's memorandum, according to people who have read it,
concludes that Reno misinterpreted the law. Like some members of
Congress, he urged her to invoke the statute's discretionary
provision, which allows Reno to apply the independent counsel law
if the subject of the inquiry poses a personal, financial or
political conflict of interest for the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella has argued that an outside counsel with a broad charter
could determine whether top Clinton White House officials illegally
conspired to evade federal election laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reno seemed to heed his advice for the first time in the
campaign finance case Tuesday when she used the discretionary
provision to open the inquiry into statements made by Ickes, who is
not automatically covered by the statute as are top officials like
Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her actions over the past week, including her efforts to
assuage Republican critics by sharing parts of the memorandums
Wednesday, did not seem to temper their demands for her to step
aside and let an independent investigation proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said after the meeting that while the discussion was
positive, Reno had not convinced him that she was moving
aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After reviewing redacted versions of the memos prepared by Mr.
La Bella and Mr. Freeh, it is clear that both gentlemen have
advanced strong, convincing arguments in support of a broad-based
independent counsel,'' said Hatch, who had convened the meeting.
``Importantly, when I asked the attorney general and her top
advisers why those recommendations have, thus far, been rejected,
the answers I received were vague, insufficient or unconvincing.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawmaker refused to accept Reno's terms for the meeting.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the governmental Affairs
Committee, which investigated the campaign finance issue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said, ``There is no valid reason for keeping
confidential the redacted version of the La Bella and Freeh memos,
and no basis for keeping their legal theories and arguments secret
from the public except to reduce the embarrassment of the attorney
general.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno appeared to fail to mollify her main critic in the House,
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the Government Reform and
Oversight Committee, which voted to hold Reno in contempt of
Congress for refusing to turn over La Bella's memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said his reading of the memo ``reinforced my view that
the attorney general appears to be trying the protect the president
and vice president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Reno's advisers said that her decisions in recent days
marked an important shift in her legal thinking that resulted, at
least in part, from a realization that her obstinacy had eroded her
own credibility and damaged the standing of the Justice Department.
They predicted that she will ask for an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But that is still unclear. Republican critics suggest that by
opening the three-month inquiries, she had postponed a final
decision about Ickes and Gore until after the November elections,
and by tightly defining the issues in each case, she could keep an
independent counsel inquiry away from Clinton. &QL;

BOEING WILL USE LONDON AIRSHOW TO FLEX ITS MUSCLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the world's biggest and most important airshows kicks off
Monday outside London, England, with Airbus Industrie strutting in
on the heels of recent headline-grabbing victories over The Boeing
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based aerospace giant, on the other hand, arrives at
the biannual Farnborough International show with its image
tarnished after one of its worst years ever, its reputation on the
line and a new management team taking over the company's core
business of building commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But if an animal is most dangerous when wounded, look out for
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year at the Paris Air Show, where Boeing
deliberately kept a low profile because of European concerns over
its then-impending merger with defense powerhouse McDonnell
Douglas, Boeing will use the Farnborough stage to flex its
considerable military, space and commercial muscles. The world's
largest aerospace company also will showcase many of its products,
from the new 777-300 to its stealthy RAH-66 Comanche scout and
attack helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to Farnborough, Boeing and Airbus
convince customers to hold off announcing new orders until the
show, then both companies try and out duel the other for the
attention of the world's aerospace press, who every two years flock
to Farnborough, the home of British Aerospace some 30 miles outside
of London. It will be no different this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is expected to announce major orders for two of its
planes that are flying for the first time this week.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is the Boeing Business Jet, a corporate version of
the 737. So far, Boeing has 29 firm orders, including one from
professional golfer Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently decided that it needed more room for
production of its next generation 737 in Renton and is moving final
assembly of the business jet from Renton to the former Douglas
plant in Long Beach, Calif. But any new orders for the business jet
will also be good news for workers in Renton, who build the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly of the Boeing Business Jet in Long Beach should get
under way next month, with an initial production rate of 3 planes a
month by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The business jet, which will compete in a market now dominated
by Gulfstream and Bombardier, will make its inaugural flight Friday
from Renton.
</P>
<P>
   The other new Boeing plane that could find customers at
Farnborough is the 717, which made its first flight Wednesday in
advance of the airshow.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-passenger 717, Boeing smallest commercial jet, took off
on its maiden flight from the Long Beach plant where it is built
and later landed at Boeing's flight test center in Yuma, Ariz. The
flight had been delayed from earlier this summer because of
problems with a new engine developed for the 717. After a test
program and certification, the first of 50 planes is scheduled to
be delivered to launch customer AirTran Airlines in the third
quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only AirTran, formerly ValueJet, has placed any
significant order for the 717.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is expected to announce at the airshow that it, too, has
decided to develop its own 100-seat jet to compete with the 717.
The Airbus plane will be a smaller version of its A319.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing several commercial aircraft orders,
Boeing will also hold press briefings throughout the week-long show
on everything from its plans to eventually build a bigger 747 to
its battle with Lockheed Martin to win what could be a $200 billion
Pentagon contract for the next generation Joint Strike Fighter.
</P>
<P>
   But missing from this year's show will be the imposing figure of
Boeing's Ron Woodard, the plain-speaking, 6-foot-5 master airplane
salesman who until Monday headed the company's Commercial Airplane
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most significant management shakeups in Boeing's
history, Chairman Phil Condit sacked Woodard because of continuing
production problems. Woodard was replaced as group president by
Alan Mulally, the former 777 program manager who has been heading
the company's defense and space business.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing has offered Woodard another position within the
commercial group, he has not yet decided he wants to remain with
the company, a Boeing spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other executives in the commercial group were ousted in the
shakeup and several were moved to different jobs as Boeing
struggles to recover from production snarls that resulted in the
company's first annual loss in 50 years in 1997 and a decline of
almost 50 percent in the company's stock price over the past 14
months.
</P>
<P>
   With Woodard out, Boeing has had to play a musical-chairs game
with its executives as it prepares for the important Farnborough
show.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the opening day, Boeing and Airbus take center stage
with back-to-back news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Until Woodard was removed, the plan was to have him give the
presentation on the company's commercial business, with Boeing
President Harry Stonecipher talking about defense and space as a
substitute for Mulally, who is skipping Farnborough because of a
family reunion that has been planned for many months.
</P>
<P>
   The task of talking about Boeing's ailing commercial division
has fallen to Bruce Dennis, the group's vice president of
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The news conferences will take place against the backdrop of a
changing European aerospace industry, in which the Airbus
consortium of four separate companies will soon to be transformed
into a single corporate entity to better compete with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing still dominates commercial aviation, Airbus has
become a much more formidable opponent in the last two years. And
it arrives at Farnborough fresh off a major coup over Boeing. Last
week, British Airways, one of Boeing's most loyal customers,
decided it will buy planes from Airbus for the first time. Some
analysts believe this could be the year Airbus lands as many new
airplane orders as Boeing.

 Home Sweet Home Pages   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Forget push technology. Forget portals. Forget e-commerce.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest things on the Internet _ this week at least _ are
community home pages.
</P>
<P>
   These virtual neighborhoods are a cross between chat rooms,
where strangers message each other online _ and personal home
pages, those Web sites that let people show off themselves, their
pets and their hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual communities let a group of people _ friends, family, a
Little League team, a college alumni association _ set up an
interactive home page.
</P>
<P>
   Members can go to the site to communicate in chat rooms or by
e-mail. They can post schedules or photos and set up a contact list
with everyone's phone number and address.
</P>
<P>
   The creators can restrict access to the site or open it to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Major Internet companies such as Yahoo, America Online and
Excite are providing the free service as a way to draw and retain
visitors. They plan to make money by selling ads on the Web pages
where people create their virtual communities _ but not on the
community pages themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As users become more Net savvy, they increasingly find chat
rooms are too noisy and crowded with strangers,'' said Tim Brady,
executive producer of Yahoo Clubs. ``A personalized Web community
page gives them a noise filter, a place with a fair amount of
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A chat room is like a cocktail party of a thousand people; Web
communities are like an intimate dinner party of a dozen close
friends,'' said Joe Kraus, co-founder of Excite, which is readying
a new service called Excite Communities this fall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Yahoo Clubs is the only virtual neighborhood that's
operating. Excite and AOL plan to launch theirs in the fall,
followed by Netscape Communications, Lycos and Infoseek next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new fad on the block,'' said Tom Taulli, an analyst
with IPO Monitor in Woodland Hills (Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three community home page services:
</P>
<P>
   _Yahoo Clubs ( &LR; clubs.yahoo.com &LR; ), which has been up for only two
weeks and has not been consistently accessible, offers a convenient
way to create a community site with just a few mouse clicks.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can create a new community or join an existing one, if
it's open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers choose one topic from a list of 16 such as computers,
sports, sex and romance and hobbies. Within each of those
categories, there are subcategories that are even more specific _
such as African foods or horror movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gathering place where a group of knowledgeable people
can post information on a topic they know and like,'' said Pete
Challinger, a member of DVD (Digital Video Disk) Developers Club,
one of many communities already created on Yahoo Clubs. ``It's a
nice alternative to searching the Net for DVD bulletin boards and
it's different from a typical home page, where one-way
communication rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found many travel places online where I can have a
meaningful, intellectual conversation about cultural exploration,''
said Suzanne Hornwood, founder of Discovery Travel, another
community page on Yahoo Clubs. The 22-member site recently has
posted discussions on tombs in China, dance in Brazil and
architecture in Jaipur, India.
</P>
<P>

MEXICAN DRUG GANGS THRIVE ON INTRIGUE, BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amado Carrillo Fuentes used his smooth talking to ascend from
laboring in Mexico's opium fields to operating a $23 billion drug
empire, U.S. authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   But when all else failed, Carrillo Fuentes traded his
negotiating skills for an AK-47 assault rifle. His path to being
``patron'' of a vast drug territory, based in the Mexican border
city Ciudad Juarez, is splattered with the blood of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Since Carrillo Fuentes died at age 41 in July 1997, when he had
plastic surgery to disguise his appearance, frenzied violence has
swept the city as drug traffickers battle for control of the
empire, or plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the blood stops flowing, we'll see who's in charge,''
said Travis Kuykendall, director of the High Intensity Drug
Trafficking Area in El Paso and a retired U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent. ``This plaza has been important in the
smuggling underworld for the last 50 years, and that's not going to
change with Carrillo Fuentes' death.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials attribute at least 60 homicides in the six months
after Carrillo Fuentes' death to rivalry for the drug empire, which
stretches at least 200 miles through Chihuahua, Mexico, and into
Presidio, Texas. In mid-August, seven men were found slain, three
of them in a black 1998 Ford Thunderbird. The three had been
tortured and strangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the violence has started up again,'' said a U.S.
government official in Washington, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Who knows when it will ever stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of Mexican drug traffickers learned their
vicious tactics from their Colombian counterparts, who became known
in the 1980s for carving up their adversaries with chain saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, no trafficker would have killed the family
member of a rival,'' Kuykendall said. ``Now they take out five at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrillo Fuentes gained notoriety as ``Lord of the Skies'' with
his use of Cessna airplanes to transport heroin, cocaine and
marijuana into the United States. The key in the struggle for
control of the Ciudad Juarez cartel is who can prove they are the
new patrons capable of carrying out a deal with the Colombian
cartels to deliver their cocaine in exchange for half of each load.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over a cartel, a patron forms alliances with other
organizations to avoid violent sabotage of the drug transportation.
Drug cartels typically are not highly structured organizations like
the Mafia, with several levels of workers answering to one
godfather. Instead, a ``fluid system of geographical alliances and
working unions are the key to success of the major Mexican
traffickers,'' one DEA document states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably 50 people who could move 50 kilos of heroin
on the border,'' Kuykendall said. ``There has to be some level of
internal organization within each group, but as a whole, drug
trafficking is very chaotic and very disorganized, which makes it
so difficult to attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Three major players are vying for control, according to U.S.
officials. They are Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Vicente; Rafael
Munoz-Talavera, known as ``El Orejon,'' or Big Ears; and Juan Jose
Esparragosa-Moreno, known as ``El Azul,'' or the Blue-Eyed One.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Carrillo Fuentes has been seen spending lavishly since
his brother's death and is believed by some U.S. officials to be
living in an extravagant estate across the border from El Paso. He
would be a natural successor because of the importance of familial
ties in drug cartels, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   According to sensitive DEA documents obtained by the
Star-Telegram, Munoz-Talavera is a powerful drug trafficker who in
1989 supervised the funneling of 250 tons of cocaine worth more
than $1 billion from Mexico through El Paso into Sylmar, Calif.,
aligning him with Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Several attempts by the
U.S. government to pressure the Mexican government to prosecute or
extradite Munoz-Talavera after a 1992 indictment in El Paso have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz-Talavera, who is believed to be living in Ciudad Juarez,
published a full-page advertisement last year in a Mexican daily
newspaper, denying allegations of being involved in drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Esparragosa-Moreno, who is believed to have been Amado Carrillo
Fuentes' top lieutenant, has been valued in the drug underworld for
``his ability to bring peace among warring traffickers,'' according
to a DEA document.] ]Mexican media have reported that
Esparragosa-Moreno is the head of the Ciudad Juarez cartel, but
U.S. officials said that is still unclear, judging from the amount
of blood being spilled.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Mexican government indicted Esparragosa-Moreno
on charges of drug trafficking. He is believed to be in hiding in
Mexico.

CLINTON TOOK INTEREST IN RETURNING LEWINSKY TO WHITE HOUSE,
TESTIMONY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for wording change)  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told the grand jury investigating
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he was troubled by her
transfer out of the White House and discussed bringing her back
last summer, according to people familiar with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified on Aug. 17 that he spoke about his worries
over Ms. Lewinsky's situation with Marsha Scott, a senior aide in
the White House personnel office and a friend of his since high
school, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion, in July 1997, is the first indication that
Clinton took an interest in returning Ms. Lewinsky, a former
intern, to the White House from the public affairs job at the
Pentagon, where she was transferred against her wishes in April
1996. Clinton's apparent sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky is starkly at
odds with the views of some White House staff members, who
criticized her as recently as this spring that she had been
shadowing or even stalking the president, which is why they said
they thought she should leave.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not order Ms. Lewinsky's return and did not
ask aides to give her favorable treatment, one adviser
knowledgeable about his testimony said. And despite her own pleas
to White House officials, Ms. Lewinsky did not receive a position
there. Ms. Scott met with Ms. Lewinsky twice last summer to talk
about her career, even though she was not responsible at the time
for administration jobs outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told grand jurors that, as early as spring
1996, at the time she was transferred, Clinton assured her that he
would bring her back to the White House after the presidential
election that November, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies and Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, have seized on Clinton's conversation with Ms. Scott for
opposing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To the president's team, the talk is evidence that Clinton was
concerned, as any man might be, for the well-being of a woman he
had been intimate with. They argue that if he was intent on buying
her silence, he would have surely insisted that his aides rehire
her.
</P>
<P>
   But allies of Starr say that prosecutors view Clinton's stated
interest in Ms. Lewinsky's return to the White House as a possible
abuse of his office, a likely accusation in a report that Starr is
preparing for Congress. They may also cite the conversation as an
attempt by the president to obstruct justice by keeping Ms.
Lewinsky mollified and silent about their relationship, the allies
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the prosecutors, the timing of the conversation is
significant. Weeks before, on May 27, 1997, the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously that Paula Jones' sexual misconduct suit could proceed
against Clinton while he was in office. Days later, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers said that they planned to seek testimony from other women
linked to Clinton. That effort eventually led them to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted an inappropriate physical relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, but he has denied obstructing justice or breaking any
other laws. Ms. Lewinsky also denied an affair under oath during
the Jones lawsuit, but later acknowledged an 18-month sexual
relationship with the president to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton expressed an interest in bringing Ms.
Lewinsky back to the White House, he had ended their affair,
according to his advisers. They said the president broke off their
physical relationship in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Lieberman, a former deputy chief of staff, has said she
removed Ms. Lewinsky from her White House job in April 1996 because
of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet allies of the president said that he felt that Ms. Lewinsky
had been treated unfairly, and that her transfer might be a blot on
her resume. One adviser to Clinton said that the president had a
further worry about Ms. Lewinsky. ``He was concerned about her
talking with people,'' the adviser said, describing that concern as
``a natural feeling'' that anyone involved in an extramarital
relationship might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't order anyone to bring her back,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, the Jones lawyers were not the only people
inquiring into Clinton's relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, according to those familiar with her testimony,
Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton that a Newsweek reporter had
contacted her friend, Linda Tripp, who also worked at the Pentagon.
The reporter was pursuing claims by Kathleen Willey, then a White
House volunteer, that Clinton had made a sexual advance toward her
in the private hallway outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that she pressed Clinton to have his senior
aide and confidant, Bruce Lindsey, call Mrs. Tripp to advise her on
how to respond to the reporter, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
A day later, Lindsey called Mrs. Tripp, according to lawyers
familiar with the testimony of both women.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had that
conversation with Clinton before or after he expressed an interest
in bringing her back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott has testified on at least two occasions to the grand
jury inquiring into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She
described meeting twice last summer with Ms. Lewinsky, who implored
her for a White House job, according to lawyers familiar with her
testimony. Ms. Scott testified that she met with Ms. Lewinsky at
the request of Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   During their second meeting, Ms. Scott testified, Ms. Lewinsky
indicated that she was angry about her transfer across the Potomac
to the Pentagon, and attributed it to what she called untrue rumors
that she was involved with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott said that she advised Ms. Lewinsky that, because of
her detractors in the White House, it would not be a good career
move for her to return there, according to people familiar with her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott did not recall discussing Ms. Lewinsky with the
president, according to her lawyer, Stuart Pierson. ``She could
very well have talked to the president about her conversations with
Monica, but she had no specific recollection of that,'' Pierson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's interest in efforts by Clinton to bring Ms. Lewinsky
back to the White House had not been not previously revealed. Some
White House aides, worried about the potential impact of Starr's
report, believe that they should disclose potentially sensitive
information to present their gloss on the facts before the
prosecutors do.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also been examining efforts by Clinton's friends and
administration officials to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New
York. The president acknowledged under oath that he had asked aides
last winter if they could provide Ms. Lewinsky with a favorable job
recommendation for her White House work, according to people
familiar with his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly complained to Clinton in early 1997
about her transfer out of the White House, according to people
familiar with the testimony of both. She was said to have been
worried that prospective employers might interpret her transfer to
the Pentagon as a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a girl who is very concerned about what people think,''
one associate said. ``And she did not want it to be seen that she
was run out of the White House. I know she wanted to come back, and
she did not like being over at the Pentagon.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Unless you happen to be Ricky Williams of the University of Texas,
being a top running back in the Big 12 this season is sort of like
being a power hitter in a year when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
make home-run history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may be one of the best around, but nobody seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has graced the cover of almost every newspaper and
magazine in the nation that covers college football. He is a clear
favorite to win the 1998 Heisman Trophy, playing at a big school in
a major conference that brings him plenty of media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma running back De'Mond Parker said he doesn't mind if
Williams gets the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the hype,'' Parker said. ``I like being myself.
I'm friendly with people I know, but I'm no big talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky can have all that stuff. That's all political. The only
reason why I would want to win (the Heisman) is it would mean we
had a great year. The best player on one of the best teams in the
country usually wins it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams may win despite being on a team that isn't expected to
be one of the best, but he is not the only player in the Big 12 who
can carry the football and make things happen. Talented running
backs are the staple of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Parker and Darren Davis of Iowa State were 1,000-yard rushers
last season, even though each missed three games with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M and Oklahoma State each had a tailback duo that
combined for more than 1,500 yards rushing. Dante Hall and Sirr
Parker totaled 1,773 yards on the ground for the Aggies, and Nathan
Simmons split time with Jamaal Fobbs to gain 1,557 yards for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Having a tailback duo works for those schools, but it doesn't
help an individual put up the kind of numbers that make people
notice.
</P>
<P>
   A few running backs in the Big 12 last year earned some notice
as freshmen by proving they could run hard and gain big yards,
including Fobbs, Darrell Bush of Baylor and Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That is, Ricky Williams of Texas Tech. Having the same name as
UT's star has enabled the Tech sophomore to gain a little more
attention than some of the other backs.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is more than just a name. He rushed for 894 yards
last season, breaking the Tech freshman record set by former Doak
Walker Award winner Byron Hanspard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is an outstanding young running back,'' Tech coach Spike
Dykes said. ``He continues to amaze me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor fans, and coach Dave Roberts, were amazed at what
Bush did when he got a chance to play. The Jersey Village product
became the first freshman in school history to rush for at least
100 yards in three games, along with surpassing the freshman
rushing record of Walter Abercrombie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darrell doesn't always look like the best guy in practice,''
Roberts said. ``But he would come over to me and say, `Just put me
in, coach, and I'll show you what I can do.' When you break the
records he did last year, that says something.''
</P>
<P>
   Staying in school for his senior season says something about
UT's Williams. But De'Mond Parker made a similar decision, and he
would be the Big 12 back getting most of the attention this season
had Williams left for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-10, 190-pound junior from Tulsa is the first OU back since
former Heisman winner Billy Sims (1978-79) to rush for 1,000 yards
in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Parker considered leaving for the NFL after last season, but an
injury, a change in the offense and the urging of his mother
convinced Parker to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I needed another year to get stronger and show I
could be durable,'' Parker said. ``I think that injury may end up
being the best thing for me in the long run. If I had stayed
healthy, I probably would have turned pro and I might not have been
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker suffered a tear to a lower abdominal muscle that limited
him in the second half of last season. His 1,143 yards rushing look
even more impressive when you consider he gained only 17 yards on
13 carries in OU's last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to see my baby hurt,'' Parker's mother, Carol, told
the Tulsa World. ``But it kept him from going pro; I was glad. I
want him to stay in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker will have a new offense to display his skills this year
because OU has returned to the wishbone and the option attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the option went away,'' OU coach John Blake
said. ``I think that has been part of our problem. We shouldn't
have gotten away from it, and it won't happen again. I believe in
it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake also believes in Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know De'Mond is the feature back for us,'' Blake said. ``He
is a very special player. We need him to touch the ball 25 to 30
times a game. That's our main focus. I think this offense will be
easier on him because the defenses will have to key on the fullback
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``De'Mond has worked really hard in the weight room. He wants to
put his body in a situation where it can take the punishment. He's
ready to carry the load for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker has seven touchdown runs of 30 yards or more in his two
seasons at OU. He also has played his best games in head-to-head
matchups with Williams and the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   He outgained Williams 107-99 in 1996 and had a career-best 291
yards last year against Texas when Williams rushed for 223 yards.
But Texas won the game 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always dreamed my best game would be with us winning,''
Parker said. ``Maybe that will happen this year. I had a talk with
(running-backs coach) Joe (Dickinson), and he told me I was going
to get the ball more.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Heisman, Parker said he would be happier to take home
the award for the best running back in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather win the Doak Walker Award,'' Parker said. ``That's
more about what you did on the field. But mainly, I just want to
win and go to a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for the talented backs at A&AMP;M and Oklahoma
State, who share time without complaining in hopes of winning the
Big 12 South Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about those guys,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum
said of his running backs. ``They aren't very big, but they are
very talented and they're better receivers than we've had in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who also returns punts and kickoffs, just missed a
1,000-yard season last year when he rushed for 973 yards. But the
most impressive stat for the Nimitz High product was his 7.3 yards
per carry.
</P>
<P>
   There's no break for the defense when Sirr Parker takes the
field. His 4.2 speed is the best in school history, but it didn't
help him much against Florida State on Monday. He had eight carries
for 22 yards, and Hall had seven carries for 13 yards behind an
offensive line that has three new starters.
</P>
<P>
   OSU has a couple of all-conference candidates on the line in
center Jeremy Offutt and guard Adam Davis, which should keep things
rolling for the tandem of Simmons and Fobbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both kids will play an important role for us this season,''
said OSU coach Bob Simmons, Nathan's dad. ``When we need an inside
guy who is physical and makes cuts, Nathan is that kind of runner.
He's got the kind of legs and type of style to get you the tough
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaal is a guy who can be a sensational back. I just have to
get him to grow up and mature. Right now, he is playing on athletic
ability alone. What he has to get better at is his work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people in college athletics have a better work ethic than
Simmons, who graduated with honors last May and is working on his
master's in psychology. He completed 44 credit hours as a freshman,
more than any student-athlete in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``God blessed me with two parents who had me focus on
academics,'' Simmons said. ``It was hard at times to take so many
hours so quickly, but I pushed through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has that same attitude about playing in a conference
where most of the acclaim seems to go to one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't feel like the rest of us are overlooked,'' Simmons
said. ``It doesn't matter anyway. We know our talent, and we're
going to keep running as hard as we can.''

SAME OLD STYLE FOR NEW DEVILS' COACH? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The playing surface at National Hockey League rinks will have
different dimensions this season in an attempt to increase the
goal-scoring and attacking excitement that have dwindled in recent
years. The Devils will have a new head coach who is replacing the
defensive-oriented one who helped stifle opposing attacks by
perfecting the neutral-zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has taken over for Jacques Lemaire, does Robbie
Ftorek expect more scoring chances because the goal lines have been
moved out two feet from the end boards, from 11 feet to 13 feet?
Not necessarily. Ftorek noted Wednesday that the space added behind
the goal lines will be taken away from the neutral zones, between
the blue lines. This, he said, might increase the effectiveness of
the 1-2-2 forechecking system that the Devils use to set up their
neutral-zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1-2-2 is designed to turn over the puck in the neutral
zone,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the smaller neutral zone, Ftorek said: ``I would think it
would enhance the ability of the 1-2-2 to work better.''
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean Ftorek will stick with Lemaire's 1-2-2 system
that some people found both effective and boring? ``That's
obviously one of the ways we'll play,'' Ftorek said during a
luncheon with reporters near the team's practice facility in West
Orange, N.J. Although training camp doesn't officially begin for
veterans until Sept. 13, many are working out informally. Among
several issues raised Wednesday, Ftorek said that he was
unconcerned about his four unsigned players who are restricted free
agents of the Group 2 category. Two are centers: Petr Sykora and
Denis Pederson, and the team needs to replace center Doug Gilmour,
who left for Chicago as an unrestricted free agent. The other two
are defensemen: Scott Niedermayer and Sheldon Souray. Only Souray
is thought to be near contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned,'' Ftorek said. ``You like to see everyone
here. My job is to coach the players we have.'' One of the players
sure to report is a free agent named Sam Ftorek, the coach's son. A
23-year-old right wing, he played the last four seasons in college
at St. Anselm in the ECAC. The coach said he will let other members
of the staff evaluate him. But will other players rough him up to
test his grit in training-camp scrimmages, the way they would with
most free-agent rookies?
</P>
<P>
   BOWMAN CONTEMPLATES FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 18, as teams begin their exhibition schedules, Detroit
Red Wings Coach Scotty Bowman will celebrate his 65th birthday. The
oldest coach in the league and the most successful, Bowman could
return this season in an attempt to lead his Wings to their third
consecutive Stanley Cup championship and the ninth over all of his
long and remarkable career. Since the Islanders won four from 1980
through 1983, no team has won more than two in succession. Should
Bowman win again, he will break a tie with Toe Blake. Both have
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But will Bowman be back? Probably not for training camp or the
start of the regular season. Shortly after the Wings won last June,
Bowman's younger brother, Jack Bowman, a Buffalo Sabres scout, died
of complications during heart surgery. Following a physical
examination, Scotty Bowman underwent an angioplasty to correct a
partly blocked artery near his heart. He also had surgery to
replace his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotty is rehabilitating; it's coming along, it's a slow
process,'' said Ken Holland, the Detroit general manager. ``We'll
take it week by week. There is every indication he is coming back.
But he has not said to me outright: `I'm coming back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said Bowman has lost weight and is determined to make
life-style changes to keep the pounds off while lowering blood
pressure and cholesterol. Holland said Bowman will find time to
work out after practice and will eat fruit instead of pizza on the
team airplane after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going into this with determination _ full bore ahead,''
Holland said. Bowman's assistants, Dave Lewis and Barry Smith, will
run the team until Bowman's return
</P>
<P>
   NEW STYLE FOR KARIYA
</P>
<P>
   After missing the second half of last season with a concussion,
Anaheim's Paul Kariya has said this summer that he plans to play a
rougher style to protect himself from heavy hits. This could
involve raising his stick to discourage opponents from charging
toward him. Kariya, a small superstar generously listed as 5 feet
11 inches, 175 pounds, twice won the Lady Byng trophy for
sportsmanship. If he needs a bodyguard, the Ducks have acquired Stu
Grimson in a trade with Carolina. Known as the Grim Reaper, Grimson
_ 6-5 and 227 pounds _ is one of hockey's largest and most
accomplished fistfighters. &QL;

A `HURT' SEN. MURRAY WANTS FURTHER EXPLANATION FROM CLINTON ON
AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Patty Murray, under fire from Washington state
Republicans for her restrained reaction to President Clinton's
sexual relationship with a White House intern, said Wednesday she
is angry and hurt by the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that she does not believe the president has acknowledged
how deeply painful his behavior has been for his supporters, Murray
called on Clinton to make another public statement explaining
himself. And Murray said she does not know whether she would want
the president to campaign for her anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow Wednesday, Clinton insisted he had acknowledged ``a
mistake'' and had asked ``to be forgiven'' in his much-criticized
explanation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the matter at a news conference with Boris Yeltsin,
Clinton said he had gone back and reread his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was clear that I was expressing my profound
regret to all who were hurt and to all who were involved and my
desire not to see any more people hurt by this process and caught
up in it,'' he said. ``I have acknowledged that I made a mistake,
said that I regretted it, asked to be forgiven, spent a lot of very
valuable time with my family in the last couple of weeks and said I
was going back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments clearly were not enough for Murray, who had read a
transcript of them before speaking with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks, at a briefing for reporters in her office, were her
most extensive since Clinton acknowledged a relationship that was
``not appropriate'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt I am very hurt and angered and really
dismayed by what he has done, and it is up to him now, clearly, to
show us that we can trust him,'' said Murray, who has been a strong
Clinton supporter. ``Does he fully understand the pain and anger
that has been caused by this, and the distrust that is out there?
I'm waiting for him to make a statement to let us know where he is
on that, and I will judge him when he makes that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is under fire from one of her leading re-election
challengers, Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., for her restraint in her
comments about Clinton's behavior. Previously, Murray has said she
was ``disappointed'' by the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech Aug. 22 to thousands of Republicans at the King
County GOP picnic, Smith offered her own history of Murray's
reaction over time to the accusations against Clinton, saying:
``First there was Paula Jones, and Patty said nothing. Then there
was Kathleen Willey, and Patty said nothing. Now our president has
admitted that he used the power of his office and took advantage of
a 21-year-old intern, and Patty is saying virtually nothing. Is
this the same Patty Murray who ran in 1992 saying that abuse of
power and sexual harassment were the reasons she was running?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith accused Murray of applying a different standard to Clinton
than she applied to two other public figures accused of sexual
misconduct _ former Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas _ because Clinton has helped Murray raise
campaign cash. Mocking Murray's moniker as a ``mom in tennis
shoes,'' Smith said that Murray's relative silence about Clinton
suggested that ``she seems to have traded in her tennis shoes for a
pair of Hush Puppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Wednesday rejected any charge of inconsistency, saying
that she has always simply demanded that a legal process be
followed in which accusations of sexual misconduct can be aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely consistent with everything I have done in the
past,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's behavior clearly has the potential to become an
issue in Murray's re-election campaign. John Carlson, a Republican
commentator in Washington, mocked Murray at the GOP picnic, saying
``Don't you think Patty Murray should demand the same
accountability from Bill Clinton that she demanded from Bob
Packwood? ... A little consistency never hurt anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although national GOP leaders have been somewhat circumspect in
their comments about Clinton, Washington state GOP Chairman Dale
Foreman has called for Clinton's impeachment, saying `his behavior
is so despicable, it is so immoral, he is beneath contempt.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how male politicians have treated their female
subordinates has played a major role in Murray's political career.
She was elected in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman, motivated
in part by anger over how the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee
had handled Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against
Supreme Court nominee Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   That year Murray had been one of few Washington state Democrats
willing to run against Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who was accused
by eight women of abuses ranging from sexual harassment to rape.
Once elected, Murray was one of the leading critics of Packwood
when he was accused of groping numerous female employees. Murray
accused Packwood of ``manipulating'' the Senate, and she demanded
public hearings about the sexual allegations against the Republican
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's comments about Clinton generally have been restrained,
and even Wednesday, she did not go as far as House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who called Clinton's behavior
``reprehensible,'' or Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, who within
minutes of the president's admission said ``my trust in his
credibility has been badly shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the topic, Murray has always favored
unusually mild language for an elected official _ she doesn't try
to compete with the sharp tongue of Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., for
example _ and her comments Wednesday were clearly as far as she is
willing to go at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said some of her supporters want the Clinton sex scandal
simply to go away. In a statement just after Clinton's admission of
wrongdoing, Murray called for an end to the media frenzy over
Clinton's sexual behavior. But Wednesday she indicated she is no
longer seeking to turn attention from this topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to wait for the independent counsel's
report, and when that comes, Congress will have the ability to act
on that,'' she said. ``We need to see what the independent
counsel's report is before we make a determination about what needs
to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton said Wednesday that he has no intention of
elaborating, Murray called on the president to make a further
public statement expressing regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needs to show us clearly that he understands the
full impact of what his actions have done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, asked whether she would allow Clinton to campaign for her,
as he has in the past, Murray said ``I haven't made that decision.
I think that he has said he's focusing on repairing his family, and
obviously he's dealing with international issues that are extremely
important, and when he gets through that and we see what comes,
I'll make that decision.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON vs. Furman, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve quarterback Woody Dantzler, who will play in two or
three series behind Brandon Streeter on Saturday, has been showing
some flashes akin to the departed Nealon Greene. Dantzler, a
redshirt freshman and former Mr. Football in South Carolina, has
been dubbed ``Mr. Excitement'' by teammates for his work in recent
scrimmages. He's had two runs of 40 yards or more, and has
demonstrated a stronger throwing arm than Greene. ... Wide receiver
Brian Wofford returned to practice this week after missing the last
two weeks with a sprained foot. He's currently listed behind Mal
Lawyer. ... Reserve outside linebacker O.J. Childress has been
moved to a starting spot on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. W. Carolina, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder if the Blue Devils ever are going to get better,
this could be the year. ``This is the best preseason session we've
had since I've been here,'' said coach Fred Goldsmith. ``This is
the best team we've had since 1994.'' The '94 team was the one that
began the season 7-0, finished 8-3 and went to a bowl game. Since
then, Duke's fortunes have nose-dived and the Blue Devils have
compiled a 5-29 mark. Still, senior guard Lennie Freidman sees the
light at the end of the tunnel. ``We were involved in a lot of
close games last year,'' he said. ``Virginia and Clemson are two
very good teams that we had beaten and let it get away. We didn't
graduate that many people _ most people are back from last year.
The thing is, we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot and make
mistakes and mental errors.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE at N.C. State, Sept. 12
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden said the most significant thing to come out
of FSU's 23-14 win over Texas A&AMP;M Monday night, other than winning,
was the way his team responded to being down at the half. ``Here
wewere favored, but when we went in at halftime, they (Texas A&AMP;M)
got the lead and the momentum,'' said Bowden. ``They were all fired
up and jumping up and down, but our kids didn't lose our poise. We
took the ball in for a score and then scored again. We had talked
to them about adversity before the game. A lot of people say that's
negative, but to heck with that. They need to know about adversity
and about things not going right.'' Bowden said he was pleased,
overall, with the play of 26-year-old QB Chris Weinke, who was
starting his first college game. MARYLAND vs. James Madison,
Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With a recent foot injury to starting tailback LaMont Jordan,
one of the rare bright lights for the Terrapins, Maryland has been
taking a close look at 5-foot-7 junior Harold Wheatley, who coaches
say is the fastest player coming out of the backfield. Jordan, who
had 689 yards as a true freshman, is still listed as the starter.
... With Trey Evans out with knee surgery, the Terps have an even
slimmer list of quarterback candidates to back up little-used
starter Ken Mastrole. The only other QBs listed on the depth chart
are redshirt freshmen Gil Harris and Erik Lipton. ... Former head
coach Mark Duffner, who filed a lawsuit this week seeking
compensation for TV and consulting services as part of his Maryland
contract, probably is entitled to less than $100,000 should he win.
NORTH CAROLINA vs. Miami-Ohio, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Domonique Williams, slated to start at tailback for North
Carolina before a preseason injury sidelined him, was declared
academically ineligible by the Tar Heels Wednesday. ... Junior
cornerback Dre Bly's assessment of the Carolina defensive unit is
bad news for the rest of the ACC. ``We feel we're just as good as
we were last year,'' he said. ``I know you think I'm crazy because
we had three first-rounders (in the NFL draft), but we're good. Our
front four can put the pressure on them.'' Bly also admitted he's
asked coach Carl Torbush about adding to his responsibilities. ``I
want to play receiver,'' the 5-foot-10, 190-pound All-ACC performer
said. ``I'm bored at cornerback. There's nobody throwing that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE vs. Ohio University, today, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio University has a chance to slay another ACC team tonight
when it meets the Wolfpack in Raleigh. Last year, the Bobcats upset
Maryland in the season opener 21-14, sending the Terps on a 2-9
slide. But former Valdosta High QB Kareem Wilson might not be in
the lineup for Ohio after getting pushed in preseason practice by
more mobile rivals. ... The loss of Tremayne Stephens overshadowed
the departure of his chief blocker, valuable fullback Carlos King,
and it's a position that State has had trouble filling in the
preseason. While Rahshon Spikes has nailed down Stephens' slot at
tailback, King will be succeeded by senior Jeff Butler or junior
Kevin Hubbard. Between them, they have rushed for fewer than 100
yards.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA at Auburn, today, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Crawford, perhaps the top tight end in the ACC, says the
fact that his Cavaliers open tonight against Auburn on national
television has helped Virginia prepare for the Tigers. ``We're a
lot further along this year than we were last year,'' said the
6-foot-6, 250-pounder. ``The fact we're starting off with Auburn on
TV has helped keep our team focused this year. Our practices have
been very intense.'' ... Defensive tackle Antonio Dingle has never
had a problem staying intense. The 6-foot-3, 302-pound pre-season
All-ACC player had a ring put in his tongue over the summer. The
out-spoken native of Fayetteville, N.C., also has let his hair grow
long and has a pair of red contact lenses that he wears on certain
occasions. WAKE FOREST at Air Force, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons' starting quarterback, Brian Kuklick, says he
started playing sports because of shyness. ``My parents pushed me
into sports at an early age because I was so quiet and shy,'' he
said. ``I started off playing Little League baseball and soccer and
moved into other sports.'' The plan obviously worked because the
Hatboro, Pa. native is as articulate as any player in the league.
``It's still hard for me (to talk),'' he said, ``but I'm getting
better.'' Kuklick also knows his value. ``I've been told by some of
the pro football people that I'm anywhere from a late first-rounder
to an early third-rounder (in the NFL draft),'' he said. So does he
consider himself the best quarterback in the ACC? ``Not the best,
but one of the best,'' he said, ``one of the best in the country.''

 &HT;    Virginia seeks payback for '97 loss to Auburn
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ The way Auburn coach Terry Bowden figures it, two
very angry entities are coming to Jordan-Hare Stadium tonight when
Auburn opens the 1998 college football season. They are named
Virginia and Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia arrives for tonight's nationally televised game _ 8
p.m., ESPN _ as a team on a mission. The Cavaliers were 7-4 a year
ago, missing out on a bowl for the first time since 1992.
Virginia's players strongly believe they would not have been passed
over had they not lost to Auburn 28-17 in the 1997 season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get down there, because I know that losing to
Auburn kept us out of a bowl,'' said Anthony Poindexter, Virginia's
All-America strong safety. ``This team and this program want to be
taken seriously. We want to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden certainly takes this Virginia team seriously. The
Cavaliers return 15 starters, including nine from a Top 25 defense
a year ago. His father, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, already
had made the telephone call to say, ``Look out for these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has had our attention since last spring,'' said
Terry Bowden, who begins his sixth season at Auburn. ``We know that
we're going to have to be hitting on all cylinders if we're going
to win. One thing's for sure. We'll know a lot more about our
football team after this.''
</P>
<P>
   The angry Earl comes in the form of a tropical storm that is
supposed to dump rain into Auburn as it moves through the South
today. Bowden was clinging to one report that said the rain would
clear out before the 8 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it hurts is the home-field advantage that you get,''
Bowden said. ``The game is already on Thursday, so not everybody
can get here. If the travel conditions are bad, that only makes it
more difficult, and so people will just stay at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the weather, it will be a sweaty palms night for
sophomore Ben Leard, who makes his first start as Auburn's
quarterback. The Hartwell, Ga., native threw only two passes last
season as Dameyune Craig's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ben's nervousness will be over after the first snap,''
Bowden said. ``We just have to work him through the first series
and he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn will try to run the ball with sophomore Demontray Carter
and senior Rusty Williams to try to take the pressure off Leard.

 &HT;    Carter teammate starts at FAMU
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Quincy Carter was locked in a quarterback battle in the
final days before Georgia's season opener, his backup on Southwest
DeKalb's 1995 state championship team earned the starting job at
Florida A&AMP;M several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Michael Morand will start for FAMU at home Saturday
against Hampton University in an important early season contest
involving historically black colleges. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound
Morand beat out Division I transfers Jose Laureano of North
Carolina State and Patrick Bonner of Temple to earn the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rattlers' spring game, Morand passed for 447 yards and
three touchdowns. Quarterbacks are common in the Morand family:
Mitchell Morand, Michael's father, and Elroy Morand, his uncle,
were starting quarterbacks at Alabama A&AMP;M and FAMU, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Giant showdown
</P>
<P>
   The Hampton-Florida A&AMP;M showdown matches the No. 1 and No. 3
teams in the Sheridan Broadcasting Network preseason poll. Many
have wondered why the two MEAC giants are meeting at the top of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wasn't my idea to play this game so early in the
season,'' said Hampton coach Joe Taylor, whose team won the 1997
MEAC title and was crowned SBN national champion after posting a
10-2 record. ``Originally, we were to play this game the first
weekend in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some MEAC teams had scheduled games for Aug. 29, which
did not meet the approval of the NCAA, the league's composite
schedule had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching debuts
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dickerson, who was fired at Temple last year after compiling
a record of 8-47 in five years, will coach his first game at the
I-AA level Saturday when his Alabama State team faces Troy State in
Troy, Ala. Dickerson, 52, wants to put his Temple experience in the
past, as he prepares for his first season in the SWAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't dwell on the facts of the good, the bad and the ugly
that occurred at Temple University,'' Dickerson said. ``I have to
put all my energies into Alabama State.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama A&AMP;M will be led by a former Division I-A coach when it
takes on Jacksonville State in Huntsville Saturday at 8 p.m. Ron
Cooper, fired at Louisville after the Cardinals posted a 1-10
record in his third year, looks toward better days at the
first-year SWAC school in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward to a great year,'' said Cooper, 37. ``We
aren't going to make any promises, but we're just going to put a
team out there that's going to play hard for 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   A lot of eyes will turn toward Grambling University at 8 p.m.
Saturday, when Doug Williams becomes only the second head coach in
57 years on the Tigers' sideline. Williams, a former Super Bowl
MVP, replaces legendary coach Eddie Robinson. ...Howard quarterback
Ted White, a 6-4, 220-pound passing machine, expected to be among
the top three or four draftable candidates from historically black
colleges, will get a chance to display his prowess on Fox Sports
South at noon Saturday against Jackson State in D.C. The past two
seasons, White has passed for a total of 5,455 yards and 54
touchdowns. . . . In addition to Sunday's 7 p.m. showdown between
Clark Atlanta and Morris Brown at Herndon Stadium, another Labor
Classic will unfold that day, Tuskegee-Benedict at 8 p.m. at Legion
Field in Birmingham . . . Virginia State, picked to win its third
CIAA title in the last four years, faces Norfolk State for the time
since Norfolk moved from the CIAA to the MEAC. The game will be
played in Norfolk at 6:30 p.m. Saturday.

<P>
   ALABAMA vs. BYU, Saturday, 7 p.m., ESPN
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Fernando Bryant said there is ``no way'' he will miss
Saturday's opener with BYU despite a sprained knee suffered last
week. Bryant, who is also slated to play wide receiver, sprained
his knee while returning a kickoff. Bryant's injury is the third to
a defensive back as Antoine Hunter sprained an ankle and Kecalf
Bailey had to leave practice with severe cramps. ... Sophomore
linebacker Travis Carroll is still considered questionable for BYU
after getting hit with a helmet underneath his left shoulder pad on
Aug. 20. Senior Tito Smith would start in his place. ... Ryan
Flugner, a 5-10 junior, has won the placekicking job over sophomore
A.J. Diaz. Diaz will still be used on kickoffs.

   The return of running back Madre Hill should make Razorbacks
fans happy. Hill, who has missed the last two seasons recovering
from a knee injury, will get a majority of the load at tailback
right from the start. ``The doctors have said he's ready to go, so
we're going to turn him loose,'' first-year head coach Houston Nutt
said.... Although Nutt and most of his staff are new, only three
new starters are projected to break into the lineup: defensive end
Carlos Hall, cornerbacks Orlando Green and Ontraia Moss and
flankers Michael Williams, Michael Snowden or Emanuel Smith.
...Arkansas men's athletics director Frank Broyles unveiled plans
this week for a $50 million expansion of Razorback Stadium. The
project would add roughly 17,000 seats and luxury boxes to push
capacity close to 70,000.

   Karl Levine will start at center and Cordele's Meiko Collier
will be the backup quarterback for tonight's game with Virginia.
Levine, a 6-3, 279-pound senior from Fort Walton Beach, Fla., moved
into the spot when junior T.J. Dunnigan quit the team in August.
Collier, a 6-2, 231-pound freshman, sat out last season as a
redshirt. ... Auburn has won 20 straight regular-season
non-conference games dating to 1991. ... This will be the first
time Auburn has opened at home against a ranked opponent. Virginia
is No. 16. ... Markeith Cooper, a 5-7, 165-pound running back, has
been moved to wide receiver and will start tonight.

   FLORIDA vs. The Citadel, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Doug Johnson finally started throwing without pain
this week but will still not play in Saturday's opener. Sophomore
Jesse Palmer was named the starter over a week ago. ``In a week or
two I'll be at full strength,'' said Johnson. ... Coach Steve
Spurrier said Palmer would play well into the second half
``regardless of what the score is.'' Walk-on Larry Richart will be
the first quarterback off the bench, followed by redshirt freshman
Tim Olmstead. ... Spurrier said as many as seven true freshmen will
see action on Saturday, which would match the most the Gators have
used since 1990. ... Offensive tackle Cooper Carlisle (shoulder)
and tailback Earnest Graham (shoulder) are questionable for the
game.

   KENTUCKY at Louisville, Saturday,

<P>
   3 p.m., Fox SS
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats' youth on defense has allowed nine true freshmen to
make the two-deep roster, with defensive end Dennis Johnson and
defensive back Anthony Wajda expected to crack the starting unit,
coach Hal Mumme said. Seven starters on defense will be starting
their first collegiate games. ... Returning starting safety Willie
Gary, one of the leaders on defense, is listed as questionable with
a sprained ankle....Saturday's game will be the first for the
Wildcats in Louisville since 1915, and will be the first of several
in the next few years. Earlier this week, Kentucky renewed its
series with the Cardinals for another six years to the year 2005.
The two schools hadn't played each other in 70 years until resuming
the rivalry in 1994.

   LSU vs. Arkansas State, Sept. 12
</P>
<P>
   LSU's backfield may be taking another hit. A month ago, All-SEC
candidate Cecil Collins was kicked off the team after a brush with
the law. Now it appears that Rondell Mealey will miss next
Saturday's opening game with Arkansas State. Mealey, the backup to
All-SEC tailback Kevin Faulk, has not been able to get over a foot
injury suffered last spring. He has gotten virtually no work in
preseason drills. Coach Gerry DiNardo indicated this week that he
was not sure when Mealey would return. ``My experience is that if a
guy's not progressing, he's not progressing,'' he said. With Mealey
out, more of the work load will be on Faulk, senior Kendall
Cleveland and redshirt freshman LaVar Johnson. ... Craig Nall has
been named No. 2 quarterback behind starter Herb Tyler.

   The opener against Memphis will mark the first game in expanded
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. All 50,577 seats _ including about 8,000
new ones _ will be available for the game. Coach Tommy Tuberville
is ``disappointed with ticket sales,'' adding that more than 7,000
tickets were still available. And that figure assumes that Memphis
sells its entire allotment and all Ole Miss student tickets are
claimed for the Labor Day holiday weekend game. Ole Miss and
Memphis _ located about 75 miles apart _ are renewing a series that
took a two-year hiatus after being contested all but four years
between 1949-95.

   Coach Jackie Sherrill said this week that he will play the four
players arrested on battery charges last week. Starting center
Craig Moore, starting split end Kevin Cooper, backup split end
Lahitia Grant and backup right cornerback Kenzaki Jones were
released by university authorities, but Sherrill said he will not
determine their future playing status until he looks into the
matter personally....Matt Wyatt's job as the No. 1 quarterback is
secure, but Sherrill plans to take a look at backups Rod Morgan and
Wayne Madkin against Vandy. Wyatt, with 2,199 passing yards, needs
224 more to move into ninth place in school history....About a
dozen Bulldog freshmen also are expected to get some playing time
in the opener.

<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA vs. Ball State, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve safety Maurice Henderson has been suspended for
Saturday's game after violating an unspecified team rule. ... Coach
Brad Scott said Wednesday that quarterback Anthony Wright is 100
percent after suffering a severe knee injury in the ninth game of
the 1997 season. ``When the surgery first took place there was a
question if he could ever return to football,'' said Scott. ``He's
far exceeded everyone's expectations with his comeback. The way
he's throwing and running, you wouldn't believe he was hurt so
bad.''... South Carolina has won three straight home openers. ...
This is the first time an SEC team has played Ball State.

<P>
   noon, ESPN
</P>
<P>
   Besides new quarterback Tee Martin, the Volunteer with the most
to prove on Saturday will be sophomore punter David Leaverton.
Leaverton, a high school star from Texas, won the punting job at
the beginning of last season. But in the second game against UCLA,
Leaverton gave up a safety when he missed a snap while trying to
call time out. Then he shanked the free kick. His next two punts
went 17 and 25 yards. UT overcame all that to win 30-24 but
Leaverton went to the sidelines for the rest of the season. He
thought about quitting the team but was talked out of it by his
parents. ``He has just got a lot of ability. But until he gets in a
game and actually does it, we won't know for sure,'' said head
coach Phillip Fulmer.

   Former running back Jimmy Williams isn't the only skilled
offensive player moved to the other side of the ball. Vandy has
converted Jamail Carter, last year's backup quarterback, to strong
safety, where he will play behind Ainsley Battles but is expected
to get considerable playing time. Williams, who is replacing
All-SEC cornerback Corey Chavous, has made the adjustment well,
according to coach Woody Widenhofer....The leader of the secondary,
cornerback Fred Vinson, has been rated the best cover corner man in
the nation by The Sporting News. ... Junior Hi Lewis is still
listed as the starter at quarterback, a position in which Vandy has
no players with college experience.

 &HT;    Bulldogs to start freshman Carter at QB
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Quincy Carter learned about 2 p.m. Wednesday that he
will be the Bulldogs' starting quarterback in Saturday's opener
against Kent. The freshman was nearly sworn to secrecy, but Carter
couldn't have told the woman he wanted to tell first anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Montgomery Carter, his 82-year-old maternal grandmother,
died in Chicago Aug. 20 after a lengthy illness. After tearful
discussions with his mother, Sherry Carter-Embree of Decatur,
Carter decided not to attend her funeral to remain in Athens for
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like it was what my grandmother wanted me to do,''
Carter said. ``She always wanted me to achieve in life. She was the
most important person to me, except for my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carter-Embree buried her mother Aug. 26, her son competed
in Georgia' final full-contact scrimmage in Sanford Stadium. His
performance that night would go a long way in earning him the
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He visited her on her sick bed just before practice started,''
Carter-Embree said. ``I didn't hear all of the words, but she told
him that's what she wanted him to do. She prayed for him everyday.
She wanted him to make it and she gave him words of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She supported his decision to go back to school and play
football all the way. She would have wanted him to stay there and
fight for his position. Those were my last words to him before I
left for Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan's announcement that Carter would start
over three other contenders is just the latest chapter in the
storybook career of the Southwest DeKalb High product. After less
than a month on campus, Carter, a Parade All-American in 1995, has
been handed the reigns of the 19th-ranked Bulldogs, despite a
two-year layoff from football.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a 6-foot-3, 225-pounder, will be the first true freshman
to start at quarterback in a season-opener for Georgia in more than
50 years. The last was John Rauch, who started 45 straight games
for the Bulldogs from1945 to1948 and finished his career as the
NCAA's career passing leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider (Carter) a true freshman because of all that
he has done athletically,'' Donnan said. ``Any time a guy comes in
as a true freshman and is able to do that, it's a real compliment.
But he's a mature young man; he's almost 21 years old now. He's
been around and knows how to handle himself. He's the guy we picked
and it's obvious why we picked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter held off Jon England, last year's backup behind Mike
Bobo, for the starting job. England, a 6-foot-1, 205-pound junior
from Norcross, left spring drills as the No. 1 contender. That was
before the arrival of Carter, who signed with Georgia Tech in
February 1996, but later opted for a minor-league baseball contract
with the Chicago Cubs. He was later released from his letter of
intent with the Yellow Jackets, but wasn't allowed to practice at
Georgia until August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out every day and did the best I could,'' England said.
``I just keep doing the same thing, I guess. I just went out in
this camp and did the best I could. Coach Donnan has his thoughts
on who should be the quarterback and I guess that's what's best for
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan said sophomore Mike Usry of Tallahassee was much-improved
in preseason camp and was ``involved a lot more in this decision
than everybody gave him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   The player who could be most affected by the decision, though,
is true freshman Nate Hybl of Colbert, who graduated early from
Jeff Davis High in Hazelhurst to enroll at Georgia this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl was perhaps Georgia's most impressive quarterback during
spring drills, but he was hampered by an ailing back for nearly the
last two weeks of preseason camp. If Carter is successful, the
highly regarded Hybl, who turned down scholarship offers from
Florida, Georgia Tech and Vanderbilt, now faces the possiblity of
being a backup at Georgia for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's written in stone yet,'' Hybl said. ``I'm still very
young in this whole deal. It's all new to me. I thought I was still
in there until this week. ... I knew there was a possibility
(Carter) was coming. I did take it into consideration, but it
wasn't a big factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard (to be a backup). That's not what I'm looking
to do, obviously. I don't feel left out at all. No one wants to
walk in someone else's shadow, but who couldn't use a redshirt
year? It's kind of murky, as far as my immediate future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Georgia's players said they were surprised by
Wednesday's announcement. Donnan met with the candidates
individually, then Carter worked with the first-team offense
throughout Wednesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Donnan) really didn't tell anyone,'' senior tight end
Jermaine Wiggins said. ``(Carter) was just out there with the first
team, so we all kind of got the feeling that he was the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great athlete and I think he's going to be a great
player. He brings the threat of the run and can throw on the run,
which is hard for quarterbacks to do. I'm just going to wait and
see what he does Saturday.''

 &HT;    Rams begin with grim '98 outlook
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past three years, prognosticators have examined the
young talent on the St. Louis Rams roster, rated several of the
kids among the NFL's top young performers and concluded that the
team will get over the hump. Invariably, the Rams finish much
closer to the sump pump than the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of being so wrong so often, and tired of waiting for the
Rams' youngsters to play up to their potential, no one is making
the same mistake this season. A Rams club that remains one of the
league's top teases figures to torture its fans once again.
</P>
<P>
   Even the eternally optimistic Dick Vermeil, who could hie back
to the broadcast booth if this season is anything like 1997,
appears resigned to another poor campaign. The Rams haven't had a
nonlosing season or made the playoffs since 1989. The club's most
recent NFC West championship came in '85. All those streaks will
likely continue in '98.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated with troubled tailback Lawrence Phillips last
year, Vermeil is the Father Flanagan of coaches, always seeing the
positive side of players. After the coach's gut-wrenching
experience with Phillips, he now knows that incorrigibles exist.
``For whatever reason, a lot of the young players there never seem
to realize just what kind of commitment is necessary to play at the
NFL level,'' recently retired Rams center Bern Brostek said. ``The
talent isn't a problem, (because) from that standpoint they're not
far off. But as a team, they have to grow and realize talent isn't
always enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Enigmatic quarterback Tony Banks, entering his third year as the
starter, symbolizes the problems with St. Louis' nucleus of young
veterans. Banks, 25, has the stature and arm strength all NFL teams
covet, and in 30 starts has flashed playmaking skill at times. But
for every 50-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaac Bruce, he
makes twice as many physical errors and untold mental miscues.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after a brilliant practice session, Vermeil, who
for the first time since 1982 will call the offensive plays, told
friends that he thought Banks might have turned a corner. But a day
later, the staff again had lost patience with the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Banks said, ``I'm making progress. Maybe not everyone
sees it, but I know what I feel in terms of my growth. I've come a
pretty long way in a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks got a bad break when Phillips went bust on the Rams last
fall. Without a running game, Banks and receivers Bruce, Ricky
Proehl and Eddie Kennison feel far more pressure to carry the
offense. But even the enhanced preseason play of former first-round
tackles Orlando Pace and Wayne Gandy might not help a ground game
that was No. 24 in 1997 and still has unheralded Jerald Moore at
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The return of cornerback Ryan McNeil, who signed a one-year
contract on Monday after a camp-long dispute, should solidify the
secondary. McNeil led the NFL in interceptions in 1997 and with
Todd Lyght gives the Rams a respectable tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``(There's) no question we're immediately better now that Ryan
is in here,'' free safety Keith Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
   But questions persist over St. Louis' toothless pass rush.
First-round defensive end Grant Wistrom, who has trouble getting
off blocks, looks to be just a situational player for now. For the
league's oldest coaching staff, it could be another season that
adds to the gray they've already accumulated.

FEDERAL AGENTS RAID CHILD-PORN SUSPECTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Texas) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Customs Service agents raided the homes of
suspected child pornographers in 32 U.S. cities in a crackdown
Wednesday on an international ring accused of trafficking in
computer images of children being raped and abused.
</P>
<P>
   The raids included Texas houses in the Conroe area, north of
Houston, Dallas and Allen, north of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   They were coordinated with law enforcement officials in 21 other
states and 13 other countries. Investigators said they tracked the
cyberspace images to about 200 suspects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the targets ... have in common _ both here and abroad _
is membership in a perverse network,'' Customs Service Commissioner
Raymond Kelly said at a Washington news conference. ``They trade in
the most vile child pornography imaginable over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine anything more repulsive than the sexual
exploitation of children,'' Kelly said, describing the images
swapped by traffickers as ranging from ``sexual abuse to the actual
rape of children.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County, north of Houston, customs agents executing
search and seizure warrants seized a pair of computers and hundreds
of diskettes from an undisclosed residence, customs spokesman Judy
Turner of confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made at the Montgomery County home, nor at a
residence raided in Allen near Dallas, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County raid netted two computer systems and 400
diskettes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Guy Williams acknowledged that deputies assisted federal
agents in the raid, but he referred questions to Turner.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the address and the name of the Montgomery County
resident whose home was raided cannot be disclosed because the
warrant remains under seal by a federal court order.
</P>
<P>
   The raids followed a two-year investigation that began after
officials in San Jose, Calif., found a group known as the Orchid
Club forcing children as young as 10 to perform sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   The performances were being broadcast live over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation led to England, where investigators with the
British National Crime Squad found a second, larger organization
called ``Wonderland Club,'' which had a database of more than
100,000 pornographic images of children.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that group was then linked to others in the United
States, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most extensive ring of child pornographers ever
uncovered,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to England, Australia and the United States, raids
were conducted in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Texas locations, customs agents and local law
enforcement agencies in the United States served search warrants on
suspected child-porn traffickers in Broken Arrow, Okla.; Grand
Haven, Mich.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Halifax, Pa.; National City,
Calif.; St. Charles, Mo.; Lawrence, Kan.; Greenville, N.C.; Salt
Lake City; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chapel Hill, N.C.; Miami; St. Paul,
Minn.; Kennebunk, Maine; Salem, Mass.; Fort Collins, Colo.;
Chesapeake, Va.; Braintree, Mass.; West Orange, N.J.; Skowhegan,
Maine.; Alpharetta, Ga.; Glen Carbon, Ill.; Augusta, Ga.;
Blacksburg, Va.; New Britain, Conn.; Santa Ana, Calif.;
Knightstown, Ind.; Columbus, Miss.; and Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, customs investigators worked with the
British National Crime Squad _ an operation code-named
``Cathedral'' _ to follow porn traffickers across state and
national borders through computer chat rooms and Internet clubs.
</P>
<P>
   To join, members were required to share multiple images of
children engaged in sexual acts, and some members had collected as
many as 10,000 images, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The content would turn the stomach of any right-minded person.
It's really disgusting,'' said Detective Superintendent John
Stewardson, who led the operation in London.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were tracked ``through cyberspace as they hid
behind a maze of Internet providers, servers, files and screen
names,'' Kelly said. ``The people who exploit children in this way
think they can hide in cyberspace, but the are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers were seized at most of the homes, and more
than two dozen people were arrested overseas, mostly in England,
Germany and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Four were arrested in the United States. Another 100 remain
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service spokesman Bill Anthony said successfully
conducting the raids was complicated by the computer network
linking the suspects, which would allow individuals to alert each
other once agents arrived at the first location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am unaware of another police operation that has ever pulled
together so many law enforcement agencies worldwide to effect
simultaneous raids and arrests,'' said Bob Packham, deputy director
general of the British National Crime Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities involved in the raids confiscated ``boxes of
pornography, various software materials and hardware that were part
and parcel'' of the ring during the raids, said Special Agent Dick
Weart.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that, once information from the computers is
accessed by agency investigators, more people likely will be linked
to the porn traffickers and will be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law prohibits making or owning images of children under 18
involved in sexually explicit behavior. Anyone convicted of
possession or distributing banned material faces up to 10 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation and Wednesday raids were conducted as Congress
wrestles with proposals to tighten restrictions for transmitting
pornography on the Internet, legislation prompted by a 1997 Supreme
Court decision striking down restrictions in the Communications
Decency Act.

SMALL INVESTORS AVOIDING PANIC BUTTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Small investors may have been battered and
bruised by the market this week, but many are determined to hold on
to their stock investments without making any major adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   They remain calm while institutional investors largely have been
driving market volatility in the face of economic turmoil in Russia
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jump in and jump out,'' said Norman Puls, a
62-year-old, semiretired engineer in suburban Woodland Hills. ``You
can't time the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Puls' comments came amid a mixed performance by the stock market
Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 125
points before a late sell-off left it down 45.06 on the day at
7,782.37. The Dow failed to build on Tuesday's 288-point rebound
from the previous day's 512-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
   After four decades of investing, Puls knows it's almost
impossible to pick the tops and bottoms of markets and time buys
and sells accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   While he has sold and bought a few stocks in the past month, his
investment portfolio overall has remained relatively unchanged. He
believes the market will bounce up for a little while, then test
new lows before surging upward again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of (mutual fund) money out there,'' Puls
said, ``and that has to go somewhere. It cannot lie in the bank, it
cannot lie in bonds because the yields are low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund managers are measured by their performance. If they put
it in cash, they have no performance. They have to get back into
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he can't time the movement back into stocks, Puls believes
it's better not to leave the equity market in the first place. ``I
don't want to be the last one in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Alexander, director of business development at Trim
Tabs.Com, a Santa Rosa, Calif., firm that tracks stock market
liquidity, said few individual investors are cashing out stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cash inflows into stock mutual funds are estimated to be flat
for August, he said, after declining by $19.3 billion in July. That
means ``individual investors have not panicked. They have held on
to what they bought and neither liquidated them nor added to
them,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true with retirement accounts such as 401(k)
plans, where redemptions have been low, said a spokesman at
American Century Investments, a mutual fund company in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Tobias, an accountant from suburban Van Nuys, is not
touching his retirement account. However, he plans to whittle down
his exposure to stocks in his taxable accounts by selling a little
at a time as his stocks recover.
</P>
<P>
   But a decision to sell by individual investors like Tobias is
not the main driver of stock market volatility. It's institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said institutional investors -- mutual funds, pension
funds, banks and insurance companies -- that are exposed to
volatile emerging markets such as Russia's and Asia's are the ones
doing most of the selling.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they have to raise money to meet margin calls by
lenders who gave them money to buy emerging market government debt,
such as Russian bonds, Alexander said. When a lender makes a margin
call, the institutional investor has to put up more money to cover
the loan.
</P>
<P>
   How do they raise money quickly? Alexander said they sell their
most valuable holdings -- U.S. stocks. As the market drops, other
managers may sell more stock to hold on to gains they have made
this year and look good to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managers look at the portfolio differently than individual
investors,'' said Ken Janke, chief executive officer of the
National Association of Investors Corp., an association of
investment clubs in Madison Heights, Mich. ``They are very
concerned about short-term swings (in the market) because they have
to report to their shareholders'' -- people who invest in their
funds.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't faze Rebekah Fleischaker of Van Nuys. The mechanic
not only is not selling, she has been shopping for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unrealized loss if you don't sell,'' Fleischaker said.
``In the course of 10 years, you're going to get your money back.
This is the time to buy.''

NAFTA COMMERCE BOOSTS DRUG TRADE, REPORT STATES
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARISA TAYLOR and SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mexican drug traffickers are exploiting the North American Free
Trade Agreement, the pact that has reduced trade barriers among the
United States, Mexico and Canada, warns a confidential report by
federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Since NAFTA was adopted in 1994, drug traffickers have invested
in improving Mexico's roads, railways, airports and points of
entry, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful Mexican drug organizations are also buying some of the
country's largest trucking and railroad companies and have
interests in a large Colombian shipping company, according to the
report, Drug Trafficking, Commercial Trade and NAFTA on the
Southwest Border. It was conducted by Operation Alliance, an El
Paso agency that helps coordinate federal, state and local efforts
against drug smuggling along the Southwestern U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial trade increases have brought about significant
expansion of opportunity for drug trafficking organizations. This,
in large part, is because of the excellent `cover' commercial trade
activity provides,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   With eight rail lines, 43 airports, 24 ports of entry, three
nearby seaports, multiple highway links and remote, unguarded
areas, the Southwest border is ideal for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Only 25 percent of commercial trucks crossing the border are
officially checked for narcotics, which requires that 20 percent of
the cargo be unloaded and examined, and that the walls of the truck
be inspected, along with its fuel tank, underbelly, tires and cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's physically impossible to check every vehicle, and that's
why NAFTA has been a blessing for drug traffickers,'' said Phil
Jordan, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration's Dallas
division for a decade until retiring in 1995. ``Instead of
traffickers having loads intercepted once every 100 times, now it's
one in a thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say that NAFTA, which by 2008 will remove most
restrictions on border trade, has had no proven effect on illegal
drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting NAFTA and the drug trade is ``totally unrealistic,''
said Vick Hines, legislative aide for state Sen. Carlos F. Truan,
D-Corpus Christi, who is chairman of the Texas Senate committee on
international relations, trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no evidence whatsoever that the rate of trade is
related in any degree whatsoever to the amount of drugs passing the
border,'' Hines said. ``I would just love for someone to show me
that, because no one has done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorough inspection of rail cars, containers and semi-trailers
on flat rail cars coming from Mexico has been impossible because
there are few inspection sites and personnel. Inspectors cannot
check inside tank cars because they can carry hazardous or
corrosive materials, according to the Operation Alliance report.
But railroad inspectors allow up to a 5,000-pound discrepancy in
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Railroad plans to open a $1.5 million inspection
building in September at the border in Laredo, with areas for the
U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said
Mark Davis, spokesman for the Omaha, Neb.-based railway. Union
Pacific is the American train line with the most traffic from
Mexico, and Laredo is its busiest crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The building will have space for inspections of up to 16 rail
cars and eight trailers at a time. The Customs Service, the
Agriculture Department, the Border Patrol and Union Pacific
Railroad police personnel will have offices, and there will be six
dog kennels for federal and Union Pacific canine units.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps twofold,'' Davis said. ``It helps the federal
agencies have a place to secure the cars they want to inspect, and
it gives them one location. Prior to this, they would do the
inspection in the rail yard, and that would slow things down.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the U.S. Defense Department, Operation Alliance is
arranging loans of high-tech military gadgetry and troops to assist
with drug interdiction efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any given day, some agency along the border is going to be
working with the military,'' said Mike Connell, chief Border Patrol
agent and coordinator of Operation Alliance in El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the Operation Alliance report, saying
that it is an internal document.
</P>
<P>
   The most common vehicle provided by the military is the
Blackhawk helicopter. Blackhawks have a long flight capacity,
sophisticated navigation systems, platforms to mount night-vision
devices, infrared scopes and powerful ground lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need them all the time,'' Connell said. ``And we
don't have that kind of money _ thousands of dollars an hour _ to
get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell said he gets about 1,200 requests a year from agencies
but is able to get military support for less than half. One reason
is cost.
</P>
<P>
   Another is government bureaucracy. If a drug trafficker wants
high-tech equipment, he drives to a store and buys it, Connell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to buy them, I have to go through a long process as
a government employee to justify it and go through bids,'' he said.
``By the time I've got it, we're six to eight months down the
road.''

ALLEN DRURY, 80, NOVELIST WHO WROTE `ADVISE AND CONSENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (bl) 
 By DINITIA SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allen Drury, the quintessential Washington novelist and author
of ``Advise and Consent,'' died Wednesday at St. Mary's Medical
Center in San Francisco. He was 80 and lived in Tiburon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a cardiac arrest, said his nephew Kenneth Killiany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advise and Consent,'' for which Drury won a Pulitzer Prize in
1960, is about a nominee for secretary of state who during his
confirmation hearing is found to have had communist sympathies. It
is a big, sprawling work of betrayal and intrigue, packed with
details and insider knowledge of Congress; the novel includes the
blackmailing of a senator with a homosexual past who as a
consequence commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Drury, a former reporter in the Washington Bureau of The New
York Times, was a prolific author of 19 novels and 5 books of
nonfiction. As a novelist, he was in the tradition of Galsworthy,
Dickens and Thackeray, and not incidentally, of Henry Adams. Drury
was fond of complicated plots and larger-than-life characters, and
wrote trilogies and series of books about the same characters.
</P>
<P>
   But judgments of the literary merit of his work were often based
on the political sympathies of the reviewer. ``Rarely has a
political tale been told with such vivid realism,'' Richard L.
Neuberger wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1959 when
``Advise and Consent'' was published. The book, said Neuberger, was
``one of the finest and most gripping political novels of our
era.''
</P>
<P>
   But other critics saw Drury's work differently. Pamela Hansford
Johnson wrote in The New Statesman that the book was ``politically
repellent and artistically null with a steady hysterical
undertone.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury was born in Houston, the son of Alden Monteith Drury, a
real estate broker and insurance agent, and Flora Allen, a
legislative representative for the California Parent-Teacher
Association from whom he learned a love of politics. He grew up in
California, and graduated from Stanford University in 1939. His
experiences at Stanford formed the core of his intellectual and
emotional life, and provided the basis for his novels ``Toward What
Bright Glory'' and ``Into What Far Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, he went on to work for The Tulare California Bee, where
he won a Sigma Delta Chi citation for editorial writing. During
World War II, Drury was a Senate reporter for United Press
International in Washington. ``They were big men in the Senate
then,'' Drury once said in an interview. ``And they didn't have the
phalanx of aides then they have now. They wrote their own speeches,
staked out their own positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times hired Drury as a reporter in 1954. During the
early morning hours before going to Capitol Hill, Drury wrote
``Advise and Consent,'' bringing to bear the knowledge he had
gleaned as a reporter on the Hill. As soon as it was published, the
book became a best seller, and Drury quit the newspaper to become a
political correspondent for the Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote six sequels to ``Advise and Consent,'' including
``Preserve and Protect,'' and ``A Shade of Difference,'' following
a group of Washington characters through a series of political
crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned with moral ambiguity,'' said his nephew,
Killiany. ``He always called his characters `fallible people in
difficult situations who were called on to solve great problems.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Advise and Consent'' became a Broadway play, and was made into
a movie in 1962 with Charles Laughton as a senator from the Deep
South, and Walter Pidgeon as the Senate majority leader. Henry
Fonda played the nominee for secretary of state, who eventually
fails to achieve the office. Franchot Tone was the dying president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He unapologetically insisted on the gravity of the stakes in
the Cold War, and he did so without joining any particular
faction,'' said Killiany. While his uncle, he said, ``appreciated
the good feelings of many at the end of the Cold War, he watched
the recent course of world affairs and changes in Washington with
growing concern and found little comfort in them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Drury's writing was not just confined to Washington
politics. He also wrote novels and nonfiction books ancient about
Egypt, a country whose political struggles, he said, resembled
those of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1964, Drury lived in Tiburon. His passions were reading
and travel, said his nephew. He was an intensely private man, who
never married, and lived quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his nephew Kenneth, of Washington, Drury is
survived by a sister, Anne Drury Killiany of Hampstead, N.C.;
another nephew, Kevin Killiany of Wilmington, N.C., and three
grandnieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   Drury's most recent published book was ``A Thing of State,'' in
1995, a novel about a Mideast crisis and how the State Department
responds to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Drury completed his 20th novel, ``Public Men,''
which is scheduled for publication by Scribner's in November. The
novel completes his trilogy about Stanford and young men caught up
in the events of World War II.

RECOVERING HEROIN ADDICT STILL STRUGGLES TO BREAK DRUG'S BOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Emily, 19, was a heroin addict for more than a
year until entering a rehabilitation program. She says she has been
clean since March, attends a 12-step recovery program daily and
attends cosmetology school. Emily is keeping a diary for the
Star-Telegram of her thoughts about addiction and her continuing
struggle to break free of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   EMILY'S NOTES: I was in a meeting at the 12-step program I
attend when the using thought came upon me. I was just sitting
there playing the whole scenario in my mind _ of getting it out,
laying it on the table, opening up the cap and getting that one big
whiff, that first smell. It just made me gag. I was like ``Whoa,''
because it was so real. I'll make myself go through the act of
snorting, trying to taste it, even though I didn't like it. I can't
control it. If I'm sitting there and I'm bored, that's what I get
in deep thought about, about using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Then I think, ``Can I afford to start all over again?'' I'm not
sure if I went back it would be a one-nighter. I love it, but the
results I don't like.
</P>
<P>
   I heard story after story of people I knew getting caught.
Everybody either got caught or ran into the cops about it. It's
like, either throw up and you're shaking and you're having
withdrawals, or you're thinking of the chances of getting caught by
a cop. I didn't care. I didn't think it would happen to me. When I
would have withdrawals and I would go get it, just having it in my
hand would make me feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Using thoughts often occur when I am mad or something is not
going the way I want it. It's kind of a passing thought. It comes
down to dealing with life on its own terms. I thought I would have
to deal with using thoughts occurring only when stuff isn't going
my way and when bad things are happening to me. But there have been
plenty of days when everything is going great, and I still want to
use heroin.
</P>
<P>
   I have used many drugs, but heroin has not detached itself from
me. I still think how good that high feels. I forget all my
problems, and I am in my own world. How much better can life get?
Well, there is the problem: It's all a lie. Life on heroin sucks,
and it just gets worse. I have to tell myself that over and over
until the thought passes, or I talk to someone or I keep myself
occupied.
</P>
<P>
   I know I can't use and have everything be OK. My life will fall
apart, because there is no such thing as one time for me. I look at
it this way: There is no problem or excuse big enough for me to
use.
</P>
<P>
   I often think about if I were to go back out and use, how much
would it take for me to get a good high? The thought that follows
is: What if I don't make it? What if I die? I may not get another
chance to try life again. It scares me that it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   There is truly another way of living that is better. Not
everything goes my way. Not everybody does what I think they should
do. That's the beauty of it. Walking through life like that, clean,
and being OK with that.
</P>
<P>
   I had a choice in my addiction to live in misery and become
nothing. And the other choice, I had no idea existed. That is what
kills me inside today, to think I actually thought there was no way
out; I would be a junkie for the rest of my life. There's a way to
get clean, and there are people who care that are just like me. I
don't have to do it alone. If there weren't, I could be dead or in
jail.

GAME, MATCH, OPEN AND OUT FOR KORDA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be no more cartoonish scissors kicks, no
reprisal of last year's epic U.S. Open dethroning of top-ranked
Pete Sampras, no encores to the Grand Slam breakthrough he made
last winter when he won the Australian Open at the ripe old age of
29.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda kissed all those scenarios goodbye Wednesday when he
became the first major casualty at Flushing Meadows when Germany's
Bernd Karbacher, a 155th-ranked qualifier whose own career was
threatened by myocarditis last year, recovered from a slow start
and went on to trample Korda, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very tired at the moment, mentally, everything; I was not
pumped at all today,'' said the fourth-seeded Korda, who was
out-aced, 15-2, produced 57 unforced errors and felt everything go
downhill from the second set on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit it and I miss it, I was trying to come in
and he made good pass,'' Korda added. ``Whatever I did today, I did
wrong,'' Korda admitted he was also suffering from homesickness
that stemmed from his having to leave home just five days after the
birth of a second daughter on July 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really depend on my family, and I haven't had a chance to
see them since the baby was born,'' said Korda, who married Regina
Rajchrtova, a former WTA Tour player, in 1992 and has credited her
with helping him rebound from a series of surgeries and rekindle
his love for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The playing conditions were amenable enough at Arthur Ashe
Stadium, and the opponent was one he had crushed in both prior
meetings, but Korda simply forgot how to play his game. Once that
happened, he was summarily ousted by the somewhat stunned
Karbacher, a 30-year-old journeyman who could not even remember the
last time he made life miserable for a member of the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Michael Chang, who encountered little resistance from
the qualifier he faced, 271st-ranked Eyal Erlich of Israel, could
have warned Korda about Karbacher's potential for creating chaos in
Grand Slam situations: Karbacher knocked him out of the second
round at the French Open, the only Slam where Chang has bragging
rights to a championship, in 1993. But Chang had other hurdles to
overcome: At 26, he has not only been Slam-less since capturing
that Roland Garros title in 1989, he came into this Slam, the one
where he was seeded second last year and became the odds-on
favorite to win the title after Korda's ambush of Sampras, unseeded
for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Chang is nothing if not dogged, and after handling Eyal 6-1,
6-3, 6-1 in just 88 minutes, he donned a T-shirt with a ``Jesus
Loves You'' message and announced that, on the basis of this
first-round victory and the hardcourts title he won in Boston on
Sunday, he believes himself capable of tackling this title along
with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My injuries and stuff are headed in the right direction,''
said the 22nd-ranked Chang, who has battled foot, wrist, stomach
and knee trouble this season. ``I'm still left in the draw, so why
not have the attitude that I can come out and play great tennis and
maybe even win this tournament,'' said Chang, who confirmed that
his energized attitude toward the game does not include his
volunteering for Davis Cup singles duty in the semifinals against
Italy later this month in Milwaukee. ``It is not in my best
interest to play at this time. My major concern is getting back to
where I'd like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Chang would like to be is back in the top 10 and
contending for titles like this one, but his immediate path is
complicated by his unseeded status, a predicament that advanced him
into a difficult second-round encounter against the reigning French
Open champion, 10th-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain. Moya escaped from
a potentially lengthy first-round duel with Mariano Puerta of
Argentina on Wednesday after the 58th-ranked teen-ager was felled
by hip flexor cramps with Moya ahead, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7),
4-4.

<P>
   Like Korda, the second-seeded Marcelo Rios has had ample
opportunities in 1998 to wrestle the No. 1 ranking away from Pete
Sampras, and unlike Korda, he has succeeded twice. But Rios has not
been quite the same since Moya sent him packing this spring at
Roland Garros, the Slam in which the Chilean had hopes to validate
his No. 1 ranking by capturing a major title.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Rios got revenge for a straight-sets loss to Daniel
Vacek in Cincinnati by demolishing the Czech, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing really bad, not having a lot of fun,'' Rios
said, ``but I come to this tournament with a lot of energy, trying
to do good, get the No. 1 ranking again and win a Slam _ the last
Slam of the year.''

ROBERT A.M. STERN TO BE YALE'S ARCHITECTURE DEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIE IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert A.M. Stern, who has designed notable buildings for
Berlin, New York's Battery Park City and Walt Disney Co., is
expected to be named Wednesday as the new dean of the Yale School
of Architecture. He will replace Fred Koetter, who has been dean
for the past five and a half years and who will return to private
practice while remaining a part-time adjunct professor.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, the founding principal of Robert A.M. Stern &AMP; Associates
in Manhattan, is known as a traditionalist architect. He is also an
author, a teacher, a preservationist and a member of the Disney
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's best-known buildings include the Walt Disney World
Castingslot Center in Lake Buena Vista, Fla; a master plan,
prepared with Jaquelin Robertson, for Celebration, the new town
founded by Walt Disney Co. in Orlando, Fla.; apartment houses in
Berlin; a dining hall for the University of Virginia and numerous
residences throughout the country, including one in Colorado for
Disney chairman Michael Eisner. His first residential apartment
building in New York will be completed in Battery Park City by the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Scully, the architectural historian and mentor of Stern
since his student days, commented in anticipation of the
appointment that ``Of all the many distinguished graduates of the
Yale School of Architecture, Robert Stern best understands its
history and values its special traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Stern both fits the school's reputation as a
school that has been led by active practitioners and unsettles its
long history of pushing the envelope of modern architecture. Past
deans have included Charles Moore, Cesar Pelli and Paul Rudolph,
whose iconoclastic modern design for Yale's Art and Architecture
building was came as a shock to the students of the 1960s. Stern,
along with artist Richard Serra, was a member of the first class to
study in the new building, where architects and artists worked side
by side, a legacy of cooperation that the school still champions.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York in 1939, Stern received degrees from both
Columbia University and Yale University, where he graduated from
the School of Architecture in 1965. He has continued to teach at
both universities, and his course on the history of American
architecture at Columbia has attracted hundreds of students over
the years. He is also the author of ``New York 1930,'' ``New York
1960'' and, most recently, ``New York 1880.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stern belongs to the last generation of hero architects that
includes Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey and Richard Meier,'' said
Steven Harris a faculty member for 14 years and a member of the
search committee. ``The model no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment came as a surprise to some members of the
architectural community who had received a letter from Yale
president Richard Levin in July stating that the search for a new
dean would not be completed until early fall. ``It's good move for
Yale to have completed its search,'' said Ralph Lerner, dean of the
Princeton School of Architecture. ``The course is now set with Bob
and will be a clear reflection of where Bob stands in
architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   While Stern's residential architecture tends in style to range
from the early American to the late Deco, as a preservationist he
has supported the landmark status of numerous modern buildings,
including the 1960s Huntington Hartford building on Columbus
Circle, deemed by some to be an eyesore. Bernard Tschumi, dean of
the Columbia School of Architecture, said, ``Bob has his
ideological preferences but at the end of the day, he will cast
them aside for the greater good of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for a new dean lasted over one and a half years,
starting with a list of 400 names, according to Harris. The final
list included both architects and academics, but initially not
Stern. Among the finalists were Dana Cuff, a professor at UCLA;
Mark Robbins, the curator of architecture at the Wexner Center for
the Arts at Ohio State University, and Marilyn Taylor, an architect
at Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill in Manhattan.

SUMMER BOX OFFICE POSTS RECORD DESPITE LACK OF MAJOR HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood stayed hot this summer, even without a
blockbuster hit.
</P>
<P>
   Final U.S. movie ticket sales for the period between Memorial
Day weekend and Labor Day will wind up around $2.5 billion,
tracking services Exhibitor Relations and ACNielsen EDI said
Wednesday. That equates to an 11 percent gain over last summer's
record-setting total of $2.22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nine films topped $100 million, but none reached $200 million,
making this summer only the third of the past decade to finish
without a movie topping that milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sort of an unexpected record summer,'' said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``Usually, you
have two or three event movies dominate, but that didn't happen.
What went right was there were a lot of good films that people went
to over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marks, senior vice president of ACNielsen EDI, agreed. ``No
matter how you draw the comparisons, it was a great summer because
of the terrific breadth and depth,'' he said. ``There were movies
for all appetites. Every demographic had a movie to satisfy its
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this year's late Labor Day, the 1998 season has one
more week than the summer of 1997. But even if this week were
excluded, box-office revenues would be up 8 percent, and admissions
would have risen 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A successful summer, representing more than one-third of this
year's expected box office, is crucial because of Hollywood's
soaring budgets. Analysts believe costs have continued to escalate
even beyond numbers posted in 1997, when production costs jumped 34
percent to $53.4 million, while marketing costs rose 12 percent to
$22.2 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' was the clear summer winner and could wind up
with $195 million by the end of its run. Disney's disaster flick
was labeled a major disappointment when it opened below
expectations over the Fourth of July weekend, but then showed
surprising staying power and is now the 27th-highest domestic
grosser of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Armageddon,' people made immediate comparisons with `Men
in Black' and `Independence Day,' but it's now Disney's most
successful live-action movie,'' noted Prudential Securities analyst
Kathy Styponias.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Armageddon'' carried an estimated $150 million budget
plus the costs of an enormous marketing campaign, so it's not close
to being the summer's most profitable movie. That title goes to
either 20th Century Fox's ``There's Something About Mary,'' made
for a mere $25 million, or DreamWorks SKG's ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' with a $65 million cost.
</P>
<P>
   ```There's Something About Mary' and `Saving Private Ryan' were
both successful due to strong word-of-mouth from audiences,''
Dergarabedian said. ``Audiences have become very sophisticated. You
can't fool them with hype for more than the first weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   The staying power of popular films is particularly impressive
because it comes at a time when studios and theater chains are
increasingly likely to pull a poorly performing film. ``As long as
there are a lot of films, there is extraordinarily high pressure
for exhibitors to show films that gross well and push out films
that don't,'' Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sony's ``Godzilla'' took in $74 million in its
first week and then only a little more than $60 million during the
rest of its run. By late July, it was in fewer than 200 theaters,
and analysts were saying that the studio had overhyped the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting good word-of-mouth is always elusive,'' Marks said.
``You never know you have it until it comes. And with so many
movies, ones that previously might have developed that buzz have a
hard time hanging around.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer saw both Disney and Fox crack the $500 million in
summer grosses, marking the first time two studios have done so.
Sony became the first to cross the milestone last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Disney managed the feat with solid performances from
``Armageddon,'' ``Mulan,'' ``The Parent Trap,'' ``The Horse
Whisperer'' and ``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' Fox started by
stumbling with ``Bulworth,'' which grossed only $26 million, before
clicking with most of its slate -- ``Hope Floats,'' ``The
X-Files,'' ``Dr. Dolittle,'' ``There's Something About Mary'' and
``Ever After.''
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, the performance represents a continuation of its
status as Hollywood's most consistent studio, while Fox has posted
a stunning rebound from its dismal summer of 1997, when it flopped
with ``Speed 2'' and was forced to delay ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say the summer's strong performance reflects the
increased popularity of megaplexes, those giant 20- and 30-screen
complexes replete with lavish snack bars and state-of-the-art
screens, sound systems and seats. Nearly all new screens will be
part of megaplexes in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have this many good movies, a megaplex allows
customers to have multiple options,'' Dergarabedian said. ``If the
big hit is sold out, it's a matter of, `Let's go see something
else.' It gives moviegoers the chance to be the kid in the candy
store.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks agrees that megaplexes clearly helped keep moviegoers
coming this summer. ``The public loves them,'' he said.

INFORMATION IS KEY TO BUSTING THE STREET DEALERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY BLANEY and SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The faces had to be familiar, or Eddie wouldn't sell heroin to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth dealer used caution and cunning to avoid
detection. He used code names to identify meeting places; drugs and
the quantity being sought were never mentioned on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who survive are very cagey,'' Eddie said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eddie, investigators say, typifies area heroin dealers. They
deal in small quantities of the lucrative drug. They sell to young
users who protect their own kind. And the major dealers don't deal
with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   That creates impossible odds for investigators, who must rely on
informants and undercover agents to infiltrate drug dealers'
circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only as good as our informants,'' said Grapevine police
Sgt. Sam Gladney, who is assigned to the Northeast Tarrant County
Drug Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers to getting that information on the deadly dealers
of heroin are many:
</P>
<P>
   The legion of today's heroin users are young, making it
difficult for undercover agents to blend in.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin use is growing in suburban areas, where its use is more
clandestine than in urban areas, and suburban users more likely can
afford quick, savvy legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and friends are not willing to turn in a teen-ager or to
call for an outside official's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Even when investigators make a bust, they often don't find
enough heroin to press significant charges.
</P>
<P>
   Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies only now are
beginning to work together on the same cases.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin's spread beyond the inner city has changed the dynamics
of law enforcement and resulted in many of the new barriers, police
say.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban areas, users are much younger than the traditional
inner-city addicts, impeding police in their efforts to infiltrate
heroin circles and to go up the dope chain to find the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The young users ``just don't want to give up the friends,'' said
Bedford police Lt. Larry Romines, commander of the Northeast
Tarrant County Drug Task Force. ``That's the problem with this
drug. It's kind of like a cliquish thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents won't call Crime Stoppers, task forces or area
police departments to report that someone is a heroin user or a
dealer, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, some parents ``past the denial stage will say,
`Here's who he's talking to' and pass it on,'' Plano police officer
Rick Moore said. ``Occasionally, we'll talk to neighbors and
they'll give us license plate numbers of people they suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Heroin deals might be made on the streets of Fort Worth and
Dallas, but in Northeast Tarrant County they are cloistered behind
closed doors and are more difficult for police to track, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Jason M., a 21-year-old recovering heroin addict from Haltom
City, said that when he was dealing, users came to his place or he
went to theirs. When he made deliveries, he put the heroin in
bubble wrap and placed it inside a container of coffee beans to
mask the odor. Even a drug-sniffing dog missed it once.
</P>
<P>
   When suburban users are busted, they usually have a gram or less
of heroin, which likely means a probated sentence, prosecutors say.
A private attorney will usually be at their side quickly, said
Margaret Beaudry, director of research with Drug Strategies in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that lawyer is not going to let them turn over dealers,''
Beaudry said. ``It's just a very different demographic. These are
sharp, sharp attorneys that they're getting. These are the kids of
doctors and lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say that they usually arrest young heroin users as soon
as they catch them, rather than dragging out the investigations and
risking overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buy what they're going to use,'' Gladney said. ``As soon
as they buy it, they want to get it in their arms or up their nose.
They can't wait until they drive back over here.''
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the secrecy protecting heroin use, police are
searching for new tactics and alliances.
</P>
<P>
   In Denton, drug agents work with informants who know dealers of
other drugs, said Denton County Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard
Mankoff, commander of the North Central Texas Narcotics Task Force,
which serves Denton, Grayson and Wise counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sources, they've heard about it and they lead us to
others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that pressuring young people to inform may backfire
and cause users not to seek medical help or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   George Malina's 20-year-old son, Milan, died of a heroin
overdose in June 1997. Friends who were with Milan when he
overdosed kept an eye on him but were too afraid to call an
ambulance because they also had been doing the drug, Malina said.
By the time the friends took Milan to the hospital, it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   A no-questions-asked policy for anyone who takes an overdose
victim to a hospital could keep more young people from dying,
Malina said.
</P>
<P>
   Collaboration by law enforcement agencies is vital, Beaudry
said. Although authorities at all levels have communicated with one
another for years, they focused on avoiding duplication of efforts
so that no two agencies were working the same case.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently have suburban, city, state and federal law
enforcement agencies come together on cases.
</P>
<P>
   One such endeavor is the Northeast Tarrant County Drug Task
Force, part of a countywide narcotics intelligence group. When task
force agents get a tip and follow a user outside the county _ to
Dallas, for example _ police there are notified.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaps in the coverage, though. Although most area
cities dedicate an officer to the effort, Colleyville, Keller and
Southlake have not, citing staff!chortages and the need to tend to
their home turf first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been convinced that I can do that right now,''
Colleyville Police Chief John Young said. ``I can't take someone
out of a shift and put him over there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Plano, where heroin has taken the lives of more than a dozen
young people in the past two years, local, state and federal
authorities combined forces to root out a major heroin distribution
ring.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, five Guerrero, Mexico, natives and 24 others,
including some Plano youths, were indicted on federal charges of
distributing heroin. Authorities have also accused some members of
the group of selling heroin that killed four people, a step that
could bring a longer prison sentence for anyone convicted.
</P>
<P>
   But law enforcement can be in only so many plaqes to try to
quell the heroin problem. The eyes and ears of others _ parents,
siblings, teachers and friends _ are needed to help spotlight users
and dealers, police say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can either be part of the problem or part of the
solution,'' said David Flory, Bedford's interim police chief. ``I
think they have a responsibility to society not to turn their
backs. If everyone took that attitude, I don't know where we'd end
up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines laid off more than half of its 51,000 workers
Wednesday, spreading the economic disruption created by a 5-day-old
strike of its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The move signals that the airline is preparing for a protracted
battle while at the same time increasing pressure on President
Clinton to order the pilots back to work, an intervention that the
company has been quietly seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said that with its 1,700 daily flights grounded since
Saturday by the walkout, it had no work for a full work force. The
27,500 employees being laid off, including mechanics, flight
attendants and customer-service representatives, are also in
contract negotiations with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, as Northwest canceled all its flights through
the Labor Day weekend, the Department of Transportation said that
two commuter airlines affiliated with Northwest had violated
federal law by suspending service to 17 small cities in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The department ordered the airlines, Mesaba Airlines and Express
Airlines I, which connect the cities with Northwest's hub airports
in Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tenn., to resume flying
Thursday. The commuter airlines' pilots are not on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The large layoff means that Northwest, which is the United
States' fourth-largest carrier and dominates much of the Midwest,
will not be flying again anytime soon, even if it reaches a
settlement with the pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier estimated that it would take eight to 10 days to get
all its planes back in the air once the pilots returned to the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed Wednesday to meet with a federal mediator on
Saturday, though it was not certain that negotiations would resume.
</P>
<P>
   The major issues in the strike are pay and job security. Before
negotiations broke off on Friday, the union was seeking a 14
percent raise over three years. Northwest's last offer was a 9
percent raise over four years. The union says the pilots' yearly
average salary is $120,000; the company says it is $133,000.
</P>
<P>
   Magdalena Jacobsen, the chairwoman of the National Mediation
Board, who is supervising the negotiations, invited the two sides
to meet with her in Chicago on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Armshaw, a spokesman for the board, which is an independent
federal agency that supervises the airline and rail industries,
said that the meeting was not a resumption of negotiations but an
attempt to see whether there was enough movement on either side for
new talks to be productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exploratory meeting,'' Armshaw said. ``If it can go
beyond that, it will.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was announced a day after Rodney Slater, the
secretary of the Department of Transportation, met with the chief
executive of Northwest, John Dasburg, and the president of the Air
Line Pilots' Association, Randolph Babbitt, separately and together
for nearly five hours in his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Slater seemed to believe the two sides showed some willingness
to compromise, but neither the company nor the pilots indicated
that on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Foley, Northwest's vice president for communications,
said: ``Dasburg made it very clear that ALPA's position on pay is
unachievable.They gave no indication that they will move on that.
Until they do, we can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots reiterated their position that they were waiting for
Northwest to make a move. ``It has always been our preference to
negotiate,'' said Paul Omodt, the union's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first strike to cripple a major airline since flight
attendants went on strike at American Airlines five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest pilots say that they helped save the airline from
bankruptcy in 1993 when they accepted a 15.5 percent wage cut in
exchange for stock along with the other unions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Northwest has registered four years of record
profits and the airline's executives have cashed in stock options
worth tens of millions of dollars, while the pilots' salaries have
merely returned to the pay levels before their concessions. After
two years of negotiations, the pilots say they are seeking an
``industry-leading'' contract that would vault them over their
counterparts at American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that it cannot afford to pay the pilots
more than its three competitors, which are much larger, pay their
pilots,
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 14 percent raise, the pilots are seeking a
lump sum of $86 million to make up for the past two years, an end
to a two-tier wage scale in which newly hired pilots are paid less
than those who have been at the airline more than five years, and
limits on the number of small, regional jets Northwest can add to
its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 9 percent wage increase, Northwest has
offered a lump sum of $57 million, a reduction of the two-tier wage
scale to three years from five, profit sharing and improved pension
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots say the difference between the two offers amounts to
$70 million a year; the company estimates the difference at $170
million.

</P>
<P>
   But Northwest is also in the midst of negotiating new contracts
with its five other unions. The airline has said that if it meets
the pilots' demands, it will be forced to be equally generous with
its other workers, saddling it with high costs at a time when a
weakening global economy threatens to end the current boom in the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strike has caused fewer problems than many had
predicted. Under the Railway Labor Act, which also governs union
contracts in the airline industry, the federal mediator must
declare a 30-day cooling-off period before an airline union can
strike. That gave businesses and consumers more than a month to
prepare for life without Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the strike drags on beyond the Labor Day holiday, a heavy
travel period, it promises to cause increasing disruption as
business people resume heavier travel schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has repeatedly warned of the disastrous effects of a
strike in the hope of convincing Clinton to intervene. The White
House has the power to force the pilots back to work for 60 days
while a special emergency board tried to negotiate a compromise
acceptable to both sides. But Clinton, who ended a pilots strike at
American Airlines last year, has declined to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said Wednesday that it regretted having to lay off its
workers. ``This is a sad day for Northwest Airlines,'' said Dwayne
Tucker, Northwest's vice president for human resources. ``We hoped
never to have to exercise this option.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots accused the company of exaggerating the impact of
the strike in order to get Clinton to intervene. The union said the
layoffs were ``simply the next step in a carefully contrived plan
by management to inflict pain on everyone _ the traveling public,
the pilots, and indeed, all Northwest workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has also said that there was no reason for Mesaba and
Express to stop flying just because Northwest was grounded.
</P>
<P>
   In its order Wednesday, the Transportation Department said that
under a federal program that pays subsidies to airlines to fly to
underserved areas, Mesaba and Express are prohibited from
suspending service below a minimum of two round trips a day to a
major hub airport six days a week without first giving 90 days
notice.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many passengers would be affected by the
order, though it is probably small.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Wilkinson, a spokesman for Mesaba, which is effectively
controlled by Northwest, said that it made no economic sense for
the airline to fly without being able to connect passengers to
Northwest. He added that Northwest also provides many essential
services to Mesaba, such as its reservation system, scheduling and
ground handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northwest just furloughed 27,000 employees,'' he said. ``There
is no one to provide these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing their own negotiations with the company, Northwest's
other unions have supported the pilots. ``We do stand behind
them,'' said Kathy Jo Smith, a business agent for Local 2000 of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents
Northwest's 11,000 flight attendants. ``They're sort of paving the
way for us. We want them to stand hard and firm.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that thousands of workers are losing their jobs, the
pressure on both the union and the company to reach a settlement is
sure to increase. Few Northwest workers make anywhere near the
pilots' average yearly salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time alone changes these things,'' said one person involved in
the talks who insisted on anonymity. ``But it is important that
neither side be too far ahead of its troops.''

COUNTRY STAR FREE ON BAIL IN TEXAS SHOOTING

<P>
   SABINAL, Texas _ As family and friends packed a church Wednesday
to bury a man allegedly shot and killed by country-western star
Johnny Rodriguez, one of the mourners claimed the singer shot at
his uncle in a previous incident three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in San Antonio, defense attorney Alan Brown continued to
insist that the victim, 26-year-old Israel ``Bosco'' Borrego, was
drunk and in Rodriguez's mother's home without permission at 4:30
a.m., CDT, Saturday. Brown said the singer shot the man because he
thought he was an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also said Rodriguez, 46, was freed from the Uvalde County
jail shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday after a state district judge
reduced bail, initially set at $250,000, to $50,000. The lawyer
said he had no knowledge of the reports of an earlier shooting by
his client, but doubted they were true.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio television station KSAT reported Wednesday that
District Attorney Tony Hackebeil confirmed that police investigated
a report that Rodriguez shot at an individual in Sabinal several
weeks ago. Hackebeil could not be reached for comment later
Wednesday, and Sabinal police referred questions about the shooting
to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of those attending Borrego's funeral at St. Patrick
Catholic Church here was Pete Musquez Jr., also a Sabinal resident.
Musquez said an uncle _ whom he declined to identify _ was shot at
by Rodriguez during a gathering about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know he took a couple of shots at my uncle, and someone
knocked the gun out of his hand,'' Musquez said, as he waited to
join Borrego's funeral procession to the town's Catholic cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents evidently took place at the small wood-frame home
on Pickford Street that belongs to Rodriguez's mother, who now
lives in a nursing home in San Antonio. The modest home, with
yellow paint peeling from the walls and empty chairs sitting in a
carport, was the site of a number of impromptu drinking parties
hosted in recent weeks by the famous singer, townspeople said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of guys would gather around there, and sing and drink
beer,'' said Juan Rodriguez, who is not related to the singer and
who played softball with Borrego. ``Johnny would invite people to
go over and party with him. There was nothing weird about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The boyish-faced singer helped put this South Texas ranching and
farming community of 1,500 residents on the map with his rapid rise
to fame in the early 1970s. He had 15 top 10 hits, including his
trademark ``Pass Me By'' (If You're Only Passing Through), after
his musical talent was discovered while he was jailed for stealing
a goat.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church Wednesday, relatives of the slain man hoped
his four brothers would not take the law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really upset, the brothers are,'' said Jesus Flores, a
barber from Uvalde whose wife is a cousin of the Borrego clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just going to have to go with the flow and see what
the judges and the lawyers come up with .... I hope they don't do
anything because there's been enough trouble as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the funeral service, Auxiliary Bishop Patrick Zurek of
San Antonio recalled his own brother's death in a traffic accident
with a drunken and drugged driver, and having to tell his
12-year-old nephew the sad news.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled asking if the boy was mad at the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be angry with him? Will it bring back Pop?''
Zurek said, and applauded the boy's wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Borrego's grieving friends and family to ``let
vengeance remain with God.''
</P>
<P>
   The funeral Mass was conducted by the St. Patrick parish priest,
Rev. Einer R. Ochoa, who said last Saturday's homicide was tough on
a small community where the families of both victim and murder
suspect have long resided.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small community like this, when something like this
happens, it's a big tragedy because everybody knows everybody. It
is even more terrible than in a big city where sometimes people
don't know each other,'' the priest said. ``But here, both families
are members of this community and know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for both families to deal with this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez's release on bond late Wednesday, the next step
in the criminal proceedings was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, the prosecutor said he planned to present
evidence seeking a murder indictment to a Uvalde County grand jury
today. But defense attorney Brown said Hackebeil on told him
Wednesday that he would not be taking the case to the grand jury
when it meets in regular session today.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he considers the shooting justifiable, and said
Borrego had broken into other homes in the area and has been
repeatedly warned not to go into the Rodriguez home.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Borrego was already inside the house when Rodriguez
walked in: ``He startled Johnny in his own home at 4:30 a.m., and
he didn't have permission to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown disputed recent accounts by the victim's family that
Rodriguez shot him several times during a fight outside the house,
then dragged the body inside to make it look like a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rationalize everything as to why there ought to be
someone responsible, a victim mentality,'' Brown said of the
family. ``But I was raised by my parents not to go into people's
homes without their permission. What they ought to be worried about
is, he had a wife and two children and he was out drunk and going
into people's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrego's death left his wife, Anita, a young widow trying to
raise two children _ Israel Borrego Jr., 8, and Lydia Borrego, 4 _
while caring for her elderly father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough ... it's real, real tragic,'' said Anita's
older brother, Al Alejandro, a 38-year-old trucking company manager
who lives in Abilene.
</P>
<P>
   He described his brother-in-law as ``a good human being _ he had
a good heart, but he wasn't perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro said the family would not comment on remarks made
about Borrego, and will rely on the criminal justice system to
settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put our faith in God and the system and let it
run out on its own,'' he said.

TRANSPORTING HEROIN INTERNALLY A DEADLY RISK FOR COURIERS TO
SWALLOW
</HEADLINE>
 
EDS: One of 22 stories (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON DICKSON and SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment a smuggler slathers a heroin-filled balloon with
cooking oil, pops it in his mouth and swallows hard, his life is on
the clock.
</P>
<P>
   If anything goes wrong _ a flight delay, a lengthy interrogation
by the U.S. Customs Service _ the balloon could rupture and the
smuggler could face instant death.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary risk, swallowing is an increasingly
popular method of heroin smuggling because it is relatively simple
to get past federal authorities and even drug-sniffing dogs,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couriers who swallow say to themselves, `This is an easy
way, it's good money and a free trip,' '' said Roberto Medina,]
associate special agent in charge of U.S. customs investigations in
El Paso. ``They think it's almost impossible to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, customs officials acknowledge that
they are usually wrong when they suspect that someone has swallowed
drug-filled balloons or condoms or bags. In the past five years,
only five of the 36 suspects escorted by customs officials to
Baylor Medical Center at Grapevine for X-rays had anything other
than food in their stomachs, U.S. customs records show.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. customs seizures of ``internally concealed''
heroin increased significantly in 1996 _ 642 pounds, compared with
508 in 1995 _ officials say they are seizing only a fraction of the
incoming drug.
</P>
<P>
   Swallowers usually arrive by plane, but they also walk or drive
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're seeing swallowers show up at Laredo, Eagle Pass and
El Paso,'' said Judy Turner, a customs spokeswoman in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso and Laredo, Texas, were among the leading cities for
internally concealed heroin from Mexico from 1994 to 1996. Houston
was among the leading cities for internally concealed heroin
seizures from flights out of Panama and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   One swallower can ingest as much as $3 million worth of heroin,
a lure that is tempting more people to try, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers have no problems recruiting swallowers. Many
live in poverty where the heroin originates: Mexico, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Swallowers who are physically able to handle more balloons are
being asked to carry 2 to 3 pounds across the border at a time,
said Paul Rimmer, port director for customs in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It limits your exposure without limiting your profit,'' Rimmer
said. ``Several years ago, 2 pounds was unusual, but now it's much
more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In early August, a Salvadoran man arrested at Bush
Intercontinental Airport in Houston had swallowed 100 balloons
filled with about 3 pounds of heroin _ a load that had a potential
street value of up to $3 million, customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost twice the typical load of 1.7 pounds for
swallowers from 1994 to 1996, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   New technology makes it possible to install easy-to-use X-ray
equipment at points of entry to try to identify more swallowers.
But customs officials are not planning to install the technology,
saying that role is for medical experts. And the American Civil
Liberties Union has said it will oppose any routine use of such
equipment at U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airport is not a no-privacy zone. The Fourth Amendment is
fully applicable,'' ACLU legislative counsel Gregory T. Nojeim told
the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, federal officials say they are focusing primarily on
improving how they question suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Their main advantage is time.
</P>
<P>
   If a balloon is expelled prematurely, the smuggler risks a
lengthy prison sentence if discovered by authorities _ or quick
execution by the traffickers if any of the drug is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people expel them prematurely and they swallow them
again,'' Turner said. ``It's unpleasant, but what else are they
going to do? If they show up missing two pellets when they make
their connection, they are going to get shot. It's an amazing
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   If a balloon ruptures in the carrier's body, the smuggler can
suffer a horrifying stomach explosion. Death is quick but
excruciating as the heroin makes its way to the intestinal walls,
where it is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream. Within a few
heartbeats, the heroin is pumped into the heart, stopping it cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your body will jerk and go rigid,'' said Larry Alexander, an
emergency room physician at Baylor Medical Center at Irving who has
treated several heroin overdoses. ``Once it's in the bloodstream
... it's like somebody turning the lights out. It takes one beat of
the heart to circulate it through the entire body.''
</P>
<P>
   If customs officials suspect that someone is a swallower, the
interrogation is usually slow-paced.
</P>
<P>
   They look for signs of nervousness as minutes tick by. They also
look in the suspect's luggage for laxatives or for medicine to
prevent premature bowel movements. They check whether the suspect's
breath smells like latex, or whether the suspect refused airplane
food.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the clues are more subtle. Last year, federal
authorities at D/FW Airport became suspicious about two Colombian
men traveling from Lima, Peru, to Japan. The two said they were
businessmen, but they weren't carrying briefcases and had dirty
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we looked at them, they began to get nervous,'' said
customs inspector Renee Nunn, who worked the case. ``One was
shaking a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Each had swallowed 100 balloons of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, swallowers are generally less likely to travel to D/FW
than to drug-trafficking hot spots in Miami or New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit longer flight to here and a little more
difficult to hold that in all that time,'' said Fred Waters, a
chief customs inspector at D/FW.

   Clinton Hints at Offer to Russia of Financial Aid
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton suggested that the West would increase its aid
to Russia if that country continued its tough economic reforms. His
message was intended to encourage the Yeltsin government to stick
with its pro-capitalist course despite the nation's deepening
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told his aides that the United States should be
prepared to lead a new international aid effort, which could draw
on the Group of Seven industrialized nations and international
organizations, such as the World Bank.
</P>

   Chase Manhattan Bank and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette announced

Russia and Asia.

   FDA Panel Backs Tamoxifen
</P>
<P>
   An advisory committee to the FDA voted unanimously to approve
the use of the drug tamoxifen to reduce women's risk of developing
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Zeneca, which makes the drug tamoxifen, and Barr
Laboratories, which sells its generic form, rose sharply. Also
increasing were shares of Genentech, which received approval from
an FDA panel for Herceptin, the brand name for a biological drug to
treat metastatic breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   More Northwest Workers Laid Off
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines laid off 27,500 workers, including mechanics,
flight attendants and customer service representatives, and
canceled all its 1,700 daily flights through the Labor Day weekend,
a move that could extend the disruption caused by the five-day old
pilots' strike for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian Finance Minister Ousted
</P>
<P>
   Anwar Ibrahim was dismissed as deputy prime minister and finance
minister of Malaysia. His dismissal came one day after the prime
minister imposed controls on the sale of the currency, the ringgit,
and fixed its exchange rate. These steps followed a July stimulus
package that overturned Anwar's tight fiscal policies.

   Hong Kong Suspends Short Sales

   The Hong Kong government bolstered the stock market again by
suspending short-selling of shares many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Brokerage Firms Down
</P>
<P>
   Shares of brokerage firms have been battered in recent weeks, in
some cases falling more than 40 percent. Analysts say that if the
market stabilizes and builds on its fledgling recovery, these
stocks might increase, but then again, if the market's slide
continues, they might decline.
</P>
<P>
   Livent Names Artistic Director
</P>
<P>
   Livent hired Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout
Theater Company, as artistic director, effectively supplanting
Garth Drabinsky, Livent's co-founder and the producer of
``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Bond's Yield Edges Down
</P>
<P>
   Prices of most Treasury securities slipped slightly, with
investors feeling less need to seek a haven, as stock markets
worldwide stabilized and the dollar weakened. The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.33 percent, from 5.34 percent on
Tuesday. With yields at a 30-year low, the lure for some investors
is not as strong as it was a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Finance Minister's Lament
</P>
<P>
   Investors have sold Latin securities because of worries
generated by Russia and Japan, without bothering to examine
conditions in individual nations, lamented Finance Minister Jose
Angel Gurria of Mexico.

SONGBIRD'S FUTURE IN PERIL, GROUP SAYS; U.S. BLAMED

<P>
   A tiny songbird likely will become extinct despite its listing
as endangered because of the federal government's failure to
enforce the Endangered Species Act, an environmental group charged
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Southwestern willow flycatcher was declared endangered
in 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has approved
destruction of habitats for nearly 20 percent of the remaining
population of this tiny migratory songbird, according to a report
by the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fish and Wildlife resisted listing the flycatcher, tooth
and nail, and ever since has continued to stonewall protection for
this graceful bird,'' said Noah Greenwald, who wrote the report for
the Tucson-based environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Humphrey, Phoenix spokesman for Fish and Wildlife, said his
agency shares concerns for the flycatcher, and is doing everything
possible to avoid issuing any additional ``take'' permits, which
legally allow the destruction of endangered species and their
habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were especially critical of decisions by Fish
and Wildlife to allow the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to raise water
levels at three lakes, drowning or potentially drowning the trees
that the flycatchers use to nest.
</P>
<P>
   Those lakes _ Roosevelt in Arizona, Isabella in California and
Mead on the Arizona-Nevada line _ represent half of the remaining
locations where at least 20 pairs of songbirds nest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists filed lawsuits in each case. They lost the
decision to raise water levels at Lake Mead, which since has
flooded flycatcher trees. Federal court decisions are pending in
lawsuits involving Roosevelt and Isabella.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal Fish and Wildlife memo made public in
the Mead lawsuit: Former federal biologist Rob Marshall said of his
own agency: ``The Southwestern willow flycatcher is being
piecemealed to extinction; the service is turning a blind eye to
the aggregate effects of its own (actions).''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey said that his agency is sensitive to such criticism,
and that all decisions regarding the flycatcher now are being
collectively monitored by the agency's regional office in
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're doing everything in our power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, federal and local officials recently worked out a
way to provide water to a flycatcher nesting site when the repairs
for flood damage to the Kearny airport were planned.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mead, the Bureau of Reclamation has pledged to
replace the destroyed habitat with new habitat along the Colorado
River, though the replacement habitat is yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   For Roosevelt, which was enlarged in 1996 to provide more
storage and more flood control for the Valley, the Bureau of
Reclamation pledged $4.4 million over 20 years so the Nature
Conservancy could buy 820 acres of former ranch land along the San
Pedro River for a preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald of the Southwest Center said this is hardly a fair
trade-off, because there have been up to 45 nesting territories
surrounding Roosevelt, and only three flycatcher territories at the
Dudleyville Crossing site run by the Nature Conservancy. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be no more cartoonish scissors kicks, no
reprisal of last year's epic U.S. Open dethroning of top-ranked
Pete Sampras, no encores to the Grand Slam breakthrough he made
last winter when he won the Australian Open at the ripe old age of
29.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda kissed all those scenarios goodbye Wednesday when he
became the first major casualty at Flushing Meadows when Germany's
Bernd Karbacher, a 155th-ranked qualifier whose own career was
threatened by myocarditis last year, recovered from a slow start
and went on to trample Korda, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very tired at the moment, mentally, everything; I was not
pumped at all today,'' said the fourth-seeded Korda, who was
out-aced, 15-2, produced 57 unforced errors and felt everything go
downhill from the second set on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hit it and I miss it, I was trying to come in
and he made good pass,'' Korda added. ``Whatever I did today, I did
wrong,'' Korda admitted he was also suffering from homesickness
that stemmed from his having to leave home just five days after the
birth of a second daughter on July 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really depend on my family, and I haven't had a chance to
see them since the baby was born,'' said Korda, who married Regina
Rajchrtova, a former WTA Tour player, in 1992 and has credited her
with helping him rebound from a series of surgeries and rekindle
his love for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The playing conditions were amenable enough at Arthur Ashe
Stadium, and the opponent was one he had crushed in both prior
meetings, but Korda simply forgot how to play his game. Once that
happened, he was summarily ousted by the somewhat stunned
Karbacher, a 30-year-old journeyman who could not even remember the
last time he made life miserable for a member of the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Michael Chang, who encountered little resistance from
the qualifier he faced, 271st-ranked Eyal Erlich of Israel, could
have warned Korda about Karbacher's potential for creating chaos in
Grand Slam situations: Karbacher knocked him out of the second
round at the French Open, the only Slam where Chang has bragging
rights to a championship, in 1993. But Chang had other hurdles to
overcome: At 26, he has not only been Slam-less since capturing
that Roland Garros title in 1989, he came into this Slam, the one
where he was seeded second last year and became the odds-on
favorite to win the title after Korda's ambush of Sampras, unseeded
for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Chang is nothing if not dogged, and after handling Eyal 6-1,
6-3, 6-1 in just 88 minutes, he donned a T-shirt with a ``Jesus
Loves You'' message and announced that, on the basis of this
first-round victory and the hardcourts title he won in Boston on
Sunday, he believes himself capable of tackling this title along
with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My injuries and stuff are headed in the right direction,''
said the 22nd-ranked Chang, who has battled foot, wrist, stomach
and knee trouble this season. ``I'm still left in the draw, so why
not have the attitude that I can come out and play great tennis and
maybe even win this tournament,'' said Chang, who confirmed that
his energized attitude toward the game does not include his
volunteering for Davis Cup singles duty in the semifinals against
Italy later this month in Milwaukee. ``It is not in my best
interest to play at this time. My major concern is getting back to
where I'd like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Chang would like to be is back in the top 10 and
contending for titles like this one, but his immediate path is
complicated by his unseeded status, a predicament that advanced him
into a difficult second-round encounter against the reigning French
Open champion, 10th-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain. Moya escaped from
a potentially lengthy first-round duel with Mariano Puerta of
Argentina on Wednesday after the 58th-ranked teen-ager was felled
by hip flexor cramps with Moya ahead, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7),
4-4.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like Korda, the second-seeded Marcelo Rios has had ample
opportunities in 1998 to wrestle the No. 1 ranking away from Pete
Sampras, and unlike Korda, he has succeeded twice. But Rios has not
been quite the same since Moya sent him packing this spring at
Roland Garros, the Slam in which the Chilean had hopes to validate
his No. 1 ranking by capturing a major title.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Rios got revenge for a straight-sets loss to Daniel
Vacek in Cincinnati by demolishing the Czech, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing really bad, not having a lot of fun,'' Rios
said, ``but I come to this tournament with a lot of energy, trying
to do good, get the No. 1 ranking again and win a Slam _ the last
Slam of the year.''

FOR WRIGLEY FIELD BLEACHER BUMS, SOSA'S THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sammy Sosa responded to Mark McGwire, or at least to
Barbara Reichert. ``We need just one run, Sammy, hit me one,'' she
yelled Wednesday from the first row in the right-field bleachers at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   And Sosa did, leading off the Cubs' sixth inning with his 56th
home run, off a Jason Bere fastball that landed in Reichert's
college softball glove. The home run gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead over
the Reds in a game they would win, 4-2, assuring that they would
finish the day still ahead of the Mets in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   And that homer temporarily put Sosa one behind Mark McGwire of
St. Louis in the race to break Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs
in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had entered the night with 57 homers after his two
blasts Tuesday in Florida. But he connected on his 58th and 59th
Wednesday night, both two-run shots, again against the Marlins.
After Wednesday night, McGwire has 23 games remaining and Sosa has
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great day,'' said Sosa, a right-handed batter, who
had struck out three times the night before. ``Every time I'm
thinking about going to right field, I'm a much, much, much better
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   So the home run race has become a sprint to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   It was a glorious afternoon to be in right field at Wrigley,
where the serious baseball fans sit. It's warm on cold days in the
sun. The players are nearby. And the faces are familiar.
</P>
<P>
   They arrive early to argue over statistics and trades and the
batting order. They argue whether Wrigley will ever be torn down.
They opine: ``Fifty-seven is a dumb uniform number for an
outfielder,'' referring to Cincinnati right fielder Roberto
Petagine's jersey.
</P>
<P>
   They swap news: The pennant flags for the Western Division
teams, which show the standings, aren't flying above the scoreboard
Wednesday. ``Why not?'' ``The cable is frayed.'' The fans in right
field know these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they come!'' Sherwin Esterman, the man in the painter's
cap, announces as the Cubs emerge from the dugout for the first
inning. He's not sure why he says that, but he always does. He's
been in the right-field bleachers since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   And here comes Sosa, not trotting as the other players do, but
sprinting 368 feet to the ivy-covered wall in right field. He takes
a left turn in front of the cheering bleachers, his right hand
cupped to his ear in the universal sign for ``I can't hear you.''
</P>
<P>
   The bleacher bums are Sammy's fans now, as they were Andre
Dawson's from 1987 to 1992. Sosa pats his chest to give heart
kisses to the crowd. They tell him to play a little deeper or to
the left. Wednesday he rewarded them with a fine running catch in
the corner, just before his home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right-field bleachers is something I'll never forget,''
Sosa said after Wednesday's game. ``When I play hard, they like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bums agreed with Sosa that it was a bad idea for the Cubs to
announce Tuesday night that McGwire had hit two home runs. It made
him think home run, Sosa said. The Cubs say they won't make any
more announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's home run Wednesday gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead in a game
they would hang on to win on another home run by the veteran Gary
Gaetti, and an insurance homer by catcher Scott Servais. Sosa's
56th also tied the Cubs' record for a season, set by Hack Wilson in
1930. That was the National League record until McGwire's efforts
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the talk is of Sosa and McGwire, the bleacher bums
are most excited by the prospect of the Cubs' best finish since
1989. One theory is that a tie for the wild-card spot would help
Sosa pass McGwire. ``The Cubs will finish in a three-way tie for
the wild card,'' said Dave Alm, 53, who has been in the bleachers
since 1958. ``They'll play a playoff, and Sosa will hit two more.''
</P>
<P>
   The bums gamble on ``mound ball,'' in which the game is won or
lost depending on where the baseball is left by the players between
innings. And they stand reverently with 36,000 others for the
singing of ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame.'' Wednesday's guest
conductor, filling in for the late Harry Caray, is Cardinal Francis
George, archbishop of Chicago, who threatens to sing it in Latin.
That would match the sign across Sheffield Avenue, where more fans
fill still more bleachers built on top of a brick three-flat. The
sign urges ``Eamus Catuli,'' ballpark Latin for ``Go, Cubs!''
</P>
<P>
   Behind right field, the El train rumbles by and a ball roars
overhead. Dave Davidson had played Lance Johnson perfectly,
fielding his long foul off a taxi on Sheffield. Davidson gets his
signs from Mel Romanek in the back row. ``Uncle Mel,'' 59, has been
sitting in the bleachers since 1953. ``When a left-hander is up, I
tap my left shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   The bums can be brutal, perhaps hardened by years of
disappointment. Their favorite play this year was when a Phillies
right fielder, who had made one bad play, was heckled mercilessly.
Finally he turned to give the crowd a shrug, and missed a ball hit
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway's OK, but this is it right here,'' said Trish Hollard,
32, a lawyer. She joins in the chant of ``MVP!'' for the most
valuable player award that the bums think will be Sosa's.
</P>
<P>
   The ivy-covered wall of right field became a 10th player itself
this week for the Cubs. A long fly to right by Jose Hernandez
appeared to be a home run, and the Reds' right fielder turned to
watch it land in the seats. But the serpentine wall curves at that
point, making the outfield a few feet deeper. The ball landed safe
on the warning track for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Fights are fewer now in the bleachers since beer sales were
discontinued a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reichert stayed in her seat when Sosa was up. A copy editor for
The Chicago Tribune, she might be editing a story with her name in
it. She held a sign: ``Hit Us No. 56 and we'll give it back free.''
And she offered to do just that. But if the ball were to go to the
Cubs, owned by Tribune Co., ``They'll have to pay.''

REAL HELP FOR SLEEPY DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sleepy drivers can cruise along the highway with
the window wide open, pinching or slapping themselves, chewing gum
or tuning the radio to a call-in host whose politics they detest,
but none of that will keep them awake, the AAA Foundation for
Traffic Safety and a prominent sleep researcher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their advice for a Labor Day weekend drive is this: Go to bed
early on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do,'' said David Willis, president of
the AAA Foundation, ``is spend your time running around like mad
getting ready for that big drive to Grandmother's house, and get
only a few hours' sleep the night before.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three million drivers will hit the road this weekend,
Willis said, many of them right after work on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year study by the University of Pennsylvania medical
school surveyed 283 sleep researchers and transportation safety
experts. David Dinges, head of the division of sleep and
chronobiology at the school, said the study debunked a variety of
folk remedies, including driving with one shoe off, playing mind
games, eating snacks or arguing with someone on a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Dinges advised getting enough rest the night before. Taking a
nap, even for as little as 20 minutes, could provide an hour or
more of alert driving time afterward, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinges and Willis recommended that after a nap, someone who
would be driving should do about two minutes of jumping jacks,
running or marching in place, and stretches, to get the blood
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Official statistics attribute about 3.2 percent of the crashes
in which someone is killed to driver fatigue, Willis said, but a
dozen states report no accidents from that cause because the report
forms that officers fill out do not have a space to list fatigue as
a factor. In addition, he said, few surviving drivers will admit
that they fell asleep, and if the driver dies, it is even harder to
pinpoint the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Dinges said that caffeine could be effective, and that people
who planned a long drive on Friday night should drink more then,
and less during the day.

   HEMET, Calif. _ A wildfire started by lightning and driven by 40
mph winds burned 34 homes and 6,000 acres near here on Monday and
Tuesday, leaving little but blackened barren hills and the pungent
smell of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 firefighters from around the state battled the
flames in Juniper Flats, about 85 miles east of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters contended with 12-foot flames, heat in excess of
110 degrees and a fire that did not burn in a clear pattern,
because of shifting winds. A preliminary assessment put the damage
at $2.9 million in homes, livestock, and buildings like barns,
greenhouses and sheds.
</P>
<P>
   As the flames advanced toward their homes, several residents
said they had little time to prepare or even to grab anything.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Chatlousky, a 40-year-old stone polisher and silversmith,
was having dinner at his mother's house when he heard news of the
fire. By the time he saw his house, everything was gone: his
collections of turtles and tarantulas, his laying hens, his mobile
home and his English furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the surface of the moon,'' Chatlousky said at a
Red Cross emergency shelter set up in a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   To the list of weather problems attributed to El Nino this year,
add hazardous fire conditions. Heavy rains caused thick growth this
year, leaving grass 8 feet tall in some parts of the state, said
Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry
and Fire Protection.

JONES EXPECTS COOL PLAY AFTER BUM SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ If nothing else, at least the longest and
hottest of summers is over for the Cowboys. Which, of course,
doesn't involve North Texas' record heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the walls at Valley Ranch, the Cowboys are parched and
barren in areas other than landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Just since the opening of training camp in mid-July, the image
of the Cowboys has dried up and died, both on the field and off.
</P>
<P>
   What do other people think of this bunch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad team,'' for starters. ``Still bad actors,'' for the
kicker.
</P>
<P>
   From a football standpoint, not since 1990 has the prevailing
national perception of the Cowboys been so low. This has been
fueled by a combo of 1997's December dog act and an August of
alarming preseason misery.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, Jerry Jones' carefully crafted and sincere
clean-up-the-Cowboys campaign suddenly took a serious beating. The
dorm-room neck slashing in Wichita Falls, and then the Larry Allen
incident, destroyed what had become some deserved credibility on
this front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think in both cases those are fair
evaluations, at least based on the current general perception,''
Jones said yesterday, with the 1998 season opener just a few days
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here was a case where a negative fed on a negative. Our
two off-the-field instances were compounded by going 0-and-5 in the
preseason, and vice versa. Again, just in my opinion, it made both
look worse than they really were. But when dealing with perception,
and certainly when it's the Dallas Cowboys, it's a loss in both
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his Valley Ranch office, surrounded by five Lombardi
trophies, Jones spoke candidly, but didn't retreat from his normal
upbeat mood. Never-let-'em-see-you-sweat is a Jerry trademark, plus
yesterday had him in a general manager frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was juggling a legitimate attempt to sign free-agent
linebacker Quentin Coryatt (great idea) with some crazy scheme to
bring back Charles Haley (awful idea) from retirement. With Jerry,
it's always something.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones' obvious eagerness for the arrival of Sunday's kickoff
seemed to go beyond normal circumstances this time of year. Mainly,
he has convinced himself that Chan Gailey and Co. have the
on-the-field capabilities to quickly put a bad summer behind one
and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Dallas Cowboys, and we are constantly faced with
too high expectations and a too low benefit of the doubt,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit I have more unanswered questions about this team than
at any time since we became a (Super Bowl) contender. What I also
have, however, is the advantage of sitting in on so many of the
offensive meetings, be it before training camp, training camp, and
now. As a fly on the wall, and that's what I've been in these
meetings, I have regained that confident feeling that this is an
offense that is going to be very productive. If the offense is
productive again, then look out for the Dallas Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   See there. Jones is being Jones, even if his high hopes seem
totally unreasonable, given where the Cowboys are as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry, would you take 8-and-8 right now and call 1998 a success?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, every team starts off a season with the premise it can
be 8-and-8,'' Jones said. ``What takes a certain amount of those
teams to the 9-7 mark, the 10-6 mark, or beyond, is the caliber of
the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a full season of health for Troy Aikman, playing in
Chan Gailey's offense, and we are a playoff team. If you're a
playoff team, you are a (Super Bowl) contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine wins for these Cowboys? Then file that under ``great
season.'' Ten wins would deserve a ``miracle'' tag. But to Jones,
my thinking, and the thinking of most others, is based on ``six
wins last season when there is no way we should have been that bad,
and also based on our preseason, when our emphasis was on veterans
staying healthy. I see a lot of things changing, and that starts on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of change, the Cowboys' image hasn't, due to
off-the-field incidents this summer involving Michael Irvin and
Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that once again there has to be doubt,'' Jones said.
``But all I can say is we will continue to work very hard in this
area. We have had our setbacks, and there may be more. But we
aren't going to pack up and go home. We will continue to be
diligent as an organization, and it's going to get better and
better under Chan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we have Chan. How bad would this have looked if
Barry (Switzer) were still here? Yes, things have changed, and we
will continue to work very hard for more positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least the Cowboys' hottest of football summers
will end Sunday. And it couldn't have come soon enough.

NEW YORK DEMOCRATS ANGRY ABOUT CLINTON FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan fund-raising appearance by President
Clinton scheduled for the night before the New York Democratic
primary is stirring resentment among candidates and their aides,
who are worried that Clinton will steal attention from their
contests and undercut their own fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints seemed to represent a near-consensus among the
major New York campaigns as Clinton's appearance at the Sept. 14
national Democratic fund-raiser approaches. The state's three major
candidates for U.S. Senate _ Geraldine Ferraro, Charles Schumer and
Mark Green _ have called the White House in an unsuccessful effort
to persuade Clinton to delay the fund-raiser, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales for the event, a performance of ``The Lion King''
to benefit the national congressional campaigns, have been heavy
and are expected to raise at least $3.5 million. That would make it
the most lucrative fund-raiser the party has ever staged, said
Steven Grossman, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The objections raised by Democrats in New York in a series of
interviews offered a discordant counterpoint to Democrats in
Washington. National party leaders pointed to the evident success
of the ``Lion King'' fund-raiser, which Grossman described
Wednesday as ``the political event of the decade,'' as an
indication that Clinton had not been hurt, at least among
contributors to the Democratic Party, by his admission of an
improper relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than viewing the event's success as testimony to
Clinton's political strength, New York officials described it as
the latest instance in which national Democrats had put their
fortunes ahead of New York, where the party is engaged in difficult
races to unseat Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign and state party officials said the very success of the
fund-raiser, whose top ticket goes for $100,000, would complicate
the already formidable task the party's nominees for senate and
governor will face in raising money after the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is unfortunate,'' said James Larocca, a Democrat
seeking the nomination for governor. ``It can't help but overshadow
whatever last-minute attention the primary may be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser is to be attended by Clinton, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Tipper Gore. It will be the
first visit by the Clintons to a major city since he acknowledged
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New York candidates and their aides said Wednesday
night, they were now resigned, after a campaign in which they had
struggled to win public attention, to seeing the final hours of
their contests eclipsed by what is likely to be an unusually
prominent presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, the White House political director, said he had
fielded a series of calls from New York candidates upset about the
event. ``I told them that while we understood their concerns, the
same concerns get raised in every state in the country,'' Smith
said. ``You can't just shut down the fund-raising of these
committees. You just can't do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Green said Clinton's fund-raiser would directly compete with and
overwhelm a campaign fund-raiser he had planned for the same night
at the Upper West Side home of folk singer Peter Yarrow, of Peter,
Paul and Mary. The Democratic candidate for Senate did not attempt
to hide his exasperation when asked his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green sighed,'' Green said, speaking of himself in the third
person, ``and then said, given the number of Democrats with dollars
in the five boroughs, it's awkward but inevitable. It is not
perfect that the Clinton `Lion King' party is happening at the same
moment as my Peter, Paul and Mary party.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's assessment was echoed in harsher terms by aides in most
of the gubernatorial and senate campaigns, all of whom would speak
only on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of angering the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the hell are they holding a fund-raiser the night before
the primary?'' one said. ``Why do you want a story in the next
day's paper about Democrats raising money? We were shocked when we
heard this was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager of another statewide campaign said: ``This is not a
good development for anyone running statewide in New York. People
are very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   A state Democratic Party official added: ``It's the most
unbelievable, awful thing that you can imagine. It's a travesty. It
is everything that is wrong with politics in 1998. I don't think
the Republican National Committee would even consider doing
something like this.'
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's event is a joint fund-raiser involving the Democratic
National Committee, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee
and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. It is one of a
series of 12 to be held nationwide to raise money for the fall
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds will be divided equally among the three committees
and, presumably, some of that money will come back to New York. In
addition, because of complaints by Judith Hope, the New York
Democratic Chairwoman, the Democratic National Committee has agreed
to give the state committee 7.5 percent of the net proceeds from
fund-raisers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   National party leaders said the concerns voiced by New York
Democrats were unfounded, but they tried to minimize the fallout.
White House officials said the Clintons and the Gores had agreed to
return to New York in the months ahead to campaign on behalf of New
York candidates. Grossman said the Democratic National Committee
planned to give $300,000 in proceeds from the event immediately to
New York campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the party had settled on Sept. 14 because that was
the date that was offered them; it is a Monday, a night when
theaters are usually dark. ``This is one of the hottest shows of
the last decade,'' Grossman said. ``You take the date that they
give you and you work with it.''

N.Y. LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS TO ENDORSE PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York League of Conservation Voters, a
political action group that focuses on environmental issues, has
decided to back Gov. George Pataki in his re-election bid this
fall, the organization's leader said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group's decision to endorse the Republican incumbent before
a Democratic rival has been chosen was criticized by some of the
Democrats vying for the governorship. But Paul Elston, the chairman
of the directors of the conservation league, said Pataki's record
was ``so fantastic'' that there was no need to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four years, he's just delivered on one
environmental initiative after the other,'' Elston said Wednesday,
citing Pataki's support for the $1.75 billion Clean Water-Clean Air
Bond Act, a park on Manhattan's Hudson River shoreline and state
purchases of forested tracts upstate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the League of Conservation Voters endorsed Gov. Mario
Cuomo, while criticizing Pataki's record in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which is scheduled to formally announce its
endorsement Thursday in Manhattan, is a private political action
group that grades the environmental records of elected officials
and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have had a mixed relationship with Pataki,
with those focused on preserving open space closest to him, and
those focused on strengthening regulation of polluters more
critical.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has come under the sharpest criticism for shrinking the
budget of the Department of Environmental Conservation and reducing
the agency's emphasis on pollution enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The New York chapter of the Sierra Club has not decided to
endorse any candidate yet, said John Stouffer, the chief Albany
lobbyist for the group, adding that Pataki's mixed record made it
unlikely that he would receive the group's support. ``At this point
an endorsement of Pataki would be very difficult,'' Stouffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Elston said the conservation league's decision to support Pataki
was prompted by the governor's strong stand on issues like
requiring car manufacturers to offer some models that produce no
air pollution, and his commitment to expanding the state superfund
program.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, a Democratic candidate for governor, said Pataki's
environmental record did not deserve such praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the league is a fine organization, it's troubling that
they chose to ignore the sad reality of the Pataki administration's
environmental policies, such as the 51 percent decline in
enforcement penalties for environmental violations,'' Ragone said.
He was referring to a recent audit of the Department of
Environmental Conservation by Richard Brodsky, chairman of the
state Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, who has been
at odds with Pataki on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky also received an early endorsement from the League of
Conservation Voters.

L.A. COUNTY HOME VALUES UP 11 PERCENT TO SET '90s RECORD, SURVEY(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A resurgent real estate market pushed Los Angeles
County's home values to their highest level of the decade during
this year's second quarter, a just-released survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   Values in the county jumped 11 percent from the 1997 quarter,
said First American Real Estate Solutions, formerly Experian, an
Anaheim-based market tracker.
</P>
<P>
   The region is now among the nation's best markets, reflecting
its increased attractiveness to home buyers. ``Eleven percent is a
very respectable performance,'' said Nima Nattagh, First American's
research director.
</P>
<P>
   The local results helped boost home values in the nation's major
metropolitan areas by 9.5 percent during the April-June period, the
biggest jump this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The company's assessment of home values is based on a ``repeat
sales model,'' which tracks the resale value of homes that have
sold at least twice. Some analysts consider this method a more
accurate measure of the marketplace than focusing on average or
median prices recorded by real estate trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance by Los Angeles County came amid a surge
in values in other areas of California. Six of the eight areas in
which values jumped 10 percent or more are in the state, with
neighboring Orange County leading the way at 17.9 percent. First
American surveyed 36 markets.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and the Seattle area were the only non-California
markets to post double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the California picture was not entirely rosy. Although
the state's major urban centers have emerged as the nation's
hottest real estate markets, the state's housing recovery is spotty
and home values in some areas have not recovered ground lost during
the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Values in the Riverside-San Bernardino area and Sacramento also
have not yet shaken off the effects of the recession. The regions
are, respectively, 24 percent and 12 percent under their
pre-recession peaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if today's trends continue, then I think it is just a
matter of time before homeowners who bought at the peak of the
market recoup the equity losses they incurred throughout the
1990s,'' Nattagh said.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for the state's homeowners because for much of
the decade home values barely kept pace with inflation. But
double-digit gains in some parts of California have been the norm
since the last half of 1996, First American said.
</P>
<P>
   The steep gains in appreciation are being fueled by a strong
economy, with some key components being low unemployment, increases
in personal income and low interest rates. They have added up to a
buoyant housing market during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And now the supply of homes for sale is tightening, especially
in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley area, which will put more upward
pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, believes the gains in value could stimulate home building.
``It's a very strong signal that it's time to gear up the
home-building industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 new units will be built this year in California,
up 17 percent from 1997. Gibson said this figure could jump to
about 160,000 units next year, although that will not be enough to
satisfy demand and is far short of the 245,000 units built annually
between 1985 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   However, the current building pace is ``a massive improvement''
from 1993 and 1995, when only 84,000 units were built each year,
Gibson noted. Even in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when mortgage
rates approached 14 percent, home-building activity did not descend
to those levels.

REJECTED HMO CLAIMS, LATE PAYMENTS THREATEN DOCTORS' SOLVENCY,
GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A group of doctors and consumer advocates said
Wednesday that the company that processes claims of more than half
the state's 2.3 million health maintenance organization subscribers
has endangered the solvency of doctors and hospitals in the state
by denying claims and delaying payments.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they said that through a loophole in state law,
these companies that do nothing but process claims are not
themselves considered insurers and therefore are out of the reach
of state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the company that was the main target of the
anger, Allied Specialty Services, denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms of such companies, called ``third-party
administrators,'' came from an unlikely assemblage that included
doctors involved in the year-old effort to unionize physicians in
the state, leaders of the state's more traditional, 222-year-old
medical society and members of Citizen Action, the consumer group
that is usually critical of the profession's treatment of its
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But these groups seemed unified in their criticism of the
practices of Allied Specialty Services, the Florida-based company
that reviews, adjusts and pays claims for a range of medical
specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMOs have been practicing medicine without a license for years
through their interference with medical decisions made by
doctors,'' said Dr. Anthony Tonzola, president of the 700-member
Physicians Union, an affiliate of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers. ``With Allied Specialty Services,
they have gone one step further _ they're running an insurance
company without a license because of a loophole in state law.''
</P>
<P>
   The group announced its support of pending legislation that
would bring the third-party administrators under the orbit of state
regulators and insure prompt payment.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Sept. 8, new state regulations take effect that will
for the first time put teeth into enforcement of a prompt-payment
law that has been on the books since 1991, said Tom Breslin, a
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
Those regulations were the outgrowth of meetings last year with
critics of the current system.
</P>
<P>
   But those who participated in the meetings insisted that new
legislation is still needed to stiffen the resolve of state
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Tonzola and others charged that Allied Specialty Services had an
incentive to delay and deny claims because doing so allowed them to
invest, for longer periods of time, the money that the HMOs give
them to satisfy claims and thereby earn more on those investments.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Allied Specialty Services as well as the
association representing the state's 11 HMOs denied the charges,
saying that the doctors were either misinformed about the
arrangements between the HMOs and their claims processors or
blindly intent upon returning to the imperfect and costly practices
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the new world of health cost containment, said Dr. Lawrence
Schimmel, one of the founders of Allied Specialty Services,
improper billing is rife and the company has developed
sophisticated computer programs to weed out such mistakes and
possibly fraudulent claims.
</P>
<P>
   Schimmel also said that his company operated on a
fee-for-service basis in its contracts with four of the state's
largest HMOs and therefore did not benefit financially from holding
on to money from the insurers. It was the insurers themselves who
held the money until the claims were approved and checks cut, he
said. The company operates in 12 states processing 4 million claims
a year, Schimmel said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, there had been a number of complaints over the
last year from medical specialists, he said, who were claiming
higher fees for consultations than were allowed by the Health Care
Financing Administration, the federal agency whose fee codes set
the standard for the industry. The HMOs serviced by Allied are HMO
Blue, Prudential HMO, Cigna HMO and NYLCare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that the doctors in New Jersey don't like
the fact that we downgrade them when they can't submit
documentation supporting a higher level of payment,'' Schimmel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the HMOs, Paul Langenvin, president of the New
Jersey HMO Association, said that the charges by the groups were
without foundation. He said that the HMOs took full responsibility
and were subject to punishment based on the actions of the claims
processors with which they contract. Under the new regulations, he
said, they will have to pay properly documented claims in 60 days
or face a penalty of 10 percent a year.

WEST STAYING WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There will be no sabbaticals for Jerry West,
nor a premature retirement for the Lakers' chief architect. In
fact, he'll be guiding the team's fortunes well into the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   West, the Lakers' top basketball executive for 16 seasons, has
agreed to a contract extension in the four- to five-year range. The
upcoming season would have been the last under his current deal.
</P>
<P>
   West and team owner Jerry Buss were ironing out the final
details of the new pact Wednesday, and an announcement is expected
as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're close to getting it done,'' Lakers spokesman John
Black said. ``Jerry West is definitely coming back next year. He
and Jerry Buss are discussing an extension that will be addressed
if and when it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifics of the extension were not available, but the Riverside
Press-Enterprise reported Wednesday that West would earn $3.5
million a year _ about a $2 million raise.
</P>
<P>
   Just four months ago, West contemplated leaving the team, citing
stress. He insisted at the time money had nothing to do with his
decision, although there were reports Buss owed West $4 million in
bonuses that had been deferred but have since been paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wonderful year, but I can tell you that every
game I watched is like going to the dentist,'' West said in April.
``Sometimes, I say this is not good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Hall of Famer said he would not make any
decision until the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the NBA's lockout, West spent most of August
vacationing in Europe and on the East Coast. When he returned last
week, the new deal was quickly hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has implications far beyond the Lakers merely keeping
one of the top executives in pro sports under contract. It could
also guarantee that the Lakers' franchise players, Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant, remain with the team for the rest of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, whose contract is up next summer, and O'Neal, who can
opt out of his deal next year, had both said West's departure would
have an impact on their decisions. O'Neal, who has a close
relationship with West, said during the season that he would be
``upset... to the highest degree of upsetivity'' if West left for
any reason other than health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's agent Leonard Armato said West's new contract is good
news for the Lakers and his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted he's signed a long-term extension that
stabilizes the future of the Lakers quite a bit... and that a
master captain is going to be at the head of the ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armato declined to speculate how West's possible departure would
have affected O'Neal, but noted, ``Jerry means a lot to him. And
they both have tremendous respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   West, a Laker for most of his life, followed a 14-year,
Hall-of-Fame career as a player with a storied run as coach,
special consultant, general manager and executive vice president,
overseeing three NBA championships and seven Finals appearances.

EDITORIAL: A MISGUIDED MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is backing itself into a dangerous corner by showing
off its ability to make and market advanced weapons. Just two weeks
after U.S. intelligence agencies noticed construction work on an
underground complex suitable for developing nuclear bombs, North
Korea fired a missile into the Pacific beyond Japan. At that range,
the missile could reach U.S. bases in the Tokyo and Okinawa
regions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's reckless actions threaten the security of its
Asian neighbors and undercut Washington's hopes of providing
economic and humanitarian aid as a means to coax the North out of
its traditional isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the missile test is probably linked to next week's
inauguration of Kim Jong Il as president. But North Korea's
secretive decision-making has left American analysts guessing at
possible motives. Earlier this year the North signaled that it
might halt testing and exporting of missiles in exchange for
economic aid from the West, along the lines of the deal it agreed
to four years ago to freeze its nuclear weapons program in exchange
for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Its test-firing may be an effort to demonstrate the kind of
missiles it could sell if no deal were reached _ or a dramatic
advertisement courting just such future sales to nations like Iraq,
Libya and Pakistan. The North might even be building up its arsenal
for confrontation with South Korea, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   If the missile test is part of the North's bargaining strategy,
the rest of the world cannot be expected to respond positively.
Washington and its allies have delayed signing an agreement on
funds for the nuclear deal and Japan also plans to suspend food
assistance and talks on diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has tried to woo North Korea diplomatically for the
past several years because there is no attractive alternative. The
United States could defeat the North in a military showdown but
could not prevent it from killing hundreds of thousands of South
Koreans in vulnerable border areas like Seoul. The Clinton
administration reasonably calculates that if North Korean nuclear
weapons programs remain frozen, time is on the side of peaceful
political evolution toward more moderate policies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, the North can make the world a lot more
dangerous by developing and selling longer-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea remains committed to improving relations with the
North and sees the missile test as underlining the dangers of
keeping North Korea isolated. Keeping the North cut off from
Western aid, investment and trade, the argument goes, would make it
even more dependent on revenues from its missile exports.
</P>
<P>
   This line of reasoning has its limits. If North Korea seriously
wants U.S. recognition and economic cooperation, it cannot continue
to stir nuclear and missile fears. By its own actions, the North is
destroying its hopes for wider acceptance and assistance.

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm worried about myself,'' said Lanny Davis, the
ubiquitous former White House aide who may well defend Bill Clinton
until the last independent counsel dies. Normally you can find
Davis in Washington _ or in an NBC studio, actually, where he spent
more than 17 straight hours as a pro-Clinton talking head on the
day of the president's Monica Lewinsky speech. But on Tuesday Davis
got off the air long enough for coffee at the Royalton Hotel on
West 44th Street, before he hurried over to Simon &AMP; Schuster to
work out a book contract about his years in the First Bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be 10 rules on how to make bad news better,''
said Davis, whose tenure in the White House might not immediately
suggest that he is an expert on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is happy to explain. ``I'm going to reflect on my own
mistakes,'' he said, genially, ``in a White House that failed to
resist the impulse to hold things back.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 52, has returned to a partnership at Patton Boggs, the
powerful Washington lobbying law firm, where he earned $700,000 in
1996. His book contract with the Free Press, a Simon &AMP; Schuster
imprint, is in the low six figures. He and his second wife, Carolyn
Atwell, have a 5-month-old baby. His life is good. Nonetheless
Davis said he is concerned about his well-being because ``I have
pushed myself mentally and physically to a point where I think it
was beyond healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, Davis' doings on Aug. 17, the day of the
president's speech, which Davis describes as ``the culminating
point of a schedule where I had been doing shows virtually every
night and weekend for four or five months.''
</P>
<P>
   7 a.m.: The ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   9 a.m., 11 a.m., noon, 1 p.m., 3 p.m., 5 p.m.: MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   7:30 p.m.: CNBC's ``Rivera Live.''
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m.: MSNBC's Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m.: ``Rivera Live'' again.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 p.m.: Tom Brokaw on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m.: Olbermann again. ``I was on NPR while I was sitting on
the set waiting,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   (Time Magazine logged 81 appearances by Davis on network and
cable programs since January _ more than any other television
pundit.)
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's point of view, Davis is either an appalling
publicity hound or an admirable Clinton loyalist at a time when
their numbers are shrinking. There are two central questions about
his life: Does he not feel betrayed by a president who lied to his
staff and sent them out to cover for him for months? And why, if
Davis left the White House in January, is he still in the game?
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been answering the first question since Aug. 17. ``I
don't feel betrayed,'' he said. He says Clinton never directly told
him that he was innocent, as he did his Cabinet, other associates
and the nation. On Aug. 21, Davis said, Clinton called to thank
him. ``We had a private conversation about everything,'' Davis
said. ``He recognized what he had done was wrong. What he said to
me was sufficient, and I forgave him.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the second question, Davis said, is not a love of
seeing himself on television. ``If it's such self-aggrandizement,
how come nobody is doing it besides me?'' Davis said. ``It's what I
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has known the Clintons since he befriended Hillary Rodham
at Yale Law School. (``I was the married guy who a lot of the women
confided in about their male problems _ I was safe.'') He saw
Clinton as the only Democrat in 1992 who could win the presidency
when the Republican Party was gravitating toward the Christian
right. ``The issues of the Christian right scare the daylights out
of a lot of people, including me,'' said Davis, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Davis grew up in a liberal Democratic household in Jersey City,
N.J., with a father _ a dentist _ who taught him to read Murray
Kempton in Dorothy Schiff's New York Post. After Yale, Davis ran
twice for Congress from Montgomery County in Maryland and lost,
then briefly sold Amway products. ``My first wife was active in
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he remains a shameless salesman with an endearing streak.
Over his coffee, Davis lobbied heavily for mention of The Pawprint
Post, a small Maryland publication he supports that runs pictures
of homeless cats and dogs in hope of their adoption. Davis _ who
said he had taken no money for his television appearances _ said he
directed MSNBC to send the $2,500 fee for Aug. 17 to The Pawprint
Post. At home in Potomac, Md., he and his wife have seven cats and
two dogs. ``When the lady from the shelter shows up on my doorstep
and says, `If you don't take this kitten, we will have to put her
down,' what would you do?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis arrived at the White House in December 1996 as special
counsel to handle the press during the Senate investigation into
campaign fund-raising. He made $100,000 a year, and is
straightforward about why he left: because he thought the scandals
were over (he laughs), to spend time with his new baby, and to
stanch the flow from his savings account. ``We could have sold our
house, but we didn't want to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that he was now determined to cut back on his life as
a talking head, but that he had no regrets, even if his partners at
Patton Boggs ask ``all the time'' about his reasons. ``They want to
know if I'm sane or not,'' he said. ``I get a lot of calls from
people saying, `Are you all right?'''

COWBOYS' LETT BACK ON FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys defensive tackle Leon Lett practiced
yesterday for the first time in more than three weeks and probably
will be in the starting lineup when the Cowboys meet the Arizona
Cardinals in Sunday's season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he is 95 percent certain that
Lett, who sprained his left knee in a scrimmage against New Orleans
on Aug. 11, will play against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he felt good,'' Gailey said. ``Let us make the
decision on Sunday, but I'm optimistic he will play well over 50
percent of the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett is listed as questionable for the game. Second-year tackle
Antonio Anderson also will see time at Lett's tackle spot.
</P>
<P>
   Kavika Pittman also returned to practice yesterday. Pittman, who
has been hobbled the past three weeks by a sprained right ankle,
will start at weakside defensive end Sunday. Gonzalez is back The
Cowboys re-signed rookie free-agent Daniel Gonzalez to be the
team's third quarterback for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who was the No. 3 quarterback in training camp, was
released Saturday. His return became necessary when former Oilers
quarterback James Ritchey, whom the Cowboys claimed off waivers,
failed his physical.
</P>
<P>
   The turn of events made for an interesting two days for
Gonzalez, who drove home to Chesapeake, Va., Tuesday and had to
drive back to Irving yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hectic, but I'm glad to be back,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Gonzalez's spot is guaranteed only for this weekend
since the team will re-evaluate the third quarterback spot next
week. Briefly The Cowboys added center/guard Earl Scott to the
practice squad yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that Kevin Mathis will be the team's primary kickoff
returner against the Cardinals and that cornerback Deion Sanders
will handle punt returns. Either Billy Davis or Jeff Ogden will be
the other deep man on kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague, who will start in the nickel defense,
strained his left hamstring in practice yesterday and is listed as
day-to-day _ though the Cowboys' training staff won't have a
prognosis for Sunday's game until they re-evaluate Teague today.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones confirmed that he has talked to former Cowboys
running back Herschel Walker, but said no decision has been made on
whether Walker will return to the team. Jones said Walker would not
be signed before Sunday's game with the Cardinals.

COACHES' VOTES NEED TO GO PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beginning this weekend, a monumental event will
take place in the way teams are voted into one top 25 poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press has decided that it will release the
individual ballots of every voting member every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good start toward full disclosure by announcing the
sportswriters' opinions, because it prevents some yahoo in
Mississippi from going to bed early on Saturday night oblivious to
events on the West Coast. For years, the poll has been criticized
for its regional bias, especially against teams that didn't play in
the Midwest or East.
</P>
<P>
   But now that this problem has been solved, it's time to move on
to a more serious offender: The CNN/USA Today coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this group will ever make its votes public, you've
never met a coach.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, coaches are a paranoid and insecure lot. Besides,
exposing their votes might reveal the real process in how they
vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than a few simply let their sports information director, or
some other university lackey, cast the ballot. Most coaches hole up
in their office for 120 hours a week during the season. You think
they have time to see how Arizona will fare against Hawaii this
weekend?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the little issue of cronyism. Coaches have as many
cliques as an average episode of ``90210.'' It's not much of a
stretch to think a coach might put one of his ``dear old friends''
a couple of notches higher than, say, someone who ran the score up
on him a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You don't think more than a few coaches have held their nose
voting for Florida (and smug coach Steve Spurrier) the past few
years? Or enjoyed giving a break to everybody's buddy, Florida
State's Bobby Bowden?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Maybe not. It's the mere appearance of conflict that
makes releasing this information to the public critical.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it probably will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Check it out: South Carolina, Kentucky, Vanderbilt and Arkansas
run routine criminal background checks on recruits, according to
The State newspaper in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my integrity questioned, as well as my program,''
South Carolina coach Brad Scott said. ``I'm not going to let that
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas kicks ad: Lowly Kansas filmed a television commercial to
promote the sale of season tickets this summer. In the commercial,
kicker Joe Garcia is shown kicking a dog that is being ``held'' by
its owner. Of course, Garcia didn't kick the dog; it was all
editing and camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas chancellor Robert Hemenway wisely ordered the
commercial to be pulled from local television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Brain dead: It's usually an honor for a player and his school to
be pictured on the cover of a national football publication, but
San Diego State representatives are pained having to explain why
running back Tyrone Evans was pictured in some Athlon Western
region preseason magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing that Evans was only the Aztecs' third-leading
rusher last year with 163 yards, far behind Jonas Lewis'
team-leading 1,021. But it's quite another that Evans has only a
jail yard to run around for the next three years _ his recent
sentence after pleading no contest to 13 misdemeanor assault
charges.
</P>
<P>
   And, pending are felony assault charges after being accused of
assaulting a girlfriend who was seven months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Local watch: Former Hart High School wide receiver Soren
Halladay caught two touchdown passes in Brigham Young's preseason
scrimmage last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tact: Florida's Spurrier has been known to show his disgust
on the sidelines when his quarterbacks play poorly, but he says he
has learned to show more self-control. In fact, after seeing
Colorado's Rick Neuheisel angrily confront his quarterback on the
sidelines last year, Spurrier gave him some advice this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him those TV cameras are on you at all moments waiting
on you to yell at somebody,'' Spurrier said. ``He looked bad doing
it. I have learned to not look and yell at them if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier displayed how he stares at the ground and imitated what
he says when he's angry with a player: ``Doug, how can you be so
stupid?'' he said. ``It comes off much better that way instead of
getting in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching positions: USC isn't the only school moving
quarterbacks. Dan Kendra was the nation's top-rated quarterback
coming out of high school, and after three years as an understudy,
he was slated to be Florida State's starting quarterback against
Texas A&AMP;M on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   A spring practice knee injury ended those thoughts, as well as
his dreams of playing quarterback. Kendra, who is out for the
season, has now decided to play fullback next year.
</P>
<P>
   Less of Moore: It is looking less and less like All-Big Ten
safety Damon Moore will be in the lineup for top-ranked Ohio State
this season.
</P>
<P>
   A Ohio State administrator said Moore's eligibility is more
precarious than that of linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, who like Moore
is engaged in final examinations this week hoping to obtain the
requisite grades to meet Big Ten eligibility standards.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the patch? Colorado State announced its intention of
defecting from the WAC, effective June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And the 15th-ranked Rams left themselves open for interrogation
Saturday by playing Michigan State without the league's trademark
``WAC'' patch on their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has set off a furor within the conference, but
Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick blamed the mishap on new uniforms
and a new equipment manager. &QL;

A JERSEY SHORE TOWN'S HISTORY OF HARMONY FOR CHINESE AND ITALIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADLEY BEACH, N.J. _ Family after family, they flocked to this
tiny, tranquil Jersey Shore town from Mulberry Street in
Manhattan's Little Italy _ Italian-Americans hungry for a summer
escape from urban congestion.
</P>
<P>
   It started in the 1950s, and Anna Mingione was one of the
pioneers, spreading the word to neighbors in the city about the
fragrance of the sea, the glow of the sand, the family atmosphere
of the area. Then, one day in 1959, as Mrs. Mingione pushed a baby
carriage past a row of charming bungalows, she was startled to see
another familiar face.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sue Moy, her hairdresser from Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw her on the porch, and we said, `Look who's here!'''
Mrs. Mingione said, smiling at the memory. ``Then when we walked
around the corner, we saw more of our Chinatown neighbors. We can't
get away from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, Mrs. Mingione later discovered, actually beat the
Italians to Bradley Beach, having first made it their summer
address in the 1940s and '50s. And both groups remain firmly
entrenched here, with perhaps 200 people altogether coming each
weekend in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have coexisted at the beach in much the same way
they do in the city: keeping to themselves, focusing on family,
swelling with immigrant pride.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many ethnic groups that share urban neighborhoods
also tend to gravitate to the same vacation spots. But the fact
that two contiguous and occasionally adversarial groups in
Manhattan have established second identities in the same small
town, 60 miles away, on parallel streets, totally by accident, is a
serendipitous phenomenon of another order that even Neil Simon
couldn't dream up.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if strips of Chinatown and Little Italy had been
peeled off lower Manhattan and layered atop this town, turning Mott
Street into Newark Avenue and Mulberry Street into Park Place
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very strange that it happened that way, especially since
there was a lot of hostility between the two groups in the
generation before the first Bradley Beach generation,'' said Bruce
Edward Hall, who writes about the Bradley Beach experience in his
new book, ``Tea That Burns: A Family Memoir of Chinatown'' (The
Free Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you think about it, Bradley was homey, not fancy, and
family-oriented,'' Hall said. ``And both groups are territorial,
believe in the safety in numbers and are family-oriented. So they
are more alike than they might want to admit.''
</P>
<P>
   It started in the 1920s, when the Church of All Nations, a
Protestant church in lower Manhattan, began sending Chinese and
other immigrant children from their congregation to a boarding
house here called Cliff Villa for two weeks each summer. The
children loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of us, it was the first time out of the city,''
recalled Roberta Louie, one of five sisters in the Dong family to
stay at Cliff Villa. ``We went swimming, boating, walking,
everything. It was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one of Chinatown's most prominent families, the Lees of
Mott Street, found summer lodging in Bradley Beach. But there was
discrimination at first, said Grace Mok, a member of the Lee
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one lady said to me, `Does your father smoke
opium?''' Mrs. Mok said recently, sitting on her porch on Newark
Avenue. ``I was only a 10- or 11-year-old girl!''
</P>
<P>
   The Lees bought a small house on Newark Avenue for $2,000. And
by the 1950s, even after Cliff Villa was torn down, many Chinatown
families had begun to rent or buy cottages, mostly on Newark
Avenue. Some Chinese even began calling Bradley Beach Chinatown by
the Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese usually did not socialize outside their circle.
Hall noted in his book that the Chinese children usually avoided
the weekly dances that were staged in a pavilion on the boardwalk;
they were afraid, Hall wrote, that the white children would make
fun of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a self-contained community here, just as we did in
Chinatown,'' said Richard Hoe, Hall's uncle, who spent his
adolescence here during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who could not afford to travel to Bradley Beach knew
about its reputation as a beloved getaway tucked into an area less
than half the size of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the usual gossip is about taxes and real estate (a
bungalow now fetches up to $150,000). And it means unfurling beach
chairs and towels on the same spot on the beach, every weekend
(lined up, roughly, with the weathered Bingo hall on Ocean Avenue).
</P>
<P>
   ``People must think it's the Chinatown section,'' Tracey Seeto
Perri, 33, said with a laugh as she played on the beach with her
14-month-old son, Angelo. ``This is where the Chinese go.''
</P>
<P>
   This did not escape the notice of the year-round residents who
called Bradley Beach their permanent home. Rose Galassetti, an
ebullient woman who never met a friend she didn't hug, recalled
that Chinese children would often buy candy at Virgil's, her
family's variety store on Newark Avenue. And the post office once
delivered a letter to Norma Seeto, Tracey's mother, with only the
following address: Norma Seeto, Bradley Beach Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-American summer residents were equally adept at
clustering, staking a claim to Park Place Avenue, where the homes
are bigger than those on Newark Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Chinese-Americans, the Italian-Americans were
successful descendants of recent immigrants impressed by Bradley
Beach's laid-back grain. And like the Chinese-Americans, the
Italian-Americans first rented, then invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't stand the traffic to the Hamptons; it was too
far,'' said Russell Torraco, 69, a retired postal worker, whose
house on Park Place Avenue is across the street from his
daughter's.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, romance bloomed. The first summer the Mingiones were
in Bradley Beach, one of Mrs. Mingione's brothers met his future
wife. Another summer, another brother met his future wife. A
generation later, Mrs. Mingione's son and daughter met THEIR
respective spouses in Bradley Beach.
</P>
<P>
   These days, life is a raucous burst of spontaneity on Park Place
Avenue. People yell to friends across the street. People say hello
to strangers on the street. Children shout and play with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Margiotta, Torraco's son-in-law, was the quintessence of
bronzed, bare-chested friendliness on a recent weekend. Talking
with strangers on his porch, he offered drinks and beseeched his
wife, Lorraine, and brother-in-law, Nick, to join the conversation.
Fiddling with a cigar, he estimated that there were 15 extended
families in Bradley Beach with links to Little Italy _ all close
friends, all from the Mulberry Street area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the familiarity,'' said Margiotta, 42, who, when not
sunbathing, is a manager for Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   A few houses away, the Mingiones were preparing for a lavish
barbecue. Boys were driving toy jeeps and guiding remote-control
cars. Girls boasted about putting on their own Spice Girls concert
for the neighbors a few weeks back. (They sang seven songs. They
wore cool costumes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice for the kids,'' said Mrs. Mingione, 67, whose
father immigrated from Italy and toiled seven days a week for years
at a Little Italy pastry shop. ``When do you get the opportunity to
wake up with your cousins and grandparents?''

EDITORIAL: BILL CLINTON'S SHAKEN FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   In an elegant turn of phrase, Michael Wines of The New York
Times' Moscow bureau described the Clinton-Yeltsin summit meeting
as an event teetering ``on the slippery brink of self-parody.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of President Clinton's claim at a Moscow
press conference that he had adequately apologized for the Monica
Lewinsky affair. That view is not widely held among Democrats in
Congress or even within the White House staff, and Clinton's
comments are a troubling sign that he is still relying on outdated
reflexes in dealing with the Lewinsky crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been good at rallying himself and his followers
against powerful external enemies, be they health-care profiteers,
talkative mistresses or right-wing conspirators. By conjuring such
plotters, Clinton was always able to assume the mantle of
aggrievement and slip into his favorite campaign persona, that of
the resurgent victim.
</P>
<P>
   This personal archetype had a name, the Comeback Kid. But when
Clinton invokes that image these days, as he did in his universally
panned semi-confession, he skids toward self-parody. That is
because he is seen these days as the victim of his own bad judgment
and indiscipline, rather than as the victim of his rhetorical
rogues' gallery.
</P>
<P>
   As he resumes his White House schedule, the president has a
problem more serious than the condemnation of Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and the defection of House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt. He is a politician whose most loyal supporters have
fallen silent. He is the leader of a party whose high-risk
congressional candidates often decline to defend him in public and
then bash him in off-the-record conversations.
</P>
<P>
   This president's first problem is not winning over his enemies:
it is winning back his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Recent pieces by George Stephanopoulos in Newsweek and Dee Dee
Myers in Time have traced disaffection among loyalists. It may be
the stronger and more pervasive because his followers placed such
low demands on Clinton. The glue that bound his supporters to him
was the same as that which seemed to bind his marriage: a belief in
common values and policy goals. Under the terms of their pragmatic
contract, past lapses were forgiven and mendacity about them
excused as a political necessity. All that was required of Clinton
was that he not gamble with the common policy enterprise through
compulsive adventurism.
</P>
<P>
   He not only broke the contract with his staff and supporters. By
then attempting to blame Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for his
troubles, Clinton parodied his trademark blame game. Starr did not
clear Monica Lewinsky into the White House on 37 occasions. Neither
did Starr close the door to the Oval Office study. Those were the
acts of a president out of control and in the betrayal mode when it
came to the work and dreams that his supporters had entrusted to
him.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has conducted his exercise in
diplomacy-on-autopilot, here at home disappointment has taken deep
root among his followers.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as always, a gap between grass-roots and elite opinion
here. The public is tired of the Lewinsky story. The Democratic
professionals are tired of Clinton and jumpy about what will be in
Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So as he turns to the task of winning back his own party,
Clinton faces a problem common to all caught liars. The words that
availed in prior crises are no longer believable. A speech in the
voice of the resurgent victim will flop into overt self-parody as
quickly as if written by Jay Leno's staff. Clinton's best hope is
to throw away the blame script and switch to contrition. But can
he?
</P>
<P>
   It is a problem contemplated by a distinguished citizen of
Clinton's home region. William Faulkner believed that the most
riveting of human dramas was ``the human heart in conflict with
itself.'' As this vacation ends and the nation turns to the work
that September always brings, what was true in Yoknapatawpha County
will be true at the White House as well.

IN N.Y. GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE, DEMOCRATS SOUND LIKE ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ With remarkable unanimity, the Democratic
candidates for governor attacked Republican Gov. George Pataki on
the state budget, job growth, education and campaign finance in a
debate here Wednesday night, treating one another more like chums
than like adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   In a hint of the shifting fortunes of the campaign, none of the
other candidates overtly attacked Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross or
asked her any questions, as they did in previous debates when she
was clearly considered the front-runner. In forums held last month,
they demanded that she explain positions she had taken just a few
years ago as a Republican, often leaving her struggling for a
response.
</P>
<P>
   What went unmentioned in Wednesday night's hourlong event,
however, was the recent talk of the campaign: the apparent disarray
in Ms. McCaughey Ross' camp. She spent much of the day denying
reports that her campaign manager, Michael Nussbaum, had been
ousted, and refusing to answer questions about whether she intended
to launch a long-awaited television advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be making a statement about my campaign finances
tomorrow,'' she told reporters after the debate at Hudson Valley
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ms. McCaughey Ross, the other contenders were New York
City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Brooklyn District Attorney
Charles Hynes and James Larocca, a businessman and former state
transportation commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's debate wa the sort of exchange that
candidates claim to want: a polite, serious discussion of issues.
But it failed to inject any fire into a race that so far has not
received much voter attention. The event, sponsored by the League
of Women Voters and public television, will be broadcast statewide
Thursday night on public television.
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic attacks on the governor came about his
handling of state spending and borrowing, which have increased
sharply, with all four Democrats claiming that they would be more
fiscally responsible than Pataki, an avowed conservative. They also
charged that the governor had done little for the anemic upstate
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at the possibility of significant budget cuts
as early as next spring,'' Larocca said. ``Today in New York, there
is no economic development plan. There isn't even a plan to make a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, whose standing in some polls has risen at Ms. McCaughey
Ross' expense, referred to the fact that the state had begun this
fiscal year with a $2.4 billion surplus but now projects large
deficits in two years. ``When you take that surplus and turn it
into an admitted $5.5 billion deficit in a few years,'' he said,
``that is the height of irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his call for a state law giving preference to New
York businesses in government contracting, similar to a measure
Pataki vetoed this year. That idea has been called into question by
some economists, and none of the other Democrats have advocated it.
</P>
<P>
   The only real note of disagreement came in the area of campaign
finance reform. Vallone, Hynes and Larocca advocated measures like
strict contribution limits, public financing of campaigns and a ban
on ``soft money,'' the unlimited contributions to parties,
ostensibly for organizational needs. They noted that Pataki had
proved to be a master of the current fund-raising system, which
they charged has put state government in the service of wealthy
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   But Larocca took Vallone to task for taking contributions from
people who do business New York City, saying that the practice
should be banned.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McCaughey Ross, whose own campaign treasury is provided
almost entirely by her husband, investment banker Wilbur Ross,
would only say that she favored banning contributions by anyone
with a business interest before the state. She refused to say
whether she supported tighter contribution limits, a ban on soft
money, public financing of campaigns, or any other measure.
</P>
<P>
   All four candidates lauded the higher high school graduation
standards adopted recently by the Board of Regents. But they agreed
that the schools were not ready to meet those standards, and
advocated an expansion of school programs for the youngest
children, and after-school programs for older students.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates agreed that patients should have the right to sue
their health insurers, something now denied by state law. And all
said that many drug offenders should be sent to rehabilitation
programs, not prison.
</P>
<P>
   The only attack on the lieutenant governor came from Larocca, in
discussing health care. He said that patients would be better off
``if the conservative right wing hadn't trashed the national health
care program'' proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to Ms. McCaughey Ross, who first gained
fame critiquing the Clinton plan. But Larocca did not mention the
lieutenant governor by name.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ms. McCaughey Ross was trying to focus on the debate,
she and her aides were besieged with questions about the status of
her campaign. Several people close to the campaign said Nussbaum, a
top adviser to the campaign, had not spoken to Ms. McCaughey Ross
or spent time at her campaign headquarters since last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Ms. McCaughey Ross, said that
Nussbaum had left only for a few days to take his son to school in
Boston, and that he was still ``giving us tremendous advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But others close to the campaign said that Nussbaum's absence
was provoked by the disagreement between Ms. McCaughey Ross and her
husband over financing for the campaign. They point out that
Nussbaum is closer to Ross than he is to Ms. McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Nussbaum is an executive at News Communications, a company owned
by Ross, and is not paid for his work on the campaign, Davitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has provided more than $3 million to his wife's campaign,
but hardly any of it has been spent. People close to the campaign
said that Ms. McCaughey Ross had been trying to persuade her
husband in recent days to spend the money on advertising, but that
he was reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   With the Sept. 15 primary less than two weeks away, Ms.
McCaughey Ross has begun talking privately about spending her
personal savings on advertising, they said.

 &HT;    Johnson, Astros tough on Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy Johnson held up his end of the bargain. Greg Maddux had
his right arm gnawed off at the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros bashed Maddux for 10 hits, including three
home runs, to take a 4-2 victory over the Braves Wednesday night in
a game billed for pitching brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, in his first start against Atlanta since being acquired
by Houston July 31, gave up a run in the first and shut out of the
Braves on three hits through eight innings, striking out 10, to
improve to 6-1. He left with leg cramps in his left leg after
batting in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (17-7) gave up 10 hits for the second time in three
starts to fall to 5-5 in the second half. He threw only one hitless
inning before exiting after the seventh with three strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched the 9th for Houston, allowing Andruw Jones'
25th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won the season series against Atlanta five games to
four, the first time they've taken the Braves since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's third homer belonged to Sean Berry, who hit Maddux's
first pitch of the seventh inning over the center field wall for a
4-1 lead. Maddux had gone the first 392 starts of his career
without giving up a three-homer game and now has done it twice in
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio gave Houston a 3-1 lead in the fifth, when he
homered to left with Brad Ausmus on second. The homer was Biggio's
19th of the season but the first of his career against Maddux in 83
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell tied it 1-1 with a lead-off homer in the second,
when the Astros recorded four hits but scored just once. Maddux
received a huge break when Moises Alou, who had doubled behind
Bagwell, was hit by Berry's grounder as he attempted to take third
base.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones was Maddux's greatest ally in the early going. When
Ricky Gutierrez sent a sinking single into center in the first
inning, Jones missed with a diving attempt, but still got up in
time to throw out Gutierrez when he attempted to take second. Jones
then assisted on a double play in the third, when Biggio took off
on a hit and run with Derek Bell at the plate. Jones ran down
Bell's line drive and then rifled a throw back to first to
double-off Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might have gift-wrapped the Braves first run, when he
walked Gerald Williams on four pitches in the first. Williams stole
second, made third on a passed ball by catcher Ausmus and then came
in for a 1-0 lead on Javy Lopez's RBI single. The single gave Lopez
a career-high 11-game hitting streak and gave him eight RBI in five
games.

McGWIRE'S CAP PUTS RESTAURANT ON MAP 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest thing on the grill at The Abbey, a small restaurant
in Seal Beach, Calif., is Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Not a ``Mark McGwire Sandwich'' or ``Mark McGwire Special'' or
dare we say? ``Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Mark McGwire himself, whose dramatic pursuit of Roger
Maris' home run record has put The Abbey (306 Main St.) squarely on
the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been absolutely amazing,'' said Rob Burdick, manager of
The Abbey, which his brother, Mike, opened only little more than a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's all because McGwire, when he sits down to face the press
night after night, has taken to wearing caps emblazoned with ``The
Abbey, Seal Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from people all over the country,'' said Burdick.
``I've had hundreds of calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lady from Johnson City, Tenn., called (Wednesday) morning.
She wanted to buy some caps. A guy from New York called. He'd been
to Seal Beach and he wanted a cap. A fellow from St. Louis had been
out here on vacation. He wanted a cap. I even got a call from a guy
on a ship who was on his way here and wanted to make sure I saved
him a cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day we had caps we sold out, all 50. I had to order
some more.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what is it with Mark McGwire, soon-to-be (?) home run king,
and The Abbey?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to know Mark at our other restaurant, Tsunami (17236
Pacific Coast Highway), in Seal Beach,'' Burdick said. ``Robb Nen
(a relief pitcher with the Giants who grew up in neighboring Los
Alamitos) is a good friend of mine and, through him, I got to know
Mark, who lives close by (in Huntington Harbour). We talk, maybe,
one, two times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with Mark wearing a Tsunami cap ... but that's
all that's on it, Tsunami. So, when I was in Chicago a couple of
weeks ago, when the Cardinals were there, I brought along a whole
supply of caps from The Abbey.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, The Abbey is keeping close tabs on McGwire's home run
pace. Sometimes it's a little taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a `Big Mac Meter' in the front window,'' Burdick
said, ``and (Tuesday night), when he hit those two homers, I'd just
put up No. 56 and - bang - he hit No. 57. Fifty-six wasn't up there
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy,'' Burdick
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who could sitting there in front of millions
(watching on television) wearing a Nike cap, but instead he's
wearing one from a little restaurant in Seal Beach.''

CORYATT, HALEY ON JONES' LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
and CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Charles Haley is talking to the Cowboys about
coming out of retirement, and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he
would expand his checkbook in an attempt to sign former Colts
linebacker Quentin Coryatt.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Haley, who would still have to pass a physical, nor
Coryatt, who was released by the Colts last week, would be signed
in time for the Cowboys' season opener against the Arizona
Cardinals on Sunday, Jones said. But Jones is expected to talk with
both players before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles has definitely decided to play,'' Jones said of Haley,
who retired because of back injuries in July 1997, but would come
back as a pass-rush specialist. ``This is interesting. I'm anxious
to sit down and see what his thoughts are. I'd like to sort through
(Haley's thoughts) a little more and see what's best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would be the second team to consider adding Haley to
their roster. Haley worked out with the San Francisco 49ers on
Tuesday, but the 49ers decided not to sign the defensive end who
played with them from 1986-91.
</P>
<P>
   After looking at a magnetic resonance imaging exam of Haley's
back, 49ers vice president Dwight Clark told the San Francisco-area
media during a news conference yesterday that, ``his back looked
pretty bad. It didn't look like he'd be able to practice much, or
play the 15 plays a game that we would want. His workout was a lot
better than his exam. But we decided the best thing for us is if we
pass at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the situation said Haley did not flunk the
49ers' physical, but other factors led to the club passing on him.
Haley had a rancorous relationship with the 49ers in his six
seasons there.
</P>
<P>
   In going after Coryatt, Jones also confirmed that he would be
getting into a bidding war with several teams and was prepared to
make him the highest-paid linebacker in club history. Coryatt
worked out with the Chicago Bears yesterday and also has received
interest from the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we signed (Coryatt), we would break the mold for what we've
traditionally paid linebackers,'' Jones said of Coryatt, who was
scheduled to make $2.3 million in 1998. In terms of base salary,
the Cowboys have never paid a linebacker more than the $750,000
they paid Darrin Smith in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who was a roommate of Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith at
Texas A&AMP;M, worked out at Valley Ranch during the off-season and
knows many Cowboys players. Jones said the club would use Smith's
relationship with Coryatt to woo the seventh-year linebacker, who
was the second overall pick of the 1992 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes it here,'' said Smith, who spoke with Coryatt
yesterday. ``He just wants to be in a good situation. But our
friendship won't be the deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to sign Haley, 34, began last weekend. Haley told
Cowboys officials that he wants to play again and asked Jones to
officially release his rights. The Cowboys, Jones said, did not
immediately show an interest in Haley, who was the club's most
consistent pass rusher from 1992 until back problems sacked him for
much of the 1996 season. He had 34 sacks during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Haley flew to San Francisco on Tuesday, when he worked out for
49ers coaches and scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked pretty good,'' 49ers defensive coordinator John
Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   If he passes a physical and the Cowboys sign him, Haley would
probably be used in obvious passing situations. The Cowboys have
struggled rushing the passer this summer. Defensive ends Greg Ellis
and Kavika Pittman did not have a sack during five exhibition
games.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, meanwhile, would likely be an every-down player. He
played primarily strong-side linebacker in Indianapolis, and his
presence probably would allow Cowboys coaches to move Randall
Godfrey inside to compete with starting middle linebacker Fred
Strickland. The team had considered moving Godfrey to middle
linebacker in training camp until Broderick Thomas suffered a
season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys restructured quarterback Troy Aikman's contract
Tuesday to help the club get under the league-limit $52,388,000
salary cap. Of the Coryatt and Haley deals, Jones said, ``One
wouldn't effect the other.''

JAYHAWKS' COACH LOOKING TO PROVE HIMSELF OFFENSIVELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Allen proved he could make the transition from coaching
Division I-AA to Division I-A. Now, he hopes to get the chance to
demonstrate his ability as an offensive coach.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Northern Iowa, Allen took over at Kansas last
season. He inherited a team few thought was capable of a winning
record. The Jayhawks finished 5-6, losing their final two games to
fall out of contention for a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sophomore years can be scary years,'' Allen said. ``I'm not
trying to stab anybody in the back, but we weren't left with a
plethora of players. Now, we're just trying to get the ball moving
with the guys we recruited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be a better football team, but whether our record will
be better, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   At Northern Iowa, Allen's teams were known for their
high-scoring offense. Last season, the Jayhawks finished last in
the nation in total offense with 241.4 yards per game. Kansas won
five games despite averaging 16.1 points per game. The offensive
output was the Jayhawks' worst in more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 112 is a motivation for us,'' running back Mitch Bowles
said. ``It affects our pride. We want to go out and prove it won't
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen is counting on 10 returning starters on offense, a
stronger offensive line and junior quarterback Zac Wegner to boost
the team's offense. In their last three games, the Jayhawks
averaged 353 yards and 27 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You finish last in the nation and nobody has expectations for
you. That can be a positive thing,'' wide receiver Michael Chandler
said. ``The offense was new for us last year. We had young guys.
But if you look at it, our stats improved late in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who replaced Glen Mason who took the job at Minnesota,
has, if nothing else, improved the Jayhawks' attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is together,'' offensive lineman Justin Glasgow
said. ``It used to be hard to get in touch with (coach Mason.) It
seems coach Allen is always around a lot of places and
communicating with the players.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Allen is a players' coach who can motivate people and
get them ready to play,'' linebacker Pat Brown said. ``He's always
talking with the players and asks us to let him know how we're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Kansas won four of its first five games. This
season, the Jayhawks need another fast start. They open the season
Saturday against Oklahoma State, and then play at rival Missouri on
Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's biggest concern is a lack of depth, so he decided it was
best to play two conference games at the beginning of the season
when his team was most likely to be at full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled at the end of the season, so we might have lost
some of the confidence we might have had,'' Allen said. ``But I
think we've got some confidence going into the second year. We're
light years ahead of where we were a year ago at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we all got to know each other. What we expect in
certain situations, what dictates success and failure. I think all
the players are headed in the same direction, and that's a big
positive.''

ROUGH ROAD FAMILIAR POSITION FOR NORTH TEXAS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Looking back, Darrell Dickey had the world at
his fingertips in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He only had to sign his name to grab hold.
</P>
<P>
   A letter of intent lay before him, a pledge to follow his dad
and play for Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about to become the quarterback for a football team that
wasn't winning very many games, that my father was the head coach
of,'' Dickey said, ``and I don't think I had any idea how hard that
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, Dickey is the first-year head coach of a
North Texas team that hasn't won very many games lately, 11-of-33
since moving up to Division I-A in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time around, Dickey knows exactly how hard it is going
to be, and still he says, it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say that knowing everybody is going to laugh and think `He's
crazy,' '' Dickey said. ``Well, when I arrived at Kansas State, if
I said that, I'd have been crazy, too, and now, they're talking
about having a shot at a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   UNT has smaller goals, trying to win any games it can against a
brutal schedule, invigorating a stagnant alumni base and generating
revenue. To do so, Dickey has borrowed from a plan his father
implemented upon his arrival at Kansas State _ recruit locally,
think long term and improve every year.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Kansas State and North Texas are
startling.
</P>
<P>
   When Dickey's father, Jim, was hired as the head coach at Kansas
State in 1978, the program recently had been through two
probations, never been to a bowl game and hadn't won a Big Eight
Conference game in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Dickey said he figured he'd change all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the good things about Darrell, he wasn't
afraid of anything,'' recalls TCU coach Dennis Franchione, then, an
assistant at Kansas State under Jim Dickey. ``Sometimes we felt he
needed to be afraid of some things. He wasn't afraid of a challenge
though, and certainly Kansas State didn't have a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who can say they knew Dickey when he was just Darrell
Ray, they would expect nothing less. He was the kid afraid of
nothing. The quarterback from North Carolina with the curly
golden-blond hair, and a golden arm to match, wasn't afraid of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a better example than the Missouri game in 1979?
Dickey was just a redshirt freshman, and he got his first start for
Kansas State on a cool, autumn day in Columbia. He led a 27-point
underdog Wildcats squad to a 19-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that day Dickey made his first big impression on
current UNT athletic director Craig Helwig, who would choose him as
head coach nearly 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that game a lot when I decided on a coach,''
said Helwig, who was an assistant AD at Kansas State when Dickey
played. ``I think the thing that always stands out in my mind is he
always found a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey threw for 4,098 yards and 23 touchdowns in four years at
Kansas State, saving his best for his final season. He passed for a
personal-best 1,225 yards and eight touchdowns, and led Kansas
State to an Independence Bowl berth in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was vindication. We were the whipping boys of the Big Eight
for a long time. There were a lot of 58-6s and 48-0s getting
there,'' said Rusty Hill, the backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   They held a party for him recently, 40 or 50 former Kansas State
teammates from all over the country who came to Kansas City to
celebrate Dickey becoming UNT's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was there. Steve Willis showed, the kicker who to this
day can see the look on Dickey's face as he returned to the huddle
after being drilled by Arizona State linebacker Vernon Maxwell in
1982. Oh, and offensive lineman Amos Donaldson was there, too. He
was Dickey's first roommate in college, the one who helped him ring
up almost $300 in cheeseburgers on Jim Dickey's country-club tab
one month.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing they agreed on was that Dickey is a perfect
fit for UNT, because he has been there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Darrell Ray (took the job) because he has been in that
situation before, and he knows what it takes,'' former Wildcats
teammate Mark Mackey said. ``He has a way of making everybody
believe the impossible can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guys hadn't seen Dickey since those days, although
they had kept up with his career. They knew he had held assistant
positions at UT-El Paso, Louisiana State, Mississippi State and
Memphis through the years. He spent last season as the offensive
coordinator at SMU, helping a struggling Mustangs program to its
first winning season since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not coached any place where you walk in and they were
like `Are y'all going to the Orange Bowl or the Rose Bowl?' ''
Dickey said. ``I haven't been there. Where I've been is: `Let's get
on our feet. Let's get over the hump.' ''
</P>
<P>
   UNT has a huge hurdle to overcome, and that's Dickey's
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun, and I say that knowing everybody knows
the odds are stacked against me,'' Dickey said. ``If you make the
decision to do it, you better let it rip and approach it like you
are not scared, because if people sense you are scared they become
scared.''

CONTRACT EXTENSION CLOSE FOR HITCHCOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said yesterday that he
is close to terms on a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which would likely keep him under contract with the
team for the next three years, would increase his tenure as one of
the most senior coaches in the NHL with the same team. Hitchcock
will soon begin his third full season as head coach, ranking fifth
behind Scotty Bowman of Detroit, Ron Low of Edmonton, Larry
Robinson of Los Angeles and Paul Maurice of Carolina in the 29-team
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful it will get done in the next day or two, and that
would be something that for myself and my family would be
fantastic,'' Hitchcock said. ``There are a lot of good coaches in
the NHL who have been a good coach for three or four teams. But I
always wanted to see myself as a good coach of one team.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over for general manager Bob Gainey, who gave up
his dual roles, on Jan. 8, 1996, Hitchcock has a 112-71-24 record
in the regular season. Last season, he led the Stars to the
Presidents' Trophy for best regular-season record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   He finished second in the voting for the Jack Adams Award (NHL
coach of the year) in 1996-97 and finished third last season. He
was voted coach of the year by ``The Sporting News'' and ``The
Hockey News'' in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, 46, got into coaching at the midget ranks in
Edmonton, Alberta, and has worked himself up through the lower
levels before coaching the Stars' minor-league affiliate in
Kalamazoo, Mich. He said spending five years in the Stars'
organization has helped him appreciate what Gainey and owner Tom
Hicks are building.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's being built here is a commitment to winning, and you
always want to be a part of that,'' he said. ``This means a lot to
me. It means they believe in me as a coach and as a person.'' &QL; 
LIND GONE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left winger Juha Lind is close to signing a contract in Europe
and will not play for the Stars this season, his agent, Don
Baizley, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lind, 23, played in 15 of the Stars' 17 playoff games last
season and had seemingly worked himself into a regular position on
the team. But when the Stars refused to offer the restricted free
agent a ``one-way'' contract that would help keep him from playing
in the minor leagues, Lind decided it would be best to stay in
Europe, Baizley said.
</P>
<P>
   Lind is talking with Jokerit in his native Finland, as well as
teams in the Swedish and German leagues. As a restricted free
agent, he remains the Stars' property in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that he stays over there for only one year and
returns to the NHL,'' Baizley said. ``We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have an abundance of left wingers fighting for a
regular spot, including Jamie Langenbrunner, Dave Reid, Brent
Severyn, Jamie Wright, Dave Roberts and either Brett Hull or Jere
Lehtinen.

REPORTERS EXPLAIN LEWINSKY QUESTIONS IN KREMLIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The two reporters who questioned President Clinton on
the Lewinsky matter Wednesday at the Kremlin both said that they
had raised the matter because they were frustrated by the lack of
opportunity to question Clinton about it since his speech to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Santos, 40, who has covered the White House for 10 years
for United Press International, said she felt compelled to question
Clinton because it was her first chance since the Aug. 17
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen him,'' Ms. Santos said. ``We have not had the
opportunity to seek amplification. But we also wanted to know his
reaction to the fallout from his televised address and whether he
felt it was inhibiting his ability to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   The other reporter, Laurence McQuillan, 53, a Reuters
correspondent who has covered the White House for most of the past
22 years, said he had been considering a Lewinsky-related question
to the president for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case,'' he said, ``I really wanted to ask a question
about Russia, but when I heard his response to the first question
about Lewinsky I thought it was so inadequate that I had to ask
mine. One, because we knew the press conference was going to be
short. And there was no one who can tell you when the next time
reporters will be near Bill Clinton again.''

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ The clerk at the Golden Island
cash-for-gold shop peered at the front door from behind
bullet-proof glass for a long minute before buzzing in the small,
solitary woman waiting outside. It was 2:30 in the afternoon.

   ``Yes? What do you want?'' he said in a thick Russian accent,

   There seems to be little tolerance for browsing at the
cash-for-gold stores around the casinos. The cash-for-gold stores
are just about the only local businesses that have thrived since
the city started tearing down buildings to make way for gambling 20
years ago, and they are braced for the worst kind of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 cash-for-gold shops on Atlantic and Pacific Avenues, the
resort's main streets, all keep their doors locked and their gold
and their clerks sealed away behind windows. Many of the stores
have a public space no bigger than a bathroom stall. They allow one
customer in at a time, making desperate gamblers wait outside in
the thick of night even though all the cash and gold in the little
stores are behind half-inch-thick Plexiglas and steel partitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, after two attacks on storekeepers, it looks as though
the worst trouble has arrived. Three weeks ago, there was an
attempted robbery at City Jewelers, a cash-for-gold store on
Pacific Avenue. The 21-year-old proprietor, Alex Kotlyarenko, was
stabbed several times in the chest, neck and stomach. He lived to
tell about it, and the police have a warrant for a suspect, Huy T.
Luong, 30, of Jersey City. But on Friday, there was another
assault, believed to be unrelated, and Andrei Dvoriantchikov, the
38-year-old owner of Resort Jewelers on Atlantic Avenue, didn't
pull through.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot three times, in the mouth, heart and stomach, by
someone he had let into his inner office.
</P>
<P>
   The police say robbery may be a motive in that case, too. But by
Tuesday afternoon, rumors had spread that Dvoriantchikov had been
executed in classic Russian mob fashion. The police will not
discuss that possibility, and in any case it appears to have done
little to ease the anxieties of the mostly Russian and Asian
immigrant shopkeepers in the cash-for-gold stores.
</P>
<P>
   Five shopkeepers who were approached along Atlantic Avenue
refused to talk about the latest killing. At one, the clerk, who
was from Russia, brandished a copy of the local newspaper, The
Press of Atlantic City. He gestured to an article that suggested
the shooting of Dvoriantchikov was a mob hit. ``You don't worry,''
he said. ``The story is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it isn't. Even if the assailants in both incidents
are caught, what has happened has cast a new spotlight on the shady
world of jewelry buyers. No one paid much attention to the stores
before; they were just another consequence of gambling. But now,
they look like real problems. They have raised questions about
whether the Russian mob might be involved in the cash-for-gold
business. They also have other shopkeepers publicly worrying about
getting caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   The recent crimes have also pointed out the distinction between
pawnbrokers and cash-for-gold shops (which are listed under
``jewelry buyers'' in the Yellow Pages). Most people think they are
the same, which bothers pawnbrokers no end.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional pawnshops, which lend customers money and hold their
valuables as collateral, charging 3 percent interest a month, are
``bankers to the poor,'' says Martin Wood, owner of Wood's Money to
Loan on Atlantic Avenue. ``Cash-for-gold stores, on the other hand,
buy a customer's jewelry outright, and sell them back to them at a
20 percent markup or, after 15 days, to whoever cares to buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral distinction may be lost to most people. ``But it's a
big difference,'' said Wood, a fourth-generation broker. ``Once a
cash-for-gold store buys your jewelry,'' he said, ``you have no
claim to it.''
</P>
<P>
   His store, one of two pawnshops in Atlantic City, is much larger
than the cubicles the cash-for-gold stores operate, but no less
secure. He and his assistant sit behind bulletproof glass. Signs on
the front windows warn people they are being videotaped. Inside,
there are more cameras and a sign warning ``Guard Dogs on Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been security conscious,'' Wood said, ``but I'm
not too worried about what's happened recently. I'm a 9 to 5
business. Those cash-for-gold places run till 2 a.m. That's their
world.''

59 DOWN, 2 TO GO FOR MCGWIRE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Mark McGwire, who hit two home runs on Tuesday night,
made it Nos. 58 and 59 against the Florida Marlins on Wednesday
night, putting him only two short of tying Roger Maris'
single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit No. 58 in the seventh inning. It came on a low,
inside 2-1 curveball from right-hander Brian Edmondson, the ball
sailing over the left-field fence and carrying an estimated 497
feet.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire knew it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Cardinals first baseman took several steps out of
the batter's box, then pumped his right arm as he watched yet
another home run fly out of Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third-longest home run at this stadium, behind Andres
Galarraga's 529-footer and McGwire's 500-footer, both last season.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth inning, McGwire hit Rob Stanifer's first pitch, a
fastball, into the left-center-field seats, an estimated 458 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Both homers Wednesday came with one man on base and brought
standing ovations from the crowd of 45,170 _ the largest of the
season here _ and curtain calls from McGwire as the Cards trounced
the Marlins, 14-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, the Cubs' Sammy Sosa hit homer No. 56 at Wrigley
Field in Chicago's 4-2 win over the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire moved past Jimmie Foxx, who hit 58 homers in 1932, and
Hank Greenberg, who hit 58 in 1938, and McGwire eclipsed the 58
that he hit last season, 34 for Oakland and 24 for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   And he pulled even with Babe Ruth, who had 59 homers in 1921. He
is now one behind Ruth's 60-homer season of 1927 as he takes aim at
Maris' mark of 61, set in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In his first three plate appearances, McGwire grounded into a
double play and walked twice.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked McGwire's eighth multihomer game of the season.
The team has 23 games left to play, and McGwire seemed to
understand that he was now an odds-on favorite to break Maris'
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole month of the season left,'' he said. ``There's
a great, great possibility that there's going to be two or three
guys. I wouldn't rule out Ken Griffey. I mean, this man is going to
get hot.''

NORTHRIDGE'S GOLDEN RISES ABOVE TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Jeremy Golden wears his tribute to his
father on his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he has a tattoo of an eagle, but it doesn't
resemble an eagle. Instead, it's a sketch, and you have to use your
mind to fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   This is significant. Golden, a Cal State Northridge defensive
back, lost his father, Mike, in a construction accident when he was
6. Golden's memories are sketchy 13 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a way to remember his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have someone watching over my shoulder,'' he said.
``I wouldn't mind my dad watching with eagle eyes. Those are the
best eyes to have, right?''
</P>
<P>
   And Golden really needs someone to watch over him. He seeks
thrills in BMX bicycle racing, skateboarding, snowboarding,
waterskiing and wakeboarding. Next up is motorcycling, rugby and
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Mountain is lame now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's into zanier things, as he has a pierced tongue. Out of
respect for his mother's wishes, Golden waited until he was 18 to
have his tongue pierced and shoulder tattooed.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Kim Bourdon, suspects Mike wouldn't have approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom wouldn't let me,'' Jeremy said. ``I do everything that
keeps me on the edge. I love all the extracurricular activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite pastimes is football. While he is the first
in his family to play, he goes at it with a gusto that would make
his father proud.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot, 180-pound sophomore will be one of four returning
defensive starters in the Matadors' season opener Saturday at Boise
State. Last year as a freshman, he started the second game, at
Hawaii, and returned an interception 65 yards for a touchdown _
after he dislocated a shoulder. He finished the season with 65
unassisted tackles, 19 assisted tackles and four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the Hawaii game that earned him attention. Only then
did everyone become aware of his off-the-field antics. Couple that
with his frame and it's easy to see why Northridge coach Ron
Ponciano says Golden ``is not your prototype at that position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at (wide receiver James) Maldonado. He's built,''
Ponciano said. ``(Fellow DB) Vito Clemente's got some bumps on his
body. He passes the eyeball test. Jeremy doesn't pass the eyeball
test. For one, he rides skateboards.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ponciano discovered Golden recently broke his board, he
said, ``I bet it's a devastating thing in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden laughed, but it's clear losing his father was the
toughest. Mike was crushed when beams 11 stories high came crashing
down with him on it.
</P>
<P>
   Golden stayed away from school for three weeks and didn't want
to return because he feared everyone asking him about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea why my teacher asked me to stand up and talk
about it because I was bawling,'' he said. ``I asked why it had to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the man who used to let Golden take off his
construction boots after a long day. Jeremy said Mike always
promised his feet smelled like strawberries. Instead, they smelled
like sweaty feet.
</P>
<P>
   Never again would Mike be around to walk his son to a finish
line after little Jeremy had spilled off his BMX bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want me to quit,'' Jeremy said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many families, they went forward. Kim remarried and Jeremy
grew up and watched out for his younger brother, Josh (now a junior
at Westlake). But somewhere along the way, Kim said, Golden
discovered a need to revisit his father's memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a need now,'' she said. ``Maybe he's trying to
find his way. You have to make your own life. Maybe he's trying to
find himself. We all go through different turning points.''
</P>
<P>
   When he turned 18, Golden got the eagle. He now feels like Mike
is near again, and it gives him a sense of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' he said. ``I have fun every day. I wake up in
the morning happy where I'm at. If I died today, I'd say I lived a
full life.''

MAN CHARGED IN 1 MURDER, SUSPECTED IN 7 OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-WOMEN-SLAIN-KIN) 
(mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Police investigators wearing face masks and white jumpsuits
found the bodies of two women and the decaying remains of others
Wednesday in a ramshackle wooden house a block from prestigious
Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   They charged Kendall Francois, a 27-year-old unemployed school
aide who lived in the house, with strangling one of the women to
death and said they thought he was responsible for killing seven
others, most of them prostitutes, who have been missing for up to
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reason to believe that ultimately eight bodies will be
recovered from our search of the house based on our conversations
with him,'' said William Grady, the district attorney of Dutchess
County.
</P>
<P>
   The house, where Francois lived with his parents and sister, is
on a quiet tree-shaded block of gracious Victorians and doctors'
offices one block from Vassar. But it is also two blocks in the
opposite direction from a stretch of Poughkeepsie's Main Street
used by prostitutes, including some who were drug users, to solicit
customers.
</P>
<P>
   What made the case particularly eerie is that Francois' parents
and sister continued to live in the house where the bodies and the
remains of the women were found, yet law enforcement officials said
they were surprised when told of the murders. Neighbors and a
postal carrier said the stench coming from the disheveled and dirty
house had long been unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   Late into the evening, investigators continued to search the
Francois house for remains of the other women. Grady said at least
one body was found in the basement, but he would not disclose other
locations in the house that he said Francois had mentioned when
interrogated about the missing women Tuesday night and Wednesday.
Grady said there was no indication that the women had been
dismembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had something to say about all of the missing women,''
Grady said of the suspect. Grady would not say what led police to
Francois, although other law enforcement officials said Francois
was jailed for 15 days last winter on charges of assaulting a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest in a sequence of serial murders of street
prostitutes during the last two decades. It bore strong
similarities to the case of Joel Rifkin, who confessed to killing
17 women he said were prostitutes in Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The string of missing women has unsettled both the city of
Poughkeepsie, a Hudson River manufacturing center with 28,844
residents, and the surrounding township, also named Poughkeepsie,
which has a population of 40,143 people. The economic vitality of
the area has been battered by the closing of a nearby IBM plant and
the flight of business from the city's downtown. Some relatives of
the victims complained that until last week, when a task force
focusing on the disappearance was formed, police were not paying
enough attention to the disappearances because the victims were
prostitutes and drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been this much press before, I don't think it
would have gone this far,'' said James DeSalvo, the brother of
Kathleen Hurley, who vanished in January of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The only body identified Wednesday was that of Catina Newmaster,
a 25-year-old drug user who had tattoos on her right hip and right
arm and a nose ring. She was last seen on Aug. 25 by a boyfriend in
nearby Pleasant Valley, who found out that she had traveled to
Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman reported missing was Wendy Meyers, 30, who was
last seen on Oct. 24, 1996, at a motel in nearby Highland. Her
disappearance was followed by that of Catherine Marsh, 31, who was
pregnant, on Nov. 12, 1996; Gina Barone, 29, on Dec. 9, 1996; Ms.
Hurley on Jan. 12, 1997; Michelle Eason, 27, on Oct. 9, 1997; Mary
Healey Giaccone, 29, on Nov. 13, 1997; Sandra Jean French, 51, on
June 11, 1998, and Ms. Newmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Although some lived in the rural towns outside urban
Poughkeepsie, four of the women were last seen in the meaner
stretches of the city of Poughkeepsie. All except Ms. Hurley had
been arrested on prostitution charges. Seven of the women were
white; one was black. Francois is black, but Grady and other law
enforcement officials said the kilings did not appear to be
racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Francois, who is 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighs more than 300
pounds, was arraigned Wednesday morning before Judge Ira Pergament
of the Town of Poughkeepsie court and charged with one count of
second-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty and was assigned a
lawyer from the state's Capital Defender Office, which handles
cases that might result in a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Francois was born in Poughkeepsie, graduated from high school in
the Arlington School District, made up of the town of Poughkeepsie
and seven other towns, and served in the U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
   He began working at the Arlington Middle School in 1994 as an
occasional custodial worker, and then from April 1996 to January
1997 he worked full time as a hall monitor at Arlington, making
sure halls and the cafeteria were not unruly. When he left, he told
school administrators that he was going to work for the Anderson
School, a school for mentally retarded and other developmentally
disabled children in Staatsburg, a 20-minute ride from the city of
Poughkeepsie. Officials of that school would not confirm or deny
that he had worked there.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
For the better part of a week, the Comets fought the Phoenix
Mercury with their backs pinned firmly against the proverbial wall
in defense of a WNBA championship.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, they are back-to-back champions of the 2-year-old league.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets' voyage from the brink of elimination to repeat
winners was completed Tuesday night with an 80-71 triumph over the
Mercury in the decisive game of the best-of-three WNBA Championship
Series before a sellout crowd of 16,285 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately afterward, a blizzard of confetti showered the arena
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper stood in the midst of the frenzied atmosphere
receiving her second consecutive finals Most Valuable Player
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson and Sheryl Swoopes hugged. Swoopes grabbed
year-old son Jordan Eric Jackson from her husband and held him
aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Perrot ambled from center court to one corner of the arena
and back shouting and signaling to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cooper and Swoopes, who have endured an uneasy truce
throughout the summer of '98, exchanged pleasantries, if only
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Their teammates found a variety of methods to celebrate amid
blaring music and the crescendo of noise from an adoring public,
friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year Van Chancellor, his '98 WNBA championship cap
tugged firmly down on his head, sought out Cooper for an embrace of
thanks, friendship, admiration and congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy this one more than last year's
(championship) because Saturday I thought we were dead in the water
(in Game 2),'' Chancellor said Wednesday. ``There was no way we
were supposed to win that one. It was a miracle, simply a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Tuesday, man, what a ballgame. It had everything. Boy, did
we play defense when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does this dynasty-in-the-making go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Will this team nobody could beat simply beat itself through a
postseason fit of petty jealousies and rage that quietly ripped at
its heart through a record 27-3 regular season?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely important that we try to keep this team
together,'' said Perrot, the 5-5 heroine who played her best game
of the series Tuesday. ``But some people have to make decisions to
better themselves. For me, personally, I hope this team can stay
together. I think we have great talent, and when we all put our
talent and character together, we're a winning team all around.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the Comets become free agents once an elite team of
WNBA players competes in a foreign exhibition tour that spans
September and October.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight are Cooper, named league MVP for the second year
in a row, and fellow All-WNBA first-teamers Swoopes and Tina
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever feud existed between Cooper and Swoopes was thought to
have been squelched in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   They complemented each other on the court thereafter as the
Comets tied a franchise record for victories at the start of a
season (five in a row) and later put together a WNBA-record 15-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But the day after that string was snapped by Cleveland 74-71 in
overtime at Compaq Center, Cooper let loose in the locker room,
offering a fiery climax to the Comets' 77-61 victory over
Sacramento. She fumed over what she perceived to be a team-wide
lapse into individualistic play. She ranted about Chancellor's
inability to control a team on the brink of splintering.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Coach of the Year was able to grab the reins and
get the Comets back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The problems between Swoopes and Cooper aren't the only ones
with which Chancellor has had to cope.
</P>
<P>
   A practice session before the Comets faced the Charlotte Sting
in the first round of the playoffs had to be halted when another
two players were at odds over assignments. That clash simmered for
two days but was handled gently though deliberately by Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the night the Comets wrapped up their second straight
WNBA title, according to a source who requested anonymity, there
was at least one major player ``who was not happy'' about her role.
</P>
<P>
   It has become quite evident the only team capable of beating the
Comets may be the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor is amazed at the level of success the two-time
champions can achieve when petty jealousies, envy, ego and greed
are set aside for the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that we need to keep this team
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the issue of a team filled with turmoil, Chancellor
said, ``It's been my experience that when things are going good,
they're not going as good as you think. When things are going bad,
they're never as bad as you might seem to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what next year will bring. In eight months' time,
a lot of things can change. My whole thought process is, let's go a
few months, see how things look three or four months from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being frank about it, it's awfully difficult to see right
here, right after the season's over with, just what is next year
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to argue about what the Comets have
accomplished, problems or no.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, this year's been a struggle,'' said Chancellor.
``But as I reflect on it, a lot of parties involved in this
situation had to give for the good of the team. And as you see that
championship unfold, it makes it worthwhile. From my point of view,
I'd love to try it again this way next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I suffered through that much. We won 30
games overall. Any way you slice that up, it ain't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot has a philosophy about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never predict the future,'' she said. ``But I have about
eight more fingers with no rings on them.''

   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ In the fall of 1996, Catherine Marsh, a
longtime prostitute and drug addict, repeatedly begged her mother
to let her come home.
</P>
<P>
   She had recently turned her life around, her mother said
Wednesday, completing a rehabilitation program, reuniting with her
two children and pursuing a college degree. Still, her mother,
Marguerite Marsh, was hesitant. ``I was afraid if she came up here
she was going to continue with her habit,'' Mrs. Marsh said. ``But
she kept calling and calling and finally I said, `OK, come.' That
was the last I ever heard from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believed that Ms. Marsh, 29, was one of eight
women _ all involved with drugs and most with prostitution _ who
were murdered here by Kendall Francois in the last 22 months. On
Wednesday, after the arrest of Francois, 27, in the strangling
death of one of the women, police began removing bodies from the
home he lived in with his family on a stately, tree-lined street
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying she's not in there,'' Mrs. Marsh, her voice thin
and strained, said of her daughter in a telephone interview from
her home in Schenectady. ``Cathy was a beautiful, gifted woman. She
loved music and she was very, very bright. But she was caught up in
a powerful illness, addiction, and it took her places she didn't
want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The first body to be removed from Francois' home was identified
as that of Catina Newmaster, 25, who was last seen on Aug. 25,
police said. Her boyfriend, Christopher Briggs, said Wednesday that
he was trying to keep his mind focused on the woman he loved, a
mother of five who adored flowers and dreamed of being near the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to straighten out her life and be with her kids,''
he said. ``But Catina had a very bad drug problem. She cried on my
shoulder about it a lot. People in Dutchess County have said the
cops shouldn't have even bothered looking for these women, that it
was just one less crackhead or prostitute on the street. But these
people all had families, and they shouldn't be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the missing women have also criticized the news
media for concentrating on the dark side of the women's lives. Each
said the missing women had close ties to their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women, Sandra Jean French, 51, who was once a horse
trainer, was busy buying baby clothes in June _ for a granddaughter
who was born only a few days after she disappeared that same month.
She would call her expectant daughter, Heidi Cramer, at least three
times a day and bring meals over regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cramer said she had been realistic about her mother's
longtime struggle with drugs but never imagined it would end with
her death. Now she must tell her younger sister Nicole exactly what
police believe happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in shock,'' Ms. Cramer said of her sister. ``One minute
she's talking to her mother and it's, `OK Nicole, I love you, I'll
see you soon.' The next minute her mother's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Patricia Barone will be searching for an answer to
satisfy her granddaughter, whom she has been raising since her
daughter, Gina Barone, 25, was reported missing in 1996. An addict
since the age of 12, Ms. Barone never had a chance to develop much
individual talent or skill, her mother said. But, when sober, she
was a dedicated mother to her daughter, Nikki, now 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, you know, it was, `Where's my mommy?''' Mrs.
Barone said of her granddaughter's pleas. ``And I'd tell her, `Your
mommy doesn't feel well. Mommy went away for a while.' Then we'd
say, `We're looking for your mommy and we can't find her.' Now it's
going to be, `Your mommy's not coming back.'''

DAY OF CELEBRATION IN MANHATTAN FOR TEAM FROM TOMS RIVER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the calendar, at least, Wednesday should have been
a normal day in school for a group of 12-year-olds from Toms River,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the boys of the Toms River East baseball team,
which won the Little League World Series Championship on Saturday,
were once again basking in the glow of celebrity, as the talk show
hostess Rosie O'Donnell showered them with gifts and the Official
All Star Cafe rolled out the feast of choice among many young
champions: burgers, fries and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, they met Yogi Berra at the site of his
new museum, which is to open next month on the campus of Montclair
State University in Montclair, N.J..
</P>
<P>
   In fact, precious little has been normal for the boys since the
world first began paying attention to them, only a week ago.
Tuesday morning, on the first day of school, cameras followed their
every step. After school, the team boarded a bus for Yankee
Stadium, where they frolicked in George Steinbrenner's private
suite and took the field with the home team. There were even
autographs from Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   For the boys, all the attention has been the stuff of dreams.
But for their parents, well, they say it is time that life returns
to the way it was before their sons became heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants a piece of them right now; it's crazy, like
you wouldn't believe,'' said George Gardner, the father of the
team's third baseman, Gabe Gardner. Since the team won the
championship, the Gardners' telephone has rung incessantly and
there has been little time for things his family craves the most:
sleep and a quiet dinner away from all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucy Cardone, a first-grade teacher in Toms River, returned
to the classroom on Tuesday, her new students had only one thing on
their minds: her son Chris, a reserve outfielder who smacked two
home runs in the championship game, including one in the final
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grade girls made a special trip to her classroom to ask
about the Toms River East boys. ``It's overwhelming,'' she said.
``On the one hand, my husband and I want to do as much as possible
to see that Chris has a chance to savor this moment. But I don't
want the situation to become so out of control that he's let down
when it finally ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cardone said that she and her son have had long talks about
what would happen when the cameras stop flashing. ``I've told him
that he should see what he and the team accomplished as a
once-in-a-lifetime thrill, not his life's greatest
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys appeared to be handling their newfound fame with a
poise well beyond their years, though a few conceded to being a
little tired. ``Signing all the autographs kind of makes my hand
hurt,'' said Joey Franceschini, the smallest player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gaynor, the team's manager and the father of Casey Gaynor,
a team pitcher, said the trip to New York would probably be the
team's last big adventure, although another hometown parade is
planned for this weekend. ``We've told them that school is the No.
1 priority now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fame has brought at least one unusual moment. The first stop
Wednesday was the set of the ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' at the
NBC studios in Rockefeller Center, where they joined Cindy Crawford
in taping Monday's season premiere.
</P>
<P>
   But the boys seemed less interested in the supermodel than in
their moment with Ms. O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   First, Ms. O'Donnell joked with the boys. ``Are you like rock
stars at school?'' she asked Chris Cardone. Smiling shyly, he
replied, ``Nah.'' Trying to elicit a little more response, she
said, ``I hear all the girls want to marry you.'' This time Chris
had more to say: ``There was one girl with a sign when we got home.
But she was 7.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys' biggest thrill came when Ms. O'Donnell gave them a few
tokens of thanks: personalized championship baseball jackets, a
shopping cart full of new bats and balls, and a promise that she
would foot the bill for a new batting cage. That will come in
handy, as the league prepares to try out a practice facility that
will allow the boys to play baseball year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a real cool lady,'' said Gabe Gardner, loading his arms
with piles of gifts, including a Rosie doll that Ms. O'Donnell
autographed for his mom. ``This was the best.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, the team was off to a private party at the
Official All Star Cafe in Times Square, where the actor Stephen
Baldwin, a fan and a former Little League catcher, dropped by to
say hello. For a couple dozen boys and girls having lunch at the
cafe Wednesday, the team's visit was an unexpected surprise.
Grabbing napkins and any other piece of loose paper they could
find, the children lined the entryway of the reception area set up
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreamed of signing autographs in the pros,'' said Gabe
Gardner, who was surrounded by a group of autograph-seeking
8-year-olds from upstate New York. ``I never dreamed of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the parents who were being forced by sons and daughters to
wait as they got autographs, Bob Fisher, father of pitcher Scott
Fisher, looked on with a mix of excitement and disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' Fisher said, ``for other kids to see them
and to appreciate the accomplishment of being a group of ordinary
kids who worked hard and realized their dream. But for us, it's
also important for them to start getting back to a more routine
life. We're not complaining, but this pace can't continue. They're
just kids.''

   RENO-ASSESS _ Buffeted for 18 months by Republicans in Congress
over her refusal to allow an independent counsel to examine how
Democrats financed President Clinton's re-election, Attorney
General Janet Reno has abruptly reversed herself, opening two
preliminary inquiries in a week that could lead to the appointment
of an outside prosecutor. A shift in the attorney general's
approach does appear to be under way. But what is uncertain is
whether she has changed her mind about the need for an independent
counsel or, as some in Congress suspect, is trying to blunt the
fierce attacks by the lawmakers on her competence and credibility.

their childhoods catching tadpoles in rural ponds. Before they
started work on Eib's Pond, few of them had ventured very far into
its 17 acres. Most New York City wetlands are brackish salt
marshes; Eib's Pond (pronounced ``eyebz'') is a rarity: a
freshwater pond. Covering three acres, it is the largest in the

down a good portion of your savings _ and have pledged another
chunk of your income for the next 30 years _ on a house or
apartment you now think may have been overpriced? Or maybe it's not
overpriced _ but you think you can't afford it anymore? Or maybe
you just think that with the stock market's woes, you can get it
cheaper? That's where learning to play poker comes in. You've got
to learn when to bluff, when to stay in the game, and, of course,
when to fold. By Tracie Rozhon.

JONES VS. MORALES; FLYWEIGHTS IN ATLANTIC CITY; HEAVYWEIGHTS AT
FOXWOODS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Junior Jones does not have a problem traveling to Tijuana,
Mexico, to meet Erik Morales in his hometown for his World Boxing
Council superbantamweight title on Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a native of Brooklyn's Bushwick section, fought in front
of his home crowd at Madison Square Garden last Dec. 19 and was so
caught up in the fans' frenzy that he strayed from his game plan
and was knocked out by Kennedy McKinney in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``His being at home doesn't make him any better,'' Jones said of
Morales. ``The only thing the crowd will do is boo me. I've never
fought in Mexico, but I've fought 36 Mexicans and I've never
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones (44-3) is training at Evander Holyfield's gym in Atlanta
for the Morales bout, which will be broadcast on HBO as part of its
``Boxing After Dark'' series. Jones trained in Atlanta before his
bout against Orlando Canizales in 1996, a 12-round decision that
put Jones in line for his two big fights against Marco Antonio
Barrera. Jones said he is so sharp for his fight against Morales
that he knocked out one of his sparring partners on Monday with one
punch _ a right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the tape back and timed the punch,'' Jones said. ``It
took less than a second to land.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes his speed, power and vast ring experience give him
an advantage against the 21-year-old Morales. ``I'm confident in my
heart that he can't beat me,'' Jones said. ``He's too slow. It's
not that he can't fight, he's just not at my level.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he doesn't even think about the fourth round
technical-knockout loss to McKinney, which came after Jones had
staggered McKinney and then punched himself out trying to go for a
knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't beat me,'' Jones said. ``I beat myself. I didn't
pace myself. I just loaded up for the knockout. I hit him, but it
wasn't a hard shot or a clean shot. If I had hit him the right way,
he would have been out. After I hurt him, I was just looking to get
the fight over with. I got caught up in fighting at home and trying
to please the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson of Washington, the International Boxing Federation
flyweight champion, will defend his title against Jose Laureano
(15-3-1) of Guaynabo, P.R., on Friday at Trump Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City. The undercard will feature Ike Ibeabuchi (18-0), a
native of Nigeria who lives in Dallas, against Everton Davis of
Jamaica (13-10-1) in a 10-round heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (35-1) is coming off a dominating 12-round victory
against Luis Rolon a couple of months ago. Even though he lost only
one round on two of judges' scorecards and none on the third,
Johnson was booed by the crowd at the Turningstone Casino outside
of Syracuse because he spent many of the later rounds taunting the
overmatched Rolon. This will be Johnson's seventh title defense.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of heavyweight bouts will headline a card at Foxwoods
Casino Thursday night as part of a U.S. Satellite Broadcasting show
at 9 o'clock. Danell Nicholson of Chicago (29-3) will meet Mike
Sedillo of Chino, Calif., (31-18-2) in the main event, and Jesse
Ferguson of Knightdale, N.C. (24-17) will fight Tyrone Booze of
Hartford (21-11-2). Both bouts are scheduled for 10 rounds.

EDITORIAL: THE ELECTION COMMISSION GOES ASTRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   With limited resources and no shortage of serious campaign
finance abuses to pursue, the Federal Election Commission has made
the peculiar decision to target Forbes magazine for publishing
columns written by Steve Forbes while campaigning for president in
1996. In doing so, the commission has managed to trespass on the
First Amendment and call into question the agency's sense of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit filed by the Election Commission last week contends
that the columns, which were published while Forbes was running for
the Republican presidential nomination, amounted to an illegal
corporate campaign contribution by Forbes magazine. The panel
values the columns at $94,900.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, news articles and commentary appearing in newspapers
and magazines are exempt from scrutiny under the Federal Election
Campaign Act. But under a constitutionally dubious provision such
articles may be deemed a ``contribution'' if the outlet is
controlled by the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to prevent candidates like Forbes, who own press
vehicles, from using them to gain unfair electoral advantage. The
trouble is, it ignores a basic First Amendment principle. The
government has no business trying to dictate the contents of a
magazine by potentially subjecting editorial decisions to civil
sanctions.

EDITORIAL: CHANGING BANK REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Sept. 3:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Banking Committee today takes up the financial
services regulatory reform bill, which passed the House earlier
this year by a one-vote margin. It is good legislation that sets up
fair rules as banks, insurers and brokerage firms expand into each
other's business. But two provisions in the House-passed bill need
to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The first provision concerns who will regulate banking companies
that choose to engage in expanded activities in insurance and
securities. The House bill would restrict that to the Federal
Reserve, while the Treasury Department is pressing for an amendment
that would also allow banks to structure their activities in such a
way as to allow the Comptroller of the Currency _ an official in
the Treasury Department _ to be their chief regulator.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the country has been well served by what amounted
to competing regulatory jurisdictions, a flexible arrangement that
has given the country the strongest banking system in the world.
There is no reason to cut out the comptroller now.
</P>
<P>
   The other provision concerns mutual insurance companies, which
are owned by their policyholders. Some states have enacted
legislation that allows such companies to be taken from their
policyholders without adequate compensation, while others,
including New York, have wisely rejected such legislation. But the
House-passed bill would effectively override laws such as the one
in New York. That provision should be deleted.

FINAL SUMMATION  
 BUILDING ON A STAMP 
SKATING COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with JANE H. LII   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He spent a lifetime arguing some of the toughest cases before
some of the most demanding tribunals in the land, but Arthur Liman,
who died in July 1997, has presented his final summation as a
posthumous author.
</P>
<P>
   His new book, ``Lawyer: A Life of Counsel and Controversy''
(Public Affairs), chronicles his work as a partner at Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison; his investigation of the 1971 Attica
prison uprising, and his most public role, the face of the
prosecution in the Iran-Contra hearings.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Ellen Liman, said Wednesday that her husband had begun
writing the book shortly after bladder cancer was diagnosed in
1996. He finished the manuscript _ scribbled on yellow legal pads _
just months before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liman said the book was intended to be both an heirloom for
future generations of Limans and an inspiration to law school
students who may be interested in straddling the world of public
and private law. Starting next week, in fact, each incoming
first-year class at Liman's alma mater, Yale Law School, will
receive a free copy of the book as part of its orientation, Mrs.
Liman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the students won't be the first to get copies. A couple of
weeks ago, while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Mrs. Liman
presented a copy to Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, members of the
Class of '73.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State Is Nationalized
</P>
<P>
   It has been the backdrop for movies, out-of-focus tourist photos
and even a terrorist attack. Now, the Empire State Building has
something that few other private buildings can claim: its own
postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service introduced an embossed likeness of the
landmark Wednesday as one of 15 stamps saluting the 1930s. The
series includes the Golden Gate Bridge, Jesse Owens, ``Gone With
the Wind'' and the game Monopoly. The stamps go on sale next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's perfect,'' said Lydia Ruth, a spokeswoman for the
building. ``No people, no King Kong, just the building.''
</P>
<P>
   A Commissioner Is Staying In-Line
</P>
<P>
   It's barely a minute of film, but there he is, the no-nonsense
police commissioner of New York City, Howard Safir, wearing navy
blue shorts and a navy blue NYPD T-shirt, rolling confidently
toward the camera on a pair of in-line skates. He's wearing a
helmet, too.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not alone. His skating buddies are among the stars of a
documentary film called ``It's All Good,'' a 90-minute feature its
promoters call a look at the ``underground world of aggressive
in-line skating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the segment featuring Safir, skaters swoop down sidewalks and
do daring loops off the handrails outside a large Manhattan
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty impressive,'' the commissioner says, while pointing out
that wreaking pedestrian havoc on private property poses public
safety problems at least and a law-and-order problem at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too sure the New York Mercantile Exchange would be too
crazy about it,'' he tells one young man sizing up the building's
stone steps for an obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   Is Safir out of character? Not really, said his spokeswoman,
Marilyn Mode. She said the commissioner made an appearance at the
request of the filmmaker, David Hoffman, who is an old friend and
whose company, Varied Productions, is still seeking a distributor.
Safir has been skating since 1992, when his wife gave him a pair of
skates for his 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Although police departments elsewhere have skating units, Ms.
Mode said there were no plans to put New York's Finest on skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had Rollerblades in Central Park and the perpetrator
runs on the grass, it's hard to catch him,'' she said.

LONG ISLAND TOWN RUSHES TO SAVE TALL SHIP CAUGHT IN MUD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN COVE, N.Y. _ Volunteers rushed Wednesday to the rescue of
the Regina Maris, a 90-year-old three-masted barkentine that became
stuck in the mud at low tide and later filled with water, only a
few boat lengths away from her new home here.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Glen Cove were not about to let the 140-foot-long
ship _ a survivor of nearly a century of adventure on the high
seas, including the smuggling of Jewish refugees out of Europe
during World War II _ break apart in a murky tidal pool.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began when the ship's keel settled into the mud at
the end of Glen Cove Creek and the ship tilted on her side with her
masts at a 35-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to have some problems with the old ship, but not
quite this soon,'' said Mayor Thomas Suozzi, who only last week
welcomed the Regina Maris to Hempstead Harbor and declared her the
symbol of his efforts to revitalize the city's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The ship foundered Tuesday afternoon as she was towed about a
mile to the marina, where she was to be permanently tied up near
the Steam Boat Landing Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, heavy pumps spewed hundreds of gallons of water from the
vessel, which had been unable to right herself and become flooded
at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``She almost made it, but got caught in shallow water when the
tide ran out,'' Suozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Regina Maris was towed to Glen Cove last week from
Greenport, 90 nautical miles east of here on the North Fork of Long
Island. Officials of Greenport had threatened to take the Regina
Maris out to sea and scuttle her because, they said, the town could
no longer afford to keep her. They said the aging vessel and her
rotting rigging presented a public safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the ship was in trouble brought hundreds of curious
onlookers to the marina. ``She's a beautiful ship, even when she's
stuck in the mud,'' said Samuel Schwartz, who watched with his
11-year-old son, Michael.

CLINTON TOOK INTEREST IN RETURNING LEWINSKY TO WHITE HOUSE,
TESTIMONY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>

 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton told the grand jury investigating
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky that he was troubled by her
transfer out of the White House and discussed bringing her back in
the summer of last year, according to people familiar with his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified on Aug. 17 that he spoke about his worries
over Ms. Lewinsky's situation with Marsha Scott, a senior aide in
the White House personnel office and a friend of his since high
school, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion, in July 1997, is the first indication that
Clinton took an interest in returning Ms. Lewinsky, a former
intern, to the White House from the public affairs job at the
Pentagon, where she was transferred against her wishes in April
1996. Clinton's apparent sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky is starkly at
odds with the views of some White House staff members, who
suggested as recently as this spring that she had been shadowing or
even stalking the president, which is why they said they thought
she should leave.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not order Ms. Lewinsky's return and did not
ask aides to give her favorable treatment, one adviser
knowledgeable about his testimony said. And despite her own pleas
to White House officials, Ms. Lewinsky did not receive a position
there. Ms. Scott met with Ms. Lewinsky twice last summer to talk
about her career, even though she was not responsible at the time
for administration jobs outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has told grand jurors that, as early as spring
1996, at the time she was transferred, Clinton assured her that he
would bring her back to the White House after the presidential
election that November, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies and Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, have seized on Clinton's conversation with Ms. Scott for
opposing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   To the president's team, the talk is evidence that Clinton was
concerned, as any man might be, for the well-being of a woman he
had been intimate with. They argue that if he was intent on buying
her silence, he would have surely insisted that his aides rehire
her.
</P>
<P>
   But allies of Starr say that prosecutors view Clinton's stated
interest in Ms. Lewinsky's return to the White House as a possible
abuse of his office, a likely accusation in a report that Starr is
preparing for Congress. They may also cite the conversation as an
attempt by the president to obstruct justice by keeping Ms.
Lewinsky mollified and silent about their relationship, the allies
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the prosecutors, the timing of the conversation is
significant. Weeks before, on May 27, 1997, the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously that Paula Jones' sexual misconduct suit could proceed
against Clinton while he was in office. Days later, Mrs. Jones'
lawyers said that they planned to seek testimony from other women
linked to Clinton. That effort eventually led them to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also been examining efforts by Clinton's friends and
administration officials to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New
York. The president acknowledged under oath that he had asked last
winter whether an aide could provide Ms. Lewinsky with a favorable
job recommendation for her White House work, people familiar with
his testimony said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also expressed interest in having John Hilley, a senior
official in the legislative affairs office where Ms. Lewinsky had
worked, write a recommendation for her, they said. But the
recommendation was apparently never written _ more evidence, the
president's allies said, that he did not go to extraordinary
lengths to keep Ms. Lewinsky on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has admitted an inappropriate physical relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, but he has denied obstructing justice or breaking any
other laws. Ms. Lewinsky also denied an affair under oath during
the Jones lawsuit, but later acknowledged an 18-month sexual
relationship with the president to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton expressed an interest in bringing Ms.
Lewinsky back to the White House, he had ended their affair,
according to his advisers. They said the president broke off their
physical relationship in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Lieberman, a former deputy chief of staff, has said she
removed Ms. Lewinsky from her White House job in April 1996 because
of ``immature and inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet allies of the president said that he felt that Ms. Lewinsky
had been treated unfairly, and that her transfer might be a blot on
her resume. One adviser to Clinton said that the president had a
further worry about Ms. Lewinsky. ``He was concerned about her
talking with people,'' the adviser said, describing that concern as
``a natural feeling'' that anyone involved in an extramarital
relationship might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't order anyone to bring her back,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, the Jones lawyers were not the only people
inquiring into Clinton's relationships with women.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, according to those familiar with her testimony,
Ms. Lewinsky said she told Clinton that a Newsweek reporter had
contacted her friend, Linda Tripp, who also worked at the Pentagon.
The reporter was pursuing claims by Kathleen Willey, then a White
House volunteer, that Clinton had made a sexual advance toward her
in the private hallway outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that she pressed Clinton to have his senior
aide and confidant, Bruce Lindsey, call Mrs. Tripp to advise her on
how to respond to the reporter, an associate of Ms. Lewinsky said.
A day later, Lindsey called Mrs. Tripp, according to lawyers
familiar with the testimony of both women.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had that
conversation with Clinton before or after he expressed an interest
in bringing her back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott has testified on at least two occasions to the grand
jury inquiring into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. She
described meeting twice last summer with Ms. Lewinsky, who implored
her for a White House job, according to lawyers familiar with her
testimony. Ms. Scott testified that she met with Ms. Lewinsky at
the request of Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   During their second meeting, Ms. Scott testified, Ms. Lewinsky
indicated that she was angry about her transfer across the Potomac
to the Pentagon, and attributed it to what she called untrue rumors
that she was involved with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott said that she advised Ms. Lewinsky that, because of
her detractors in the White House, it would not be a good career
move for her to return there, according to people familiar with her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scott did not recall discussing Ms. Lewinsky with the
president, according to her lawyer, Stuart Pierson. ``She could
very well have talked to the president about her conversations with
Monica, but she had no specific recollection of that,'' Pierson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's interest in efforts by Clinton to bring Ms. Lewinsky
back to the White House had not been not previously revealed. Some
White House aides, worried about the potential impact of Starr's
report, believe that they should disclose potentially sensitive
information to present their gloss on the facts before the
prosecutors do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky repeatedly complained to Clinton in early 1997
about her transfer out of the White House, according to people
familiar with the testimony of both. She was said to have been
worried that prospective employers might interpret her transfer to
the Pentagon as a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a girl who is very concerned about what people think,''
one associate said. ``And she did not want it to be seen that she
was run out of the White House. I know she wanted to come back, and
she did not like being over at the Pentagon.''

LORD ROTHERMERE, 73, PRESS BARON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Viscount Rothermere, one of the last of Britain's great
press barons, who helped transform The Daily Mail from a listless
money loser to a highly successful newspaper aimed at Britain's
growing middle class, died on Tuesday at St. Thomas' Hospital in
London. He was 73 and had a heart attack, according to Vyvyan
Harmsworth, director of corporate affairs for The Daily Mail and
General Holdings Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a newspaper-owning family but also into a world of
upper-class privilege, Rothermere came late to his calling, taking
control of The Daily Mail and General Trust, the parent company of
The Mail and numerous other newspapers, from his ailing father in
1971. But it was then that he made the bold and risky decision to
change The Mail from a large-style broadsheet to a tabloid
newspaper, going after young professional women readers and the
country's conservative-minded middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``He inspired the revolution in mid-market papers in the past 20
years,'' Lord Hollick, group chief executive of United News and
Media, the company that owns The Express newspaper, The Daily
Mail's main competitor, told the Press Association Wednesday.
``Lord Rothermere was the quintessential proprietor, passionate for
his papers, robust in his views and commercially courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to The Daily Mail, the colorful and outspoken
Rothermere was the proprietor of The Mail On Sunday, which he
founded in 1982; The Evening Standard, and a large group of
regional newspapers around Britain, among other properties. He was
also an amateur poet and a student of Zen Buddhism who, when once
asked what class he belonged to, answered ``nobleman.'' At the age
of 71, he proudly announced: ``I am a playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   With newspaper holdings estimated to be worth $1.7 billion,
Rothermere was also one of a dying breed of rich, powerful
newspaper proprietors who once ran most of London's newspapers as
the jewels in their family's media empires. But while the Aitkens,
Astors and Beaverbrooks sold their holdings, Rothermere kept his,
explaining that he had the family pride to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife can't understand why I'm still here and why it is so
important for me to succeed,'' he told one of his employees once,
when his wife called to complain that it was midnight and he was
still at the office. ``It is even more difficult for me than for
you, because you can get another job. I can never got another
empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Vere Harold Esmond Harmsworth, the oldest son of the second
Viscount Rothermere, Rothermere had such an undistinguished time at
Eton that college was considered too high a goal, and he joined the
army. Failing to make it as an officer, he served four years,
without promotion, as a private. He later said that his humble
military career gave him an understanding of the common man that
would prove invaluable later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're standing above a tree, you can only see the
branches and the leaves, but when you're underneath the tree, and
you look up, you can see all the things inside the tree, and that's
a very valuable experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothermere's father believed that aristocrats, once they had
made their fortunes, should leave the management of their companies
to hired workers. But when he took his son riding as a boy and
described the glorious life he could have as an officer in a
high-class cavalry brigade, the young Vere was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to all this and I thought, `Oh how awful, how
absolutely ghastly,''' he recalled. ```I saw the prospect of
endless boredom stretching before me. I never wanted to do anything
but work in newspapers.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newspapers he wanted to work for had been founded in 1896 by
his great-uncle, the first Lord Northcliffe, widely considered the
father of modern popular journalism in Britain. But he had to start
at the bottom, and his first newspaper-related job was in Quebec,
where he worked in a paper mill. When he returned to London, his
new assignment _ handling the newspapers' promotional competitions
for vacations and other prizes _ helped earn him the disparaging
nickname Mere Vere.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1971, when he took over the newspapers from his father,
who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Rothermere acted boldly
and decisively. He closed The Daily Sketch, one of the family's
least-successful papers, and appointed David English, its editor
and an old friend, as the editor of the ailing Daily Mail. And he
reinvented The Daily Mail as a tabloid, going after middle-class
women readers with consumer articles and with a regular features
section called ``Femail.'' The paper was midway between the
nation's quality newspapers and the scandalous tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when competition in the British newspaper industry had
led to price wars, cost-cutting and layoffs, Rothermere hired more
reporters, paid them generous and sometimes exorbitant salaries,
and invested heavily in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Rothermere merged his money-losing evening paper, The
Evening News, with The Evening Standard, in which he bought a 50
percent stake. (He bought the rest of the paper several years
later.) Along the way, his papers began outselling those of his
closest rivals, The Express, The Daily Star and The Express on
Sunday. ``In 1970 we had two ailing papers and The Express had
three successful ones,'' he liked to say. ``But by 1983 we had
three successful papers and they had two unsuccessful ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he moved to Paris in 1978 for tax reasons, Rothermere
spoke to his London office every day and could be critical of his
own papers, even in public. His editors occasionally picked up
competing newspapers, only to find themselves reading
uncomplimentary remarks from their own proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with him, and I've told him so,'' Rothermere
said several months ago in an interview with The Daily Telegraph,
referring to Paul Dacre, the editor of The Daily Mail. ``We've gone
too far down-market; there's too much tabloid-y reporting. That
kind of thing leads in due course to slovenliness and
sensationalism, something reporters use to cover up the fact that
they've done no work. I want it to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the tough words was a feeling that as long as his
papers were financially successful, his editors could do what they
liked. When he dramatically switched political allegiance in 1997,
becoming a Labor supporter after a lifetime as a Conservative,
Rothermere did not insist that The Daily Mail _ one of Labor's most
vociferous opponents _ follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rothermere was married twice. His first wife, the former
Patricia Brooks, was a B-movie actress who became known as Bubbles
(a name her husband hated) because of her fondness for Champagne.
Though she and Rothermere began living more or less separate lives
in 1978, they remained fond of each other and attended official
functions together during the 90 or so days each year that he spent
in London. Lady Rothermere died on the Riviera in 1992, after
taking what was said to be an accidental overdose of sleeping
pills. A year later, Rothermere married his longtime companion,
Maiko Lee, a former hand model whom he had met at a charity ball in
New York in 1976. He is also survived by three children from his
first marriage: Jonathan Harmsworth, managing director of The
Evening Standard and next in line for his father's title, Geraldine
Maxwell and Camilla Yeates; a stepdaughter, Sarah Holcroft, and 10
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sometime reputation for frivolousness, Rothermere was
never frivolous in his analysis of what readers wanted. ``A
newspaper should be like the sea: always different, always the
same,'' he once said.

ARMEY LEADS PARADE OF GOP CELEBS OUT WEST TO HIT HUSTINGS FOR HOUSE
HOPEFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Leading a parade of Republican officials into
town to help capture what they consider a key seat, U.S. House of
Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey stumped in Los Angeles
for Randy Hoffman, the businessman trying to oust Democratic Rep.
Brad Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, R-Texas, spoke Wednesday at a downtown fund-raiser for
Hoffman, the GOP challenger for a congressional district that
stretches from suburban Sherman Oaks to Thousand Oaks, in
neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders -- including former presidential
candidate and Sen. Bob Dole -- are scheduled to follow. The party's
brass considers the district one of a handful nationwide in which
GOP candidates stand the best chance of unseating Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Randy's spirit,'' Armey said before the
$1,000-per-plate lunch at the City Club in the Wells Fargo Center.
``This is a contestable effort, with a great candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hoffman, who beat two other challengers in the primary for
the chance to face Sherman, the backing of party brass has helped
raise funds and rally support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say this is one of the top 10 seats in the
country to win; it's another to have the majority leader come
here,'' he said. ``It underlines the fact that the party is going
to devote whatever resources are necessary to win this seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the race escaped the attention of Democratic leaders.
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., visited the area
last week to campaign on Sherman's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman on Wednesday welcomed Armey's visit, saying the presence
of the staunch conservative belied Hoffman's more moderate
positions. Hoffman, for example, is pro-abortion rights, while
Armey is an abortion foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way for Mr. Hoffman to show us where
he'll stand in the extremely unlikely event he gets to Congress --
he'll stand right with Dick Armey,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he had no problem with differences of opinion between
himself and Hoffman. ``It's not for me to decide who a person
should be on that issue,'' he said. ``I don't believe there is a
litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey also predicted that Sherman and other Democrats up for
election this fall could be tainted by the problems engulfing
President Clinton after his admission of an improper relationship
with a former White House intern. The scandal, he said, will erode
support for Democrats -- even if Republicans don't hammer on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's talking about the Clinton problem,'' he said.
``Dick Armey doesn't need to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's invitation-only luncheon, which raised about
$40,000, drew a small crowd of businessmen and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some were regular party supporters; others were more interested
in the candidate. Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who met Hoffman
when the candidate was head of a company manufacturing
satellite-based positioning systems, attended, as did former
lieutenant governor candidate Noel Irwin-Hentschel.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Calabasas resident Jack Bredehorn said he supports
Hoffman because he wants a congressman who understands the need to
cut taxes affecting small businesses and to reform the education
system. A father and businessman, Hoffman seems to him a logical
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he understands about education, and being in the
business, he knows the whole realm of taxes,'' Bredehorn said.

FEDS SEIZE COMPUTERS, SOFTWARE IN CHILD PORN PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Federal agents investigating an international
child pornography ring raided a suburban home, seizing computers
and software, in one of a series of search warrants served across
the nation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made Wednesday when 10 U.S. Customs Service
agents, backed up by members of a child-abuse task force, searched
the Canoga Park home about 7 p.m. Tuesday, said Customs Service
spokesman Mike Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   With the warrant still under seal, Fleming said he could not
reveal the location of the house or other details, including the
nature of the evidence seized.
</P>
<P>
   The federal warrant was one of 32 served in 22 states in two
days, resulting in four arrests, said Customs Service spokesman
Bill Anthony. In all, investigators in 14 countries have identified
more than 100 suspects, most in the United States, who allegedly
use the Internet to trade child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who exploit children in this way think they can
hide in cyberspace,'' Customs Service Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly
said in a statement. ``They are wrong. We will find them and bring
them to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the speed of Internet communications, the searches in the
United States were done at the same time so the suspects could not
tip each other off, Anthony said. Investigators in other countries
also coordinated their raids, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unprecedented international scope of this investigation is
immensely significant in terms of the number of countries involved
and the level of law enforcement cooperation,'' Fleming said. ``If
you transmit, via the Internet, images of child pornography from
one country into the United States, then that's a federal crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation grew out of a similar case in 1996 in which
the Customs Service identified an international child porn ring
with members in the United States, England, Australia, Canada and
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests of British suspects in the last year led police in that
country to an even larger and more sophisticated international ring
whose members had to meet certain guidelines to join, such as
possessing multiple images of child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   In Canoga Park, agents took two computers and floppy disks.
Fleming said the evidence would be analyzed and that it was too
early to say if any arrests would follow.
</P>
<P>
   The only other raid in California was in National City, in San
Diego County, where agents took computer gear and files from the
home of a 38-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service, enforcing laws against trading child
pornography across the U.S. border, opened its first investigation
into the illicit trade on the Internet in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months ending July 31, agents have arrested 183
people on charges relating to possessing, manufacturing or
distributing child pornography, eventually resulting in convictions
against 189 people.

RANGERS DOWN TIGERS, 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ This is the way it's supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitcher goes six, seven innings. The setup reliever
holds the lead. The All-Star closer finishes it off.
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Effective. Painless ... especially for the manager.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of pitching the Rangers are hoping for as they
chase the Anaheim Angels for the American League West title, and
they got it last night in a 5-3 victory against the Detroit Tigers
at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling showed why manager Johnny Oates is considering
adjusting other starters' schedules and allowing him to pitch every
fifth day down the stretch. Helling survived some early control
troubles to pitch 6 1/3 tough innings for his club-leading 17th
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who has been the workhorse for us all year,''
Oates said. ``He's pitched innings, he's struck people out and he's
won some big ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what's going through Oates' mind when he thinks about his
rotation for the final four weeks of the season. As the rotation
stands now, Helling would not pitch against the Angels in the
Rangers' two remaining series with the division leaders later this
month. Oates could change that by bumping both John Burkett and
Esteban Loiaza by just one day in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Oates would also like to see more of Xavier Hernandez, his most
dependable setup reliever, and All-Star closer John Wetteland.
Those two finished off the Tigers after Helling had thrown 133
pitches, and the Rangers remained 2 1/2 games behind the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to keep battling and keep winning games,'' said
Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who broke open the game with a
two-run home run off Tigers starter Brian Moehler in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly like to have done better this road trip (4-3),
but there's nothing we can do about it now,'' Oates said. ``We're
still in striking distance. We go home for six days; we just need
to win. We need to get people out and continue to score runs. You
can make up two games in a hurry if you're playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed one unearned run in 1 2/3 innings, and while
other Rangers middle relievers have had their problems lately, he
has a 1.26 earned-run average in his past 27 outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel all right,'' Hernandez said. ``I've been keeping the
ball down for the most part and making them hit my pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has been excellent all year, and last night he
recorded his 39th save, second-most in a season in Rangers history.
It was also the 250th save of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitching was pretty good tonight,'' Rodriguez said.
``That's what we need from the starter, six-seven good innings and
the bullpen can take care of the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed six hits and walked four but survived because
the Tigers were 1-for-9 against him with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first inning or two my control wasn't pinpoint, but I made
enough good pitches to get out of some jams,'' said Helling, who
walked four of the first 15 batters he faced. ``This is one of the
flattest mounds in the leagues, and a high fastball pitcher like
me, it takes a little longer to get the ball down. But once I made
the adjustment, everything was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tigers manager Larry Parrish: ``It seems like a couple of
times, when he needed it, he had a little better fastball. He
pitches a little like Palmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrish was referring to Jim Palmer, a three-time Cy Young Award
winner who is now in the Hall of Fame. That's an impressive
comparison for a guy who is in his first full year as a starter.
But Helling has come fast this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to getting a chance,'' Helling said. ``Who's
to say what I could have done a few years ago if I had gotten the
chance. You have to give Johnny and (general manager) Doug Melvin
credit for giving me that chance this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances apparently will increase as the Rangers head down
the stretch.

USC'S CLAIBORNE PUT HIS WEIGHT INTO GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker Chris Claiborne weighed himself
this week and discovered he was five pounds lighter, thanks to
going 83 out of a possible 87 plays against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   But Claiborne wouldn't have it any other way, even if it were
118 degrees at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Claiborne said. ``It didn't hit me until after the
game. I just went home and rested and my mom kept giving me a lot
of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne probably had the best performance of any USC player,
with nine tackles and an interception. He also distinguished
himself with his leadership, keeping calm early despite the fact
Purdue controlled the ball for 13 of the game's first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be honest. I thought, `Oh no, not again (this
season),''' Claiborne said. ``But I decided I've got to stay cool
and keep it to myself. I can't complain. I've got to set an
example.''
</P>
<P>
   The weight loss didn't bother him, even though he dropped to 245
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a lot faster,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back: Linebacker Mark Cusano (hamstring) continues to
work his way back slowly, after being limited to 27 plays against
Purdue. As of today, Zeke Moreno remains the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be a battle,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``When Mark's at the top of his game, I would expect he'll be at
the top at that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall hurting: Strong safety Grant Pearsall said he's
questionable for the San Diego State game and is not going to rush
his return, after straining a ligament in his right knee. ``I came
back a little too soon,'' Pearsall said. ``I don't want to throw
away the whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks, quarterbacks: Freshman Carson Palmer continued to
get equal time at quarterback, although Hackett says he will
eventually give Mike Van Raaphorst 60 percent of the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Wednesday, Palmer continued to be impressive with
several long pass completions.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said if Jason Thomas undergoes ankle surgery, he will
use Quincy Woods as the No.3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Rendon still suspended: Reserve kicker Adam Rendon had a meeting
with Hackett but remains indefinitely suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' Hackett said. ``(But) I'm not saying
that the door is totally closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett refused to provide an explanation of what Rendon would
have to do to get back on the team. Rendon had been originally
suspended for missing classes and study hall sessions.
</P>
<P>
   First-game jitters: The players weren't the only ones nervous
against Purdue. ``We had some plays I called wrong,'' Hackett said.
``I called two plays right out of the (Kansas City) Chiefs'
playbook.''

ADULT VIDEOS, INTERNET PORN BAD NEWS FOR MAGAZINE PUBLISHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA FARRELL AIDEM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- London Press, a publisher in the struggling adult
magazine industry, has put its suburban Valencia plant on the
market for $5.7 million and plans to relocate to a smaller
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old publishing company, which also uses the name
Parliament News, originally sought to lease about 12,000 square
feet of its two-story, 83,000-square-foot building, but on Monday
put up for-sale signs, company President Paul Wisner said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow -- it's because of video,'' Wisner said, referring
to the surging adult video business.
</P>
<P>
   Wisner would not say if the 80-member staff would be retained or
where the business is looking to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't found it yet,'' he said. ``We don't need all this
space. We're looking for about half that.''
</P>
<P>
   London Press, which publishes soft- and hard-core material,
moved to the Valencia Industrial Center from North Hollywood in
1991, sparking protests from a few local residents. But the
business has been low-key, operating quietly within a two-story
tilt-up building with blue trim, surrounded by lush lawns and
trees.
</P>
<P>
   CB Commercial Real Estate is representing the company, said
Craig Peters, senior vice president of the realty company.
</P>
<P>
   With a vacancy rate of less than 2 percent in the industrial
park, the building is already attracting interest, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   London Press was one of the larger adult magazine publishers in
its earlier years but has lost business, said Mark Logan, managing
editor of Adult Video News in Van Nuys, in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magazine industry for adults is slowly dying out,
especially if you're doing harder stuff that's only sold in adult
stores,'' Logan said. ``Store owners and customers get mad if you
have too much advertising, so you end up with a magazine with a $20
cover price. Why would someone pay that when you can get a video
for 15 bucks?''

SUZUKI SPLENDID, BUT MARINER BULLPEN BLOWS LEAD, GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mac Suzuki barely had time to put on his warmup jacket
Wednesday night before the seventh-inning lead he handed the
Mariner bullpen disappeared into the screen above the Green Monster
at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches. One swing. Two runs. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Suzuki's splendid regular-season debut against
the Boston Red Sox produced a kiss-your-sister feeling as the
Mariners ended their nine-game road trip with a 7-3 loss before
25,813 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benjamin smacked a game-tying homer off right-hander Jose
Paniagua on a 1-and-0 pitch to cap a three-run seventh inning and
pull the American League wild-card-leading Red Sox even.
</P>
<P>
   They won it in the ninth on Nomar Garciaparra's grand slam off
Bobby Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's infield single off third baseman Russ Davis' glove
led off the inning. A sacrifice bunt and two walks preceded
Garciaparra's 30th homer of the season, coming on the first pitch
Ayala fed him.
</P>
<P>
   The towering drive would have won the game regardless because
there was one out. But the slam added some gusto to the Red Sox's
42nd come-from-behind win this season _ the second time they beat
Seattle with a ninth-inning slam.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn did it on April 10 when Boston scored seven
ninth-inning runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see what happened with their side and our side,''
manager Lou Piniella said. ``It was a parallel for both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are headed to the playoffs and the Mariners are not.
</P>
<P>
   Without a playoff berth to chase in September, the Mariners are
using the month to examine potential roster players for next
season. Suzuki warranted a look-see after finishing the Class AAA
season at Tacoma with a 2-1 record and 1.55 ERA in six August
starts.
</P>
<P>
   What worked in the minors also was working Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Red Sox to two hits over six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed a lot of poise out there and a good arm,'' Piniella
said. ``He is vastly improved and it was exciting watching him
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander wobbled in the first inning, when he walked two
batters with two outs. He struggled again in the second when the
Red Sox put two more runners on base and again in the third when
ex-Mariner Darren Bragg led off with a double to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   But Suzuki retired the next three batters and by the time he
pitched from the stretch again, the Mariners led, 3-0. They should
have been ahead by many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances to score tons of runs,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners accumulated 15 hits, but stranded 14 runners.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had six hits and stranded eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke,'' said hitting coach Jesse Barfield of the missed
scoring opportunities. ``I've said it all year and I'll say it
again, you have to beat guys by going to the opposite field. You
can't hook (pull) the ball all the time, especially against good
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's put 11 runners in scoring position. Two scored.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Buhner produced the other run with a titanic solo homer to
left-center in the sixth inning. The ball cleared the wall, the
screen, the street and landed on the roof of a building.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 2-0 at the time and made it a three-run lead in the
seventh when they loaded the bases with none out but had to settle
for one run.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki went to work in the seventh inning with a string of 12
straight outs. Then he walked Mike Stanley, got an out, and
surrendered a run-scoring double to pinch-hitting Mandy Romero.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua, who has been solid as a setup reliever since being
promoted from Tacoma last month, twice shook off signs from catcher
John Marzano. Paniagua threw Benjamin a fastball and yanked his
head to watch the flight of the ball.

<P>
   ``It's my fault for letting (Paniagua) shake me off,'' Marzano
said. ``I usually don't let a young pitcher do that, but this time
I did. I wanted to throw (Benjamin) a slider. Then I called for a
splitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only pitch Benjamin can hit out is a four-seam fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua threw a four-seamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he threw it, I thought `Oh, no,''' Marzano said.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki threw what Marzano wanted and carried a nifty two-hitter
into the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is I went 61/3 innings,'' Suzuki said. ``The
bad thing is I walked the leadoff guy in the seventh. Then
everything got screwed up. I shouldn't have walked that guy.''
