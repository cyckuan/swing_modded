<HEADLINE> Feature: Tucson Holds Historic Event to Boost U.S.-African Energy Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S. December 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-Africa Energy
Ministerial Conference, the first continent-wide of African energy
ministers, is scheduled to kick off in the City of Tucson in the
southern state of Arizona on Monday evening to create a positive
environment for investment in Africa's energy infrastructure, set
up new markets for oil and gas development.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has described the
event as a way to promote technologies that will foster economic
development and engineering growth in a way which protects Africa'
s precious environment for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"This important international conference will bring together
senior government officials and industry and financial
representatives to address critical energy issues facing African
nations and help fulfill the vision for a clean energy future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Holding the conference in Tucson will give the ministers an
opportunity to see first hand the city's successful adoption of
sustainable energy development as a framework for public decisions,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tucson is extremely honored to host this historic event," said
the mayor of Tucson, George Miller. "It's a unique opportunity to
share the strategies and challenges that exist in the areas of
sustainable technologies and energy systems."
</P>
<P>
Tucson is a national leader in supporting and implementing
energy and resource conservation efforts through the Livable
Tucson Program. The city participates in U.S. Department of Energy
's Clean Cities and Million Solar Roofs program as well as U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's and the Department of Energy's
joint Star and Climate Wise projects.
</P>
<P>
The new community of Civano is the cornerstone of the city's
energy efficiency focus and sets the standard for all public
facility construction.
</P>
<P>
With more than 250 days of sunshine per year, Tucson is
surrounded by lush desert and beautiful mountains. From the city,
Arizona stretches some 103 kilometers to the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
Four mountain ranges cradle Tucson, each marking the point of a
compass: the massive Catalina range looming to the north, Santa
Rita to the south, Rincon to the east and the Tucson Mountain to
the west. From a distance, they appear as blue-grey cutouts on a
sky that is sapphire blue in the cool months of fall and winter
and almost white in the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
For at least two thousand years, people have lived in the
foothills of those mountains among the towering saguaros. Today,
Tucson remains inextricably tied to its roots. It is a place where
streets make strange twists and turns through time. And even as
the city pushes forward into the 21st century, the essence of an
older Tucson -- "The Old Pueblo" -- remains.
</P>
<P>
Much of Tucson's rich history is evident downtown. A few blocks
north of the modern-city hubbub of Congress Street is the Presidio
District, named for the fort established by the Royal Army of
Spain in 1775. This is where one of Tucson's oldest homes, La Casa
Cordova, is located. Built in early 1850s, the house is now part
of the Tucson Museum of Art complex.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the midst of the picturesque Sonoran Desert, Tucson
offers a variety of awe-inspiring sights, from a world-renowned
zoo to the country's last remaining Titan missile silo. The
Saguaro cactus -- an icon of the Sonoran Desert -- is the largest
cactus native to the United States and can grow to as tall as 15
meters and weigh eight tons. With life spans of 200 years, they
may not sprout their first branches until they are 75 years old.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably this time, people gather here not for ice skiing,
they are here to attend the event to foster a closer energy
partnership between the United States and Africa. More than 500
participants are expected to be present at the conference
including African energy ministers, international organizations,
private sector representatives, regional African organizations and
academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, the U.S.-Africa Energy Ministers Meeting
creates a successful of our two continents that commemorates a
mutual respect for global culture and environmental awareness,"
said the mayor of Tucson.

<HEADLINE> Iran Sets up Emergency Center to Cope With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has set up an emergency
center to help fend off possible damages to the domestic
industries done by the millennium bug, or the Y2K problem,
Gholamhussein Narjabadian, official from Iran's Electronics
Council, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Narjabadian said the center has now become operational in the
capital city Tehran and is ready to offer free services to the
applicants, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The center will also provide applicants with technical
information and assist them to identify and remove the existing
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, a programming defect that would lead computers
to mistake the year 2000 for 1900, might affect the production
process of various industrial sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on managers and officials to pay due attention to the
issue and make sure of the smoothness of their running systems.

<HEADLINE> EU Observers Satisfied with Mozambican Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's joint
Observer Mission has concluded that Mozambique's general elections
were "free and fair."
</P>
<P>
Presenting a preliminary report from the 64 EU observers at a
Maputo press conference on Sunday, the head of the Mission, Pertti
Paasio, said they believed that "polling has been conducted in a
free and fair manner allowing the Mozambican people to express
their will, and that the election results will validly reflect
this".
</P>
<P>
Paasio said his observers believed the problems and
irregularities that occurred during the elections of December 3-5
"are of such a minor scale that they do not in any way invalidate
the outcome of the polls".
</P>
<P>
Among the irregularities EU observers noted were illegal
campaign activities, by both the contending parties of Renamo and
Frelimo, in the period after the close of the official
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The observers, who visited 750 polling stations (nine per cent
of the total) in 34 districts, concluded that the stations "were
generally well managed. Polling station staff were well trained,
efficient and organized".
</P>
<P>
The EU team found that staff were careful to avoid any
impression of bias, and thought that at times this led them not to
give sufficient explanation to voters as to how to mark the ballot
papers.
</P>
<P>
The observers noted that elderly citizens in particular had
difficulty in understanding what to do, and sometimes just folded
the ballot paper and dropped it into the box unmarked.
</P>
<P>
Paasio said that the unanimous conclusion of the EU observers
was that the Mozambican elections were "second to none" of all the
elections they had ever observed.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Likely to Delay Vote on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is likely to take action on a new Iraq resolution
Tuesday instead of doing so Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council held a brief meeting on Iraq
Monday morning. Speaking to the press after the meeting, Council
President for the current month Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said
the vote would likely to happen later today or probably tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, Russia, China and France are
expected to veto the draft resolution if it is put for vote Monday,
and in order to get support from the full members of the Security
Council, Britain and the United States decided to delay the vote.
</P>
<P>
The council members are still divided on the main section of
the draft resolution, precisely what would trigger the suspension
of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq, and the current wording of the
draft resolution is too ambiguous and could be used to keep the
sanctions, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been pushing for the vote on
the draft resolution which has met with objections from some
members of the council, namely China, Russia and France, three of
the five permanent members of the council.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain seek to re-establish a U.N.
weapons inspection regime for Iraq at an earlier date amid the
concern that Iraq might have used the vacuum and revived its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors have been away from Iraq since the
U.S.-led military strikes against country last December. Iraq has
barred them from returning unless the sanctions against the
country get lifted.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. Iraq must be free of weapons of mess destruction before
the sanctions can be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Refuses to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Prime Minister
Radu Vasile went live on national television on Monday evening
stressing he would not resign from office.
</P>
<P>
Vasile made the declaration after the main ruling Christian
Democratic National Peasant Party(CDNPP) had withdrawn all its
ministers from the government, in an attempt to force Prime
Minister Radu Vasile to resign.
</P>
<P>
CDNPP had more than one third of the portfolios in the current
cabinet: interior minister, agriculture minister, environment
minister, minister of public works and physical planning,
education minister, culture minister as well as minister for
European integration.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberal Party, a alliance of CDNPP in the ruling
coalition, was reported to follow the latter's action, withdrawing
all its three ministers from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier, the intention to change Vasile from office
seemingly belongs both to a wing of the his own party and to
President Emil Constantinescu and has circulated for a longer
lapse of time.
</P>
<P>
According to the supporters of the reshuffle, Vasile has eroded
his credibility, the capital of sympathy, the political and
managerial resources.
</P>
<P>
Vasile was appointed prime minister in early 1996 after his
predecessor Victor Ciorbea was forced to resign in a dispute among
the ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Africa to Open Energy Ministerial Conference in Tucson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S.-Africa Energy Ministerial Conference, scheduled for
December 13-15, will kick off on Monday evening, and the event is
hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy and the city of Tucson,
which has made sustainable energy development a pillar of public
policy.
</P>
<P>
"This conference is expected to assemble ministers and
officials from Africa and the United States, and from industry and
the financial community, to address critical energy issues facing
African nations," U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be the first international gathering of its
kind, involving all the African continent's energy ministers, and
a big step towards a clean energy culture future for Africa,
organizers here said.
</P>
<P>
It also follows up on U.S. Bill Clinton's historic trip to
Africa last year, which was aimed at closer U.S.-African ties in
politics and economy in addition to more U.S. investment into the
energy-rich continent.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference advertises its main purposes -- "A
Partnership for the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
The organizers here are expecting some 500 participants from
government, industry, academia and non-government organizations. "
This indicates both a broad interest in partnerships between
Africa and the United States and the need for wide-ranging
cooperation to fulfill the potential of those partnerships,"
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
Energy ministers from countries including Mozambique, Uganda,
Nigeria and South Africa are expected to deliver speeches at the
conference, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who has said that he had "traveled through Africa
and seen the continent's promise firsthand," will deliver a speech
at the opening welcome reception on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be organized into two parts. The first will
feature round-table discussions among governments, industry and
financial representatives on such issues as attracting private
investment, financing energy development, energy integration, and
sustainable energy development. Participating in these discussions
will be a cross-section of industry, organizers here said.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the conference will be a meeting of African
energy ministers in which they, together with the senior officials
from the U.S. Department of Energy, will discuss clean energy
development and investment principles for the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Energy development in Africa is important to the United States.
In 1998, Africa exported 1.4 million barrels of Oil a day to the
United States, which accounted for about 17 percent of U.S. oil
imports. At present, Africa is the eighth largest exporters of
petroleum to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Soaring Oil Price Sends Factory Gate Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) - Official figures released Monday
show that factory gate inflation in Britain is continuing to pick
up, while the cost of raw materials is also rising.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of increase in the price of goods leaving the
factory gate last month was 2.1 percent compared to 1.9 percent in
October, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase was related to the soaring price of
petroleum related products used in production. However, prices of
finished goods were unchanged in November from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said crude oil prices rose 10 percent on the month,
which left them 123.3 percent higher on the year -the fastest
annual rise since records began in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The crude oil price impact added 1.2 percent to the November
unadjusted input price index and 7.5 points in the 12 months to
November.
</P>
<P>
The input prices were up by a seasonally-adjusted 1.7 percent
on the month, more than double the average forecast of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the input prices were 9.1 percent higher than a
year earlier - the largest increase since September 1995.

Hundreds of firemen used bottles and smoking producing devices

The demonstration of firemen was directly provoked by the death

<P>
Firemen across France have been demonstrating asking the
government to recognizing their job as one of the most dangerous,
which would let them retire at the age of 50.
</P>
<P>
But the government only agrees to give the firemen either the
right of workers of dangerous jobs or the right to retire at 50

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Africa to Develop Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Monday urged African countries to find ways of integrating
traditional medicine into their health care systems.
</P>
<P>
The WHO in 1978 recommended that proven traditional practices
and remedies be incorporated in national programs for the
provision of essential drugs for primary health care, WHO regional
director for Africa Ebrahim Samba said at a three-day meeting in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
The WHO meeting was aimed at advising the African members on
the strategy for traditional medicine from 2001 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this policy orientation, traditional medicine
practices and remedies have not been integrated into health
systems in a scientific manner and in a way that is socially and
culturally acceptable," Samba said.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the reasons for the non-integration was the
mistrust between Western trained health professionals and
non-Western trained practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Samba said legal and policy instruments in countries should
address the contribution of traditional medicine practitioners in
health systems and how they could be utilized in disease
prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
The WHO regional office for Africa is developing a 10-year
strategy on traditional medicine for its more rational use within
sustainable health care systems.

<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt
and Development said Monday that civic society must monitor the
country's debt to force the government to be accountable.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the coalition Jonah Gokova told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that Zimbabwe was trapped in a debt crisis because the
government depended on foreign institutions like the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank for borrowing.
</P>
<P>
He said if civic society monitored how the debts were acquired
and how the money was used the government would be cautious in its
borrowing as there would be advise from other groups.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is not only the civic society that is supposed to
monitor the government's borrowing tendencies, Parliament also has
a major role to play," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need more people to take an interest in monitoring the use
of borrowed funds to make the government accountable and
transparent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of civic groups had already come together
under the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development to develop
the capacity to monitor how borrowed money was used by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had been struggling to pay-off its foreign debt which
had risen to more than 171 billion Zimbabwean dollars (4.5 billion
U.S. dollars) over the past years with analysts predicting that
the debt would rise as the country continued to borrow money to
stabilize the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
The domestic debt has also soared to 73 billion Zimbabwean
dollars (1.92 billion U.S. dollars) after the government
back-tracked on an earlier pledge to stop borrowing through the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe overdraft.
</P>
<P>
Gokova said the debt burden was stifling development as money
was being channelled to service the debt at the expense of
developmental programs.

<HEADLINE> Girl's Educational Status Improved in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of educational
status of Iranian girls during the past decade was "eye-catching
and praiseworthy," the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
said on Monday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Children's Condition in the Year 2000"
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying that the
percentage of girl student enrollments in Iranian primary schools
have risen to 96 percent from 80 percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, 80 percent of school-age girls have been
enrolled in rural educational centers, compared with 60 percent
five years ago, while 52 percent of female students found their
ways to state universities.
</P>
<P>
Based on a research conducted in three Iranian provinces, 25
percent of families, who refused to send their girls to schools,
believed that education of their girls would have nothing to do
with their future roles as mothers and wives, the report said .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 43 percent of families cited economic problems
as reason for not sending their female members to schools, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Angola Issues New Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Angola's new currency Kwanza
officially entered into circulation on Monday with the exchange
rate of one U.S. dollar for 5.74 kwanza. The Angolan government
said in a communique that former currency Readjusted Kwanza (one
Kwanza equal to one million Readjusted Kwanza) will not circulate
until May 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although Monday's edition of the official newspaper Jornal de
Angola was priced at two Kwanza, in most shops and supermarkets,
commodities have only price tags counted in the Readjusted
Kwanza.
</P>
<P>
The Readjusted Kwanza devalued rapidly since it was introduced
four years ago, with the note of the largest face value having six
"zeros", making trouble for customers and business.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan National Assembly approved a law on replacing
Readjusted Kwanza with the new currency Kwanza on November 9.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Mechanism to Back Syria in Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa proposed on Monday that an Arab mechanism be set up in a
bid to support Syria in its peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Such a mechanism, which could be formed through consultations
at bilateral, trilateral or multilateral level, can also provide
support for all Arab negotiators in the Middle East peace process,
Moussa was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel have agreed to resume their peace talks on
Wednesday in Washington after a freeze of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are to discuss thorny issues including
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast War, security arrangements and normalization
of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa paid a one-day visit to Damascus on Sunday and held
talks with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Sharaa on the upcoming
Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders coordinated stances on the Middle East peace
process. Moussa expressed Egypt's readiness to host the
negotiations between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lebanon's peace talks with Israel, Moussa said
"Egypt is concerned with the Lebanese track as much as the Syrian
one."
</P>
<P>
However, "there are no specific contacts" between Egypt and
Lebanon in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Lebanese-Israeli peace talks may be
resumed some time after the restart of the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a border strip in south Lebanon as a
"security zone" since 1985 to allegedly ward off attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas on its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been the power broker of Lebanon and is stations more
than 30,000 troops there as peacekeepers. The two countries agree
to coordinate stances on key issues in peace talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Final-status Framework Agreement Not Imminent: Rabbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator
Yasser Abed Rabbo said Monday that the Palestinians and Israel
will not reach a framework agreement on final-status issues
sooner than scheduled, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the 10th session of final-status talks with his
Israeli counterpart Oded Eran at the Erez checkpoint, Rabbo
denied media reports that the two sides will finish a first draft
of the framework agreement within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo also reiterated the Palestinians' stand on the Jewish
settlement issue, urging the Israeli government to freeze all
settlement activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
There are no reported progresses in Monday's session, but the
two sides agreed to hold further talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Palestinians threatened to suspend the
permanent-status talks to protest Israeli issuance of tenders for
construction of 500 new units in settlements.
</P>
<P>
With the mediation of United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the Palestinian National Authority decided to
resume the talks, but to keep the settlement issue on top of the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum signed in September,
Israelis and Palestinians should reach a framework agreement on
the final-status issues by next February and a final accord on
permanent peace by September 13, 2000.

<P>
PARIS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- France is seeking a consensus
among all United Nations Security Council permanent members on a
resolution on Iraq which will suspend U.N. sanctions while
renewing disarmament control, said French Foreign Ministry
officials on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council was scheduled to vote a resolution on
Iraq on Monday, but the voting could be postponed because of
persistent differences among council members.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a resolution which could be accepted by all
the people, including the Iraqis in its aspects of application,"
Agence France-Presse quoted a French diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
France, which has been pleading for months for a consensus on
such a resolution on Iraq, is contacting ambassadors and foreign
ministers of the other four U.N. Security Council permanent member
countries, said the same source.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council extended for six months last Friday the "
oil for food" program with Iraq, which allows Baghdad to export a
limited amount of oil products in exchange for medicines and other
daily necessities.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Help Make Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy Terry Larson said here Monday
that the U.N. will make every effort to help make the upcoming
Syrian-Israeli talks successful.
</P>
<P>
After separate talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud,
House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Larson
told a news conference that the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
talks is a historical incident and each party concerned should
seize the opportunity to achieve a lasting and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
He added that the United States is ready to offer any help so
as to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Lebanon will join the talks at a proper
time.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that
Israel and Syria have agreed to resume peace negotiations "at the
point where they left off" in 1996 and the talks will start
Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Talks on Syrian and Lebanese tracks have been suspended since
Israel's former hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon want a simultaneous Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the strategic plateau of Golan Heights from
Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
It set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim to stop cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Larson said their talks also covered the role the
U.N. peacekeeping forces could play in the event of an Israeli
pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Larson will inspect the U.N. forces
and confer on the spot with field commanders at the forces'
headquarters in the southern border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
The 45,000-strong U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon, which was
installed after the first Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978,
consists of soldiers from Ireland, Ghana, Nepal, Fiji, India,
Finland, Poland, France and Italy.

<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday that a
vote at the United Nations on conditions for suspending sanctions
against Iraq would not take place before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably going to be tomorrow. We need another day's work
on the text to see whether we can secure votes," a Reuters report
quoted a Foreign Office spokesman as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Britain and the United States were still trying
to narrow differences with Russia, particularly on the question of
what exactly would trigger a suspension in the sanctions, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be another day of hard talking in New York. We
think we're pretty much there -- there have been quite a lot of
telephone calls today," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the disagreements were partly over substance and partly
over language in the planned resolution which Moscow was averse to.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has been divided for over a year on
how to find a way of returning weapons inspectors to Iraq in
return for the prospect of an easing in sanctions. It had been
expected to vote on a draft resolution later on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Company Plans to Boost Refining Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait National Petroleum
Company (KNPC) has drawn up a plan to increase the refining
capacity of its three refineries to about 1.3 million barrels per
day (bpd) from the current 930,000 bpd, said a KNPC official
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The company's major long-term strategy is to keep its
refineries competitive with international ones, which are running
in high gear, said Sami Fahed al-Rashaid, vice-chairman of KNPC.
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of doing this, especially if we double our
efforts and utilize available energy to achieve the target,"
Rashaid told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said KNPC was also looking for a production of 950,000 bpd
of oil derivatives with the current facilities within years.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait possesses a crude reserve of nearly 100 billion
barrels, or 10 percent of the world's total, and has a production
capacity of over 2 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The three refineries maintained a capacity of a little more
than 800,000 bpd before they were damaged during Iraq's invasion
and occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
The refineries underwent a program of repairing and upgrading
after the 1991 Gulf war. Their capacity reached almost 900,000 bpd
in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports account for about 90 percent of the output from the
three refineries.
</P>
<P>
KNPC, a subsidiary of state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation,
handles local refining and distribution.
</P>
<P>
According to Rashaid, KNPC gained moderate profits estimated
at 15.8 million Kuwaiti dinars (52.14 million U.S. dollars) in
the fiscal 1998-1999 ended on June 30.
</P>
<P>
He attributed low profits to the sharp decline of oil and oil
derivatives' prices in 1998 and early this year.
</P>
<P>
But Rashaid said that KNPC intended to increase its profits to
200 million dollars before next June.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: East Asia: From Deep Crisis to Steady Recovery (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- East Asia is finally waking up
from the nightmare of a two-year-old financial crisis, as the
region has returned to growth in 1999 much faster than expected.
</P>
<P>
The initial recovery is a clear sign that East Asian economies,
after learning lessons from the outbreak of the crisis, are now
better prepared for the intensification of globalization, a double-
edge sword, as described by economists.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, East Asia is not out of the woods yet, but its
steady economic recovery from a severe crisis this year is a
pleasant surprise to many people.
</P>
<P>
Just a year ago, few economists, business executives or
government officials doubted that Asia was heading for a long
economic recession and recovery would be a slow and painful
process.
</P>
<P>
However, as 1999 is drawing to a close, the region's economic
picture is brighter than expected. Based on economic performances
in the first half of the year, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
estimated recently that South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia
and the Philippines, the five countries most hit by the crisis,
will all register positive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ADB, South Korea's gross domestic product (GDP)
will grow 9 percent this year from a 5.8 percent contraction last
year, while Thailand 3 percent from a 9.4 percent contraction in
1998. Even Indonesia, whose GDP declined 13.2 percent last year,
could see positive growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the steady recovery, the ADB said, the regional
economy is expected to grow 5.7 percent this year, or 3.4 percent
higher than it forecast earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the East Asian financial market, which experienced a
turmoil in 1997 and 1998, has become relatively calm in 1999.
Despite the launch of Euro, the appreciation of the Japanese yen
and the rise in the U.S. interest rates during the year, East
Asian currencies rebounded positively and continued their
appreciations. With stronger investor confidence in East Asia,
stock markets in the region have also recovered to the pre-crisis
level.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators wound up the 10th round of final-status talks in the
Israeli border town of Erez Monday afternoon with no headway on
the settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour session, Palestinian chief negotiator for
final-status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo called upon the Israeli
government to stop all forms of settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports that the two sides are to reach a framework
agreement soon, saying the continued Jewish settlement activities
in the occupied territories are obstructing such consensus.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations will continue on Thursday, he added.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks between the Palestinian and the Israeli
side, headed by Oded Eran, kicked off early last month to discuss
thorny issues including the Palestinian statehood, Jerusalem, the
Palestinian refugees and water resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Now we are comfortably out of the recession," Bank Negara
Malaysian Governor Ali Abul Hassan declared. "Confidence has
returned."
</P>
<P>
From deep recessions to a steady recovery, the positive changes
taking place in the region have resulted from economic reforms and
adjustments by East Asian countries, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, East Asian countries have tried their best
to transform their vulnerable banking systems to adapt to the
globalization. They have consolidated their banking systems by
merging small banks into big ones, boosting bank capital and
opening up to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
While Indonesia closed 64 financial institutions in the year to
repair its banking systems, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea
allowed foreigners to buy majority shares of their banks to boost
capital.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the central bank has stopped issuing
licenses to new banks to encourage acquisitions and mergers of the
existing financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, governments across the region have tapped
potentials of their home market by spending massive amounts on
public-works projects, strengthening the service sector and
stimulating domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficits of East Asian countries have increased to 5-8
percent of their GDP so far this year because of the massive
spending on public projects.
</P>
<P>
Countries in the region are also printing money to keep
interest lower and exporting as much as possible to the booming U.
S. and European markets.
</P>
<P>
While these moves have effectively promoted a faster-than-
expected recovery in the crisis-hit countries this year, the
external conditions, or the positive impact of globalization on
the regional economies, have also fueled the recovery in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Among those external factors were China's commitment to non-
devaluation of its currency helping the stabilization of the
regional financial market, the booming U.S. economy absorbing more
East Asian products and the stronger yen increasing Japan's
imports from the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since East Asian countries have deepened financial and economic
reforms in the year, they have become more capable of gaining from
the globalization and offsetting its negative impact, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the encouraging economic performance does not
mean that East Asia would create a new economic miracle too soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economists warned that East Asian economies remain burdened
with a weak banking system, excessive capacity, excessive debt-
equity ratio and shortage of necessary foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a full recovery and long-term economic health, there
is no substitute for the thorough reforms that have yet to be
achieved, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments must be the pro-active agents of change -- the
architecture of reform -- if a faster and more sustained recovery
is to be achieved," said Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai at the
World Economic Forum's East Asia Conference in Singapore in
October. "To rebuild our economies in the aftermath of the crisis,
structural change is a must."
</P>
<P>
Structural changes remain a hard job for East Asian economies
in the next few years if they want to make their financial and
economic systems strong enough to adapt to the globalization.
</P>
<P>
For most Southeast Asian countries, their recovery this year
depended too much on exports of electronics, which account for
over 50 percent of their total exports, economists said.
</P>
<P>
But the future of the electronics market is uncertain as
demands for some products have already become weak after a
recovery started at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
East Asian countries must develop more high-tech products for
exports instead of some lower value-added traditional products, in
order to increase their shares in the world market, where
competition is fiercer with the intensification of the
globalization, economists said.
</P>
<P>
As for the region's banking system, more effective remedies
must be found for the massive non-performing loans, which are as
high as 10-60 percent of their total lendings in some East Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
"If non-performing loans cannot be resolved, the recovery
cannot be sustained," said Praphad Phodhivorakhun, vice chairman
of the Federation of Thai Industries.
</P>
<P>
Since the weak banking system is preventing banks from playing
an active role in the recovery process, East Asian countries must
create more favorable conditions for foreign investments, which
are still very low compared with that before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides these domestic problems, the further rise in the U.S.
interest rates and the slow recovery process in Japan are likely
to have a negative impact on the regional economy next year.
</P>
<P>
But economists said that so long as East Asian countries
continue their financial reforms and economic adjustments, they
could achieve higher economic growth and gain more from the
globalization next year.

BUCHAREST, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Romania's main ruling
Christian Democratic National Peasant Party on Monday decided to
withdraw all its ministers from the government, in an attempt to
force Prime Minister Radu Vasile to resign, media reports said
here.
</P>
<P>
The intention to change Vasile from office seemed to come from
a wing of the his own party and President Emil Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
Since Vasile has made clear that he will never hand in his
resignation and the president does not have the Constitutional
means to dismiss the prime minister, this task has been left to
the main ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Vasile was appointed prime minister in early 1996 after his
predecessor Victor Ciorbea was forced to resign in a dispute among
the ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Concerned Over Food Shortage in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday again
expressed concern over the growing shortage of food in Kabul and
other parts of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan would continue to help
the Afghans despite its own constraints.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman appealed to the international community to
provide assistance to Afghanistan in "this hour of trial."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government issued a statement last Saturday
calling for attention from the world to its war-torn neighbor's
food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report from Kabul said the desperately needed U.N.
aid has started arriving in Afghanistan for tens of thousands of
refugees stranded in the region.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations convoy carrying emergency food and clothing
last week was allowed to cross the Afghan frontlines north of
Kabul to enter the Panjsher valley after negotiations between the
Taliban and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 65,000 Afghan people have fled their
homes to escape fighting and are now facing an uncertain winter
without proper food and shelter.

<HEADLINE> Mental Disorders Common in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13(Xinhua) -- Nearly one in every five
Americans experiences a mental disorder and half of all Americans
have such disorders at some time in their lives, according to a
report of the surgeon general of the United States issued here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, most of people with mental disorders never seek
treatment as they do not realize that effective treatment exists,
or they fear discrimination because of the stigma attached to
mental illness, Surgeon General David Satcher said in his report.
And many people cannot afford treatment because they lack
insurance that would cover it, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "mental illness, including suicide, is the
second leading cause of disability" after heart disease, but "
nearly two-thirds of all people with diagnosable mental disorders
do not seek treatment".
</P>
<P>
Mental disorders are defined in the report as health conditions
marked by alterations in thinking, mood or behavior that cause
distress or impair a person's ability to function. They include
Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention-deficit or
hyperactivity disorder and phobias.
</P>
<P>
"Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General" reviews 3,000
academic studies on mental health and mental illness and has been
in the works since Satcher took office in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The report's principal recommendation to the American people
is to seek help if you have a mental health problem or think you
have symptoms of a mental disorder," it said.
</P>
<P>
Satcher argues that people with mental health problems and
mental illnesses can live happier, more productive lives with the
help of therapy and medication.
</P>
<P>
But without help, someone who begins sad can become clinically
depressed, and ultimately even suicidal. Untreated, the most
severely ill can end up homeless or criminal.

<HEADLINE> New FM Radio Station Launched in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A new FM radio station,
HornAfrik Radio, was officially launched here Monday after its
long silence following the collapse of the factional radios for
economic or technical reasons.
</P>
<P>
A loud and clear music coming from the radio station has
attracted the attention of many Somalis, especially in Mogadishu
and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Program manager of HornAfrik, Ahmed Abdisalan Aden, said that
the radio station is business-oriented instead of being allied
with any of the political organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that HornAfrik radio has been founded and owned by
Somalis living both in and outside the country, aimed at filling
and benefiting from the gap created by the absence of the other
radios in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that broadcasters from all sides of Mogadishu
are working in this new radio station, some people still say that
it is another radio station for faction leader Hussein Mohamed
Aidid.
</P>
<P>
HornAfrik Radio station has found its headquarters in Gubta
area of south Mogadishu and it has been transmitting local and
international music in the past two days during its test period.
</P>
<P>
Neutral news and non-political public service messages are
broadcast in Somali language.
</P>
<P>
The engineers said that during the month of Ramadan, the radio
will be on the air for six hours beginning from 4:00 p.m. local
time, but after the Ramadan the transmission period would be
extended to 12 hours from midday to midnight everyday.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali Afey Dhildug, one of the engineering staff of
HornAfrik radio station, their radio message can reach Jowhar
town, 90 km north of Mogadishu, and Merca town, 100 km south of
the capital. The studio uses relatively advanced technology,
including digital system.

<HEADLINE> India Asks Foreign Firms to Resume Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Monday
asked the U.S. major Cogentrix and Hong Kong-based China Light and
Power Company to review their decision to withdraw from the 1,000
mw Manglore Power Project in south India's Karnataka state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court quashed a probe order of
the Central Bureau of Investigation given by the Karnataka High
Court into the alleged kickbacks in the awarding of the 39.48
billion rupee (918.14 million U.S. dollar) project.
</P>
<P>
Power Minister P. R. Kumaramangalam said the government would
give counter guarantee for the project once the promoters conveyed
their willingness for resume the project.
</P>
<P>
"I told the representatives of the two companies to intimate
their respective Boards about the government's views along with
the Supreme Court judgment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two multinationals announced last week their withdrawal
from the prestigious fast track project, citing delays in
government clearances and legal wrangles.
</P>
<P>
Congentrix had 60 percent equity of the project while the Hong
Kong firm held the remaining 40 percent equity.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM to Visit Turkey Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou will visit Turkey early next month to sign bilateral
agreements on a range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The Athens daily "The News" Monday quoted Papandreou as said
that he hoped to be able to visit the neighboring country in
January.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Ankara, Papandreou would sign half of the
bilateral agreements and his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem would
visit Athens at a later date to sign the rest of the pacts.
</P>
<P>
The texts of the five bilateral agreements referred to tourist
cooperation, the environment, issues of security for citizens,
economic cooperation and cooperation in the scientific and
technologic sectors, avoidance of double taxation, investment
protection, shipping cooperation and cooperation in the energy
field, according to diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece reiterated Monday that the only valid dispute with
Ankara that it recognized was the delimitation of the Aegean
continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that Greece was
not obliged to consent to discussing any issue raised by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if there was to be dialogue between the two
neighbors, it was Turkey's obligation to approach the issues in a
peaceful manner.

<HEADLINE> Defense Policy IS In Right Direction, Says NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) acknowledged Monday that European Union's new
defense policy announced at its Helsinki Summit "is a very
important step in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General George Robertson said that he welcomes
the results of the European Council meeting in Helsinki, where EU
leaders
finally approved a plan for setting up a rapid reaction force as
part of common European security and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said on numerous occasions, a stronger Europe means
a stronger Alliance. A stronger European role will reinforce the
Alliance for the 21st century," Robertson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Helsinki Summit is a very important step in the right
direction. We look forward to cooperating with the EU in a manner
that is both transparent to, and inclusive of, all NATO allies,"
the NATO chief said.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders during the summit expressed a clear desire that
they want to be able to deploy up to 60,000 troops at short notice,
and maintain the force at least for a year. The European
autonomous force will be in response to "international crises".
Its main task in early the next century will be dealt with crisis
management, in particular peacekeeping, humanitarian relief or
rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
However, Europe's new defense policy has caused concerns in the
United States that a new European force might detract from NATO
and undermine trans-Atlantic alliance. Therefore, NATO's statement
suggested that European Union be in the right direction if the 15-
nation bloc enhanced its defense cooperation while sticking to the
close ties with NATO, observers believe.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
canceled a fund-raising trip Monday after suffering from a bad
cold.
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit better this morning, but he's still pretty
knocked out," said White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
Toiv said the illness included flu-like symptoms. A White House
spokesman said Sunday that the president had a mild case of the
flu.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was resting at the White House so as to take part in
the Middle East peace talks between Egyptian and Syrian leaders
scheduled to be held later this week in Washington, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Toiv said the president's doctor was confident he would be able
to participate in the talks so long as he got sufficient rest over
the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
White House officials said Clinton had been struggling with
symptoms since Wednesday, and a weekend trip to Florida and
Arkansas exacerbated the problem. Clinton had planned to travel to
Houston for political fund-raising.

OTTAWA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Households spent an average 51,
360 Canadian dollars (about 34,822 U.S. dollars) in 1998, up three
percent from the previous year, Statistics Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Personal taxes claimed just over 21 percent of the household
budget, while shelter cost another 20 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and food each took up just over 10 percent,
which was similar to that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Northwest Territories had the highest average of 71,200
Canadian dollars (about 48,274 U.S. dollars) in household spending.
Ontario followed with an average of 57,170 dollars (about 38,761 U.
S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Newfoundland saw the lowest average level of 41,020 dollars (

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Does not Expect Volte-Face in Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government said Monday
that it does not expect Turkey to immediately change its stance on
the Cyprus issue following the European Union's (EU) decision to
grant it candidate status.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by Turkey's Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem that they will not make
any concessions on Cyprus, Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said "I do not expect Turkey to make a complete
volte-face in 24-hours."
</P>
<P>
However, Kasoulides said a new environment is being created and
there is an effort for conciliation.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Greece and Cyprus have an obligation to
make full use of the results of the EU's Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, accompanying President Glafcos Clerides in New York
to attend the proximity talks on Cyprus between the two Cypriot
communities under the auspices of the United Nations, said that
the Helsinki conclusion on Cyprus is "an important victory for
Greece."
</P>
<P>
He said Greece "gave a big diplomatic fight and succeeded
mainly in politically disassociating, at the highest EU level,
the solution of the Cyprus issue from the island's accession,"
noting that a solution to the Cyprus issue is not considered a
precondition for Cyprus' EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession negotiations with the EU
in November 1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by
January 2003.

CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday expressed
support for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's decision to
declare a state of emergency in the country and dissolve the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bashir declared Sunday night a three-month state of emergency
in all parts of Sudan and dissolved the parliament in what he said
an effort to preserve the unity of the country and its coherence.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is closely watching the latest developments in Sudan and
contacts between Cairo and Khartoum have been continuing since
Sunday night, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt supports Sudan, the Sudanese government and the steps
taken by President al-Bashir that are aimed at maintaining the
country's stability and territorial integrity," Moussa was quoted
as saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said President Hosni Mubarak discussed on Monday over
telephone with Bashir the latest developments of the Sudanese
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has voiced full support for Sudan in this stage and
expressed hope that Sudan will maintain stability and progress,
Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mubarak on Monday also held telephone conversation
with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the Sudanese situation and
the initiative proposed by Egypt and Libya with an aim to end the
country's civil war and achieve a national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Contacts will be conducted among officials of Egypt, Sudan and
Libya within the coming few days, Moussa said.

NAIROBI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings said the global economic order has been unfavorable to
most developing countries by dropping the prices of their major
foreign exchange earners.

 Rwalings', whose government has come under severe criticism

our present predicament is for all of us to appreciate that the
current state of our economy is not the making of government or
any individual person but is accentuated by exogenous factors
which we have no control over." The president assured his
countrymen that his government has not in any way lost control
over the economy.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court Backs Botswana in Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hague-based
International Court of Justice on Monday awarded Botswana
sovereignty of a tiny island in southern Africa's Chobe river,
also claimed by neighboring Namibia, according to a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Judges at the United Nations's top court granted the control of
the island, known in Namibia as Kasikili and in Botswana as
Sedudu, to Botswana by an 11-4 votes.
</P>
<P>
They based their ruling on an 1890 treaty by former colonial
powers Britain and Germany, which called for the border river to
be divided along the main channel.
</P>
<P>
The court supported Botswana's arguments that the deeper,
northern channel was the main channel, putting the island on
Botswana's side of the border.

Situated on the Chobe river which flows into the Zambezi river

The border between Botswana and Namibia was first laid out in

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reforms Banking to Meet EU Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Economy Minister Recep
Onal has said Turkey is taking "all legal and economic measures
needed" to harmonize its banking laws with the European Union (EU)
standards.
</P>
<P>
Onal said that the East Asian and Russian economic crises have
shown that a healthy market economy is contingent on a healthy
financial system, noting the banking sector in Turkey has serious
problems, Turkish Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the deadlock in the banking sector of the country
stems from the excessive role the state plays in banking
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The most important message I can give you is that the role of
the state in the banking sector ends," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, given a long-awaited candidacy for EU membership last
Friday, must now begin reforms to satisfy the economic and
political conditions required in Copenhagen criteria in order to
open the actual negotiation process for accession.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Build New Museum Next Month: Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is scheduled to begin
construction of a new museum next month, the minister of culture
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited museum will be the largest historical gallery
in the world, Farouk Hosni was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The construction plan took four years to be completed in Italy,
which covered a cost of 1.5 million U.S. dollars, Hosni said,
adding that he has received the feasibility studies and the
technical details for the museum.
</P>
<P>
The museum, which is estimated to cost 400 million dollars,
will be built on a 500,000-square-meter plot on the outskirts of
Cairo, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will call for an international tender to build the
museum.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Arab Fund for Social and Economic
Development of Kuwait might take part in the financing of the
project, Hosni said.
</P>
<P>
The existing Egyptian Museum, which opened in downtown Cairo in
1902, has long suffered from having too little exhibition
space. Many pharaonic, Coptic, Islamic and other treasures
are stored in its basement.

<P>
"We will not hesitate to allow Angolan troops permission to use
Namibia to attack UNITA," Namibia's chief of staff, Maj. Gen.
Martin Shalli, said in remarks published by the South African
Press Association on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Namibian Defense Minister Errki Nghimtina
denied that Namibia was to abandon its previous position of
neutrality and allow Angolan forces to attack the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola(UNITA) from Namibian soil.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma on Sunday also expressed his
support for the Angolan offensive against what he termed "UNITA
bandits."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, locked in a 25-year civil war with
UNITA rebels, has reportedly scored major gains in recent months,
recapturing UNITA's central highland strongholds and launching an
offensive on its positions in the south, near the Namibian border.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Angola are allies in support of the Congolese
government's war against its own rebel insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Namibia has allowed Angolan forces to use its military
all-weather airstrip at Rundu just across the border from Calai to
fly in fuel, mostly for Angolan army transport helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Passes Barak's Statement on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The special session of the
Israel Knesset (parliament) passed Monday night Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's policy statement on resumption of peace talks with
Syria after several hours of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The policy statement was passed by a vote of 47-31, with 24
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
In Barak's coalition, five Knesset members of the National
Religious Party voted against the statement.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Barak outlined the government policy
concerning the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, saying Israel has to
pay the price for reaching a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to support the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations, even though they will require territorial
concessions in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"If an agreement is reached with the Syrians, it is a
historical time. Our generations will pay the price for the
future and for future generations, for the end of wars and for
peace," Barak stated.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Barak called upon the Israeli people,
particularly the residents at the Golan Heights, to support the
government's policy on resuming peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak also said the peace talks with Syria will also help solve
the issue of Israel's troops withdrawal from south Lebanon,
stressing that Israel's pullout from south Lebanon will end years
of tragedy in the north.
</P>
<P>
As the Knesset debate goes on, about one thousand residents
coming from the Golan demonstrated in front the Knesset building
to urge the government not to return all of Golan back to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of activists of the local peace group the
Peace Now gathered outside Barak's residence here to express
their support for Barak to go to Washington to resume the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
Barak will fly to Washington Tuesday to hold talks there
with Syrian Foreign Minister Frouq Al-Sharaa on Wednesday and
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Demand 11 Billion Marks Slave Labor Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 13 (Xinhua)-- Lawyers representing over 2
million Nazi slave labor victims have raised their demands for
compensation to 11 billion marks up from the previous 10 billion,
a German lawyers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers have informed (the U.S. chief negotiator) Stuart
Eizenstat of the sum," confirmed Munich-based lawyer Michael Witti
after a telephone conference Monday evening with his U.S.
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The German side has so far agreed on a fund of 8 billion marks,
5 billion from the business and 3 billion from the government.
</P>
<P>
This sum is 2 billion more than what the German side offered in
the negotiating round in November.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, spokesman for the compensation fund
initiative Wolfgang Gibowski said in Bonn that there were "
positive signals" indicating a possible "fruitful solution" in a
few days. Crucial is the reaction of Eizenstat to the latest
German offer, but not that of lawyers, stressed Gibowski.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government might also contribute "a small symbolic sum
" to the fund, confirmed German top negotiator Otto Graf
Lambsdorff and U.S. Ambassador John Kornblum.
</P>
<P>
So far, automobile maker Adam Opel AG has agreed to take part
in German fund. Nazi took over the management of Opel, the German
subsidiary of the U.S. General Motors (GM), in the wartime.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. big name, the Ford Motor Company, said it was
considering assisting the compensation efforts. Ford also owns
works in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Historians said Nazi Germany had deployed up to 8 million slave
laborers to supplement its depleting labor force during World War
II. Up to 2.3 million survivors and their relatives are demanding
compensations today.

<HEADLINE> 7 Major Nasdaq Stocks To Trade In Hong Kong In Early 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The initial list of stocks is as follows: Microsoft, Intel,
Cisco, Dell, Amgen, Applied Materials and Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by NASD Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Frank Zarb and Nasdaq International President John Wall,
and SEHK Chairman H.C. Lee and SEHK Chief Executive Officer Alec
Tsui. The NASD is the parent organization of the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two stock markets will transfer
mutually useful and necessary regulatory information as part of a
pilot program that will enable Nasdaq-listed companies to list on
the SEHK. A number of international SEHK stocks will trade in the
Nasdaq market later as well.
</P>
<P>
"The first listings are expected to take place around February
2000," said Lee, SEHK chairman, at the signing ceremony. "Market
globalization promotes the listing of global corporations with
international business on exchanges linking the U.S., Asian and
European time zones. Investors will have easier access to these
stocks in any of these markets, which will increase the liquidity
of the shares," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the pilot program will establish Hong Kong as a major
trading center for global stocks in the Asian time zone and
eventually Hong Kong will be an integral part of a 24-hour trading
platform linking the three main time zones.
</P>
<P>
NASD Chairman Zarb said "the agreement that we have signed with
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong takes us a major step closer to
fulfilling the need for global capital formation and liquidity
requirements and to provide worldwide, instant price discovery and
trade execution in a fair, orderly, low-cost and well-regulated
environment, without time-zone limitation."

organization in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Gets Pretrial Hearing in Wiretapping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A pretrial hearing for
Linda Tripp started Monday in Howard County, Maryland, where Tripp
faces charges that she illegally taped her conversation with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky about her affairs with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A Howard County grand jury indicted Tripp on two counts of
breaking Maryland's wiretap statute because she secretly taped
Lewinsky confiding her affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The recordings were the starting point for the investigation of
the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which led to Clinton's
impeachment in the House on charges of perjury and obstruction and
his acquittal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to record telephone conversations without the
consent of the person being recorded in Maryland State. Tripp
could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of
20,000 dollars if convicted on criminal charges of willfully
violating a state law.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, who is on the witness list for the pretrial hearing,
is expected to appear in the court for testimony later this week.
</P>
<P>
"She is not enthusiastic about going in and testifying about
this," Lewinsky's lawyer Plato Cacheris said. "She would just as
soon all these episodes would subside and she could get on with
the rest of her life."
</P>
<P>
Tripp's trial is scheduled to begin next month, but the judge
dealing with the case granted her request for a pretrial hearing
on whether prosecutors had obtained evidence from statements Tripp
made under a grant of immunity from prosecution from Starr's
office.
</P>
<P>
Tripp received a promise of immunity from Starr's office in
1998. The central issue at the hearing is whether that immunity
prevented Tripp from being prosecuted in Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Western Hostages in S. Leone to be Released Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Two western aid workers held
hostages by Sierra Leone's former rebels were expected to be
freed soon, said Doctors without Frontiers (MSF), a France based
international aid group on Monday in Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"At last we have been able to contact them today and they say
they are well and fine," said MSF' s country director Giuseppe
Scollo in Freetown, according to a report reaching here Monday
from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Two MSF aid workers from Belgian and Germany were seized by
fighters loyal to Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
and were being held in the eastern Kailahun district.
</P>
<P>
The two were abducted last Tuesday and since then the MSF had
lost contact with them.
</P>
<P>
"We have contacted senior officials of the RUF in Freetown and
they told us that they have been talking with its field
commanders and the hostages would be released soon, Scollo said.
</P>
<P>
Security remains a problem despite the progress of the United
Nations' deployment of its 6,000-strong peace-keeping force to
police the west African country battered by a nine-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The final contingent of Kenyan troops arrived on Saturday to
join the U. N. peacekeeping force alongside troops from India,
Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea, said Sierra Leone's state radio on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the new UN envoy to Sierra Leone
warned on Sunday that "The international community can only help
people who are willing to help themselves."
</P>
<P>
Former Nigerian diplomat Oluyemi Adeniji, said on his arrival
on Sunday to take up his post as special U.N. representative to
the war-torn country that "I have identified the main problem in
the fragile peace process as the non-commitment of the parties to
the implementation of the peace accord, "
</P>
<P>
Adeniji, who arrived in Freetown fresh from heading another
U.N. peacekeeping mission -- in the Central African Republic --
said he was familiar with the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I have served my country's foreign ministry in your country
several years ago," Adeniji said in arrival remarks.
</P>
<P>
He replaces Francis Okelo of Uganda who has ended a two-year
term as U. N. special envoy.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls on World to Do More on Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Italy Monday called on world
leaders to do more to improve the plight of poor and sick children
across the globe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation of UNICEF's annual report, the
program's director for Italy Roberto Salvan said that "Social
mobilization is needed to solve these problems, and I don't just
mean the problems of developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"We need to mobilize the consciences of everyone with the aim
of increasing governments' economic contributions and getting the
media to pay more attention to children, and not just when cases
of abuse or violence occur," Salvan said.
</P>
<P>
Both Salvan and UNICEF's chairman for Italy Giovanni Micali
urged an "alliance" between governments, citizens, and public and
private associations in order to step up the fight against child
poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that western states were donating increasingly
less to development funds, with countries now contributing an
average 0.2 percent of GDP, while contributions to children's
funds dropped 21 percent globally between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said that 70-80 billion U.S. dollars a year for the next
ten years were needed in order to ensure access to basic health
and education facilities for the world's children.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimated that a quarter of the world's children, some
540 million, were living in dangerous or violent conditions, and
children under the age of five were most at risk of dying in
Africa and South Asia, with Sierra Leone, Angola, Nigeria and
Afghanistan posting the highest child mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the risks posed by AIDS, noting that 11 million
children were HIV positive, most of them in Africa and Asia, and
that 8,500 minors contracted the virus every day, at the rate of 5
per minute.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Clash in Presidential Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S Republican presidential
front-runner George W. Bush and his chief rival John MaCain
clashed Monday night over tax cuts and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
In a debate involving six Republican candidates, Texas Governor
Bush claimed McCain's campaign finance proposals would "hurt the
Republican Party" and help Democrats. He also questioned McCain
directly on taxes, saying his plan did little for working women.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arizona Senator McCain countered by challenging Bush
to swear off so-called soft-money contributions if nominated.
</P>
<P>
The exchange during a 90-minute debate reflected the
intensifying competition between Bush and McCain for the
Republican nomination, showing Bush's once commanding lead has
begun to erode in some important states, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that the two candidates tangled over
policy and disagreed so openly.
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes,
former State Department official Alan Keyes and former Reagan
administration official Gary Bauer also participated in the debate.
</P>
<P>
Bush came under attack from most of his rivals in the debate on
issues ranging from abortion to the World Trade Organization. But
in contrast to previous debates, Bush appeared more aggressive in
presenting his views, casting himself as a candidate not from
Washington and as a man with strong conservative convictions.
</P>
<P>
Bush is the front-runner by far in national polls, and is rated
a solid favorite in Iowa, where the first delegates will be picked
in precinct caucuses on January 24, 2000.
</P>
<P>
McCain has no organized effort in Iowa, but has pulled even, or
slightly ahead, in New Hampshire, the leadoff primary state. His
rise there presents a challenge to Bush's effort to march
unmolested to the nomination.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Latin America, Largely Peaceful in 1999, Faces New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite a risk-prone
financial turmoil and presidential elections in many countries
across Latin America, the continent has stood the tests and
enjoyed a largely peaceful 1999. However, with its economic
structure and political stability still fragile, it is faced with
further challenges in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it is not easy for the vast region, where economic
structures are frail and governments need consolidation, to tide
over the financial storm and emerge stable from a hectic election
year.
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1999, financial turbulence erupted in Brazil
and spread to its neighboring countries, leading to widespread
predictions that economies in the region would suffer a drastic
slump in the year.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the bleak predictions did not all materialize.
Among the region's large economies, Argentina was the worst hit,
with its economy registering a 4 percent plunge in the past 11
months of this year from the level a year ago. It was followed by
Brazil, whose economy declined 1 percent in the same period. In
contrast, Mexico boasted a 3.4 percent growth. The overall index
for the entire region dipped only 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Latin American economies weathered the turbulence
and maintained the momentum of moderate growth amid readjustments,
thanks to timely measures taken by various governments to
mitigate the adverse effects caused by the financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
The financial meltdown did trigger outcries and protests
against government economic policies in some countries, such as
Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador, but did not result in large-scale
social unrest or political upheavals in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Amid the financial storm, general elections were held in
Venezuela, Paraguay, Panama, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and
Guatemala. Smooth elections and power transfer were witnessed in
most of these countries, except in Paraguay, where newly-elected
President Raul Cubas was forced to resign in March and flee to
Argentina because of alleged involvement in domestic political
violence.
</P>
<P>
Polls in Venezuela were historic, during which reformist Hugo
Chavez won the presidency, putting an end to the traditionally
alternating grip of the post by the country's two biggest parties -
- the Democratic Action Party and the COPEI. The elections further
consolidated the transition to democracy from military regime
which started in the late 1970s in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the successful Ninth Ibero-American Summit last month
in Cuba underlined Latin American countries' determination to
enhance solidarity and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
In the Havana Declaration adopted at the summit, Latin American
leaders reaffirmed their common stance on current world and
regional issues and stressed the importance of cooperation and
integration for regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Latin America still needs to gear up for a number
of serious challenges, ranging from social problems to security
concerns, as the 21st century approaches. It remains a primary
theme for Latin American countries to seek ways of resolving
increasing social problems, maintaining political stability and
guaranteeing sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, free-market economy has prevailed in the
region and seemed to be the sole development mode for Latin
American countries. Free-market economy has succeeded in some
countries whose macro-economic indices have improved significantly.
But their economic growths have not brought about substantial
benefits to the masses, raising criticism and skepticism about the
golden rule of the free-market economy. Chavez has spearheaded
large-scale reforms of Venezuela's economic and political systems.
</P>
<P>
Social problems, such as unfair distribution, rampant violence
and widespread corruption, have become major concerns of the
public, which have helped the rise of center-left forces in polls
in Argentina, Paraguay and Chile this year. "Let all benefit from
economic development" has become a common cry of the ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining regional peace and stability and safeguarding
sovereignty are the two other major challenges facing Latin
American countries. The northern triangle composed of Venezuela,
Colombia and Panama is a potential trouble spot of the region,
political observers said.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, how far the Chavez-introduced radical reforms can
go depends on the country's political situation. Likewise, whether
Colombia's peace process could carry on hinges, to a large extent,
on the rebels' determination and ability to capture state power.
</P>
<P>
Panama, which is a different case, is faced with the test of
its ability to exercise sovereignty over the Panama Canal, which
the United States will hand back to the country this year-end.
</P>
<P>
Remaining unknown is to what extent the United States would "
tolerate" when Panama begins to act on its own in the canal zone.
For some time to come, the specter of neo-interventionism will
continue to haunt the region and it remains a task for Latin
American countries to oppose hegemonism and safeguard sovereignty
while building their future in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Despite these challenges, a senior Latin America expert said,
from the viewpoint of establishing a multi-polar world in the 21
st century, Latin America, with a vast area, abundant resources
and creative peoples, should and will, in all likelihood, gain a
place in the global structure of the future.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Calls for Efforts to Harness Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Effective measures should be
taken to stop soil erosion at the upper and middle reaches of the
Yellow River, said Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting held here today by the NPC's
Environment and Resources Protection Committee and the Agriculture
and Rural Affairs Committee on harnessing the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
There have been successful efforts in controlling the river in
the last 50 years, but effective measures are needed to
permanently bring the second longest river in China under control.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the NPC's Environment and Resources
Protection Committee took the lead in organizing a group of 14
ministries and bureaux from the central government to inspect the
river.
</P>
<P>
In almost two months, the group traveled more than 20,000 km
studying the Yellow River valley. They brought back with them
practical suggestions about controlling the river.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Yellow River is the wellspring of Chinese culture,
but its floods have caused untold suffering over the centuries. "
It has always been the strong wish of the Chinese people to
permanently control the river."
</P>
<P>
Li said that an important step in harnessing the river is
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of utilizing the river's water
wisely, urging that priority should be given to developing
agriculture and industry that conserves the water and prevents the
water from being polluted.
</P>
<P>
"To control the river is a systematic project," said Li, who
suggested that the State Council formulate relevant regulations as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged coordination between the legislature and
administrative organs to revise China's Water Law.

<HEADLINE> Health Canada Plans Five-Year Dope Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Health Canada has worked out a
five-year plan for medical use of nearly one million marijuana
cigarettes, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A licensed Canadian supplier is required to "be a university
graduate in an area such as pharmacology and of good character,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada will supply the seeds to the official dope dealer,
who is expected to produce 100,000 marijuana cigarettes in the
first year of the project and an annual 200,000 from the second to
the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
The health department "will contribute up to 1.5 million
Canadian dollars (about 1 million U.S. dollars) per year for
investment in clinical, basic and applied research on marijuana
and cannabinoids," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It will also finalize the 28-page Statement of Work for the
Development of a Comprehensive Operation for the Cultivation and
Fabrication of Marijuana in Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman for the organization said that Health
Canada "is looking at options to provide a safe supply" of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Health Minister Allan Rock has so far allowed 16
Canadians suffering from AIDS and other serious illnesses to
legally smoke marijuana, a cigarette with THC content of 4-6
percent.

JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has appointed army Chief of Staff Lt. -Gen. Shaul Mofaz head
of the security negotiating team with Syria, Israel radio reports
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. -Gen. Uzi Dayan and head of the
army's planning division Maj. -Gen. Shlomo Yanai were also
appointed members of the team, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Security arrangement is one of the most important elements in
the upcoming Israeli-Syrian talks, which would resume Wednesday
after nearly four years of freeze.
</P>
<P>
Barak left for Washington Tuesday morning for meetings with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa. These would be the
highest-level talks between the two sides in the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said the extent of an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, the Syrian plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war, would equal the extent of peace between the two
countries and the quality of security arrangement in the heights
and Israel's northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz told a parliamentary committee monitoring foreign and
defense affairs Tuesday that the Israeli army was making
preparations for the renewed talks with Syria and also reviewing
various measures concerning a possible Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak has pledged to pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon
 Israel has occupied since 1985 by July next year through
negotiations with Syria, the main power broker in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
But he has not ruled out a unilateral withdrawal if Israel and
Syria could not reach an agreement. Mofaz has said the army would
follow any decision made by the government though it is planning
for various scenarios.

TOKYO -- Japan announced Tuesday it will lift the remaining
sanctions, which include freezing food aid and negotiations on
normalizing diplomatic ties, against the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), Kyoto News reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki, sets the stage for preparatory talks on bilateral
relations, possibly next week, said the report. Actual provision
of food aid, however, will be delayed because of lingering
domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
Japan froze both food aid and normalization talks as part of
four punitive measures it took after the DPRK launched a multi-
stage rocket over Japan last August. (Japan-DPRK-Lift

<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said today that the Chinese Government is ready to make concerted
efforts with the Fijian Government to usher in stable Sino-Fijian
relations of all-round cooperation in the next century on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark during talks with visiting Fijian Prime

Speaking highly of Sino-Fijian relations, Zhu said that major
developments have been made in bilateral ties since diplomatic
relations were initiated 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have cooperated well in international and
regional affairs, Zhu said, adding that China is satisfied with
the growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China and Fiji, both developing countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, are concerned with stability and development
in the region. Both countries face the same task of developing
their economies and improving the livelihood of their people, he

<HEADLINE> Barak Heads for Washington for Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak left for Washington Tuesday morning for meetings with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, restarting the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations after a 45-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
Barak said before taking off from Ben Gurion airport that he
was embarking on a"difficult" mission, but one that he believed
could bring a new era of peace and prosperity to Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said he would represent all Israelis at the talks,including
those opposing a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Barak carried with him a sheaf of letters from Israeli children
in the Galilee area, which is overlooked by the Golan, appealing to
 Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to reach a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Barak met with representatives of the 17,000
Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights, who are campaigning against a
 possible quit from the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Barak on the trip were Foreign Minister David Levy,
Barak's top adviser Danny Yatom, and former intelligence chief Uri
Saguy, who will lead the Israeli negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton will kick off the talks
Wednesday morning at an official ceremony at the White House. U.S.
 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to preside over
the ensuing direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks, at the highest-level ever between the two
sides,would mark the formal resumption of the Israeli-Syrian talks,
 which started from 1991 and broke off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the two sides would discuss four main
issues: Israel's withdrawal from the Golan; security arrangements;
a timetable for implementation; and the character of a future peace
 accord.
</P>
<P>
Both Barak and al-Sharaa have expressed optimism over the
prospect of the talks, saying that a peace agreement could be
reached within months. Analysts said 80 percent of the issues
concerned had already been resolved in previous secret talks.
</P>
<P>
But Washington has deliberately played down the talks, the
culmination of intensive U.S. diplomacy, saying they would only be
ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect agreement on the Israeli-Syrian track to
emerge from two days of meetings that are envisaged and scheduled
for this week, " State Department spokesman James Foley said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak headed for Washington with a narrow margin of
parliamentary support for the renewal of talks. The Knesset
(parliament) approved to restart talks with Syria Monday by a 47-31
 vote, with 24 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli laws, any decision by the government to relinquish
 the Golan would require a majority of 61 legislators in the 120-
member Knesset, followed by a majority in a referendum.

<HEADLINE> Russia Will Not Tolerate Rhetoric of Force: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin said Tuesday that some countries and blocs are trying to
interfere in Russia's internal affairs by using a rhetoric of
force.
</P>
<P>
"We will not tolerate this and will use the levers that we have,
both diplomatic and military-political," Putin said in the
Plesetsk launching center in north Russia. He was there to attend
the ninth test launch of Topol-M, the latest generation of
intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear
warheads.
</P>
<P>
The missile blasted off at 11:05 a.m. Moscow time (08:05 GMT)
and hit its target at the Kura test site in the Far Eastern
Kamchatka peninsula with calculated precision, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has everything to keep its security assured," Putin
said, adding that Tuesday's Topol-M launch suggests that Russia
remains a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M was designed to be Russia's main nuclear weapon in
the years to come. It is relatively small and can be transported
on a mobile launch pad, which makes it difficult to locate and
taken out in the first strike during a nuclear confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces have deployed 20 Topol-M
missiles in the Saratov region, about 700 kilometers southeast of
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Putin expressed the hope that the United States would not
deploy a national anti-ballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
However, if Washington goes ahead with the proposed program, "
Our response will be adequate, but much more economical than the
ABM system itself," Putin warned.

integration process with eastward expansion a priority.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Macao Governor Busy Bidding Farewell (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Vasco Rocha Vieira, the
Portuguese governor of Macao, stood silent for a moment while he
unveiled a portrait of himself on the wall of the assembly hall of
the Leal Senado, Macao's Municipal Council here at noon today.
</P>
<P>
This is the 51st and the last portrait of a Portuguese Macao
governor hung here in the hall, which has been a local tradition
that an outgoing Macao governor would have his portrait hung in
this 125-year old Portuguese style building.
</P>
<P>
The governor in the portrait, a little bit bald-headed, seems
to have fallen into deep thought. Vasco, 60, has been a governor
in Macao for eight years, and he was conferred the title of an
honorary citizen of Macao today by the Leal Senado.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, and Governor Vasco will leave Macao prior to the dawn
of December 20, becoming a historical figure. By then, the
Portuguese had been in Macao for 446 years, enforcing a colonial
ruling over this piece of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
December 20 will mark the end of colonial rule of the West in
China and in Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Today's event was just one of the recent series of farewell
activities of the Governor. Starting from December 9, he has been
busy bidding civil servants and religious people adieu, attending
farewell dinners given by the University of Macao and the
associations of Macanese.
</P>
<P>
He selected the ruins of St. Paul Church as the background for
a group photo with his subordinates. And he is scheduled to leave
his mansion at 16:30, December 19.
</P>
<P>
The governor always cordially shook hands with people cordially
and gently when he left. He would sometimes walked around on the
streets and greeted people he met by chance.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Macao Governor Busy Bidding Farewell (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governor Vasco, often addressed as General Vasco, is from the
southern town of Lagoa in Portugal. He was in the military and did
not know well about China before he was appointed governor of
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"I will miss here," said the General, explaining that he has
taken Macao as his second hometown.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is a unique city," he said, adding that the marvellous
population, the grand sea, the culture, and many other things of
Macao are "fantastic".
</P>
<P>
The eight years Vasco has spent in Macao were an unusual period
in city's history. The Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) was adopted, the first chief executive,
the first legislative council and the first judicial organ of
Macao SAR were elected or formed during this period of time.
</P>
<P>
The process of localization of civil servants and laws has been
quickened while the official status of the Chinese language was
gradually established.
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis de Sales Marques, chairman of the executive committee
of the Leal Senado, spoke highly of Vasco, saying that the
Governor has frequently attached importance to the smooth
transition of Macao. Both the Chinese and Portuguese sides praised
him his capability in initiating dialogues and achieving common
consensus to maintain Macao's stability and characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud about the transition because we have very good
and successful cooperation with China on the one hand and on the
other with the Macao citizens," said the Governor, adding that
this is a very important point.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the friendly negotiations between China
and Portugal on the Macao question was regarded by the media as an
example in dealing with complicated international disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Governor told Xinhua that he would visit Macao as a visitor
in the future. "Why not?" he smiled, saying that he was sure that
the future SAR government would perform its obligations in a good
way.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the promises he has made in April of 1991 when he
took office in Macao, he expressed regret over some promises that
he has not honored yet.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 127 Portuguese, including Vasco, became the
governor of Macao since 1616 when Portugal appointed the first
governor. The title will become history in Macao after December 20.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Satisfied With Helsinki Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi said Tuesday the executive body of the European Union
(EU) was satisfied with the result of the Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said last week's Helsinki summit focused on the issues of
EU expansion, defense and the intergovernmental conference (IGC).
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the European Commission (EC) welcomed the decision
by the European Council, the final decision-making body of the EU,
to open accession negotiations next year with "the six candidate
countries in the second wave.
</P>
<P>
"This means we will be preparing to welcome 12 new member
states, and we should be ready to conclude negotiations with the
first wave by the end of 2002, provided we have reformed our
institutions successfully and complete our revision of the EU
treaties," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a successful IGC is "an essential precondition to
any enlargement."
</P>
<P>
Prodi described the decision by the European leaders on
Turkey's access as "a historic step of recognizing Turkey as an
official candidate country, determined to join the Union on the
basis of the same criteria as other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We want to help Turkey along the road towards full compliance
with the Copenhagen criteria. As the European Council has given
its green light, we shall be able to devise specific ways of doing
so under a pre-accession strategy for Turkey," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU leaders agreed with the main aim of the new
European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP), designed to promote
the EU's military and non-military crisis management capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"A rapid intervention force of 50,000 to 60,000 troops will
enable us to deal with brushfires in our own backyard swiftly and
effectively, especially on occasions when our NATO allies do not
wish to be involved," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: A Tough Time Ahead of New Pakistani Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Beset with political
instability since its very inception, Pakistan went through
another turbulent year in 1999, culminating in the downfall of the
31-month-old government of Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup on
October 12.
</P>
<P>
A coup is not something new to the Pakistani people. But this
one came as a surprise as many in this South Asian nation were
expecting that the government led by Sharif, who had become the
most powerful prime minister in Pakistan's history through several
major constitutional amendments, would complete its five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Yet, like all his civilian predecessors, Sharif has failed to
set a "political record" by finishing the constitutionally
stipulated five-year tenure of office. His was the fourth
successive civilian government which had been toppled in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government, which came to power in February 1997,
was blamed by the army for its failure to deliver good governance
to this debt-ridden country, and, most importantly, for its
attempt to politicize the army.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the general public has accepted the abrupt
change in the political scenario by responding to it rather
quietly, even in Sharif's hometown of Lahore, the power base of
his Muslim League party.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's just natural that the Pakistani people, disappointed
by successive civilian governments, pinned high hopes and
expectations on the army when General Pervaiz Musharraf assumed
the reins of power by declaring himself as the country's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf is now two months into his task as Pakistan's
helmsman. Although the first two or three months are usually
termed a honeymoon, a grace period of settling in for any
government and thus insufficient to gauge its performance, they
definitely provide an insight into the priorities and directions
of the new setup.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the National Security Council (NSC), the
demand for which has been voiced since long, marked the beginning
of army's formal involvement in politics.
</P>
<P>
However, the formation of the civilian cabinet helped the
government alleviate its image problem, especially in the eyes of
western countries which tend to oppose a military setup.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the composition of the cabinet underlined
the government's priorities in the revival of economy.
</P>
<P>
The induction of Yaqub Khan, Shaukat Aziz and Ishrat Hussain,
all well-known bankers, into the top decision-making process
reflected the desire of the Musharraf government to do business
with the west and international donor agencies like IMF and the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The government, though, has yet to come out with any tangible
initiatives on the economic front and the entire package, which is
known as Economic Reform Program, is expected to be revealed
shortly by General Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, ahead of any substantive economic plans,
the new government has put much emphasis on the "across-the-board
accountability" drive it launched soon after the military takeover.
</P>
<P>
It was undoubtedly a right choice for the government to take
accountability as the first measure because the crackdown against
the people who had plundered the public exchequer is a long-
standing demand of the people.
</P>
<P>
In the process, large-scale police operations have been
conducted across the country, dozens of defaulters arrested and
nearly 5,000 names were put on the Exit Control List.
</P>
<P>
However, so far only a meager amount of 10 billion rupees (193
million U.S. dollars), out of the total non-performed loans of 211
billion rupees (4.1 billion dollars), has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider has asserted that
accountability will be a permanent process and in future all those
who have looted public money will be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
More effective actions and more significant results are
anxiously awaited. The people, who have become slightly
disappointed by the relatively slow pace, will decide whether the
government has both the intent and ability to carry out the across-
the-board accountability, or they just made empty promises, just
like their predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
On another front, a four-tiered army monitoring system has been
introduced under the present setup to monitor the performance of
governments at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The system, which became operational on November 15, was
designed to provide checks and balances on the working of
bureaucracy in order to improve it.
</P>
<P>
But poor governance, also a focus of complains from the common,
is deep rooted in the fundamental social conditions in the country,
which is still, as many scholars described, trapped in a semi-
feudal snare, and is thus thorny for the government to tackle.
</P>
<P>
So, tasks are tough for the new Pakistani government. People
are expecting that the Musharraf government will bring major
positive changes to the country in the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
If its performance in internal affairs turns out to be less
than extraordinary, people might become restive within a year's
time and might be in the streets again in another year, political
analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the high expectation at home, General Musharraf is
under pressure from abroad to return the power to a civilian setup
in a short period.
</P>
<P>
Although the western countries led by the United States have
shown kind of a pragmatic attitude towards the ouster of the
Sharif government, it might be wrong to believe they will keep
being polite in asking General Musharraf to "restore the democracy.
"
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that although the west does not
genuinely care the presence of democracy in Pakistan, General
Musharraf cannot afford to offend those wealthy donors by
declining their requirements when his country is running out of
funds.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf has promised to restore the democratic process when
the seven objectives he set, including the revival of economy and
improvement of governance, are achieved by the government.
</P>
<P>
Although he has repeatedly refused to define the timeframe, it
is generally believed that taking account of the problems facing
Pakistan, the whole process will last for two to three years, or
longer, even if the government acts properly.
</P>
<P>
The new government is, anyhow, destined to undergo a tough
period of time to steer Pakistan at the turn of the millennium,
with uncertain prospects ahead.

MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met here Tuesday with his Mongolian counterpart, Nachagiyn
Bagabandi, to discuss cooperation in gas supplies, electricity,
transit and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The presidential administrations of the two countries signed a
cooperation agreement following a summit meeting, said Sergei
Prikhodko, deputy chief of Yeltsin's presidential staff.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin promised that the proposed Russian-Chinese gas pipeline
and power grids would move across Mongolia, from which Ulan Bator
would achieve economic benefits, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
"We regard Mongolia as our neighbor and recognize that there is
a large potential in developing Russian-Mongolian relations,"
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
He listed defense and arms trade, culture and education as the
fields where the two countries should step up cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents also discussed security
in the Asia-Pacific and agreed to strengthen their cooperation at
the United Nations, Prikhodko added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also tentatively agreed that the Mongolian
prime minister would visit Russia in the first quarter of next
year.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rise In UK Puts Pressure On Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom's inflation
has increased over the past month, putting further pressure on the
Bank of England to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures released
Tuesday show the November rate of inflation was running at 1.4
percent year-on-year, up from 1.2 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The underlying rate, however, which excludes mortgage interest
payment, was unchanged at 2.2 percent. The figures were in line
with economists' expectations.
</P>
<P>
Despite the subdued inflation figures, many economists believe
more pressure is in the pipeline, which makes it all but certain
that the Bank of England will raise interest rates further next
year.
</P>
<P>
The ONS figures also show the producer price inflation has been
rising steeply. Input prices for factories rose by 9.1 percent
year-on-year, driven by a more than doubling of the oil price.

<HEADLINE> Indian FM Expresses Support for Russia' Chechnya Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant
Singh has expressed support for Russia's move in Chechnya, reported
 local Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Singh stated: "We believe that Russian sovereignty over Chechnya
 cannot be questioned, and we stand for the territorial integrity
of the Russia."
</P>
<P>
"I also believe that Russia is experiencing a kind of internal
disorder in Chechnya encouraged from outside," singh observed.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Foreign Minister made the remarks in an exclusive
interview recently in New Delhi with Professor Huseyin Bagci from
Turkey's Middle East Technology University. The interview, which
covered a variety of subjects, was published in the English-
language newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Referring to global politics in the next millennium, Singh said
that the post-Cold War situation is still in a state of flux and
the finality of global balance has yet to be attained. "This
balance has to be the balance of power-sharing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Singh stressed, "I do not believe that the new balance will be a
 kind of domination of the United States as the sole, preeminent
power. Alternatives and checks to it will emerge over time."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on NATO's strikes in Kosovo earlier this year, Singh
said that India has had reservations, "especially after the
Washington Conference in April, 1999, on the new strategic doctrine
 of NATO, which advocates firstly its continuing commitment to
nuclear weapons thereafter on cross-territory and non-security-
related issues, to the advocacy of the right of intervention that
has left some very serious question marks in my mind."
</P>
<P>
Although the NATO's military actions in the Balkans might
contain great human rights and humanitarian issues, Singh said, yet
 India has had reservations about "regional groupings taking upon
themselves the right to intervene in other nations."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on India-China relations, Singh said
that "China and India are two great civilizations and two mature
neighbors. I see that India and the People's Republic of China have
 a very significant role to play, not simply in Asia but in global
affairs in the coming decades."
</P>
<P>
"We have attempted to institute a forum for mutual consent and
find an answer to the current problems as two mature, responsible
neighbors and as members of the international community, " Singh
added.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Ratifies Union Treaty With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Belarus Lower House of
Parliament unanimously ratified a treaty on Tuesday with Russia
that aims to merge the two countries into a union-state.
</P>
<P>
All 102 deputies presented in the 110-seat House of
Representatives supported the ratification of the treaty, which
was signed by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin on December 8, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Belarus Foreign Minister Ural Latypov, in presenting the treaty,
told lawmakers that the treaty, after it comes into force, would
usher in a new stage of relations between the two brotherly people,
while both Russia and Belarus retain their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the treaty will promote the formation of
a multi-polar world and serve to strengthen integration trends in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a whole, Latypov
said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus and Russia are both members of the CIS, which groups 12
of the 15 former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, the Russian State Duma, or Lower House of
Parliament, ratified the treaty Monday by an overwhelming majority
at its extraordinary session.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the treaty only represents the beginning of a
process in the integration of the two former Soviet republics. A
union state will not emerge immediately and in a complete form.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in presenting the treaty
to the State Duma, hailed December 8 as the beginning of a new era
and a turning point in the history of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Although realistic integration mechanisms are yet to be worked
out, Russia and Belarus are prepared to enter the 21st century
together, Putin said.

<P>
NANJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- More foreign investors are
choosing to set up their own enterprises rather than cooperating
with a Chinese partner.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province approved the establishment of 628 solely
foreign invested enterprises during the January-September period
this year, an annual rise of 11 percent, according to the Jiangsu
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Solely foreign-funded enterprises have attracted a contractual
investment of 2.45 billion US dollars, 1.5 times that of Sino-
foreign joint ventures. Foreign funded enterprises invested 2.05
billion US dollars during the nine months, nearly 200 million US
dollars more than Sino-foreign joint ventures.

<P>
Compared with the same period last year, foreign funded
enterprises increased their investment by 7.9 percent while
foreign investment from Sino-foreign joint ventures decreased by
29 percent.
</P>

Jiangsu Province is the second province after Guangdong in
terms of the volume of foreign investment. To date the province
has approved 38,000 foreign-funded enterprises, involving
contractual foreign investment of 72.8 billion US dollars with 34

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce "Best Before" Label in Packed Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Tuesday proposed to introduce the "Best Before" label in packed
food to indicate the time after which specific qualities of the
food deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
"Best Before" signifies the date which marks the end of the
period under any stated storage conditions during which the
product will remain fully marketable and retain its claimed
qualities.
</P>
<P>
"Best Before" day differs from "Use Before" day, which is the
recommended last consumption date.
</P>
<P>
The former implies that the product may be satisfactory for
consumption even beyond the date while the latter means that the
product will not retain its qualities beyond the date mentioned.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives approved Tuesday night on third and final reading
the proposed General Banking Act of 1999 aimed at promoting
competitiveness in the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Jose Macario Laurel, chairman of the house committee on bank,
said in a statement that the act will promote competitiveness in
the banking sector, improve prudential standards and strengthen
the effectiveness of the Central Bank's supervision over banks.
</P>
<P>
The approved measure was a product of more than four years'
debates and heated discussions by the Central Bank of the
Philippines,Congress, the banking sector and other private
concerns, Laurel said.
</P>
<P>
With protection of depositors as paramount concern, the
approved bill, among others, clearly defines restrictions on bank
exposure to directors, officers, stockholders and their related
interest (DOSRI),Laurel said.
</P>
<P>
According to the act, credit accommodations and guarantees
which a bank can extend to its DOSRI shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to their respective deposits and book value of their
paid in capital contribution in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the liberalization of foreign equity ceilings
to attract more foreign investments, the proposed revision
stipulates the reduction of Filipino ownership requirement to 60
from 70 percent of total voting stock in case of distressed banks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Test Launches Latest ICBM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia conducted a successful
test launch of its latest intercontinental ballistic missile
Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile blasted off
from the Plesetsk testing grounds in northern Russia at 11:05 a.m.
Moscow time (08:05 GMT) and hit its target at the Kura test site
in the Far Eastern Kamchatka peninsula with calculated precision,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and Strategic Rocket Forces Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Yakovlev
attended Tuesday's test, the ninth of the fifth-generation missile,
rocket forces spokesman Colonel Ilshat Bachurin said.
</P>
<P>
The test launch was designed to gather data about the missile's
performance and characteristics, the in-flight operation of its
various parts and its targeting precision.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the rocket forces deployed 10 new Topol-M missiles,
the second time in two years, to put a contingent of the missiles
on full combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
The new missiles were put on duty in the Saratov region, about
700 kilometers southeast of Moscow, the location of the first 10
Topol-M missiles deployed last year.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M was designed to be Russia's main nuclear weapon in
the years to come. It is relatively small and can be transported
on a mobile launch pad, making it more difficult to be located and
taken out in the first strike of a nuclear confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt to Seek Opposition's Return to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
contact the opposition soon to pursue their return to parliament
in the coming parliament session, Home Minister Mohammad Nasim
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed on Monday summoned the 16th
session of the country's Seventh Parliament, which was formed in
1996,on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"As the authorized minister of the government, I will soon
contact the leaders of the opposition including the BNP (
Bangladesh Nationalist Party) and invite them to come to join the
coming Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) session," Nasim told reporters
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has been abstaining from the parliament since the 13th
session.
</P>
<P>
Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury is also likely to talk to the
opposition separately as the speaker of the parliament, said the
minister, who is also the organizing secretary of the ruling Awami
League.
</P>
<P>
Nasim said the government is hopeful that the opposition would
join the session and raise their demands. "We want to discuss
their issues and demands in this coming session."
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, which has been staging an anti-
government movement, has gone on an unofficial boycott of
parliament this year to protest the government's decision in late
July to examine the proposal of providing road transshipment
facilities to India, the government's unilateral decision to hold
city corporation polls, and opposition law-makers being deprived
the right to speak in parliament.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Impartiality in Majlis Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Monday warned government officials against being
partial in the forthcoming Majlis (parliament) elections in order
to ensure a "healthy and sound climate" for the polling.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to officials in charge of holding and monitoring the
elections, Khamenei said that the government, particularly the
organs responsible for the elections, must be vigilant against
partiality.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency Tuesday as
calling on the officials to be totally impartial and refrain from
siding with certain groups, in order to guarantee people's
confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's warning came after reports said that Deputy Interior
Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh has called on provincial officials to
choose pro-government candidates from different political factions.
</P>
<P>
"If moderates are disqualified by the supervisory boards, then
hardliners should be proposed, and if they are disqualified too,
then extreme hard liners should be proposed instead, however, all
the nominees should be pro-government," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry denied the report and said that
the remarks, if there were any, represented only Tajzadeh's
personal view, local daily Tehran Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Ali Yunesi has warned President
Mohammad Khatami of possible plots to undermine the sensitive
parliamentary polling slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei underlined the need for rule of law in the elections. "
The Constitution has devised a very wise strategy for holding polls
 by assigning the government to stage the elections and having a
body out of the government to monitor the whole process to ensure
its accuracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned the officials against sabotage and other problems
 during the balloting, and called on the people to turn out and
cast their votes. "We must all try that the elections will be held
in the best possible manner and with the massive participation of
the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And we are confident that the people will turn out massively in
 the polls and carry out their divine duty," he said. With popular
support, Khatami himself won the April 1997 presidential election
by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
He also called on "qualified persons" to run for the Majlis,
whose seats will be increased from the current 270 to 290.
</P>
<P>
Registration of nominees for the Majlis elections started on
Saturday and reports said that 1,250 people have so far handed in
their applications.
</P>
<P>
Both the conservatives, who dominate most of the state powers
including the Majlis, and the pro-Khatami moderates have launched
election campaigns, hoping to win a majority in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts believe that independent candidates
will play an important role this time in the polling, which they
said would create a new power equation in the country.

PHNOM PENH, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Loans approved by Asian
Development Bank(ADB) to improve Cambodia's transportation and
social infrastructure amounted to 88 million U.S. dollars in 1999,

</P>
<P>
The ADB Mission conducted its annual Country Portfolio Review
Mission during December 7 - 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the Mission were to assess the
performance of on-going portfolio of the ADB in Cambodia, identify
generic issues that inhibit project implementation and formulate
measures to improve overall portfolio performance.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to the end of 1999, the ADB have approved 12 loans
amounting to about 374 million U.S. dollars, all from the Asian
Development Fund resources.

Among the ADB's loans, the transport sector has the largest
share with 41 percent, followed by social infrastructure 29
percent, agriculture 17 percent and energy 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
With respect to technical assistance, the ADB has provided 49
million U.S. dollars for 65 projects, about 60 percent of which
were for capacity building and policy support, while the other 40
percent were dedicated for project preparation for designing
project investments in key sectors.

</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels on Monday continued to carry out attacks on

the Elephant Pass, a statement from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Elephant Pass is a strategically important causeway linking
the mainland with the northern Jaffna peninsula. The loss of the
pass will expose the Jaffna peninsula, the former stronghold of
Tamil rebels, to rebels' attacks.
</P>
<P>
Troops repulsed all the rebels' attempts, causing heavy damages
to the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the
statement said.
</P>

said,adding that a large number of Tamil rebels injured due to
confrontations in sea and on land.
</P>
<P>

group of LTTE rebels in the eastern Batticaloa district, killing
11 rebels with machine guns and grenades.
</P>
<P>
The statement said two soldiers were and killed and 18 others
injured due to the confrontation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Intra-clan Clashes Kill 3 in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and one other wounded when rival militiamen exchanged heavy
gunfire at the industrial road of south Mogadishu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the clashes started after three
battle wagons with more than 50 heavily armed militiamen launched
an attack on a garage in the vicinity of Mogadishu's main soccer
stadium.
</P>
<P>
Both of the rival sides were said to belong to the Suleman
subclan of Habar Gidir.
</P>
<P>
Some of the watchmen in the garage said the perpetrators of the
attack aimed at seizing a battle wagon parked inside their
premises.
</P>
<P>
All three dead men and the wounded are garage defenders, but it
is not yet known about the fatalities of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
The area where the fighting took place has been calm, but tense
with the Islamic courts trying to prevent more clashes in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity has been increasing in the Somali capital since
the beginning of this week.
</P>
<P>
There are no political movements in regard to the pacification
and political settlement of Mogadishu despite the return of most
of the Somali warlords back to Mogadishu following Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi's word ordering the Somali militiamen to
leave Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic courts in south Mogadishu and the traditional
leaders have been holding successive meetings in a bid to
collaborate in restoring peace in Mogadishu and in the areas
dominated by the main Hawiyeh tribe in southern and central
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it seems that real and lasting peace will remain
beyond the reach of the Somalis as long as there is no central
authority for Mogadishu and Somalia as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Financial Situation Stabilized: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's financial
situation has stabilized, an IMF official declared on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's financial situation has stabilized. So there is no
urgent need for new money," IMF Director for Asia Pacific Hurbert
Neiss said after meeting with Indonesian House of Representatives
Speaker Akbar Tandjung here.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said that the IMF would resume the disbursement of the
new loan for the country, but refused to specify as to how much
money would be disbursed.
</P>
<P>
"That amount you will see in the Letter of Intent (LoI) but the
precise amount is just not important because Indonesia is no
longer in the balance of payment crisis," the IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that IMF would also offer additional inflow from
foreign resources that include not only IMF but also World Bank,
Asian Development Bank and foreign governments for the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the new LoI would be published at the same
time with the publication of the country's next budget.
</P>
<P>
"And in the second half of January 2000, the new LoI would be
discussed by the IMF Board of Directors and then be endorsed
before the package of loan would be disbursed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a bailout cash package worth 46 billion U.
S. dollars for Indonesia, of which the IMF is committed to provide
some 12.3 billion dollars. It has so far disbursed more than 9.5
billion dollars.

<P>
Fierce battle between the Taliban and Ahmad Shah Masood's
forces in July and August had forced nearly 100,000 Afghans of
Kapisa and Parwan provinces to migrate to the opposition-held
Panjsher valley and the Taliban-held capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokeswoman said that mines were removed from the land
route from Kabul to the Panjsher Valley to take the supplies
through the frontlines.
</P>
<P>
More supplies would also be sent to the area in the coming
months, she said.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the shortage of food in Afghanistan after
the imposition of U.N. sanctions, Bunker said they have noted less
arrival of trucks in Kabul after Pakistan tightened security on
the Pak-Afghan borders.
</P>
<P>
She said that the international community cannot make up the
deficit of food in war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The production of serial in the country reduced by about 16
percent this year which resulted in future difficulties, Bunker
noted.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program last Friday warned that millions of poor
Afghans in urban and rural areas may not be able to get enough
food to feed their families if the price of wheat does not
decrease significantly.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Refuses to Give Nine Ex-Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- South African Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has refused to give amnesty to
nine former security branch policemen for their role in the murder
of four colleagues in 1989, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission made the announcement in Port Elizabeth on
Monday. It is reported that the four were murdered when the police
vehicle they were travelling in was blown up in Port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
According to amnesty applicants, the four were involved in a
fraudulent scheme which intercepted and appropriated checks mailed
to various trade unions and political organizations for personal
gains.
</P>
<P>
Police were under pressure to charge them but the four had
allegedly threatened to expose the unlawful activities of the
security police.
</P>
<P>
TRC spokesperson Nhlanhla Mbatha said the amnesty committee
found that two of the nine security policemen who committed the
murder had provided different reasons for the murder of the four,
and on those grounds the nine did not qualify for amnesty.

<HEADLINE> Most International Conventions Still Applicable in Macao After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority of
international conventions now applicable to Macao will still apply
after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty there on December
20, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here today.
</P>
<P>
Answering a journalist's question at today's regular press
conference, Zhang said the Chinese government has recently
addressed itself to the depositories of these international
conventions concerning their application in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) after its establishment on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also soon make comprehensive
deliberations on the principles and practices concerning the
international conventions' application to Macao through the UN
secretary-general, and make them available to the international
community, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Through these actions, the overwhelming majority of
international conventions now applicable to Macao will still apply
to the Macao SAR, which will be established upon Macao's handover.
</P>
<P>
These conventions, approximately 120 in all, according to Zhang,
cover a wide range of areas including civil aviation, customs,
economy and finance, education, science and technology, culture,
environmental protection, hygiene, intellectual property rights,
human rights, labor, international crimes, maritime affairs,
international private law, roads and communications, post services
and telecommunications, and establishing international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
China has not been a party to 57 of them, she added.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned actions, taken for the implementation of
the "one country, two systems" principle and relevant provisions
in the Macao SAR Basic Law, are of enormous significance to the
smooth handover of Macao and its long-term stability and
development, the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> INRO's Special Session in Malaysia Discussing Stockpile Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Natural
Rubber Organization (INRO) Tuesday assured that its 140,000 tons
rubber stock disposal will not affect the market.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the five-day 16th INRO governing council
special session which began here Monday are discussing the
disposal proposals, its buffer stock manager Arch W. Roberts Jr.
said Tuesday, adding "We are still looking at the best way to
dispose of the stockpile."
</P>
<P>
The disposal of 140,000 tons of rubber stock is not substantial
because it represents only 2.0 percent of the total world rubber
consumption, he told reporters on the sidelines of the special
session being held at the Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB) here.
</P>
<P>
The INRO meeting is being attended by 17 rubber producing and
consuming countries except Nigeria and the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which withdrew from the organization on October 15
this year, and Thailand, which is going to cease its INRO
membership from March 25 next year, also sent delegates to the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Thailand proposed last month to form a joint
venture to buy up the INRO stockpile.

<HEADLINE> ILO Warns Severe AIDS Impact on African Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has warned that the impacts of AIDS/HIV on the
labor force of Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda are very
severe.
</P>
<P>
In these countries, "some 80 percent of persons infected with
HIV were between 20 and 49 years old, the ages when they could be
expected to be the most productive workers," said the
international organization in a report which was obtained here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Action against HIV/AIDS in Africa: An
Initiative in the Context of the World of Work", said AIDS is
affecting, and ultimately killing, the most productive labor force
and could well become "the single most important impediment to
social and economic progress" on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS epidemic threatens to lower productivity, decrease
overall demand for goods and services and spawn a new wave of
child laborers and AIDS orphans in Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the AIDS epidemic in Africa would result in increased
absenteeism, a rise in the number of households headed by women,
increased labor costs for employers, curtailed remittance from
migrant workers and the bankrupting of social security services.
</P>
<P>
The ILO, in the report, called for a coherent labor management
policy in Africa to ensure that all aspects of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic are addressed in a supportive way.

<HEADLINE> Manual Customs Goods Clearance Will Be Last Anti-Y2K Resort: Singapore Trade Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior trade officer of
Singapore has announced that Singapore trade community has been
ready for manual customs clearance of goods as the last anti-Y2K
resort in a bid to ensure no interruption in the clearance of
cargoes at the border checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Trade
Development Board (TDB) David Chin told a press conference Tuesday
that this point is contained in a TradeNet Contingency Plan to be
activated in event of total TradeNet System failure because of the
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
He said that if a Y2K glitch should occur, the manual clearance
mode will be reverted to and traders have been advised that they
should get permits processed in advance of the critical dates that
are vulnerable to Y2K, referring to December 31, 1999, and January
1, February 28, February 29, and March 1 of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan requires that traders present a Letter of Undertaking(
LU) with relevant supporting documents when clearing consignments
through customs checkpoints, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
For controlled goods, traders will have to obtain manual
endorsement on the LU and supporting documents from the relevant
Controlling Agency and they will present the LU and the documents
to clear their cargoes at the customs checkpoints, he said further.
</P>
<P>
Traders will be required to file their permit applications
within three days after TradeNet is restored, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chin emphasized that TDB has prepared the contingency plan in
anticipation of any possible disruption to the computer systems
because of Y2K and in a manner of getting prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
Chin stressed that Singapore's traders are ready for Y2K and
TradeNet, the island-wide on-line trade documentation system, is
also Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
"TradeNet has been ready since January 1 this year when it was
upgraded to Version 2.0," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All the software and computers handling TradeNet Version 2.0
are fully ready," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to TDB, TradeNet, a nation-wide Electronic Data
Interchange system launched in 1989 for trade administration which
links traders, freight forwarders and shipping agents to 18
government agencies and organizations and has 2,500 users, has
successfully passed a Y2K integrated simulation exercise in May
this year and the first critical date of September 9, 1999 without
Y2K glitch.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Prior to Macao's return on
December 20, two large local toys factories are operating at full
capacity to meet overseas orders for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The two factories, the Ho Tin Industries Limited and the
Pelfekta Toys Limited, have become examples which have succeeded
in rejuvenating themselves by employing high technologies.
</P>
<P>
They set up research and development centers with Zhejiang
University and Qinghua University of the Chinese mainland,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wong, deputy director of the Research Center of Macao
University, said that local industry is now under restructuring
and will enjoy great opportunities after Macao returns to China on
December 20, 1999. He said that Macao should serve as a base for
the mainland to commercialize their hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
He said that developing hi-tech industries in Macao will help
alleviate the local economy's excessive dependence on tourism,
entertainment and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Through rapid expansion in the 1970s and restructuring in the
1980s, the Macao industrial sector has said goodbye to small
workshops and developed a comprehensive system with the textiles
and clothing industry as the main pillar. Other sectors include
colored porcelain, rubber, electronics, toys, plastic flower,
building materials, piano, horse gear, cement, iron and steel and
battery.
</P>
<P>
Macao's industrial products are exported to over 80 countries
and regions in Europe, America and other areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, Macao industry has entered a
stagnation period and the textiles and clothing sector has been
replaced by tourism and gambling.
</P>
<P>
Since Macao has become a member of the World Trade Organization,
the textile and clothing sector, which accounts for 80 percent of
Macao industry, will gradually lose the guarantee of export quotas.
On the other hand, Macao industry suffered from the Southeast
Asian financial crisis for over 90 percent of its products were
exported to the Southeast Asian market.

50 percent at the beginning of the 1990s, and the number of
employees in Macao industry dropped from 64,000 to 41,000, and the
number of enterprises dropped from more than 2,200 to over 1,300.
</P>
<P>
Today, the need to develop a hi-tech industry has become a
consensus of both the government and enterprises in Macao. In the
past decade, the Macao government set up the Macao Trade and
Investment Promotion Institute and started the Concordia
Industrial Park project. In 1995, it set up the semi-official
Macao Productive Forces and Technology Transfer Center with the
aim of promoting the transition process of local industry.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in Macao have also made progress in cooperating
with research institutes, enterprises and regions in the Chinese
mainland. In April, four enterprises in Macao signed four
agreements and one letter of intent with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In September, the three-day '99 Exhibition of Scientific and
Technological Results of China was held in Macao. The exhibition
drew large number of visitors because it featured cooperation
between Macao and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiaoqun, director of the Hi-Tech Enterprises Bureau of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the mainland and Macao will
use science and technology to help Macao enterprises to explore
ways of development.
</P>
<P>
At present, a number of enterprises producing hi-tech and high
value-added products have emerged in Macao, including the Pelfekta
Toys Limited, the Ho Tin Industries Limited, the Macao Electo-
Optic Instrument Company Ltd. and the Aiwa Electronic
Manufacturing Company Ltd. Some local textile companies such as
the Leium Fabric and Clothing Company Ltd., the Seng San
Enterprises Ltd. and the San Heng Knitting Factory Co. Ltd. of the
Chiao Kuang Group now use computers in their production operations.

MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Stamps commemorating the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) of
the People's Republic of China are to come out on Dec. 20. They
will bear "Macao, China," the first time stamps in Macao show
Chinese sovereignty over the region.

Circulation will be 3.5 million for each of the MSAR stamps and
1.5 million for each of the last stamps of the Portuguese Macao
government.
</P>
<P>
The two series of stamps are designed to mark the ending of the
more than 150 years of Portuguese rule in Macao and the long-

TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad

<HEADLINE> Another Fatah Top Official Arrested in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Another top official of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah Movement was arrested
over the weekend in Lebanon among tightened security around refugee
 camps in the country, the Daily Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said Mohammed Shibel, Fatah's military
official, was arrested as he parked his car at one of the streets
leading to the Rashidieh refugee camp where Sultan Abul-Ainayn,
head of Fatah's Lebanon branch, is sheltering.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn was sentenced to death in absentia in October by a
Lebanese court on charges of defying the authority of the Lebanese
state. The court verdict was followed by the arrest of two other
Palestinian officials at the entrance to the camp.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's surprise move against the Fatah Movement came shortly
 after the group took control of the Ein El-Hilweh camp near
southern port city of Sidon. The camp is the biggest among the 12
shantytowns that are housing an estimated 360,000 Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the camp was dominated by the rival Syrian-backed
Palestinian factions, which oppose Arafat's peace making with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon fears that Arafat will use his position in Lebanon as a
bargaining chip to persuade Israel to accept the establishment of
an independent Palestinian state in return for abandoning the
rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The latest arrest came out as Farouk al Kadoumy, director of the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) political department, was
in Beirut over the weekend trying to defuse tensions between the
Lebanese government and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
which emerged as a result of Lebanon's recent crackdown on Arafat's
 Fatah.

<HEADLINE> Abu Dhabi to Face Water Shortage in Case of Emergencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Abu Dhabi, capital of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), would face severe water shortage in the
 event of a major problem with the city's water production or
distribution network.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city's water storage facilities can hold only
286,200 cubic meters of water, less than one day's supply.
</P>
<P>
"Problems may arise in case of emergencies such as shutting down
 of the desalination plants or failure in some major trunk mains
conveying the water to the system," warned an article in the latest
 issue of the World of Engineering, a magazine published by the UAE
 Society of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
As the largest of UAE's seven emirates, Abu Dhabi consumes 40-45
 percent of the country's production of water. Nearly three
quarters of the emirate's fresh water supplies come from
desalinated water and the rest from ground water.
</P>
<P>
Per capita consumption of fresh water in the emirate has been
estimated at between 500 and 700 liters per day, said Walid
Shorbagy, assistant professor at the UAE University in Al Ain and
author of the article.
</P>
<P>
He says that based on estimates of Abu Dhabi's future
population, the emirate will need to produce an additional 706
million liters of fresh water a day by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
At present, he says, Abu Dhabi's desalination plants are
producing close to their design capacities of 991 million liters
per day.
</P>
<P>
To avoid water shortage in case of crises, Shorbagy recommended
an additional storage capacity equivalent to seven days of
consumption.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developing ground water resources, he says the
emirate's government needs to address a number of issues, including
 water pricing and conservation of existing water resources.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investment Firm Puts 1 Billion Dollars Behind Net Start-ups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 13 (Xinhua) -- An American consulting
organization said Monday it will invest 1 billion U.S. dollars to
help create new electronic businesses.
</P>
<P>
The move indicates that Andersen consulting, a name synonymous
with helping blue-chip companies around the world streamline their
operations, now wants to be a driving force behind the Internet's
growth. Andersen is an 8.3 billion dollar global management and
technology consulting company with operations in 48 countries.
</P>
<P>
"With this bold investment initiative," the consulting company
said, "we are sending a strong message to our clients, alliance
partners and our employees that Andersen consulting intends to
lead in the new economy."
</P>
<P>
According to the company, economy is the broader business
environment in which global e-commerce is conducted. New economic
rules of cause and effect drive fundamental organization, industry
and market transformation.
</P>
<P>
For the past century, the consulting firm said, many firms have
lived by the catch-phrase of self-reliance. Given the high costs
and risks of transacting business with others, it made good
economic sense. But e-commerce has changed all that, because
communications and information technologies often make it more
effective and less expensive to collaborate with outsiders than to
own all the resources associated with a business.
</P>
<P>
The company said that it will make investment in start-up firms
that "are well- positioned to leverage technology in order to
enable new business models and change entire industries."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stanford University Creates E-Commerce Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Stanford University
is opening a new e-commerce center to provide research and courses
on the booming industry, according to a report from the university
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stanford officials said internet giants eBay, Schwab and
General Atlantic are among several companies that have pitched in
to help Stanford University raise more than 20 million dollars to
finance studies of the Internet and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Stanford plans to use the funds to build the Center for
Electronic Business within the university's Graduate School of
Business, fueled by the high demand for skilled high-tech labor in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by Stanford Monday, the program
will offer course studies and focus its research on how
information and communication affect firms, markets and industries.
</P>
<P>
Robert Joss, dean of the Business school, said the new center
will develop research and education initiatives needed to
understand the impact of information and communication
technologies on firms, industries and markets.
</P>
<P>
Joss said the business school's goal is to be the worldwide
leader in research, curriculum development and the dissemination
of ideas about conducting business electronically and about
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
Stanford's program comes at a time when the high-tech sector is
in great need of talent. The Information Technology Association of
America (ITAA) estimates that there are currently 346,000 unfilled
high-tech jobs in the United States. In addition, the industry
will need up to 1.3 million new highly skilled employees by 2006,
according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
To meet this demand, Congress announced in October that it was
considering legislation to allow companies to draw foreign-born
postgraduate students to fill the gaps.
</P>
<P>
A breeding ground for high-tech success stories, Palo Alto,
California-based Stanford is trying to encourage net companies in
its backyard to become more involved in research and education.
</P>
<P>
Stanford, spawning ground for many successful Silicon Valley
businesses, believes that through investing in education, the
whole industry wins. "The school will disseminate research to the
business community through seminars and educational programs for
executives," according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
As part of the new program, Stanford will offer a new e-
commerce course and executive training program next year. The
center will also act as a clearinghouse and library for faculty
research and studies.

<HEADLINE> Japan Lifts Remaining Sanctions Against DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan announced Tuesday it will
lift the remaining sanctions, which include freezing food aid and
negotiations on normalizing diplomatic ties, against the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki, sets the stage for preparatory talks on bilateral
relations, possibly next week, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Actual provision of food aid, however, will be delayed because
of lingering domestic opposition.
</P>
<P>
Japan froze both food aid and normalization talks as part of
four punitive measures it took after the DPRK launched a multi-
stage rocket over Japan last August.
</P>
<P>
Other sanctions, including suspension of charter flights and
contributions to a multilateral consortium for providing nuclear
power reactors to the DPRK, have already been removed.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will work to launch preliminary talks
with the DPRK to prepare for full-fledged normalization talks, but
will delay the actual provision of food aid to address domestic
opposition, according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry position
paper.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted government sources as saying that Japan is waiting
for Pyongyang's reply to its proposal to hold the preliminary
talks early next week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) endorsed the
lifting of sanctions in a meeting earlier Tuesday, on condition
that the government seeks approval from the party in deciding to
extend food aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the DPRK saw a thaw in their bilateral ties after a
visit to Pyongyang earlier this month by former Japanese Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama and a nonpartisan mission of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese mission agreed with the DPRK's Workers Party to
urge their respective governments to resume talks on normalizing
bilateral diplomatic ties.

<HEADLINE> Pak GDP Growth Rate down by 2.9 Percent in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of Pakistan'
s Gross Domestic Product was 3.1 per cent in 1998-99 fiscal year
ending on June 30 compared with the annual target of six percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth rate stood at 4.3 per cent in 1997-98,
said the annual report of 1998-99 released Tuesday by the State
Bank of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the slower growth rate of the
economy to poor performance of both the agriculture and industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 1998-99 was a turbulent year marked with
challenging problems and quick policy responses to cope with
rapidly changing situation, performance of the economy during the
year in terms of macro economic indicators was adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in agriculture sector was hit by unfavorable
weather conditions, the slowdown in industry was largely the
result of uncertainties entailing nuclear detonations, the
worldwide recession and the spill over effects of crises in the
East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Services sector, however, showed improved performance over the
last year.
</P>
<P>
The impact of decline in growth rate on domestic prices was,
however, neutralized to a large extent by tight demand management
policies and decline in international commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of agriculture sector dropped to 0.4 percent in
1998-99 as against 3.8 per cent in 1997-98. Cotton output decline
of 4.3 per cent, wheat output declined by 4.5 per cent, output of
rice and sugarcane grew by 7.9 and 3.9 per cent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The overall agricultural production registered a nominal growth
of 0.4 per cent despite 20.2 per cent increase in investment and
30 per cent increase in credit to the agricultural sector over the
last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the Industrial sector in 1998-99 was 3.8
percent against the target of 7.2 per cent. it stood at 6.8 per
cent in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Performance of industrial sector during 1998-99 mainly
reflected the effects of international sanctions, recession in
some parts of the world and the impact of IPP (Independent Power
Producers) issues which remained unresolved.
</P>
<P>
The slow growth rate of industrial sector was also attributed
to low investment rates in the sector during the past several
years. Gross fixed investment declined to 2.3 per cent as against
the previous year's decline of 5.4 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Total investment which was projected to increase from 17.1
percnet of GDP in 1997-98 to 18.7 per cent during the year,
actually declined to 14.8 per cent of GDP during 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> No Introduction of Greater Islamisation Policies in Malaysia Demanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
party Democratic Action Party (DAP) Tuesday called on Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the new cabinet to pledge to
Malaysians that there will be no introduction of greater
Islamisation policies "detrimental" to a democratic secular
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The party has received feedback from non-Muslims who expressed
their fears that United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the
backbone of the Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) led by
Mahathir, which had seen its parliamentary strength reduced from
88 seats to 72 seats in the recent general election, would embark
on greater Islamisation policies to compete with Islam Party of
Malaysia (PAS) for influence among the Muslims, DAP Secretary
General Kerk Kim Hock said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The non-Muslim's fear about this possible trend has been
further strengthened by the fact that the (non-Muslim-based) DAP,
which has been on the forefront fighting for a democratic secular
Malaysia, has been weakened in its parliamentary strength," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The general election held on November 29 saw the emergence of a
stronger PAS which had a parliamentary strength of 27 seats and a
much weaker DAP with only 10 MPs.
</P>
<P>
The 14-party BN obtained 148 seats of 193 in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The DAP also called on all cabinet ministers to publicly
declare their assets as a sign of their commitment to set a high
political standard in the new politics of the millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's new cabinet led by Mahathir took the oaths of office
before the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Supreme Head of State) Sultan
Salahuddin Aziz Shah at Istana Negara (State Palace) here earlier
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-member cabinet is expected to have its first meeting
Wednesday.

"I was one of the early birds in Shaoshan to start a private
business. But now a lot of young people are richer than me," said
Su behind his sizable secretaire.
</P>
<P>
Shaoshan is only a small city in central China's Hunan Province.
It now has some 3,000 privately-funded businesses, which
contribute to 60 percent of the city's total GDP. The farmers'
average annual income has reached 2,800 yuan, leading the way of
that of the province.
</P>
<P>
However, Shaoshan people had a hard time struggling between the
enchantment of getting rid of starvation and the perseverance of
Mao's revolutionary route. The ideological struggle was harder
here than anywhere else in the country, because it is the
revolutionary shrine with the boyhood farmhouse of Mao remains its
pristine condition and the memorial atmosphere of the late leader
profound.
</P>
<P>
When a cluster of people in the coastal area got rich by
starting their own business in 1980s, shaoshan was still silent
and outdated. People despised the commercial dealings for getting
rich, recalled Tang Ruiren, who is the owner of a chain restaurant
business famous for serving Mao's favorite dishes, such as stewed
pork and baconed fish.
</P>
<P>
The first millionaire in Shaoshan, she started her business in
1983 by taking a pot of soup to the roadside to sell -- without
telling her family. "My heart was beating so wildly when I saw
people approaching my stand that I ran and hid behind the slope,"
she says.
</P>
<P>
 Tang, already in her 70s, has her restaurant facing Mao's
home across a lotus pond. It has a perfect view of a thatch-roofed
farmhouse nestled in a lush green mountain valley. Helen Snow, the
renowned American writer, once traveled there and found it to be a
picturesque dwelling suitable for nurturing a great man.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the place is also nurturing smart entrepreneurs. As
the birthplace of the late chairman turning into a hot tourist
destination.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia could not afford to
become a global peacekeeper, the Australian Democrats party said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Force (ADF) chief Chris Barrie said on
Tuesday that Australia was the peacekeeping force of choice for
the United Nations following its successful deployment in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Barrie said Australia may have to stand ready to
provide up to 4,500 troops on short notice to restore peace in
world trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats leader Meg Lees, while praising the efforts of
Australia's peacekeepers in East Timor and Bougainville, warned
against extending Australia's peacekeeping role internationally.
</P>
<P>
"Australia doesn't need to move into the role of the world's
deputy of police behind the United States," Senator Lees said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Lees said the costs involved in increasing Australia's
peacekeeping role would be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
"Becoming a global peacekeeping force would increase the
pressure being applied to the government to boost the defense
budget," Lees said.
</P>
<P>
She said instead, the government should increase funding for
health, welfare and education.
</P>
<P>
Lees said the Democrats encouraged public debate on the issue
before next year's release of the Defense White Paper, outlining
future directions for the ADF.

<HEADLINE> Australian Planes Y2K Ready: Aviation Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Australian planes have
received the official word from aviation authorities that they are
safe from millennium bug (Y2K) problems, the country's Civil
Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The large airlines have spent hundreds of millions of dollars
getting ready for Y2K," CASA's director of aviation safety Mick
Toller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Smaller aviation authorities have identified any Y2K risks and
taken appropriate action," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's air traffic control systems are also Y2K ready and
detailed operational plans are in place for the roll-over period,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister John
Anderson said he was so confident, he would catch a plane from
Sydney to Canberra on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have managed this whole issue of the millennium bug
and our whole preparedness for it pretty well in this country,"
Anderson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And I think those responsible for it deserve commendation."
</P>
<P>
All available information indicated the Y2K computer roll-over
would not impact on the country's air safety, CASA said.
</P>
<P>
There are fears worldwide that computer systems will fail to
properly recognize the 00 dateline when the clock ticks over from
1999, instead believing it to be the year 1900.

<HEADLINE> Manila Calls for More Quake Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Two days after a strong
earthquake hit the Northern Philippines, the government Tuesday
called for more earthquake drills to ensure orderly conduct and
minimize losses during potential disasters.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said: "
Preparations, drills, and exercises are very critical. We are now
implementing drills in schools. They will prove helpful in case of
emergency."
</P>
<P>
Mercado, who also chairs the National Disaster Coordinating
Council(NDCC), said that the government's pro-active approach to
disaster prevention and preparedness has paid off.
</P>
<P>
He said that the public are now more aware of the need to
remain calm and orderly during emergencies after Sunday's quake,
which hit most parts of Luzon and caused minor damages, six deaths
and 40 injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's quake, with a magnitude of 6.8, was centered in a
location 61 kilometers west of Lingayen, about 150 kilometers
north of Manila. The intensity in Manila was put at six.
</P>
<P>
Mercado also reminded local officials of their responsibility
to ensure that public buildings under their jurisdiction are safe
and can withstand earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican urged the
public to stay calm after Sunday's quake.
</P>
<P>
"The best preparations for earthquake is to ensure the safety
and soundness of buildings and structures through regular
inspections by qualified engineers," he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Gas Hydrates to be New Energy in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists believe
that gas hydrates, found naturally in a frozen form, will likely
be a new energy source of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This compound is a mixture of natural gas and water, and under
certain conditions, each cubic meter can be turned into 200 cubic
meters of gas. The majority of gas hydrates lies under permafrost
and also in the form of crystal at the bottom of sea.
</P>
<P>
The world's gas hydrate reserves are twice as abundant as the
total combined amount of coal and oil, said Dai Jinxing and Jin
Xianglong, both academicians with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
at a recent international conference on energy and geology held in
Lanzhou in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
A number of developed nations including the United States,
Japan and Canada are looking into the feasibility of using gas-
hydrates, and India and Russia have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
China has found huge amounts of gas hydrates under the Bohai
Bay, the East and South China seas and on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
Research on the utilization of gas hydrates now is well under way.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Cryopedology turned gas
hydrates into natural gas back in early 1990s, and Chinese
geologists have established major locations of the material.
</P>
<P>
"This clean and effective energy will surely play a vital role
in China's economic development in the new century," Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Are Y2K Ready: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday reassured the public that there is no need to withdraw too
much money from banks since Philippine banks are Y2K ready and
their deposits will remain safe.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre said the Central Bank of the Philippines has assured his
office that the banking sector has made adequate preparations for
the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
"Just see to it that you will have your normal cash
transactions. But any excess cash should be left behind in the
bank because that is the safest place to place our money," Aguirre
said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems
preventing them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1,
2000 onward.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who also heads the national contingency task force on
Y2K, said the central bank supervised the contingency planning and
rechecking, as well as the updating of the compliance, by various
banks on their Y2K readiness plans.
</P>
<P>
Banks in strategic areas will remain open during the holidays
from December 31, Friday, to January 2, Sunday, to make sure
banking services run smoothly, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Gold Output Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's gold output has
increased by a large margin this year, said the Mongolian central
bank Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Up to early this month, the country's 97 gold mining
enterprises sold about 10,700 kilograms of gold to the central
bank, up 37 per cent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in gold production is attributed to improved mining
plan of the government, introduction of advanced foreign equipment
and improved know-how.
</P>
<P>
The government's targeted gold turnout for the year is 15,000
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
With proved gold reserves at more than 1,300 tons, Mongolia's
gold output is growing every year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of increased gold sales, Mongolia's foreign
reserves reached 104.8 million U.S. dollars at the end of November,
up 55 per cent from the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Official Status of Chinese Becomes Official in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese as well as Portuguese
have formally become official languages here as of today according
to a decree issued by the Macao Government yesterday.
</P>
<P>
From now on, the two languages have the same official status in
legislative, executive and judicial fields in Macao, according to
the decree.
</P>
<P>
The decree itself is based on relevant terms of the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao Question signed in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The decree says that individuals are free to use any language
for communication.
</P>
<P>
Issuance of the decree represents an important step in the
implementation of the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR) concerning the official status of the
Chinese Language.  Observers say
giving Chinese official status here reflects the reality in Macao
and is conducive to the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty
over the region by the Chinese Government after its handover on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
During the period of Portuguese rule, Portuguese was the only
official language in Macao, while Chinese, the mother tongue of 97
percent of its population, did not have an official status.
Portuguese was the only language used in official documents. Laws,
government regulations were all in Portuguese and all court
proceedings were conducted in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
The monopoly of Portuguese affected communication between the
government and citizens, blocked residents of Chinese origin from
holding senior government positions, hampered Macao's economic and
social progress, and is not compatible with Chinese sovereignty
over the region.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the MSAR enacted in 1993 by China's top law-
making body, the National People's Congress, grants equal status
to Chinese and Portuguese. Resumption of the official status of
the Chinese Language has been one of three major issues in Macao's
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1991, when the Portuguese government in Lisbon
made a statement about Chinese and Portuguese having the same
official status in Macao, efforts to popularize Chinese have been
going on in the region with marked results.

<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
will on Wednesday send 600 peony trees expected to bloom with 1,
999 flowers as gifts to Macao to honor the region's return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The flowers will be placed in the hall for Macao's handover
ceremony, gardeners say, adding that the largest tree will have 99
flowers.
</P>
<P>
To welcome Macao home, people in other parts of China are also
sending gifts and holding activities to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Shanxi Province, people today presented 3,000
miniature picture albums showing scenes of Wutai Mountain with its
ancient temples and figures of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
A company based in south China's Hunan Province this morning
transported fireworks in eight trucks to Macao. The fireworks will
be set off at around 10:30 p.m. on December 20 and December 21.
</P>
<P>
As the countdown toward China resuming exercise of sovereignty
over Macao on December 20 grows shorter, people's interest in the
region is growing. In Shijiazhuang, the capital of north China's
Hebei Province, readers are flocking to bookstores to buy books on
Macao.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, more and more people gather before the 16-meter-
high, 9.6-meter-wide countdown board to take pictures to remember
Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
People in the north China port city of Tianjin are
participating in lectures, seminars, picture exhibitions, artistic
performances and poetry readings to express their joy over Macao's
return.
</P>
<P>
In Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, over 1,000 pupils have presented postcards they made,
and red scarves as well as plant seeds as special gifts to the
children of Macao.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong press has published a Macao encyclopedia giving
full descriptions of Macao's history, politics, economy, law,
education, culture, social welfare, religion and custom, as well
as conditions during the transition period.
</P>
<P>
The company over the weekend presented the encyclopedia to more
than 60 colleges, libraries and other organizations in Beijing as
gifts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to lift
bilateral cooperation with Albania to a new high in the coming
century through joint efforts, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said in
a meeting with Albanian President Rexhep Meidani here this morning.
</P>
<P>
China deeply treasures its traditional friendship with Albania,
which is quite familiar to the Chinese people, Zhu noted, saying
that good cooperation has already been conducted in political,
economic, military, cultural, and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Albania took the lead in supporting the restoration of China's
legitimate seat in the United Nations, and has always observed the
"one China" policy by neither establishing nor conducting official
contacts with Taiwan, the premier said, and expressed appreciation
for this.
</P>
<P>
Meidani said the Albanian government's position of developing
friendly cooperation with China is steadfast. China, while making
overall achievements during the past 20 years, has also been
playing an increasingly important role on the world stage, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
With the current visit, the president said, he wants to convey
the friendly feelings of the Albanian people for the Chinese
people, and also to promote bilateral cooperation in all fields,
especially the economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
Considering the present situation in Albania and the Balkan
region, economic and trade cooperation is of great importance to
both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Albania's economy is advancing actively, and
expressed the hope that economic and trade cooperation will expand.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed pleasure over Albania's progress in economic
construction, saying that China is willing to reinforce economic
cooperation with Albania in a bid to further upgrade the level of
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Computer systems in Uganda's
capital city Kampala were broken down on Monday by a stubborn
virus, causing panic among users.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the National Y2K Task Force said that
many people called in to complain about the failure of their
computer systems and they suspected that this was a result of Y2K
failure.
</P>
<P>
The virus, called W97M.Thus.A, is a macro-virus which affects
Word documents, with a payload programmed to trigger off and
delete all files and subdirectories from the C-Drive route.
</P>
<P>
"As the National Y2K Task Force warned earlier, this period
toward the new millennium is likely to experience not one but
several virus attacks," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, another virus, called
W32/Softsix.worm consisting of two exe. files in the System32
folder, is likely to strike Tuesday and computer users were
advised to avoid the bug by installing anti- virus software.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's National Y2K Task Force was formed earlier this year
to ensure that all computer systems used in key places in the
country are Y2K compliant before the end of the year. An exercise
drill conducted by the body showed that all computers in the
banking sector of the capital city are Y2K compliant.

SHANGHAI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Many laid-off workers in
China's leading industrial and commercial city of Shanghai are now
more likely to become bosses.

Sources with the Shanghai municipal government say that laid-

</P>
<P>
The inmates were rescued when the government soldiers closed
in on the ADF rebels in the Semliki National Park in western
Uganda, Tuesday's Monitor daily reported.
</P>
<P>
In the military operation, helicopters were used to shell the
fleeing rebels sighted in the park, a security source was quoted
as saying. Seven government soldiers were injured in the exchange
of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
Some of those rescued had swollen legs after walking for long
distances while in captivity, the report said, adding they were
first taken to the Muhooti army barracks for questioning before
being handed back to the prison authorities.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 ADF rebels, who recently sneaked into western Uganda
on being repulsed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, made a
surprise raid on the Katojo prison last Thursday, abducting 365
out of the 841 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one of them had escaped back to the prison earlier.

<HEADLINE> Macao Hotels Fully Booked as Handover Approaches(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- "For three years, our business
has never been better than it is today," Connie Hong, manager of
the communications department of Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Macao,
said here in an interview today, six days before Macao returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, she said, occupancy at her luxury hotel
has been double that over the same period of previous years, with
more than 60 percent of customers coming from Hong Kong, Europe
and America. She predicts that this year's revenue for the hotel
will be much bigger than last year's.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only because that overseas tourists want to visit
Macao before the handover, but also because security is expected
to improve as the government of the Macao Special Administrative
Region will forcefully crack down on crimes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Macao was hit by a series of violent crimes in early 1997. With
tourists keeping away from Macao, the five-star Mandarin
Oriental's occupancy rate nosedived to 30-40 percent in that year.
</P>
<P>
At present, occupancy has soared to 95 percent at Hotel Lisboa,
the best known hotel-plus casino in Macao. All rooms at the hotel
have been booked out for the period around the date of Macao's
handover on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The New Century Hotel located near the handover venue has seen
unprecedented booking orders though it has doubled rates.
</P>
<P>
At the lobby of the Nam Yue Hotel, Danny Lei Yo Kong, a tourist
guide of the Macao-based Guang Dong Tours Ltd., was doing check-in
for scores of tourists. He said he had not taken a break for
nearly two months. He has been busy bringing tourist groups from
Guangdong province in the Chinese mainland to Macao every day.
Sometimes, he brought in as many as more than 100 tourists from
the mainland in a single day. "My colleagues are as busy as I have
been," he said.

"Everybody wants to have a look at Macao before it returns to
China on December 20," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiwen, manager of the house-keeping department of Nam Yue
Hotel, said occupancy has remained above 90 percent at the hotel
over the past two months, a record for two years.
</P>
<P>
Macao, known for its tourism and casinos, has more than 120
travel agencies and more than 110 hotels and inns, with more than
10,000 rooms in total. Since 3,000 international dignitaries will
attend the handover ceremony on December 20, half of the local
hotels have been designated as official dwelling places for people
attending the ceremony and related activities. Other hotels will
receive thousands of journalists and businesspersons from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
Improved confidence in Macao's economy and social order after
its handover has also benefited many small inns in the region.
Wong, owner of a seven-room inn near Senado Square, said he
expected more tourists from the mainland after the handover.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Statistics and Census
Services of the Macao government, Macao received more than 6.1
million travelers from around the world in the first ten months of
this year, up 6.2 percent over the same period of last year. The
figure is expected to reach 7.5 million for the whole of the year,
up 7.9 percent over last year. The Chinese mainland has become the
second largest source of travelers to Macao, following Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Communal Clash in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
four others seriously injured during a communal clash which broke
out in Seram, Indonesia's Maluku province, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The clash, which was the second in the past four months,
involved residents from Hualoy and Seriholo villages in Seram
island, according to the Antara News Agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted around 10 a.m. local time when residents from
Hualoy attacked Seriholo with sharp objects, home-made explosives
and weapons. The people attacked and burnt hundreds of houses as
well as houses of worship which have been just rebuilt in Seriholo
village.
</P>
<P>
Local police precinct and district military command in Central
Maluku deployed more security personnel to prevent the clash from
spreading to other areas, Antara said.
</P>
<P>
The clash occurred just one day after the visit of President
Abdurrahman Wahid to Ambon, capital of Maluku province.
</P>
<P>
Wahid told the people in Maluku on Sunday that their prolonged
conflict could only be solved by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ambon and other parts of Maluku province have witnessed a year-
long communal conflict which claimed the lives of at least 670
people.

<HEADLINE> Handover Provides Opportunity for Banking Industry in Macao (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The handover of Macao to China
will provide good development opportunities for the local banking
industry and the government of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (MSAR) will be able to make the local economy take an
upturn, said a senior Portuguese banker in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Herculano J. Sousa,
General Manager of the Macao Branch of the Banco Nacional
Ultramarino (BNU), said that his bank and he himself are quite
optimistic about the future of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"We've made all the necessary preparations to face the handover
and my bank is poised to continue its role as an important
economic lever for the SAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Branch of the BNU, wholly owned by Portugal and
founded in 1902, shares the function of note issuing in Macao with
the Macao Branch of the Bank of China and overseas all of BNU's
businesses in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Herculano Sousa, 53, has been working with banks for 20 years
and took the present position this January.
</P>
<P>
He said that banking is a significant part of Macao's financial
industry, which is one of the four pillar industries that support
Macao's economy. However, the banking industry has been slow in
development and can barely match the economic progress of Macao
and its status as an international free port.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, affected by the Asian financial crisis and the
slump of local economy, Macao's banking industry had difficulties
in management, with rising costs and decreased profits. Presently
it is making efforts to find a way out, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, the way of life of the local people will
not change, commercial and trade activities will not be affected,
and the banking system will do its business as usual, Herculano
Sousa held.
</P>
<P>
"As a commercial bank, we welcome this historic occasion just
as the other Macao people do," he said. "After the handover, we
believe that relations and cooperation between Macao and the
mainland of China will be further reinforced, and that Macao
enterprises will have more opportunities to develop markets and
businesses on the mainland."
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy of "one country, two systems" has been
successfully practiced in Hong Kong, and HK now stands in front of
the world with an entirely new image. The smooth and successful
handling of the question of Hong Kong makes people all the more
confident about the handover of Macao and its bright future.

<TEXT>
<P>
He held that Macao needs time to restructure its economy and
may not be able to achieve major improvement on the current
difficult conditions. However, he said, Macao has its own economic
advantages, including free flow of capital and commodities, low
tax policy, free port, and geological advantages of neighboring
Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta. In addition, Macao has long
been playing the role of a hub of Sino-overseas trade and East-
West cultural exchanges, and enjoy export and import quota from
European and American countries.
</P>
<P>
"These advantages will undoubtedly pull Macao's economy out of
the corner," he stressed. He especially referred to the unique
relationship of Macao with Western European countries in trade,
culture and history. Portuguese is the official language of seven
countries, with a population of over 200 million, and Portugal is
a member of the European Union, offering a huge market for Macao.
</P>
<P>
What Macao should do is to make full use of its distinctive
advantages to act as a bridge between China and the EU countries,
Latin American countries and Portuguese-speaking African countries
in their economic, trade and cultural exchanges, especially their
investment and cooperative activities.
</P>
<P>
Herculano Sousa said that his bank has established 11 branches
and 27 ATMs in Macao, and two more branches will be added soon.
The bank also opened a branch in Zhuhai, in south China's
Guangdong Province, in June 1993, which is the only Portuguese
bank ratified to open a business branch in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He held that with China making new progress in joining the
World Trade Organization, its financial system will have further
readjustment and more foreign banks will be allowed to do Renminbi
business, the local currency.

<HEADLINE> New HYV Sugarcane Developed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Bangladesh
Sugarcane Research Institute (BSRI) has developed a new high-
yielding variety (HYV) of sugarcane, The Independent daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The variety, which has been evolved by hybridization between
two much-cultivated varieties of sugarcane, ISD-16 and CP-50-72,
has been approved as ISD-29 (BSRI cane 29) by the National Seed
Board.
</P>
<P>
The variety gives more yield compared with the much-cultivated
varieties of sugarcane. The stalk of the variety is long, hard and
medium-shaped but now swelled, and the sugar holding capacity is
comparatively higher than that of ISD-16.
</P>
<P>
During the experimental period, this newly-devolved variety
gave 58 to 93 tons' yield while the 1SD-16 variety gave 45-77 tons
per hectare, varying from place to place and from season to season.
</P>
<P>
The variety is well adapted to adverse climate conditions, and
it has a relatively superior flood, water logging and drought
tolerance capacity.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh consumes about 600,000 tons of sugar every year, but
the country can produce only 120,000 tons annually.

<HEADLINE> Millionaires Popping Out in Mao's Hometown (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Su Miaogong's 300,000 yuan(
about 35,000 U.S.dollars) investment in expansion of his plant is
no big news in the small town of Shaoshan, birthplace of the great
Chinese leader Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
It was far from being so much low-keyed a few years ago, when
Su's souvenir shop was built at 100,000 yuan. Local newspapers
splashed the front-page of the story and people were amazed at his
lavishing feat, Su recalled.
</P>
<P>
But since then, more than 100 millionaires have popped out
challenging Su's wealth and business. Tourist restaurants and
stores have been everywhere in Shaoshan, which is consecrated to a
shrine by millions of tourists arriving here every year to immerse
themselves in the adoration of the primal leader of the New China,
Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
For this first generation of private entrepreneurs in Shaoshan,
there is a constant pressure in the bustling tourist business,
even for someone like Su, who has already had his company asset
surpassing 10 million yuan. The farmer-turned businessman has
recently signed up for an MBA course in the nearby city of
Xiangtan to better prepare himself for this intensified market
competition.
</P>
<P>
The high-school graduate had an early business awareness. He
bought the franchise license for producing bronze statues of
Chairman Mao in 1996. The sensible investment has led to millions
of profits.
</P>
<P>
His home in Shanhu village, Shaoshan, is one of a row of three-
story buildings, neatly seated by a tree-lined street, which has
broad dual-lanes for motor vehicles and two bicycle lanes. It is
more like a small city than the common notion of a village.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Su has a taste for the interior decoration. At
the doorway of his home stands a stout bronze statue of Mao, which
is of a man's size. It is the best of all his products, claimed Su.
</P>
<P>
The sitting-room is quite spacious laid with a large piece of
richly embroidered carpet. A wall-size cabinet is decorated with
an assortment of Mao's statues, big and small, featuring the great
man's images at different times in his life as a dashing young
revolutionary in his long gown or a fatherly man of his senior age.
At the corner of the room, a bust marble statue of armless Venus
is quite eye-catching.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Exports Heading for All-time Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's rice exports until
November grew by 4.43 percent to 5.98 million tons year-on-year
but the value fell by 17.96 percent to 63.79 billion baht (1.68
billion U.S. dollars) as a result of the stronger baht, The Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Somboon Pathaichan, manager of the Thai Rice Exporters
Association, was quoted as saying that total exports for the year
is expected to reach 6.4 million tons, breaking the country's
record of 6.3 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's rice exports during the first 11 months last year
totaled 5.729 million tons and was worth 77.76 billion baht (2.04
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Somboon said the value drop was a result of the stronger baht
against the U.S. dollar, from more than 40 baht per dollar last
year to 38 to 39 baht per dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
Rice-importing countries have placed more orders with Thai
exporters because other rice-exporting countries like India and
Vietnam have had lower production due to floods which destroyed
many rice plantation areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Export prices, however, are not lower than expected, with 100
percent white rice trading at more than 300 dollars per ton and
jasmine rice at 500 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The country's total rice production this year is expected to
reach 18.9 million tons, a slight increase over last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Boasts China's Top Bone Marrow Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai now has China's
largest bone barrow bank with over 10,000 registered bone marrow
donation volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported today that 23-year-old
Liu Dequan, a university graduate serving in a privately run
enterprise, became bank's 10,000th registered volunteer Monday,
willing to donate his bone marrow whenever the bank calls on him.
</P>
<P>
The young man first contacted the bone marrow bank on November
26 through a hotline run by the municipal Red Cross Society.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dequan, a graduate of Shanghai's Tongji University, said he
intends to persuade his friends to become volunteers, which can
help save the lives of leukemia patients.
</P>
<P>
The China Red Cross Society formally established a national
bone marrow bank in 1992 and now has five branches so to meet the
needs of a vast number of leukemia patients nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Statistics on epidemic diseases indicate that the incidence of
leukemia is about three among every 100,000 people in China, and
it is estimated that the number of leukemia patients increases by
40,000 each year, half of them children.
</P>
<P>
As China has adopted a family planning policy, it is unlikely
that most patients have brothers or sisters that can act as marrow
donors. The bone marrow match rate between unrelated patients and
donators is only one in every 5,000 to 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai bone marrow bank has provided appropriate bone
marrow for six patients since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In a related effort, Shanghai has started a trial operation of
an umbilical cord blood bank which could be utilized to treat
leukemia in newborns.

<HEADLINE> Systems Biology Institute Created in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 13 (Xinhua) -- An American biotechnology
pioneer on Monday announced the forming of an organization to
promote the convergence of information technologies and
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Leroy Hood, an expert in large-scale DNA sequencing and key
player in the U.S. Human Genome Project, said in a statement that
the new organization -- the Institute for Systems Biology -- will
play a vital role in advancing biology and medicine in the 21st
century. Its goal is to achieve pioneering discoveries within the
field of systems biology that can greatly advance preventive
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The field of systems biology promises to achieve revolutionary
strides for healthcare in the 21st century, said Hood, who is
credited with developing the technology that enables scientists to
read, record and analyze the more than 3 billion segments that
make up the human DNA code.
</P>
<P>
Hood is a leading advocate for collaboration between natural
scientists and specialists who are capable of designing the tools
biologists need to understand complex biological systems. He is
leaving the University of Washington, where he founded the
department of molecular biotechnology and served as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
The institute will commence operations next month. An anonymous
donor recently provided 5 million U.S. dollars to fund the
institute's initial efforts. Collaborative agreements are being
negotiated with eight different companies. Further sources of
funding will include endowments, federal grants and contracts,
foundation grants, industrial partnerships, private donations, and
equity from companies that spin off from the institute's work.
</P>
<P>
Hood envisions establishing a world-class campus for the
institute that offers room for several hundred researchers and
options for expansion, including space for academic and industrial
partners to build adjacent structures. It is believed that through
the combined efforts of mathematicians, engineers and biologists,
important new tools for biological research and new ways of
thinking about biological processes will emerge.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand on Way to Recovery: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand economy is
well on the way to recovery but it is too soon to get giddy about
growth, according to the latest quarterly predictions issued by
the NZ Institute of Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
The Institute joined the ranks of local pundits predicting that
the current year will end on a note of sound economic growth of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It forecast gross domestic product growth of 3.2 percent for
the year from April 1999 to March 2000, up on its previous
forecast of three percent.
</P>
<P>
That compares with the New Zealand Reserve Bank's forecast of 2.
6 percent growth and the Treasury's 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Institute sees a 4.2 percent growth in the following year
against the bank's 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand economy "appears to have finally swung into
full recovery mode," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Institute also sees economic growth putting pressure on
prices.It forecast inflation in New Zealand swelling to three
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest job index survey by a local recruitment
firm Morgan and Banks, New Zealand employers are "extremely"
optimistic about employment growth during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,100 employers has found almost 40
percent plan to increase permanent staff numbers during the six
months to June 2000, and 16 percent plan to cut staff, a net
positive effect of 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is the highest level of optimism recorded since the job
index was first issued in April 1997.

<HEADLINE> Child Death Rate in New Zealand Halved in 8 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has nearly
halved the rate of deaths among children under five since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Tuesday that six children out of every 1,
000 born in New Zealand were likely to die before the age of five
in 1998, down from 11 in 1990 and 26 in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Health Ministry attributed the drop to a
dramatic decline in sudden infant death syndrome, and other
factors including increased awareness about asthma, compulsory car
seats for children,and compulsory fencing around pools.
</P>
<P>
The statistics issued by the Health Ministry showed New Zealand
's sudden infant death rate has more than halved since 1993.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand adults are also faring better, with an average life
expectancy being 77 years, five greater than it was in 1970.

<HEADLINE> NW China to Use Overseas Fund to Develop Gold Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest
China will use overseas funds to develop gold resources in the
northern part of the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the province will use overseas
investment to prospect gold resources, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed recently by Qinghai and Sino
Mining International Co., Ltd., the Australia-headquartered
company will conduct a feasibility study on prospecting gold
resources at the Tanjianshan gold mine, the largest in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Under the 30-year contract, Sino Mining will be responsible for
raising development funds on the international market. Qinghai
will own 10 percent of the mine's share if the company invests 50
million yuan (six million U.S. dollars) for the prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The province will own 15 percent of the mine's share if the
prospecting fund is 30 million yuan (3.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Tanjianshan gold mine has produced 1,400 kg of gold over
the past few years and its output value has exceeded 100 million
yuan (12 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the mine has already produced 150 kg of gold,
with output value exceeding 40 million yuan (4.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sino Mining was founded in China and is registered in the
Cayman Islands.

<HEADLINE> Special Session of Nepali Parliament Convenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- As summoned by Nepalese King
Birendra, the Special Session of the House of Representatives is
to be convened at 1:00 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Special Session of the House of Representatives was
summoned by the king after a submission was made for it by the
main opposition party, the Communist Part of Nepal-United Maxist
and Leninst (CPN-UML)to discuss and debate the recent price hikes
by the government.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML said it seeked the special session to pressure the
government to withdraw the price hikes that have affected the
lives of people as well as the Nepali industries.
</P>
<P>
The government raised in October the prices of diesel, kerosene
and electricity by 48, 23 and 30 percent and is planning more
price hikes for other essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time after the restoration of democracy in
1990 that a special session is called to discuss issues related to
people instead of the changes of governments. Therefore, it has
been viewed as a positive change in constitutional exercise.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Taranath Ranabhat said
the session is a good start since it is called to discuss and
address the matters that are of concern to the people.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Internet War Flares up in Singapore(Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SingNet, currently the number-one ISP with the largest market
share, announced Sunday a package plan offering free internet
access and free email account to its 1.8 million subscribers in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
This dealt a deadly blow to StarHub, which triggered the
conflict ten days ago with its offer of free net surfing but with
no email, and managed to recruit nearly 40,000 new users in less
than two days.
</P>
<P>
Then came the No. two PacNet, which introduced on Monday Asia's
first customer rewards program which will pay users to log onto
its e-commerce portal and web site Pacfusion. com
</P>
<P>
StarHub dropped the bomb first on December 3. StarHub Internet,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of international consortium StarHub Pte.
Ltd., rocked the scene by offering the existing half a million
Internet account holders in Singapore the opportunity to switch to
its offer of unlimited, free Internet surfing.
</P>
<P>
"StarHub believes that access to information via the Internet
should be made simple and easily available for everyone. We think
it is timely to break the access barriers to basic Internet
surfing, with the freedom to surf at no access charge," said Terry
Clontz, Chief Executive of StarHub.
</P>
<P>
The surf-for-free plan included a free Internet connection but
with no email, no international roaming and no disk space.
</P>
<P>
An applicant will be mailed a free starter-kit after
registering online, and then surfing is free except for normal
telephone fee.
</P>
<P>
No email and no disk space were considered as a big defect as
there are countless web-based companies like Yhaoo, and Mailcity
and GeoCity which would be more than willing to offer surfers free
email accounts and free web hosting.
</P>
<P>
At least for the moment, the plan posed as a daunting challenge
for SingNet and PacNet because even the cheapest plan offered by
the two asks a customer for a minimum of 55 Singapore dollars (
about 33 U.S. dollars) and additional telephone fees for one month
's unlimited surfing.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the number of applicants for the StarHub's service
soared, with 38,000 people, or 76 percent of StarHub's existing
pool of 50,000 users, signing up in only one and a half days.
</P>
<P>
"It took us three years to hit 50,000, yet the free internet
plan took only less than two days to hit 40,000," said an elated
manager with the company.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Urges EU to Toughen Stand on Genetic Engineering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace, the international
organization for environmental protection, called on European
Union (EU) environmental ministers Monday to take a tougher
negotiating position on genetically engineering in the coming
talks on Biosafety Protocol in Montreal, Canada, next January.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers, who started a two-day meeting on
environmental issues here Monday, recognized that genetically
modified organisms (GMOs) in foods and agriculture must be subject
to strict safety controls.
</P>
<P>
But Greenpeace said the ministers failed to define the rights
as to how countries can say no to genetically engineered (GE)
foods.
</P>
<P>
"No country should receive any GE food unless they have given
their explicit approval," said Ceri Lewis, the political advisor
of Greenpeace, adding that the EU had also ignored the special
needs of less developed countries to be free from becoming the
dumping ground for unwanted GE foods.
</P>
<P>
Lewis pointed out that the European Commission, the EU
executive body, ignored those concerns at the WTO negotiations in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"We now expect those EU environment ministers who go to
Montreal to make sure that countries have full international
rights to reject imports of all GMOs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The main GMO exporting countries, including the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Australia, Uruguay and Chile, are against a
strict control on GM foods, describing it as contrary to
international rules, according to Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
If the EU cannot make the precautionary principle the basis for
all decision-making, the EU and all other countries will find it
difficult to reject the GMOs in the end, warned Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the GMO lacks full scientific certainty on its
harmlessness to biodiversity and human health.

<HEADLINE> Internet War Flares Up in Singapore (Part 2) ...with the company. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The StarHub's joyous mood, however, did not last long. The
SingNet version of free net-surfing plan came with a free 8MB disk
space email account powered by Lycos Asia, a joint venture between
SingNet's parent Singapore Telecom (SingTel) and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the SingNet plan offers users more complete services,
including global roaming, email alert and fax-mail, than its
competitor StarHub.
</P>
<P>
"The future growth in telecommunications will be driven by the
Internet and e-commerce," said SingTel chief operating officer Lim
Toon, adding that the group aims to make Singapore the Internet
hub in the Asia Pacific, perhaps even in the world.
</P>
<P>
"What better way than to provide free Internet access and email
to every home and office?" Lim asked.
</P>
<P>
SingNet currently enjoys a lion's share of 250,000 subscribers,
or more than 50 percent of the Internet dial-up market in the city-
state with a population of about 3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
It said that its parent SingTel's 1.82 million fixed-line
customers in Singapore will be "pre-registered" for the free
service, and details on user-ID and password will be sent to the
customers over a period of three months starting from January next
year.
</P>
<P>
After the SingNet offer, all eyes are now set on PacNet, second
only to SingNet in terms of the number of subscribers.
</P>
<P>
PacNet finally broke the silence by declaring on Monday an "
atomic" move which it said will "revolutionize Internet marketing.
"
</P>
<P>
"Why surf the net for free? You should get paid for it,"
claimed PacNet in an advertisement carried in recent local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Internet users who visit its Pacfusion. com
and other web sites hosted on the portal will earn something
called "Atoms" that can be used to purchase products and services
in the e-commerce outlets.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that surfers can now visit our Pacfusion. com
portal for free, thanks to SingNet and StarHub," said Nicholas Lee,
chief executive officer of PacNet.
</P>
<P>
With the rewards program, PacNet is trying to leverage on the
free service of its two rivals to hijack "eyeballs" for its own e-
business portal.
</P>
<P>
The PacNet offer may appear to pale before the free services by
its rivals StarHub and SingNet, but it revealed that PacNet,
unwilling to follow its competitors, has embarked on a new
strategy of focusing on portal revenue rather than access revenue.
</P>
<P>
With some 70 percent of its revenue coming from providing
Internet access in Singapore, PacNet said it plans to diversify
its revenue through its e-business expansion into other areas in
the region, like China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Australia and
India.

<HEADLINE> Rush of Cash Withdrawal Expected in Thailand over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Thai banks are expected to see
clients rushing to withdraw cash this month because of the concern
over the year 2000 computer problem, the Bangkok Post Tuesday
quoted a Bank of Thailand survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the population are likely to withdraw more
money than usual from banks this month, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Businesses and the public will together need about 40 billion
baht(1.03 billion U.S. dollars) in cash this month, according to
the survey.
</P>
<P>
About 24 percent of the public and 26 percent of the
businessmen surveyed said they expected to need more cash before
the holiday season, it said.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in four major provinces in Thailand in
the last week of November. Businessmen were surveyed through
interviews and 5,000 questionnaires to which about 3,000 responses
were received.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson of the central bank said depositors are expected
to withdraw additional money ahead of the transition to the new
millennium when the Y2K computer problem is likely to affect the
operation of banks.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the public and 53 percent of businesses
surveyed had a "moderate" understanding of the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Their interest in the issue and their confidence in the Y2K
readiness of various organizations ranged from "moderate" to "high
"level.
</P>
<P>
Local banks and regulators insist they are fully prepared for
the so-called millennium bug, after spending billions of baht (
millions of dollars) on computer upgrades and systems tests in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
But financial institutions and the central bank plan to delay
unnecessary transactions over the New Year.

<HEADLINE> Chronicle of the Macao Question (1152-1887)(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- This is the first part of a
three-part chronicle of the Macao question. It covers the 1152-
1887 period. The other two parts will be released in the next two
days.
</P>
<P>
When Emperor Shihuang of Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.) unified
China with force, Haojing, or present-day Macao, officially became
part of the country. During the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279),
major events of Haojing began to appear in official records of the
then Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
1152, during the Southern Song Dynasty, Xiangshan County was
set up in Guangdong, and Haojing was made part of Xiangshan County.
</P>
<P>
1271, an army of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) invaded Southern
Song Dynasty and forced the emperor of Southern Song to flee to
Haojing (Macao) and its surrounding areas with half a million
troops and civilians. Southern Song's troops beat off the Yuan
army by holding their ground in the fortresses on the hills in
Haojing. Some of the Southern Song soldiers and civilians stayed
behind and settled down there.
</P>
<P>
1553, some Portuguese landed at Haojing (Macao) and built
temporary huts there under the pretext of drying up their soaked
cargo. Afterwards, they tried to stay behind by bribing local
Chinese government officials of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
1557, the Portuguese occupied the area and named it Macao, and
began to construct permanent facilities including residential and
office buildings, emplacements and walls. The Portuguese
successfully acquired the right to stay through bribery.
</P>
<P>
1563, the population of Macao reached 5,000, including 4,100
Chinese and 900 Portuguese.
</P>

<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production grew
at a double-digit rate in south China's Guangdong Province during
the first ten months of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the combined industrial
output value of the province's state-owned industries and those
large private industrial firms with annual sales volume exceeding
five million yuan, reached 807.51 billion yuan (97.3 billion US
dollars) in the ten-month period, up 15.25 percent on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of sales to production for industrial products
reached 96.57 percent, up 0.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The combined profits of the province's industrial enterprises
rose 33.17 percent to 21.27 billion yuan (2.56 billion US dollars)
in the first nine months of this year, ranking first nationwide
and accounting for 16.48 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing sectors include electronics,
telecommunications equipment, and electrical machinery and

<HEADLINE> Most Handicapped People in Liaoning Find Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 85 percent of the
handicapped people in northeast China's Liaoning Province have
found jobs thanks to the efforts of the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 243,000 out of the 344,000
handicapped people are now employed in the province.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the disabled find jobs, the provincial
government adopted a regulation in 1997 calling for quotas in
employment for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulation, all work units should have one to seven
percent of its jobs filled by disabled people.
</P>
<P>
To implement the rule, 14 cities and 100 counties in the
province have established special employment networks for the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have invested a total nearly 10 million yuan
(1.2 million U.S. dollars) in the past few years to build special
training centers where handicapped people are learning skills and
techniques to meet the needs of their future jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Disabled Persons' Federation, there are
some 60 million disabled people in the country, and an increasing
number of them are having difficulties in finding jobs, although
the employment rate among them has been on the rise in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments are making great efforts to
ensure that most of them find jobs despite difficulties caused by
large-scale layoffs at many state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Let Court Decide on General Wiranto's Fate: Wahid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid said he would let the court decide on the fate
of General Wiranto, former commander of the Indonesian Military (
TNI).
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement following allegations by the
National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) and the
Commission for the Investigation of Abuses of Human Rights (KPP
HAM) that Wiranto was involved in the abuses.
</P>
<P>
"The allegations of involvement are the view of Komnas HAM and
KPP HAM. But the most important thing is the court's view. So I am
not at all tempted (by the allegations)," Wahid was quoted by
national newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said he would allow the investigation into Wiranto to run
its full course, and let the court decide the fate of his
coordinating minister for political affairs and security.
</P>
<P>
KPP HAM has demanded that Wiranto be held accountable for post-
ballot military atrocities in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Prior to and after the August 30 United Nations-led ballot on
East Timor, the now independent territory witnessed massive
violence, allegedly conducted by military-backed pro-integration
forces.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto was the then commander of TNI. KPP HAM is set to
question Wiranto and a number of other TNI generals over their
involvement in the melee.
</P>
<P>
"If a minister is investigated by the Attorney-General's Office
as a suspect, then he/she has to be suspended. If he/she is found
guilty, he/she will automatically be discharged. Therefore, once
Wiranto is found guilty, he automatically quits," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a senior TNI regional commander warned that any
decision to question Wiranto and the other generals must be based
on strong evidence.
</P>
<P>
"Now it seems that the generals are being tried by the public.
We should avoid a public trial," South Sulawesi Military Chief Maj.
Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah said.
</P>
<P>
Agus admitted, however, that the generals should take
responsibility for the action of their subordinates.
</P>
<P>
"The military generals should ask for an apology from the
people and should promise not to commit any wrongdoings in the
future," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Thai Highway Department Ponders Pilot Safety Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Highway Department of
Thailand is considering to launch a pilot program to improve
safety on a model stretch of highway, if successful, the same
method will be used on other highways to reduce accidents,
according to an official release of the Government Public
Relations Department available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The stretch of highway that could be used for the pilot
project is the north bound 10-lane highway from the National
Memorial Interchange, north of Bangkok Don Muang Airport at
kilometer marker 28 to the Bang Pa in interchange at kilometer
marker 53, a distance of 25 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The stretch of highway under the program will be installed
with closed circuit television and changeable traffic sign systems,
public relations campaigns will be done to give safety awareness
to drivers.
</P>
<P>
The Highway Department said road accidents occurred because of
many factors ranging from inadequate road signs to drunk and
reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
Accidents on highways in Bangkok had been reducing gradually
from 1994 to 1997. In 1994, there were 20,871 accidents on
highways resulting in 7,732 deaths. In 1997, there were 16,160
accidents with 4,097 deaths, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
Most accidents involved rear collision, followed by crashing
into road signs. Statistics show that most accidents occurred less
on highway than in cities and towns, but those on highways were
usually more serious, it noted.

<HEADLINE> No Discrimination for Portuguese Speakers in Post-Return Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Portuguese speakers, small as they are in number in Macao, are
entitled to use the language in post-return Macao since the MSAR
Basic Law has provided that Portuguese remain an official language
after the region's return to China in consideration of the fact
that Portuguese has long been used as the official language in
Macao under Portuguese administration, according to Sou Chio Fai,
sub-director of the Department of Education and Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese will be less frequently used in the future MSAR
government since most senior MSAR government officials including
chief executive Edmund Ho Hau Wah seldom speak Portuguese, Sou
says. However, Portuguese will continue to be used in the new
government since most old official documents, which the new
government needs to refer to, are in Portuguese, he says.
</P>
<P>
As of today, Chinese and Portuguese have both become official
languages to be used in legislative, executive and judicial areas
in Macao in accordance with a decree of the Portuguese Macao
government issued yesterday. The decree itself is based on
relevant terms of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the
Macao Question.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese has been used in Macao for more than 400 years. "
Portuguese will remain a fairly important language in Macao though
it won't be used as frequently after Macao returns to China as
before," Sou says.
</P>
<P>
About 96 percent of the Macao residents speak Chinese. However,
Portuguese will remain the leading language for Macao-born
Portuguese, and may remain a working language for some
administrative departments, civil groups and businesses.
</P>
<P>
At present, most official correspondence in Macao, that with
Portuguese-speaking countries in particular, is in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
Maria Antonia Nicolau Espadinha, director of the Institute of
Portuguese Studies of the University of Macao, says adequate
knowledge about Portuguese is essential for learning about laws in
Macao, most of which are in Portuguese. She adds that Portuguese
will remain a very important language in Macao in areas of
commerce, trade and external activities in the future.
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the perspective of culture, Maria Antonia Nicolau
Espadinha says, the return of Macao to China won't erase traces of
Portuguese culture in Macao, which has become an inseparable part
of the culture in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Some experts hold that Portuguese will continue to play an
important role in the future as Macao serves as a bridge between
the Chinese mainland and European and Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese was first introduced into Macao with the arrival of
Portuguese seafarers in the mid-16th century. English has derived
some of its words from Portuguese such as junk, pagoda and Macao.

<HEADLINE> New Medical Policy For Laid-Offs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A new medical policy has
been introduced for laid-off workers and other needy residents of
Chongqing municipality in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 400,000 laid-off workers in Chongqing and more
than 130,000 of them depend on relief funds from the local
government.
</P>
<P>
Under the former planned economy, work units or "Danwei"
covered all their medical expenses. Nevertheless, workers had to
pay for a certain percentage of medical expenses. The conspicuous
increase of pharmacies and drug stores in Beijing alone is a
telling sign that many work units no longer cover medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, laid-offs are only required to pay 70
percent of their operation expenses apart from the exemption of
registration fee. In addition to a 30-percent reduction of their
operation fees, those unemployed workers who have received a "
certificate with minimum guaranteed subsistence fees", they can
enjoy a 50-percent cut in their costs for hospitalization,
diagnoses and treatment.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Disburse New Loan to Indonesia Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will disburse its next tranche of loans to Indonesia
immediately after the government presents in January its next
state budget draft to the House of Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
This was stated by visiting IMF Asia Pacific Director Hubert
Neiss after meeting with senior Indonesian economic ministers here
Monday. He arrived in Jakarta on the weekend to finalize talks
over the country's new letter of intent (LoI) to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The LoI comprises Indonesia's basic economic strategies to be
financed by the IMF. Indonesia must first complete a new LoI, and
the IMF board of directors must give its approval to the LoI
before the fund disburses a new loan.
</P>
<P>
Neiss said some 90 percent of the LoI content had been
completed, but added that the final version would be completed by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"I think the LoI will be published at the same time as the
budget," Neiss was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is organizing a bailout cash package worth 46 billion U.
S. dollars for Indonesia, of which the IMF is committed to provide
some 12.3 billion dollars. It has so far disbursed more than 9.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Neiss will take the new LoI to Washington for approval.
Indonesia is expected to receive 460 million dollars in the new
IMF loan.
</P>
<P>
The new loan was supposed to be disbursed in the middle of
September, but the IMF suspended the disbursement following
revelations in the high-profile Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
The bank scandal centers around the legally dubious transfer of
some 80 million dollars from Bank Bali to a company linked to
former president B.J. Habibie's group in the giant Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
The IMF delayed its loan disbursement after the previous
administration of Habibie declined to publicly disclose the
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) audit report into the Bank Bali
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The new administration of President Abdurrahman Wahid published
the PwC report last month, prompting the IMF and other
international donors to resume talks with Indonesia.

Fund (UNICEF warned Indonesia over the possibility of it losing a
generation of children if the present government failed to improve
their health and education.
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Woodhouse, UNICEF representative for Indonesia and
Malaysia, rang the alarm bell during the release of The State of
The World's Children 2000 report here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report states that without immediate and concrete action
Indonesia may be unable to compete with other countries in the
global market due to the inferior quality of its human resources.
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia wants well balanced competition, it has to
develop smart, skillful and productive human resources," Woodhouse
said.
</P>
<P>
He said unhealthiness and malnutrition adversely affect
children's preparations for school and their performance in it.
</P>
<P>
"The school drop-out rate which remains high, especially in the
secondary level, and the poor academic achievement of Indonesian
students in general are certainly not things we expect in building
a new Indonesia," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, new Coordinating Minister for People's
Welfare and Poverty Alleviation Basri Hasanuddin said the unabated
economic crisis had caused school attendance rates in the country
to fall from 90 percent to 60 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He also said the number of malnourished children rose from 30
percent to 35 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Statistics said there are currently 38.3 million
students in the country, ranging from elementary to high schools.
Almost 25.7 million of them are elementary school students.
</P>
<P>
Woodhouse suggested the Indonesian government allocate more
funds in the health and education sectors, which he said are
crucial for the development of human resources.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia allocates only 8.5 percent of its current budget for
education and 4 percent for health, far below the between 21
percent and 26 percent set by its neighbors such as Thailand,
Malaysia and the Philippines for each of the sectors.
</P>
<P>
Basri said President Abdurrahman Wahid's government is seeking
an increase in the budget allocation for children's health and
education.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find Ancient Coins in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered a number of coins dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-
907) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, one of which is of
great value for the study of the ancient trade route.
</P>
<P>
The coins were discovered in Horinger County, some 100
kilometers south of the regional capital Hohhot. The county was a
strategic location in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists and numismatists are greatly interested in one
copper coin which was produced between the year 766 and 779.
</P>
<P>
Discovery of this coin may prove valuable for the study of the
ancient trade route which went from the southern part of the Inner
Mongolia plateau to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
central Asia, known as "grassland silk road," experts say.

<HEADLINE> Return Cements Macao's Role as Cross-Strait Link (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming Macao's return to
China on December 20 is expected to enhance the region's role as a
bridge for exchanges between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan
region.
</P>
<P>
The central government has adopted rather flexible policies for
handling relations between Macao and Taiwan after Macao's return,
which was embodied in the seven basic principles and policies vice-
premier Qian Qichen announced last January in that regard, making
it possible for Macao to fully tap its advantages to serve as a
cross-strait link.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the 1998 trade turnover between Taiwan and
Macao exceeded 360 million U.S. dollars and over 800,000 Taiwan
tourists visited Macao in 1998. More than 5,000 Macao residents
are now studying in Taiwan universities while Macao laborers in
Taiwan amount to between 15,000 and 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Close contacts with Taiwan enabled Macao to serve as a bridge
across the Taiwan Straits. Taiwan investors are seeking business
opportunities in Macao, using the region as a channel for them to
invest in the inland areas of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Macao has also been a transfer station in air transportation
between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan region after the local
airline "Air Macao" joined hands with some Taiwan airlines in 1995
to offer flights linking Chinese mainland cities with Macao, and
cities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao has always been regarded as an accessory to Hong
Kong in the past in facilitating the cross-strait exchanges, since
Macao is far from being a rival of Hong Kong in both policy
incentives and economic strength.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, Macao has its own unique advantages as a cross-
strait link," said Ambrose So, president of the Macao "One Country
Two Systems" Research Center.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, Macao and Taiwan have been closely
connected ever since ancient times and their cultures are very
similar in nature. The more than 100,000 Fujian natives in Macao,
who have the same ancestor, culture and customs as residents in
Taiwan, are serving as a backbone force in cross-strait exchanges,
making Macao an important bridge between Taiwan and Fujian
province.

<P>
"Its unique culture also enables it to serve as a bridge for
Taiwan businesses to muscle into the European market and even
market in Latin American countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
All these advantages, however, were not made full use of in the
past, mainly due to the backward infrastructure and bureaucracy of
the Portuguese Macao government.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China will enable it to fully explore its
potential, according to an expert on Macao issue. Becoming the
masters of their own region is expected to greatly inspire work
enthusiasm among the local civil servants, and greatly increase
the work efficiency of the civil service. Infrastructure is
expected to improve as a result, providing impetus for furthering
the economic cooperation between Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a trade and cooperation pact signed between Macao
and the European Union in 1992, Taiwan investors may set up
businesses in Macao as a link for the three markets in the Chinese
mainland, Europe and Latin language speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
There will be much more space for Macao to further its
exchanges with Taiwan in many aspects according to the policies
the central government announced in January.
</P>
<P>
However, Macao's role as a cross-strait bridge can only be
brought into full play when the policy of "one country, two
systems" is effectively implemented. "Only under that prerequisite
can we have reasons to believe that Macao will play its role in
facilitating the integration of both sides across the Taiwan
Strait on the basis of mutual benefit so as to finally achieve the
reunification of the whole Chinese nation," Ambrose So concluded.

<HEADLINE> Structure Readjustment Crucial to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The government should work
strenuously to cultivate new growth to increase farmers' income,
to solve the problem of farmers' stagnant income growth, said an
article in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
With 20 years of robust development in agriculture and rural
economy, farmers' annual income rose from the 1978 figure of 134
yuan (16 U.S. dollars) to 2,162 yuan (260 dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate of farmers' income has continued to
decline in the past few years. It is estimated that the year-on-
year growth rate will be 4 percent this year while 4.3 percent in
1998 and 4.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the downward trend is caused by complicated
factors. Compared with developed countries, farmers' share of
added value from agricultural processing is considerably low due
to backward value-added farm produce industries.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' low income has been further reduced by fees and
levies and the township enterprises, which made a major
contribution to farmers' income in the past years, have been
struggling themselves owing to dwindling competitiveness after 10
years of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance, it is essential to various effective
measures to raise farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
The daily suggested that the most important task is to readjust
structure of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the quality of farm produce and increase
profitability, the product mix should be optimized and local
advantage should be fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
Intensified efforts should be made for building high-quality
and high-yield crop bases.
</P>
<P>
Another major task is to invigorate the circulation of farm
produce and strengthen the construction of farm produce market
system.
</P>
<P>
To promote industrialized agricultural operations, efforts
should focus on fostering leading enterprises with the capacity to
explore the market, conduct intensive processing of farm produce
and provide services to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of revitalizing agriculture through science and
education should be fully implemented, the paper added.

<P>
CHENGDU, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine provinces and autonomous
regions along the Yellow River, China's second longest, have
decided to join hands to tap the river's tourist resources.
</P>
<P>
 Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong
provinces, as well as the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolian
autonomous regions, have unique advantages for developing the
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
There are many scenic spots in these provinces and regions,
including Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong Scenic Resort in Sichuan, vast
grasslands in Inner Mongolia, the Loess Plateau and terra-cotta
warriors in Shaanxi, the Hukou Waterfall in Shanxi, the Shaolin
Temple in Henan, and Mount Taishan in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
China's Great Wall and Yellow River are both well-known around
the world, but the number of overseas tourists visiting the Yellow
River is less than one percent of those who make it to the Great
Wall.
</P>
<P>
The nine provinces and autonomous regions now plan to establish
a tourism information network and to hold a tourism fair every two
years.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin to Shut Down Enterprises Not Meeting State Emission Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin municipal
government will shut down 23 enterprises if they do not meet state
emission standards by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Tianjin environmental
protection bureau, all of these enterprises have been informed of
the deadline and this decision.
</P>
<P>
To better carry out the state law on environmental protection,
Tianjin adopted strict regulations in 1996 to control pollutants
and set five deadlines for enterprises to meet state emission
standards. This December 31 is the last deadline.
</P>
<P>
After about four years, a total of 780 enterprises in the
northern China port city have met the emission standards, and the
city's industrial pollution has been greatly reduced, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 23 enterprises, some of which produce steel and
cement, need to work hard to meet emission standards. Once shut
down, they can only resume operations after passing the inspection
of local environmental departments.
</P>
<P>
Some of these enterprises have said that they will make a last-
ditch effort to meet the standards by year's end, the official
added.

industrial growth in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the provincial capital will give
priority to a range of development programs including high-tech

<HEADLINE> Central American Military Leaders Confident of Panama Canal Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The military heads of
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have promised that the security
at Panama Canal is guaranteed after the United States hands it
over to Panama, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The military leaders, during a meeting in Guatemala late last
month, ruled out any threat to the Canal's security in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
General Staff of the Nicaraguan Army Javier Carrion said that
Panama has the ability to control the canal on its own and there
is no need to provide excessive military protection there.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Defense Minister General Marco Tulio Espinosa said
the Canal is a strategic point whose security influences all the
countries of the American continent, while El Salvadoran Defense
Minister Juan Antonio Martinez said the Panama Canal is a route of
world and denied the handover would affect the function of the
inter-oceanic waterway.
</P>
<P>
Under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties of 1977, the United States
will hand over the Panama Canal on December 31 and withdraw all of
its soldiers from the Panamanian territory after 85 years of
military presence.

<P>
GUIYANG, December 14 (Xinhua)-- More than 2,200 grotto-dwellers
in Guizhou Province in southwest China are expected to move into
new housing within the next two years with the help of the local
government.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for a total of 300 million yuan (36 million U.S
dollars) earmarked to assist those who now can only afford to live
in grottos, according to a recent working conference on the
relocation program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more funds will also gradually be put into many
infrastructure projects, including the construction of water-
purification works, electrification, and road construction.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Guizhou city civil administration
department show there are more than 7,700 needy locals now living
in the grottos, people of the Miao, Dong and Bouyi ethnic groups
occupying a large proportion of this number.
</P>
<P>
So far, approximately 150 million yuan (18 million dollars) has
been put into the program and nearly 300 farming families, which

<HEADLINE> World Bank-Funded River Project Completed in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an navigation
and electricity project on the Xiangjiang River has been completed
in central China's Hunan Province with the aid of World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The four-year project ended up at a cost of 90 million U.S.
dollars of World Bank loans and 1.1 billion yuan (about 133
million U.S. dollars) of domestic funding.
</P>
<P>
The key state project included the building of four hydro-power
generators with a total generating capacity of 600 million kwh a
year, and smoothing of the waterway to improve navigation on the
inland river.
</P>
<P>
The project will allow ships of more than 1,000 dwt to sail to
ports along the Yangtze River and the coast area.
</P>
<P>
Xiangjiang, which waters 40 percent of the province's land and
serves about 60 percent of its people, has been seriously
contaminated. In the past five years, the provincial government
has spent over 1.6 billion yuan (193 million U.S. dollars) to
treat pollution and has closed down industrial polluters on the
river.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of this project, more than 30 million fish
fry were released into the river to sustain fishing resources, a
procedure which will be repeated every year for the next ten years.

<P>
SAN JOSE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- More than one million

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Restriction on Genetically Modified food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union environment
ministers called for a binding global pact on Monday to regulate
trade in genetically modified (GM) foods.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc's ministers approved the EU's negotiating
position for talks in Montreal, Canada, next month on a long-
delayed international Biosafety Protocol under the auspices of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The ministers in their agreement promised the EU will take a
tough line in what is supposed to be the last round of talks.
</P>
<P>
"We got very strong backing for a tough negotiating position,"
said Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen, spokeswoman for EU Environment
Commissioner Margot Wallstrom.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers stressed the need for an agreement to be struck now
and said this protocol must not be subordinated to World Trade
Organization rules."
</P>
<P>
A U.N. meeting in February in Cartagena, Colombia, failed to
reach agreement after the U.S.-led "Miami Group" of countries,
which include Canada, Argentina, Uruguay, Australia and Chile,
refused to accept demands for labeling of GM products.
</P>
<P>
Europe insists on precise labeling for GM products and products
derived from them, and has been much slower in approving new GM
foods than the United States.
</P>
<P>
Growing consumer concern about the safety of GM foods has meant
that no new GM crops have been authorized in the EU since April
1998, raising fears of another trade war with the United States,
which has been unable to export to Europe millions of dollars
worth of GM commodities, such as corn.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said the protocol should cover GM products used in
food, animal feed and for processing, and must ensure "adequate
procedures concerning the authorizations of transboundary
movements" of GM crops, including a duty to notify importing
countries of planned shipments to allow all GM crop movements to
be traceable.
</P>
<P>
The EU will also call for the Protocol to have equal legal
status with international trade agreements, including any future
WTO accord.
</P>
<P>
The abortive WTO talks in Seattle earlier this month failed to
agree on a U.S. proposal to establish a working group to discuss
approval procedures for GM products.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the United States have however set up a regular
video conference on the issue since a recent visit by EU executive
Commission President Romano Prodi to Washington.

<HEADLINE> 1,200-Year-Old Leaning Pagoda Needs Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A 1,200-year-old pagoda on
Mount Lushan, a renowned tourist attraction in Jiangxi Province,
east China, has been tilting recently, and is now in urgent need
of repair.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Xilin Temple, the Qianfo (thousand Buddhas)
pagoda was first built up in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was
then renovated during the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127).
</P>
<P>
Within the seven-storey, six-sided pagoda are adobe Buddhas,
painted pottery and porcelain, and 1,800 jade figures of Buddha.
The pagoda is of great importance for knowledge of sculpture art
and religion in past ages.
</P>
<P>
A local cultural relics manager said that the increased lean of
the tower is due to the use of concrete and other building
materials in recent facelifts.
</P>
<P>
The roaring traffic outside the temple, which is causing the
surrounding ground to sink, also explains the incline of the
pagoda.

<HEADLINE> Dismissed Romanian PM Calls Removal "Unconstitutional" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Dismissed Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile said on television Tuesday that his removal
by President Emil Constantinescu was "Unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Vasile was dismissed in the small hours of Tuesday and Labor
and Social Protection Minister Alexander Athanasiu was appointed
at the same time to head an interim government.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Razvan Popescu said Constantinescu made
the decisions after intense consultations with the leaders of the
ruling coalition, taking into consideration that the Vasile
cabinet is practically paralyzed with all parties in the coalition
having withdrawn their political support to the prime minister,
and most of the ministers having handed in their resignations.
</P>
<P>
Romania's main ruling Christian Democratic National Peasant
Party on Monday evening decided to withdraw all its ministers from
the government, in an attempt to force its own party member Vasile
to resign.
</P>
<P>
But Vasile immediately went live on the national television
saying that he would not resign. He argued that no one but the
parliament could dismiss the prime minister under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said a wing of Vasile's own party and
Constantinescu were attempting to oust Vasile, who has faced
criticism over the pace of reforms as Romania seeks to join the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Vasile was appointed prime minister in early 1998 after his
predecessor Victor Ciorbea was forced to step down in a dispute
within the ruling coalition.

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands To Set Up System For Euro Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands said Monday
that it is to set up a separate logistics chain for stocking
retail outlets with euro coins.
</P>
<P>
The task will be conducted by the De Nederlandsche Bank. It
will be necessary because of the enormous volume and weight of the
euro coins, the Dutch Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In order to permit rapid conversion from the guilder, the Dutch
currency, to the euro, banks and retailers will be able to obtain
stocks of euro coins and banknotes at the end of 2001, the
ministry said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Retail outlets will be supplied direct and free of charge with
standard packs of euro coins. As of January 1, 2002, the public
will only be able to obtain euro banknotes from cash machines, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union's regulation, the euro coins and
banknotes will be used by the public from January 2002 while
national currencies will be totally withdrawn from the market.
</P>
<P>
Now the euro is being used on the financial market and people
can use it as "electronic money" with bank accounts or all kinds
of credit cards because there is no euro cash during the euro
transitional period between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2001.

LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) - Europe's main stock markets
closed mixed Monday with London shares easing from recent record
territory and Paris and Frankfurt closing 1 percent and half a
percent higher respectively.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 closed down 0.43 percent, or 28.8 points, at

index had earlier come within 3 points of a lifetime record set on

BT ended off half a percent amid reports that it may seek to
buy Esat, Ireland's second-largest telecom firm, which already is

</P>
<P>
CW slumped 6.1 percent, reflecting weakness across the telecom
sector, while VOD shed 2.4 percent amid uncertainty on how its
hostile bid for German rival MMN will pan out.
</P>
<P>
MKS, which catapulted 14 percent Friday, staggered in the
opposite direction after an early surge Monday was derailed by
second-guessing over the prospects for an imminent deal.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, a sharp rally in software firm SAP, coupled with
strength in high-profile banking issues, underpinned late gains in
its electronically traded Xetra Dax. The index ended up 0.48
percent at 6,127.20, a gain of 29.30 points.

<HEADLINE> Equatorial Guinea Seeks More Foreign Investment in Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cristobal Manana Ela, Equatorial Guinea's minister of energy,
told Xinhua, "We have a free market economy. We welcome more U.S.
investment, and we also welcome investment from other countries."
</P>
<P>
At present, there are six foreign companies, including Mobil,
Exxon and Triton, operating in 11 regions in the African country.
Some of them are located in offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
Ela is in Tucson to attend the three-day U.S.-Africa Energy
Ministers Conference, which is scheduled to open here Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
In the course of exploration and production, "we are also
fighting against the consequences of environmental pollution," the
Spanish-speaking minister said through an interpreter, "The
government has organized a group of experts to do research in
order to find proper solutions."
</P>
<P>
Situated at the hub of the dynamic offshore West African
petroleum province, Equatorial Guinea is quickly establishing
itself as a new significant oil producing nation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Exploration activity has focused on two areas: offshore Bioko,
an extension of the prolific Niger Delta basin, and Rio Muni,
which lies between the producing areas of offshore Cameroon and
Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The Equatorial Guinean government is now offering the remaining
open areas of offshore territory for petroleum licensing, opening
up a substantial tract of one of the world's prime deep water
exploration areas.
</P>
<P>
Equatorial Guinea consists of the islands of Bioko, Annobon,
and the continental enclaves of Rio Muni, which is bordered to the
north by Cameroon and to the east and south by Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Equatorial Guinea is an independent West African republic with
established oil and gas production, significant offshore
hydrocarbon prospects and excellent minerals resource potential.
The Energy Ministry seeks to develop the mining industry by
encouraging minerals prospecting and is actively promoting
offshore hydrocarbons exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
The first offshore hydrocarbons were found in the 1960s when
Mobil drilled the Alba-I gas condensate discovery some 30
kilometers north of Bioko island. Development of the field,
however, did not commence until 1990. Hydrocarbon production in
Equatorial Guinea includes oil, gas and condensate, which is
exported to Cameroon, the United States and Cote D'Ivoire, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum production now dominates the nation's economy. Oil
revenues account for about 70 percent of the national income and
the expansion of the petroleum sector has been the driving force
behind the recent dramatic growth in the gross domestic product (
GDP).
</P>
<P>
Equatorial Guinea has the fastest growing economy in Africa,
with GDP at around 500 million U.S. dollars. Impressive growth in
the GDP rose to 76 percent in 1997, following growth rates of 29
percent in 1996 and 14 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In November 1998, the Energy Ministry announced the opening of
Equatorial Guinea's Deep Water Licensing Round. Companies are
invited to make bids for any exploration acreage within the 38,000
square kilometers open for licensing.
</P>
<P>
Interest in West Africa has been ignited by recent discoveries
and the region is now regarded as the world's premier location for
deep water prospects. The scale of potential finds more than
matches the giant fields found in other deep water basins such as
offshore Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico, the ministry officials
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 453 Million Dollars in Credit for Kazakhstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Monday a three-year credit of 453 million U.
S. dollars for Kazakhstan under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
to support the government's economic program for 2000-2002.
</P>
<P>
The first installment, which will be available immediately,
will be in an amount equivalent to 35 million dollars, the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
"Directors welcomed the recent positive developments in
Kazakhstan's economy and the authorities' commitment to achieve
macroeconomic stabilization and accelerate structural reforms,"
IMF Deputy Managing Director Shigemitsu Sugisaki said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The EFF is an IMF financing facility that supports medium-term
programs that seek to overcome balance of payments difficulties
stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems.
The repayment terms are 10 years with a four and a half-year grace
period, and the interest rate, adjusted weekly, is currently about
3.8 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Although the Kazakh government had achieved financial
stabilization and advanced the structural agenda by 1997, a series
of external shocks hit the economy in 1998, which, together with
delays in implementing necessary policy adaptations, resulted in a
recession and raised concerns for the medium-term outlook, the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) declined 2.5 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The government's 2000-2002 economic program centers on pursuing
a prudent monetary policy in the context of a freely floating
exchange rate, consolidating public finances to ensure medium-term
sustainability, and pressing ahead with broad-based structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to achieve steady GDP growth from zero growth
this year to 3 percent in 2000, 3.5 percent in 2001, and 4 percent
in 2002, and a progressive decline in inflation from an expected
17 percent at end-1999 to 9 percent in 2000, 6.5 percent in 2001,
and 4 percent in 2002.

"By the end of the year 2000, a total of 133 million children
will have lost their mothers or both parents to AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 600 million children are struggling to
survive on less than 1 U.S. dollar a day, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 million children in developing countries, 60 percent
of whom are girls, can not get basic education, Bellamy said by
quoting statistics in the survey.
</P>
<P>
"In 30 countries the half of the population over 15 cannot read
or write," she said.
</P>
<P>
In African countries south of Sahara, no more than 56 percent
of children can go basic school. This ratio is even 5 percent
lower that the number in 1980, added Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
The basic rights of children have been recognized for 10 years,
and have been written in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
Child, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief abused "the merciless targeting of children
and women in armed conflicts, the transformation of AIDS into the
No.1 killer in Africa, and the free-fall of development aid to the
poorest nations."
</P>
<P>
"The eight most important industrial countries have cut their
development help by one third since the beginning of the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
This has magnified what threaten the children in the developing
world, said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
"If all the industrial countries could commit their development
aid to poorest nations, that means 0.7 percent of their gross
domestic products (GDP), there would be annually further 100
billion dollars," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy announced a new UNICEF agenda to cope with the
challenges facing children as they enter the 21st century. The
agenda includes early childhood care and development, basic
education and a renewed focus on adolescents.
</P>
<P>
"The world has resources and experiences to know what works for
children. The time has come for us to put our words into action,"
she said. "if we do, we can make significant changes for children
within a single generation."

<HEADLINE> WHO to Expand Activities to Help Strengthen Health of Child and Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
WHO) is now able to greatly expand its child and youth activities,
thanks to a 16.4-million-dollar grant from the United Nations
Foundation(UNF), said WHO here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Child and adolescent health represent the backbone of WHO's
commitment to improving health and combating disease," said WHO
Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland at a meeting Monday in
Geneva with former U.S. Senator and President of UNF Timothy Wirth.
</P>
<P>
"Healthy children and confident, competent adolescents will be
the productive adults of tomorrow. We thank the UN Foundation for
sharing and supporting this commitment," she said.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of UNF awards for the UN System totalled 51
million dollars and is aimed at decreasing child and youth
mortality, particularly in Africa, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
The 16.4 million dollars received by WHO will be used to
strengthen community knowledge about the needs of ill children (as
part of WHO's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness "IMCI"
strategy), to involve youth as partners in preventing HIV/AIDS, to
support sustainable vaccine delivery, and to improve child
nutrition by using vitamin A and zinc as food supplements.
</P>
<P>
All projects have been funded for a three-year period and most
of them will take place in one or more of eight African countries
selected by UNF as priorities: Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria,
Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In just over one year, the UNF has given or pledged nearly 50
million dollars to WHO programs. UNF is supported by the American
billionaire Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
Since Dr Brundtland became the Director-General of WHO in July
1998, the Organization has actively pursued innovative
partnerships with other UN agencies, private foundations, and
industry. The UN Foundation support, through the UN Fund for
International Partnerships, is providing increased means of
collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and
other agencies involved in child health.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Approves Additional Environment Protection Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
approved additional measures aimed at helping protect and conserve
ecosystems and biological diversity of maritime areas.
</P>
<P>
The measures approved Monday are enshrined in an annex to the
1992 Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of
the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), which Switzerland ratified along
with 14 other nations. The OSPAR convention entered into force in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
Swiss approval of the annex was meant to signal that
Switzerland, even though it is a landlocked country, is supporting
international measures to protect marine ecosystems, the
government said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Signatories to the OSPAR convention pledge to protect the
environment by preventing discharges of dangerous substances from
land-based sources, water courses or pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Member states also agreed to phase out the dumping at sea of
sewage sludge, dredged material and the incineration at sea of
industrial wastes.
</P>
<P>
Approval of the annex will allow Switzerland to join
international programs that are aimed at protecting plant and
animal life in coastal regions.

<HEADLINE> Rangers to Sign Tugay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Scottish soccer club Rangers
are poised to sign Turkish international midfielder Kerimoglu
Tugay under the Bosman Ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Galatasaray star was in Glasgow on Monday and looked set to
sign a pre-contract agreement with the Scottish champions.
</P>
<P>
And the 29-year-old midfielder could be the first of several
new signings at Ibrox as Rangers bid to bounce back from the
disappointment of another European exit before Christmas after the
narrow UEFA Cup exit to Borussia Dortmund last week.
</P>
<P>
Manager Dick Advocaat made it clear after the dramatic penalty
shoot-out exit in Dortmund that he felt a number of his current
squad do not have what it takes to perform at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
Should Tugay, who helped the Turkish side bundle Manchester
United out of the European Cup in 1993, agree to sign, he would
join at the end of the season as he is contracted to the Istanbul
club until then.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Begins Preparation for Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager
Kevin Keegan is hoping to line up a number of international
friendlies in the build up to the European championships.
</P>
<P>
England face Germany, Portugal and Romania at the Euro 2000
finals and Keegan is keen to keep his players in top form as the
tournament approaches.
</P>
<P>
A clash against Brazil is virtually confirmed at Wembley on May
27, but the ex-Liverpool star is hoping to arrange a final pre-
tournament warm-up on 31 May.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "We won't be playing Germany now. We've got the
draw we'll try and fix up that last game for the end of May."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we've got Argentina in February and Brazil is
brilliant but we must also have a European side for the last game
and that is really important now.
</P>
<P>
"The other teams will have been waiting for the draw as well
and they'll quite fancy playing us. We would prefer it to be at
Wembley but it doesn't have to be."
</P>
<P>
While Keegan admitted he was not "doing handstands" over the
draw, he did manage to avoid facing Holland, the Czech Republic
and France in Group D - a fate which befell Denmark.
</P>
<P>
And the England coach duly expressed his confidence that the
national side could make it through to the quarter-finals - where
they would face either Belgium, Sweden, Italy or Turkey - if they
stepped up their game from the largely inept qualifying displays.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, with the largely unfulfilled talents - at least
internationally - of the likes of Rui Costa, Luis Figo and
Fernando Couto, are the first opposition in the 30,000-capacity
Philips stadium in Eindhoven on June 12.
</P>
<P>
England then have a short break until they take on Germany on
June 17 before facing Romania, who defeated Glenn Hoddle's side 2-
1 at France '98 with a last-minute goal from Chelsea's Dan
Petrescu,in the final group game on June 20.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Rule Out Kick-Off Time Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA have ruled out any change to the kick-off time for England's
Euro 2000 match against Germany in June, despite fears of possible
trouble.
</P>
<P>
The tie in Charleroi on June 17 is due to start at 8.45pm local
time, and Belgian organisers have already launched a security
review.
</P>
<P>
According to Charleroi's mayor it is "the match people are
dreading". There are no flights out scheduled for after the match
and local accommodation for the thousands of fans is limited.
</P>
<P>
The Football Supporters' Association admit to some concern over
the possibility of trouble occurring between rival fans and will
visit Charleroi on a fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA insist the kick-off time cannot be changed and are
confident their security arrangements will cope with any potential
trouble.
</P>
<P>
A UEFA spokeswoman said: "The draw is the draw and we are
sticking to it. The kick-off time cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
"All matches in the European Championships have the same risk
and we are not making a special case for any of them."
</P>
<P>
Jacques van Gompel, the mayor of Charleroi, said: "We will have
to review all our security measures. It's the match people are
dreading. I've said all along that we will need extra assistance."
