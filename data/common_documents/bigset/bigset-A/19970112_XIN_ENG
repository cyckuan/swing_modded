Qian Qichen, in the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Qian conveyed the regards of President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Li Peng to President Chirac, and said the Chinese leaders were
looking forward to the visit by President Chirac to China in May.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he was also looking forward to his state visit to
China, and asked Qian to convey his regards to President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said he attached great importance to his visit to China,
and hoped the visit would be a milestone in developing both
Franco-Chinese relations and European-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and France shared identical views on many
international problems, and both China and France thought all
countries should respect the sovereignty, cultural traditions and
national independence of others.
</P>
<P>
He said China thought that a multipolar world was good for
maintaining world peace and stability, and expressed hope that
China and France would continue to exchange views at top level to
increase mutual understanding and confidence, and expand friendly
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he agreed that France and China shared many
common views.
</P>
<P>
He said the world was experiencing a transitional period, and
was no longer dominated by a bipolar structure.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that it was irreversible that a multipolar world
would emerge, as there exists many different forces in the world
today.
</P>
<P>
He said France, as an important power in Europe, paid great
attention to developing relations between Europe and China, which,
he said, were two important forces to promote development in the
both Franco-Chinese relations and European-Chinese relations.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Registers Zimbabwe's AIDS Drug Patent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based World
Intellectual Property Organization has approved and registered a
patent application for an AIDS-drug developed by Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Gordon Chavunduka, the President of the
Zimbabwe Traditional Healers Association, here today in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''some more work needs to be doned to make the drug more
effective before formal clinical trials are conducted.''
</P>
<P>
Claims of aids-curing drugs have sparked a controversy in Zimbabwe
as some government officials feel the drugs should be tried while
others insist no cure has been found yet.
</P>
<P>
Most of the claims are being made by traditional healers who say
their concoctions can reverse some symptoms of the HIV-caused
conditions.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 percent of the country's 11.5 million population is
estimated to be infected with HIV while between 300 and 500 people
die of AIDS each week. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hosts Ross-Palestinian Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting was held here
this afternoon, grouping Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat and American Mideast
peace envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
The talks centered on the developments of the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the obstacles hindering the
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The three-way meeting, held at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry
premises, was preceded by talks between Moussa and Erakat on the
latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Erakat told an Egyptian radio after the meeting that the
Palestinians attach great importance to the roles played by Egypt
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Political Advisor to the Foreign Minister Nabil
Fahmi had talks with Ross and reviewed the American efforts to
bring closer the views of the Palestinian and Israeli sides.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this
morning. he told reporters after the meeting that the parties
concerned all agreed to give a push to the stalled talks, while
some points remain to be solved.
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the negotiations is Hebron together with some
other topics," he said. However, he declined to comment on the
Israeli proposed delay of troop pullout from the West Bank for two
years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy now is expected to build up a common ground for
the two sides to continue talks on implementing further
withdrawals from the rest of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross' intense shuttle mediations nearly sewed up the Hebron
part of the deal before Israel proposed the put-off early this
week. The Palestinian side rejected the proposal, demanding for
the strict implementation by Israel of the Oslo II Accords, which
envision three pullbacks to be finished in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian standoff has prompted Ross to dish out
a compromise date of September 1998. The current diplomatic
shuttles seem to focus on the latest U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
Tonight Ross may also meet with Palestinian Authority leader
Yasser Arafat, who returned to Gaza after a brief meeting with
Mubarak here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have urged the U.S. to play a "fair" role,
especially as President Bill Clinton himself co-signed the Oslo II
peace agreements in Washington in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state, has been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause
and a key player in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Study: Chinese Herb Used As Drug Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 11 (Xinhua) -- A study by Israeli
scientists showed a substance derived from a moss used in Chinese
medicine can help block a brain enzyme that may be involved in
developing the Alzheimer disease.
</P>
<P>
The substance called Hupterzine A (HupA), which is extracted
from the Huperzia serratea moss used in China for centuries as a
medicine called Qian Ceng Ta, was found to be helpful in curing
the disease, according to the January issue of Nature Structural
Biology released by the Israeli Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The report said Israeli scientists in the institute have
solved the 3-D structure of a complex made up of the substance
and the brain enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
</P>
<P>
The scientists were surprised to find out that the
determination of the structure revealed a "strikingly good fit
between HupA and the enzyme" and may help develop a new generation
of Alzheimer drugs with improved properties, said the report.
</P>
<P>
HupA, which differs from two other Alzheimer drugs approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, tacrine (COGNEX) and E2020
(ARICEPT), is currently under investigation in China and
elsewhere as a possible Alzheimer curing drug.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Inspection of Early 747 Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration has ordered operators of Boeing 747s to inspect
early abrasion on fuel tank wiring.
</P>
<P>
The order was made following the probe on the TWA Flight 800,
which exploded on July 17 of last year shortly after taking off
from New York's Kennedy Airport, killing all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The FAA said Friday the order was made following its probe of
possible mechanical failures that could have led to the accident,
including "failures that could result in ignition sources in the
fuel tanks".
</P>
<P>
After months of work, investigators said that what they were
sure was that the plane's center fuel tank exploded. They cannot
determine whether the tank explosion was touched off by a spark
from a mechanical malfunction or from a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
Under the order, which takes effect on January 21, operators of
Boeing 747s must look for damage on wire bundles for the boost
pumps for the plane's two outboard main fuel tanks located in the
aircraft's wings, and wire bundles for auxiliary fuel tank
jettison pumps.

<HEADLINE>   Tension in Cyprus Causes International Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Tension continues to build up
on this East Mediterranean island following a series of Turkish
threats against the Cyprus government since Nicosia revealed a
deal to buy Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles early this week.
</P>
<P>
The latest threat came from Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, who vowed to take over the ghost-town of Varosha if the
Cyprus government proceeds with the deployment of Russian
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said Friday: "we will take all measures we see as
necessary as long as the decision to buy the S-300 missile system
goes ahead and as long as the Greek Cypriots insist on continuing
with the behavior that is deepening the confidence crisis on the
island."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops landed
in northern Cyprus and seized 37 percent of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Varosha, a former holiday resort south of Famagusta, has been
a no-man's land area since then and has not been opened up to
Turkish Cypriot civilian settlement.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller also
threatened that Turkey would strike at the missiles when they are
deployed.
</P>
<P>
"These offensive missiles will definitely not be deployed. If
they are deployed we will do what is needed, if that means they
need to be hit they will be hit," she told a press conference in
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
However, the Turkish threats were dismissed by Cyprus Foreign
Minister Alecos Michaelides, who said that "we are not going to
follow the line of Turkey. We are going to concentrate on a
political solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides accused Ciller and Denktash of escalating tension
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Denktash and Ankara are trying to create tension and
discourage countries interested in providing support for a
political solution to the problem," he said, adding that "we are
not going to play their game."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' deal to buy Russian missiles, signed last weekend and
officially announced on Monday, has been criticized not just by
Turkey, but the U.S. and Britain as well.
</P>
<P>
However, Cyprus has refused to bow to international pressure
to cancel the deal which it says is purely for the sake of
defense.
</P>
<P>
The tension on the island has also caused concern to the
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who issued a statement Friday
night calling on parties involved for maximum restraint.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of carefully prepared
face-to-face talks between President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to reach a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Director of the Office of Southern European
Affairs at the U.S. State Department, Carey Cavanaugh, is
expected to arrive in Cyprus Sunday in a bid to reduce tension.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat is scheduled to meet with President
Clerides Monday morning and then fly to Athens for meetings
with Greek leaders. He will also go to Turkey for meetings with
Turkish officials later next week.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Fair Ends in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli trade fair ended
today after Jordanians staged protests against it on Wednesday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The protesters denounced the exhibition, organized by a
private Jordanian firm, as an Israeli attempt to make Jordan the
gateway to the Arab economy.
</P>
<P>
The protest could chill business relations between the two
countries and "Israeli firms will be afraid to come and do
business in Jordan in view of the opposition here," Shalom Gabbay,
owner of the Tel Aviv-based Amik Tourism Company, told the local
English language daily Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government adopted a neutral stand, saying the
trade fair was just a private commercial behavior and it was
neither for it nor against it.
</P>
<P>
The four-day exhibition, which opened here Wednesday, was
initially due to open on December 15, 1996, but was postponed
twice because of the opposition from inside Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace agreement with Israel in October 1994
and agreed to set up relations in all spheres.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the first day of the Holy month of Ramadan, the
Islamic lunar month, nearly 1,500 people performed prayers near
the Amman International Fair in protest against the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The prayers followed a larger scale protest Wednesday involving
2,500 people near the exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
A organization called "National committee for Cancelling the
Israeli Trade Fair" was formed to lead the protest campaign. The
committee was headed by former Prime Minister Ahmad Obeidat and
included legislators, trade unions activists and members from
professional associations.
</P>
<P>
Twenty out of the existig 23 political parties also took part
in the protest.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK's Film Industry Levels Highest For 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- The British film industry
flourished last year, with UK producers investing in 114 features,
the highest number for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 127 films were either produced or shot in the UK
during 1996, notably the Hollywood studios which shot several
blockbusters at British studios, according to the figures in the
latest issue of Screen Finance, a British News-letter.
</P>
<P>
The production budgets for these films, which included 37
international co-productions, were worth 725 million pounds (1160
million U.S dollars), 72 percent more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of UK-produced films seems set to
continue during 1997, as additional capital becomes available, the
Newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
Finewood and Shepperton, the two main British film studios,
have been fully booked for the past year, often with US
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
Britain is a logical choice as a European location for US film
makers because of the common language and Britain's skilled
production crews, The Screen Finance said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Demand Continues to Rise, Says OAPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- World oil demand will
continue to rise during the first quarter of 1997 over the level
registered by the end of last year, the Kuwait-based Organization
of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) predicts.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the final quarter of 1996 easily reached 73.7 million
barrels per day (bpd) and is expected to rise to 74.4 million bpd
in the first quarter of this year, according to the latest issue
of OAPEC bulletin available here today.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend is expected to continue through this
extraordinarily freezing winter which witnesses high demand for
heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a great drop in oil stocks in recent months also
contributed to the increase in world oil demand.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) predicted in
last October that the United States, one of the world major oil
consumers, would be in short supply of fuel this winter.
</P>
<P>
It said distillate fuel oil stocks, used primarily for home
heating and transportation, are unusually low, closing last
August at 109.7 million barrels or 16 percent below both the
five-year average stock level.
</P>
<P>
The recent Iraqi limited revival of oil exports to the world
market will also be easily absorbed due to the decrease in global
oil reserve, cold winter in the earth's northern hemisphere and
turbulent situation in the Middle east, experts believe.
</P>
<P>
The OAPEC bulletin pointed out that global oil demand rose by
nearly two million bpd during the first nine months of last year
to reach 71.2 million bpd comparing to the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the bulletin said the world demand on OAPEC oil was
still stagnant as its production rose by only 100,000 bpd during
the first nine months of last year over the same period in 1995
to hit 19 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The world supplies from outside OAPEC was estimated at 52.5
million bpd in 1996, recording a 1.8 billion bpd increase over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As for the prices, the bulletin indicated that it may maintain
the present level.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, the price of crude oil has been hovering
at dizzy heights not seen since the 1990-91 Gulf War. The sudden
halt to Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil exports during the conflict sent
prices soaring, but this lasted only six months, and the market
soon returned to its dismal form.
</P>
<P>
But from mid-1996, the trend reversed and prices began to
climb steadily. It said the prices topped 21 U.S. dollars per
barrel since last winter to reach 21.7 and 23.3 dollars in
September and October 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Buying Iraqi Oil in Market Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan denies Iraq is selling it
crude oil at the relatively higher international market price than
a bilaterally agreed favorable one.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Hishem Dabbas told
Jordan's official News Agency Petra that Jordan now imports
12,000 tonnes of crude oil per day from Iraq at a price of 15.25
U.S. dollars per barrel while the price at the international
market was 25 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to Petra, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz would
pay an official visit to Amman Monday to discuss issues of
bilateral trade and relationship.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first official visit by a senior Iraqi
official to Jordan since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's nephew
fled to Jordan and the bilateral ties cooled down sharply in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this month, Dabbas and Minister of
Finance Marwan Awad started to work with senior Iraqi officials
and technical experts on details of renewing an oil agreement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq is expected to increase by 7 percent
its oil supplies to Jordan at Jordan's request.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether there was any problem in renewing the
agreement, Information Minister Marwan Awad said "not
as far as I know," adding that "certain technical details"
remained to be sorted out in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Iraq fulfills all of Jordan's oil needs by trucking 50,000
barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 20,000 to 25,000 bpd of
fuel oil to the country's only refinery at Zarqa.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi oil exports to Jordan are exempt from the United
Nations economic sanctions imposed on Iraq following the August
1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under a special agreement worked out between the two
countries, Jordan sends food and medicine to Iraq in settlement
of the oil bill.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual Jordanian supplies to Iraq were high than
the oil bill in the past five years and Baghdad now owes Jordan
1.3 billion U.S. dollars, including debts accummulated during the
1980s as well as the unsettled payment of part of the Jordanian
exports to Iraq since then, Jordan Times reported today.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Truck Owners Threaten Service Stoppage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's truck owners today
threatened to stop operations to all the ports in the country
starting from Monday if the government insists they should buy a
particular brand of fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Sani Ibrahim, President of the Nigerian Association of
Road Transport Owners (NARTO), said the association would not
oppose to installing fire extinguishers on trucks, but would not
accept the imposition of a particular brand.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had ordered on Friday that
all trailers without fire extinguishers should be denied of
entrance to ports.
</P>
<P>
It said that the directive is in conformity to an order issued
by the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) last October which
specified a particular brand of fire extinguishers to be
purchased by transporters.
</P>
<P>
Howerer, the NARTO president believed FRSC's order illegal,
saying it should first tackle the issue of vehicle overloading
instead.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the brand of extinguisher ordered by the FRSC
sells for 10,000 Naira (about 125 U.S. Dollars) while an
equivalent costs only 2,500 Naira (about 31 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
NARTO officials also called on the government to reduce the
number of law enforcement agencies on highways and various levies
on transporters, arguing that the transporters have already found
it hard to survive or maintain their vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Palestinian-Israeli Differences Narrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian official said here
today that the gap between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on
implementing the Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank is
narrower than ever before but more time is needed to reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama el-Baz made
this assessment after an Egyptian-sponsored tripartite meeting in
the Egyptian capital involving Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross and Palestinian chief
negotiator Saeb Erakat.
</P>
<P>
He stood short of elaberating what progress has been made and
what problems remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that an agreement on the long-overdue Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron will be signed soon,
stressing what matters is "stands" instead of the "negotiating"
remarks made by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Erakat urged Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu to "stop straying away" from commitment to the signed
peace accords to put the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of meetings with Palestinian officials,
including Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Moussa said he
believes that more time is required to reach a Hebron deal and
discussions in this regard will continue.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who also held talks with Mubarak to coordinate stances,
said the Egyptian and American sides are cooperating to bring
closer the conflicting Palestinian and Israeli views and parties
concerned all agreed to give a push to the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to go into details of the difficulties in
the Palestinian-Israeli talks, but said that negotiations tackled
"other issues besides Hebron."
</P>
<P>
With the focus of Mideast peace shifted here today, the
U.S. envoy is expected to build up a common ground for the
Palestinians and Israelis to continue talks on implementing
further Israeli withdrawals from the rest of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has made intense mediation between the Palestinians
and Israelis, is scheduled to meet Arafat tonight in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
A previously-set Friday meeting between them was canceled after
Thursday night's bomb explosions in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israel has vowed to apply "extreme severity" if it is confirmed
that guerrillas from the Palestinian self-rule areas planted the
two bombs that wounded 13 people.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns has condemned
the blasts and said Washington "will stand by Israel."
</P>
<P>
Arafat has expressed the fear that Israel will cite violence as
a reason for further delaying the Israel troop redeployment from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross' intense shuttle mediation nearly sewed up the Hebron
part of the deal before Israel proposed Tuesday the three
pullbacks should be completed in September 1999, two years behind
the schedule agreed upon by the Palestinians and Israel's previous
Labor government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side rejected the proposal, demanding for the
strict implementation by Israel of the Oslo II Accords, which
envision three pullbacks to be finished in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian standoff has prompted Ross to dish out
a compromise date of September 1998. The current diplomatic
shuttles seem to focus on the latest U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the "Sawt al-Arab" radio this morning,
Erakat said the Palestinians would not accept changes in the
peace accords and neither would they walk out of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to play a "fair" mediating role, especially
as President Bill Clinton himself co-signed the Oslo
II peace agreements in Washington in September 1995.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai's Tomorrow Promised, with Blueprint Drawn (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
ZHUHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai in Guangdong Province
will soon become the most prosperous and promising economic zone
in south China, a senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guangda, secretary of the Zhuhai City Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, outlined a blueprint for the Zhuhai
Special Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to questions of economic reporters from the
Organization of Asian New Agencies.
</P>
<P>
The special economic zone was launched 16 years ago when China
started a long march of reform and opening-up, and has maintained
rapid, sustained and sound economic growth over the past years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Major economic indexes have increased at an annual rate of
above 35 percent over the past few years, with gross domestic
product (GDP) rising to above 20 billion yuan in 1996, more than
40 times that in 1979, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Local residents are becoming comfortably well off, having
benefited from the city's quick economic growth in recent years,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Zhuhai has become a modern seaside city with strong economic
power and great potential," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The city is among the top 50 Chinese cities in terms of overall
economic strength.
</P>
<P>
It is seeking new ways to continue its strong economic growth
into the future, and it has turned to high-tech industries as a
way of boosting its economy to a new level.

<P>
The city's economy started a take-off through the development
of export processing industries in the early days of reform.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, priority has been given to
the development of the high-tech industry, with a high technological
content, and also high added value, in utilizing foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Other measures were also taken during the 1990s by the city
government to boost high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the city set up a special fund to encourage
technological innovations by giving rewards to scientific research
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Scientists making breakthroughs were given large bonuses, free
houses or cars.
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts the city's ballooning industrial
enterprises expanded into electronics, software, genetic
engineering, petro-chemicals, shipbuilding, machinery-building,
and textiles.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the high-tech industry has exceeded 15
percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The city also attached great importance to developing its
infrastructure, which will help determine its economic growth in
future, such as the construction of a harbor, airport, power
plants, highways, and water supply projects.

<P>
NANJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A man who was almost speared to
death by a steel pole falling from a 27-storey building is well on
the way for recovery from the freak accident.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu province,
said that Wang Yaobing, the victim, was doing quite well in
recovery, except that he still felt numbness in a leg and his
appetite was not good.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a 29 years old construction worker, was pierced by the
three-meter-long steel pole at a construction site in Nanjing last
October. The pole entered from the left side of his back and came
out at his right knee.
</P>
<P>
Wang's colleagues had to cut parts of the pole from his body
before sending him to Gulou Hospital in Nanjing City where it was
found that his blood pressure had dropped to zero.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons found Wang's lung, pericardium, stomach, duodenum and
other organs were damaged, but by sheer luck his heart was
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The surgeons carefully removed the pole, and operated on the
damaged organs. He was given a transfusion of 6,000 cc of blood.
</P>
<P>
In the first two weeks, Wang pulled through the most
potentially fatal postoperative symptom - blood infection, said
the doctors.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Flies to Gaza to Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan flew to
Gaza this afternoon to meet with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat on the latest developments of the Middle East peace
process, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders will be focused on the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and ways of overcoming obstacles
in the way of signing the long-awaited but repeatedly-delayed
agreement on Hebron, the last West Bank town still under Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Gaza by the king, who was accompanied Jordanian
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti and other senior officials,
came after the agreement on Israeli troops redeployment in Hebron
failed to come through over a number of differences between the
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It was unknown on Saturday that King Hussein himself would
visit Gaza for the talks, as a senior PLO official said that
Kabariti would meet Arafat in Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
"Kabariti will visit Gaza to hold talks with Arafat over the
latest developments in the PLO-Israel talks," said Nabil Abu
Redinah, advisor to the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the Jordanian-Palestinian-Egyptian
consultation on the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, Arafat held a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the negotiations between the Israeli and
Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday evening, Arafat also met with U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross in Gaza. Ross had been intensely mediating
between the Palestinians and Israelis in a bid to close the Hebron
deal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's MENA news agency, citing U.S. officials, said Ross had
nearly sewn up the Hebron deal but Palestinians turned down a U.S
compromise date of 1998 for completing the last three Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Hebron thus stalled over Israel's proposal on
putting off the completion of the redeployment until 1999
spring. Arafat insists on strict abidance by the Oslo II accord
that stipulates next September as the final deadline.

<HEADLINE> Economists: 1996, Worst Year for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- 1996 was the worst year for
the Palestinian economy, the latest weekly of the Palestinian
Jerusalem Times quoted an economist from the Al-Najah University
in Nablus as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nasr Abdul-Karim, Dean of the Economics Department of the
university, said at a recent economic forum held in the West Bank
city of Nablus that the Palestinian gross national product (GNP)
had dropped by 25 percent instead of growing by 6-8 percent as
expected.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the autonomous areas had fallen to a record low
instead of achieving the expected growth of 500 million
U.S. dollars, and unemployment rates had climbed to 45-50
percent, said the economist.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Palestinian economists and business people
participating in the forum expressed their regrets about the past
year and pessimism for the coming years if the political
situation continues to drag along as it currently does, according
to the economist.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Karim said that there were several causes for the poor
economic performance in 1996. The first and foremost, he said,
was the numerous Israeli restrictions on Palestinian trade,
topped off by the closure enforced since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
A second major cause for the sluggish economy was the failure
by donor countries to fulfill their pledges, he said, adding that
most of the money that had been paid by the donors was spent on
salaries and government expenses rather than on investments.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was partly to be
blamed for the economic downfall. Its bureaucracy and lack of
effective management had undoubtedly contributed, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that a strong economy can only be achieved
through full sovereignty over the autonomous land.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Nablus Chamber of Commerce Mu'az Nabilsi said
the sluggish economy and the lack of its development were caused
by nothing but the Israeli measures against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's failure to honor and implement the
peace agreements had scared away local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Na'el Sa'ada, general manager of the Ramallah-based Royal
Company, said that the modest economic developments of 1996 were
concentrated in the service and construction sectors while no
development occurred in any of the production sectors.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Industrial Village Makes Big Strides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Daqiuzhuang, an industrial
village-turned-town outside north China's port city of Tianjin,
recorded 10.5 billion yuan in the total value of its products and
services in 1996, more than doubling the 1993 level.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the figure has exceeded 10 billion
yuan for the go-ahead town.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 the village was turned into a town, and put under
direct control of Jinghai County, Tianjin Municipality, after the
arrest of several village leaders for corruption and other
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
The economic development has continued to boom in Daqiuzhuang
ever since, while its social stability has been maintained,
according to Deputy County Magistrate Wang Qingbin, who is also
head of the town.
</P>
<P>
Last year it generated 750 million yuan in pretax profits, up
59.6 percent over 1993, with the per-capita income amounting to
6,500 yuan and individuals' savings deposits reaching 200 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
All local families have been moved into new-style multi-story
apartments, installed with telephones and gas, heating,
running-water and hot-water, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the fast development of Daqiuzhuang to
greater reform efforts which have focused on reinvigorating local
industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The village's previous four large groups have been broken into
23 smaller companies, and 316 million yuan has been invested to
expand their capacities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 20 million yuan has been invested in the farming
sector to make both industrial and agricultural undertakings
successful.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprian Defense Minister Kostas
Eliades will arrive in Athens later today to discuss the latest
tension arising from Turkey's threat of military attack, the
Athens News Agency (ANA) said.
</P>
<P>
Eliades will hold talks with his Greek counterpart Akis
Tsohatzopoulos on "the entire spectrum of issues pertaining to
Cyprus' defense", the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Leading the chief of the Cyprus National Guard (Cyprian army)
and members of the parliamentary defence committee, he will also
meet Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, the ANA said.
</P>
<P>
The visit, an unexpected one, takes place following repeated
threat by Turkey to strike the Greek Cypriot-controlled area if
the Cyprus government goes ahead with deploying the S-300 anti-
aircraft missile system.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was de facto divided into two in 1974, when Turkey
seized one third of the Mediterranean island and later declared
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was not recognized
by the international community. The southern part of the island is
under Greek Cypriot rule.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Britain Discuss Investment, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Promotion of trade and
investment between the two countries was the focus of the talks
between the visiting British Prime Minister John Major and his
Pakistani counterpart, Malik Miraj Khalid.
</P>
<P>
"We spent a lot of time discussing trade and investment
opportunities," Major, who is on a three-day official visit to
Pakistan, told waiting reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Major said he has brought with him senior businessmen of his
country to explore ways to give a fillip to bilateral trade,
adding that there has been a significant increase in two-way trade
in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
A 20-member delegation including top British business
executives arrived here today with Major to explore business
opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Major hoped that as a result of his visit more British
investment would pour into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the second largest investor in Pakistan after the
United States.
</P>
<P>
During his one-to-one informal meeting with Khalid, Major said,
they also discussed certain measures for promotion of trade.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister said the Afghan issue also figured
in their talks as both countries were keen to combat narcotics in
this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and
negotiations among all warring factions including the Taliban
militia to restore peace there.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Pakistan, Major visited India and Bangladesh
during his three-nation tour to promote trade and investment
between the United Kingdom and the subcontinental region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Pakistan, Major is scheduled to hold talks
with President Farooq Leghari and to call on former Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, who is widely expected to win the forthcoming
general elections on February 3.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Resettlement Program Enters Key Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The relocation of people
affected by the gigantic Three Gorges Dam Project in China has
entered its prime stage.
</P>
<P>
After three years of strenuous efforts, the relocation work is
proceeding smoothly, says a top official at the project site.
</P>
<P>
Qi Lin, director of the Relocation and Development Bureau of
the State Council's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee,
outlined the progress in an exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 21,000 local residents in the dam area
had been moved to other places, according to Qi.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29,300 local residents are set to be resettled
before November this year, when the course-blocking project is
scheduled to take place, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project was officially launched in December
1994, and is scheduled to last for 17 years, with the relocation
of over one million people.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement, the largest-ever in the human history, is
scheduled to cost 40 billion yuan at current prices, and to be
completed by 2009.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Reservoir is designed to cover 1,084 square
kilometers, and will affect 21 cities and counties in Hubei and
Sichuan provinces. It will wholly or partially submerge two
prefectural cities, 11 county-seats, 114 towns and 1,599 factories.
</P>
<P>
During the 1993-1996 period, the central government allocated
nearly 5.8 billion yuan for the relocation program.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last August, 15,333 hectares of land had been
cultivated, 118 urban infrastructural projects launched, and
750,000 square meters of houses built as part of the relocation
program.
</P>
<P>
Of the factories to be moved, 64 have been rebuilt, while
another 256 are under construction.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth resettlement, the central government has
formulated a series of regulations, policies and principles,
including a Regulation on the Relocation Resulting from the
Construction of the Three Gorges Project and an outline for the
economic development in the dam area.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995 the government has allocated 500 million yuan in
loans annually to help relocated factories upgrade their
technology and equipment. A series of preferential policies
regarding taxation and import duties have also been adopted to
help local people.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the State Council has allowed the project-affected
cities and counties to enjoy the same preferential policies
granted to coastal open cities in the eastern and southern parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Central government departments and developed provinces and
cities have also been asked to assist the dam-affected area, in
accordance with a circular issued by the State Council in March
1992.
</P>
<P>
So far, 820 projects with financial and technological support
from these departments and areas have been launched with
investments of nearly 1.6 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zambia Promotes Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is making efforts to
promote agricultural production to ensure safety of food supply
and reduce poverty in this African country.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia's vast areas of 60 million hectares of arable land
with fertile soil and rich water resources, it is suitable for
growing maize, millet, sorghum, groundnut, wheat, cotton, potato
and cassava, melon and fruits.
</P>
<P>
Zambia reaped a good harvest in 1996, with the output of maize
alone estimated at 1.26 million tons. Besides sufficient supply
for the domestic market and security reserves, there are 40,000
tons of maize left for export to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia's agriculture has always been depending on the
climate. Once there are droughts, there are famines.
</P>
<P>
In a serious drought which hit southern Africa in 1992, Zambia
with a population of over eight million suffered a grave shortage
of 600,000 tons of foodstuff.
</P>
<P>
In order to shake off such passivity, the Zambian government
has formulated some policies and measures in its economic
liberalization to promote agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
As there is at present only 15 percent of the arable land
under cultivation, favorable terms are provided to attract
investors to explore the country's rich potentials of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They include exemption from customs duties on imported
agricultural equipment, exemption from tax on income received by
way of a dividend declared from farming for the first five years
of operation, and a farmwork's allowance of 100 percent in
respect of expenditure on farmland in an investor's ownership or
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, investments of 290 million U.S. Dollars in the
agriculture sector have been approved in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Publication of scientific and technical research in improving
production is stressed in Zambia, which was particularly noticed
during the 1996 Lusaka Agricultural and Trade Show.
</P>
<P>
At the show, about one third of the exhibits of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries were samples and charters on
results of the agricultural research. They showed the visitors
that production can make remarkable progress if run with advanced
techniques after scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Diversification of products is another incentive to boost
agricultural production. At present, farmers and peasants are
encouraged to grow castor, horticultural and floricultural crops
and other cash crops in addition to maize, while in areas of
bushes and jungles, bee keeping is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The State Export Board helps to find overseas markets for such
products. Zambian cut flowers won a copper medal in an
international horticulture show in the Netherlands in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's agriculture is going to make progress, but there are
still difficulties on its way forward, such as the lack of enough
investment, the need of more incentives and introduction and
improvement of policies and measures alongside its economic
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The prospect is rosy but there is still a hard and long way
for Zambians to go and have sustainable development in
agriculture, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> S Korea to Extend $ 405 M to developing Countries in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to extend
405 million U.S. dollars in aid funds to help 12 developing
countries and to finance 22 projects this year, the Ministry of
Finance and Economy said here today.
</P>
<P>
The money will come from the Economic Development Cooperation
Fund (EDCF), which was established in 1987 in order to help
developing countries implement public infrastructure projects, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the money or 242.2 million U.S. dollars will go
to five Asian countries including China, Vietnam, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that South Korea will continue to expand its
external aid program and raise the ratio of official development
assistance to 0.1 percent of the gross national product (GNP) by
2000 from the 0.03 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EDCF is the South Korean currency-based loan program
providing funds with maturity of 10-25 years, a grace period of
three to seven years and interest rates of 2.5-5 percent. The
Export-Import Bank of Korea is responsible for the project
appraisal, loan agreement execution and administrative work
related to extending loans.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge Strides across Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A new bridge spanning the
Yangtze River, the longest river in China, was opened to traffic
today at Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan Province, on the
upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The 1,350-meter-long Chongqing-Lijiatuo Yangtze River Bridge is
the second of its kind in the urban area of Chongqing, an economic
center in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the bridge started in 1991, involving a total
investment of 730 million yuan, part of which was financed by the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The project also included construction of two approaches on
each side of the river, with a total length of nine kilometres.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng wrote an inscription for the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the bridge will help ease heavy traffic
conditions in Chongqing, and promote economic development in the
neighbouring region of the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

<HEADLINE> Model Oil Expert's Contributions Push Forward Production (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a thorough research of Daqing's oil reservoirs, Wang
suggested that different methods be used in tapping different oil
layers.
</P>
<P>
His suggestion enabled a single oil well to produce more than
100 tons of high-quality oil daily, compared with some 30 tons
previously.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Daqing's annual oil output reached 50.3 million tons
because of the wide adoption of Wang's research results, which
also helped him win the first National Science and Technology
Congress Award in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Wang started another research of surface oil layer in 1984,
which widely exist in oil wells and other oil reservoirs, but is
very difficult to explore, and is commonly wasted.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure a high yield of 50 million tons annually in
the 1986-1995 period, Wang and his colleagues conducted a series
of tough research work and experiments.
</P>
<P>
Seven years later the researchers found a new method which
proved successful after they had studied some 1,500 oil wells.
</P>
<P>
"We found more than 700 million tons of oil in the surface
layer. It will greatly help us to fulfill the goal," Wang says as
he sits at his desk, on which two rock cores of the extensive
layer are placed.
</P>
<P>
China demands an increasing amount of oil to fuel its
fast-speed economic growth. As a leading oil producer, Daqing
plans to keep high and stable yields in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Appointed as the head of the research institute last August,
Wang is leading thousands of scientific workers in Daqing to
spearhead the new mission to keep this oil giant productive.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he has been named "Iron Man" of the modern
time by the Daqing Petroleum Administrative Bureau, and all Daqing
workers have been urged to follow his example.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President Arrives in Tehran today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam will arrive in Tehran today to participate in
Syrian-Iranian high joint committee meetings, according to
Syrian official sources.
</P>
<P>
The delegation led by Khaddam includes Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara and a number of specialists.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam will hold talks with Iranian officials on the current
developments in the Middle East and the Gulf region as well as
issues of mutual concern, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Damascus hold that the forthcoming
meetings of the Syrian-Iranian high joint committee will be
of great importance in view of the recent developments both in
the Gulf region and on the Middle East peace process and the
current Iranian mediation between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seeking to act as a mediator between Syria and Turkey
with the aim of improving the relations between the two countries
so that the already suspended tripartite meetings of Syria, Iran
and Turkey can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The three countries used to hold a regular foreign ministerial
meeting every six months on their relationship. But it was
suspended nearly a year ago as the Syrian-Turkish ties went soured
due to disputes over the share of the Euphrates River water and
the alleged Syrian support for the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam's upcoming visit to Iran comes after foreign ministers
of the Damascus Declaration Signatories issued a statement
recently, in which they criticized Iran's position on its dispute
with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
Iran then criticized Damascus for having signed such a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration Signatories include Egypt,
Syria and six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.
</P>
<P>
Iran supports Syria's position on the Middle East peace
process while Syria is playing a major role in improving
Arab-Iranian relations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Aid Madagascar's Medical Care Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The doctors are all Chinese,
and their treatment ranges from acupuncture to herbs and other
medicines. The only difference at the health centers is the
patients - they are all African.
</P>
<P>
And the treatment offered by the Chinese health team is so
trusted that the patients on the island country of Madagascar
range from the country's President to newly-born babies.
</P>
<P>
The doctors have worked in Madagascar for 22 years, treating
more than ten million patients in Madagascar itself, and
neighboring countries. Many of their patients were critically ill.
</P>
<P>
Their outstanding medical skills and professional ethics have
earned them the praise and gratitude of local people.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are from northwest China's Gansu Province, with the
aim to fulfill China's decade-long project of sending medical
teams to African, Asian and Latin American countries as a form of
friendly aid.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1963, Gansu has sent eleven groups and 320 medical
experts to Madagascar," health official Wang Dianying said in
Lanzhou, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite language problems and inadequate access to medical
facilities, the doctors have set up four medical centers on the
island. There they improved the medical facilities and they even
made some of their own medicines for the patients.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese ways to cure diseases, such as acupuncture,
have been introduced to the country. The Chinese doctors also
trained local medics to master acupuncture skills.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors' work has benefited not only ordinary
residents, but many officials in Madagascar, and some foreign
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Madagascar government has awarded 37 Chinese doctors with
medals to express official gratitude for their contributions to
local health care work, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to send medical teams there in the coming
years," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
China has sent 13,000 medics to more than 60 countries and
regions in Asia, Africa and Latin America since the first
aid-the-foreign team set off for Algeria in 1963, said Lin
Shuquan, an official at the Ministry of Health, who is in charge
of the work.
</P>
<P>
They have treated about 200 million patients in those countries
and regions. There are currently about 40 such teams and some
1,000 medics working overseas, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President Arrives in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdel
Halim Khaddam arrived here this afternoon on a two-day official
visit to Tehran amid a wave of criticism by Iranian media for
Damascus' recent anti-Iranian stances.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the airport, Khaddam said that he made
his trip to Tehran within the framework of the high joint
committee of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides will hold talks on bilateral
issues, Middle East issues and the international issues of
common interest.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president also carried a special message from
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad to his Iranian counterpart Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member Syrian delegation was greeted by Iranian First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi and other officials at the airport.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question on the trilateral meeting of Iran,
Iraq and Syria, Khaddam said "in principle we can resume the
trilateral talks in the framework of the trilateral agreement."
</P>
<P>
The visiting Syrian official stressed "we believe in
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
However, Khaddam did not comment on the recent position by
his government in the Damascus Declaration on three disputed
islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Iran's strategic ally in the Middle East, joined Egypt
and six Gulf Arab countries in criticizing Iran recently for its
deployment of ground-to-ground missiles on three Gulf
islands under Iranian control but also claimed by the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The signatories to the Damascus Declaration issued a statement
recently, affirming the UAE's right to the sovereignty of Abu
Mussa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb and urged Iran to end its
"occupation" of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Damascus's endorsement of the statement provoked an outcry in
the Iranian press, which said Syria "had stabbed Iran in the
back."
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Abrar even publicly demanded an explanation
from the Syrian government on why Damascus backed the anti-Iran
Cairo statement issued last month.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said that the Cairo statement would be on
the top of the agenda for the bilateral talks between Iranian
and Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration was signed in 1991 after the Gulf
War to facilitate economic and security cooperation between Arab
members of the U.S.-led coalition which drove Iraqi troops out of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
It groups Egypt, Syria and the six members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has tried
to play down talk of a rift between the two countries, saying
Damascus's endorsement of the Arab statement would not create
friction.
</P>
<P>
"Iran and Syria have a long-standing and all-embracing
relationship and we still believe that our cooperation is very
important for the Arab and Islamic world as well as the
resistance against Israeli aggressions," he said.

<P>
WUHAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The world's only artificially-fed
Yangtze dolphin celebrated his 17th birthday today - with a
special offering of his favorite fish.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi spent his 17th birth anniversary today at the Wuhan
Biology Research Institute attached to the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He became the world's first and the only artificial-fed Yangtze
River dolphin in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Qiqi was caught by fishermen near the mouth of Dongting Lake on
the Yangtze River on January 12, 1980, and was sent to the Wuhan
Institute of Biology in this capital of central China's Hubei
Province. The date was fixed as his birthday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ding, Director of the Yangtze River dolphin Section at the
institute, said when Qiqi was sent there, he was 1.47 meters long
and weighed 36.5 kilograms, and he was estimated to be about two

By 1986 he had grown to over two meters in length, and weighed
125 kilograms. From then his length and weight have remained the
same.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Qiqi, living a single life, has three meals a
day of over 10 kilograms of fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
He has been receiving daily training and helping scientific
experiments of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
The researchers make regular health check-ups on him every
month. If abnormal indicators appear, researchers add vitamins,
trace elements, antibiotics or nutritional medicines in fresh fish.
</P>
<P>
Between April to July last year, Qiqi contracted a serious
life-threatening liver trauma, hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia.
</P>
<P>
The institute quickly invited experts from the United States,
Hong Kong and Taiwan to help save Qiqi.
</P>
<P>
Guided by experts from the No.2 Hospital attached to Hubei
Medical Sciences University, researchers applied a drip-method
stomach lavage to treat his diseases, and Qiqi recovered after 100
days of treatment.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Cargoes Via Nacala Corridor Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The volume of Malawi's cargoes
going through Nacala railway and port systems reduced sharply for
various reasons last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This has forced traditional customers of Malawi to turn to
Beira Corridor for the exports of their cargoes, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The news was disclosed on Friday by Director of Nacala Port
Agostinho Langa, who noted that flood disaster, and lack of
wagons were among the reasons for the sharp decline of Malawi
cargoes going through Nacala railway and port systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nacala Port only managed to deal with 9,000
containers last year, lower than the planned 12,400 ones, while
its handling capacity of cargoes only reached 289,000 tons,
without realizing its goal of 357,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Model Oil Expert's Contributions Push Forward Production (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Wang Qimin looks at odds with
the name "Iron Man" - he is actually thin and a little hunchbacked.
</P>
<P>
But people who know him all agree, without even slight dissent,
that he is worthy of the name.
</P>
<P>
It has nothing to do with his strength or physical appearance
- but a tenacious drive to contribute to scientific research for
oil exploration in China.
</P>
<P>
Iron Man Wang, in his fifties, is head of the Daqing Research
Institute of Oil Exploration and Development. He has taken a lead
for 30 years in conducting research to ensure high and stable
yields of crude oil in the Daqing Oil Field, China's flagship of
oil production sector.
</P>
<P>
The original "Iron Man" was Wang Jinxi, Daqing's model oil
driller, who was famous across the country in the 1960s and
70s. Iron Man Wang devoted himself to Daqing's oil production, and
his hard-working spirit encouraged countless Chinese oil workers
and ordinary people during those years.
</P>
<P>
Since then Daqing became the leading oil producer in China, and
the country has ended a the history of being oil-starved.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of "Iron Man" impelled Wang Qimin to get a job in
Daqing in 1961, after graduating from Beijing Petroleum Institute.
</P>
<P>
Major research results achieved by him and his colleagues have
enabled the oil field to keep a production capacity of 50 million
tons of crude oil yearly in the past three decades, which also
made Daqing one of the top oil producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
"What I have done is just part of joint efforts of Daqing's
experts and researchers," Wang said with modesty. But nobody will
deny that his contributions have played an indispensable role
since the oil field was developed in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In 1964, the oil drilling work was challenged by a high
moisture content in oil when the field adopted water injection as
a way of recovering oil.

<HEADLINE> Lanzhou Gives Preferential Policy to Housing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Spring Festival
will have an extra meaning for 200 families in northwest China's
Lanzhou city. They will be moving into new houses before the
Chinese lunar new year, the Spring Festival, which falls on
February 7.
</P>
<P>
It is the result of a project to provide relatively comfortable
living conditions for low- and meddle-income families, launched by
the capital city of Gansu Province,
</P>
<P>
The municipal government was busy constructing residential
quarters for such families during 1996. About 218,000 square
meters of floor space of residential quarters had been completed
by the beginning of 1997, with sales of the houses now underway.
</P>
<P>
The Lanzhou city government has issued a regulation on the
selling of apartments, stating that the apartments will be
preferentially sold to low and medium income families, and
families without a settled residence or to families living in
dilapidated conditions, as well as retired teachers and workers.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou will construct more residential quarters in 1997, with
120 million yuan (14.5 million US dollars) in loans from the
central government and 80 million yuan (9.6 million US dollars) of
funds raised by other means.

<P>
CHENGDU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province now has 1,235 Taiwan-backed businesses, or one-fifth of
the province's overseas-backed firms, according to the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official said that to date, Sichuan has
introduced 900 million U.S. dollars in investment from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-funded companies have provided employment for 60,000
people and have a combined annual output value of five billion
yuan. In 1996 alone, the province added 67 of these companies.
</P>
<P>
The increased investment from Taiwan was helped by government
departments that have paid a great deal of attention to providing
a favorable environment for Taiwanese investors and to making them
feel like home.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government and people's congress adopted
"Regulations on Protecting Investment of Taiwan Compatriots" on
August 1, 1995 to protect the rights of Taiwanese investors and to
ensure that they enjoy the same treatment as others.
</P>
<P>
The province has also tried hard to keep Taiwan-backed firms
from being charged extra fees, and has set up various service
centers to help solve problems for them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bankers to Gather in Beijing to Discuss Key Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese banking
officials and experts flooded into Beijing today on the eve of the
national financial conference, due to open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bankers are expected to stay in the capital for a
week, not only to participate in the national meeting sponsored by
the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to hear about new year's
policies set by the central bank, but also to attend annual
gatherings of their own banks.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China (BOC),
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China
Construction Bank (CCB), the four largest state-owned commercial
banks in the country, will also meet during the week to discuss
the central bank's strategies, and to make their own blueprints
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The week will give Chinese bankers the opportunity to ponder
and talk on some major issues, especially the banks' relations
with state-owned companies, the majority of which are undergoing
restructuring or struggling for survival from the ongoing
reshaping of the country's economic system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, local banks have tried hard to help
state firms, but with the fear that the banks themselves may be
trapped in accumulated bad-loans.
</P>
<P>
State banks, except those policy banks, have been granted
bigger self-decision powers by the central government to enable
them to become commercialized in line with the international
standards.
</P>
<P>
But the bank-enterprise ties are also changing, which has made
many state firms uncomfortable as state banks are no longer an
endless source of funds.
</P>
<P>
The current experiment of the so-called sponsoring-bank system
has brought new hope for state companies, but has also created new
problems and trouble for state banks as they head for
commercialization, as the international criteria has required,
according to some local observers.
</P>
<P>
At a newly-held national conference on reemployment of laid-off
workers from state firms, People's Bank of China President Dai
Xianglong said the law will protect the interests of both the
banks and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He warned that banks could refuse to accept bankruptcies that
have not been carried out in conformity with legal standards.
</P>
<P>
Now that the central government has decided to extend the
ongoing bankruptcy experiments to as many as 110 cities, state
banks will face even bigger challenges, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides the issue of enterprise restructuring, the bankers are
expected to focus on topics like further deepening their own
structural reforms to improve services and efficiency, and to
enhance their viability in both domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the banks, all the four banks reached
their targets set for 1996. Meanwhile, the banks spared no efforts
to follow the central government's macro-economic control plan of
keeping a moderately tight supply of currency.
</P>
<P>
As China is gradually opening up its banking industry to
foreign banks, especially after four foreign banks were allowed to
handle RMB yuan business in Pudong New Area, local banks have met
opportunities and challenges, subjects that will be widely
discussed at this week's meetings.
</P>
<P>
The news about the conferences have drawn great attention from
home and abroad, and even some foreign banks are taking the chance
to peacock themselves. A planned briefing by the Boston Bank of
the United States at a local hotel in Beijing on Thursday is one
of the events.

<HEADLINE> S. African Farm Minister to Visit Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister of
Agriculture D. Hanekom will arrive here "in a few days" to
discuss with the Mozambican government how to speed up the
implementation of the Mozagrius Program.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mozambican representative of the program
Antinio Cabral on Saturday, the "Domingo" paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Mozambique and South Africa signed a
principle agreement on the Mozagrius Program last May, under
which about 300 South African farmers will invest in Niassa
Province in northern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
But the program has been delayed for implementation, over
which the Mozambican government is fairly worried, Cabral said,
adding, "We hope that the visit by the minister will break the
stalemate."
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government hopes the Mozagrius Development
Company will be formed in late January and that an accord on the
promotion and bilateral protection of investments signed.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Chamber of South African Farmers for having not
replied to Maputo's draft charter for the formation of the
Mozagrius Development Company.
</P>
<P>
Cabral said the Mozambican government had proposed that the
company, as the administrative body for the program, be
established before last December.

ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The controversial Eighth
Amendment to the Pakistani Constitution was declared a valid piece
of legislation by a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court of
Pakistan here today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing a short judgment on identical constitutional
petitions on the amendment, Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice

The Eighth Amendment was passed in 1985 through a non-party
parliament when General Zia-ul Haq was in power.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, the president is empowered to dismiss the
National Assembly if the federal government cannot function.

BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing scored a 9.1 percent
economic growth rate in the past year, with its GDP reaching 160.7
billion yuan (about 19.36 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has set a nine percent economic growth

WELLINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Sun Shuwei,
Olympic champion in the men's 10-meter platform in Barcelona
Games, captured the title in his speciality event in the FINA
Diving Grand Prix here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sun scored 97.92 points in his final dive, taking the title
with a total of 709.20 points.
</P>
<P>
"It can rarely be seen in diving to get such high points as

<P>
Mbeki's planned trip to meet the Angolan government would be a
follow-up to the meeting this week between Mandela and Jonas
Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) in Umtata in Eastern Cape province.
</P>
<P>
The South African government declared a success when Savimbi
committed himself to participating in the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
But despite that assurance, diplomats and officials here on
all sides admitted this week that Savimbi's participation in the
government of national unity, the key to sustainable peace in
Angola, was still far from certain.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats of countries close to the protracted negotiations
said the January 23 deadline was slipping and invitations had not
been sent for the formal inauguration of the new government on
January 25 which Mandela plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers, the troika of the U.S, Portugal
and Russia which have been supervising the Angolan negotiations,
now believes a postponement of the new government is not only
inevitable but necessary to allow time for planning.
</P>
<P>
But the Angolan government and UNITA want to push ahead to
meet the deadline and the South African government would like to
help them to do it, officials based in Pretoria said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's intervention in the crisis ran into controversy this
week when the Angolan government publicly announced that South
Africa's mediation is not wanted as the United Nations already
has a mediator in that country.
</P>
<P>
But government officials here were quick to point out that
South Africa has never used the word "mediate" to describe its
role but has only offered to "interact" and to "facilitate".
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the Mandela/Savimbi meeting had been
approved by the Angolan government last month when Mbeki visited
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
For that reason they said Mbeki's second visit would probably
go ahead despite the Angolan government's statement and should
not be seen as a defiant move by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki would probably take South African government backing for
a special role for Savimbi in the government of national unity,
the officials said
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusaka Peace Protocol which ended the fighting in
1994, Savimbi is entitled to a "special status" in the new
government, but the Angolan government was reported to want to
relegate him to the largely-ceremonial role of a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi wants to exercise real powers, wider than those
exercised by former deputy president F.W. de Klerk in the
government of national unity of South Africa, but has also
demanded that his position as leader of the opposition be
institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
After the Umtata talks, the officials believed, no one was
ready to divulge exactly what Savimbi wanted, beyond saying that
he wanted wider powers as vice-president than might be
inconsistent with his role as opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lusaka Protocol, the government of national
unity should be formed in Luanda on January 23 following 20 years
of war which claimed 500,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Massive Troops to Be Deployed on Pak Election Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
decided to deploy 250,000 troops on the election day of February 3
to maintain the law and order situation, Defense Minister Shahid
Hamid said today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here, Hamid said 150,000 troops would be
purely on election duties while 100,000 others are to be deployed
to meet any law and order situation on the election day.
</P>
<P>
"The government has requisitioned the services of the Pakistan
Army to assist the Election Commission and the civil
administration to smoothly carry out the general election," Hamid
said.
</P>
<P>
Total troops deployment in the last election held in 1993 was
108,000.
</P>
<P>
Hamid revealed that unlike in the past, the troops will not
claim security expenditure which could cost the government about
100 million rupees (2.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the troops have already been stationed at four ballot
printing presses in Pakistan's major cities of Lahore, Karachi and
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
They will also be responsible for carrying the election bags to
and from the polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Two to three soldiers will be stationed at each of the 43,000
polling stations all over the country and the number could be
raised at "sensitive" polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Hamid said, three or four vigilance teams would
patrol every constituency with an army officer being in charge and
more officers would be deployed in sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
He said civil armed forces have also been mobilized and placed
under the command of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"Such heavy deployment of armed forces only goes on to prove
that the government is determined to have a fair and transparent
election on February 3."
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting was held between the chief election
commissioner and army authorities last Tuesday at which matters
pertaining to the use of troops to assist the Election Commission
and civil administration came under discussion.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Negotiations on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said here today that the best way out of the Afghan crisis
is to bring all the warlords to the negotiating table under the
U.N. umbrella.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Islamabad-based foreign correspondents at
the Presidential House, Leghari said the role played by countries
like Pakistan and Iran in the Afghan affairs is to "facilitate the
U.N. peace process."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan believes that the Afghan problem will be finally
solved by the Afghan people themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan remains totally neutral in the Afghan problem," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, there is so much misunderstanding
concerning Pakistan's policy toward Afghanistan and there are
rumors that Pakistan has favorites in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we keep in touch with all Afghan groups and have good
relations with those groups," he added.
</P>
<P>
The history of Afghanistan has proved that anybody who
interferes in the country's internal affairs gets his fingers
burnt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which still accommodates 1.4 million Afghan refugees,
is eager to help restore peace in the war-torn country and
participate in the reconstruction process, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan will only work for peace through the U.N.
system, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the reopening of the Pakistani
Embassy in Kabul, Leghari said the authority in Kabul is the "de
facto regime" of Afghanistan. However, Pakistan has not reopened
its embassy in Kabul so far.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Embassy in the Afghan capital was burnt down in
September 1995 by thousands of angry demonstrators in protest
against alleged Pakistani support to the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Since the Afghan Taliban militia captured Kabul last September,
not a single country has formally recognized the Taliban regime in
Kabul and all embassies in Kabul have closed down.
</P>
<P>
The local press disclosed recently that Pakistan is preparing
to reopen its embassy in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said on the occasion that every country has the right
to recognize a regime on its own decision.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, recognizing the Taliban regime or not is not the
core issue of the Afghan crisis," he said, adding that the most
important issue at present is to bring durable peace to the
war-ravaged country.

Yeltsin's ailment after he was admitted to the Central Clinical

Mironov said that Yeltsin has shown signs of recovering

<P>
He did not deny that the immune system of the president was
affected to some extent after his heart bypass operation two
months ago.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Presses Benin for Extraditing Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is pressing Benin for
the extradition of a Nigerian couple once jailed there for
attempting to import weapons into Nigeria, hoping that this will
shed light on the series of bomb attacks in the country in the
last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The "Sunday Tribune" reported today that the couple was
arrested in October 1995 in Benin Republic and sentenced to
one-year in jail. They were released in December last year after
serving the terms.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria had demanded their extradition after their arrest, but
was refused by the Beninois government.
</P>
<P>
Now frustrated in their search for the plotters behind the
series of bomb attacks in Lagos that has led to two deaths and
over 50 injuries in total, the Nigerians recently renewed their
extradition call.
</P>
<P>
The Beninois authorities have reportedly re-arrested the
couple under the pressure of Nigeria, but it later handed them
over to officials of an European country's embassy in Cotonou
under the pressure of human rights group, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Abuja were quoted as hinting that
Nigeria has expressed "serious concern" over the development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Television Authority has in a recent
report accused the Nigerian National Democratic Coalition
(NADECO) of trying to import weapons into the country to create
chaos and disorders.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that the Beninois border security force has
intercepted arms and explosives imported by NADECO. However, the
Beninois side has denied the report. The spokesman of the
Nigerian government, Walter Ofonagoro, also denied any knowledge
of the event.
</P>
<P>
Then in a dramatic turn of event on Friday, NADECO's Deputy
Chairman Abraham Adesanya in a press conference alleged that
there was a plot to eliminate NADECO chairman Mischael Ajasin and
himself.
</P>
<P>
He further claimed that the government has ordered the Second
Mechanized Division in Ibadan to eliminate them.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich, Poor Widening in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the rich and
the poor is becoming wider in Hong Kong as the economy has
benefited the richest minority over the past decade, according to
today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper released a survey conducted by the Hong
Kong Social Security Society, which grouped local households into
ten classes according to their incomes. The top 10 percent of
households possesses 42 percent of Hong Kong's gross income, while
the bottom 50 percent shares 19 percent of the wealth.
</P>
<P>
Only the top class has seen a rise of 17.75 percent in their
share of the total wealth in the city since 1986, according to the
survey. The shares of all other groups have fallen -- by almost
five percent for the second-richest group and by about 31 percent
for the poorest.
</P>
<P>
The poverty problem and a widening gap between the rich and the
poor have become too obvious for the government to ignore, said
the paper. The Social Security Society called for immediate action
and urged the future government of the Special Administrative
Region to work out a strategy to tackle the social problem.

<HEADLINE>   General Elections to Be Held on Time: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari stressed here today that the general elections will be
held, as it was previously announced, on February 3 in accordance
with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Islamabad-based foreign correspondents in the
Presidential House this morning, the president said there is a lot
of suspicion in the local press and political arena that the polls
would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The "general elections shall be held in accordance with the
constitution as free, fair and transparent as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason whatsoever why the elections should not be
held on February 3," Leghari stressed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the forthcoming polls will be "the
cleanest elections that Pakistan has ever held."
</P>
<P>
The president noted that there have been some changes in the
electoral law and in the election process, including ensuring the
autonomy of the Election Commission and improvements in the
process of declaring election results.
</P>
<P>
"These changes have been introduced to ensure a better and
freer election where drug money and black money is not used in a
manner it has been used in the past," Leghari added.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial results of elections used to be declared only by the
Pakistan Television (PTV), but this time the election results are
to be announced also by the returning officers at polling stations
in addition to the declaration by the PTV.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces will be required by the Election Commission to
help in the election process, Leghari said, adding that "This has
been a demand from almost all the political parties in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The armed forces will be on patrol duties in every polling
station on February 3, especially those hot spots, he added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the transparency of election results, Pakistan is
also inviting foreign observers to monitor the elections, Leghari
said.

Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir has said Sudan would not seek to shake the
security and independence of Ethiopia and wants to improve
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Bashir's remarks came in an oral message conveyed by Osman el

<HEADLINE> S. Korea raps Japan for Secretly Delivering "Comfort Women" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today criticized
Japan for secretly delivering monetary compensation to "comfort
women" victims, saying that the act is "deeply regrettable."
</P>
<P>
South Korea demands that the Japanese government admit its
involvement in recruiting comfort women and forcing them into sex
slavery in the 1930s and the 1940s, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Japanese government must compensate the
victims instead of turning the matter over to a private
organization.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese private organization, known as the Asian Peace Fund
for Women, recently handed 2 million Japanese yen (17,200
U.S. dollars) to five South Korean women with a letter of apology
from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
By setting up this private fund, Tokyo aims at avoiding any
official compensation for the comfort women victims, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Foreign Ministry issued a statement on
Saturday night, accusing the Japanese organization of "turning its
back" to the wishes of the South Korean government and the
majority of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"Japan, which seeks new status in the international community,
should first and foremost resolve its shameful past in which it
has destroyed the women's dignity," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It urged Japan to find a solution that is acceptable to the
comfort women victims in consideration of the Seoul-Tokyo
relations.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
its World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited by Japan as "comfort women", a euphemism for sex
slaves, for the Japanese imperial army when it invaded East and
Southeast Asia in the 1930s and the 1940s.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges International Community to Help End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has urged the international community to help
end the crisis in the peace negotiations with Israel, according
to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued following the PNA cabinet meeting held in
Gaza late Saturday night, warned that the crisis in the current
talks would lead to unrest in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross
will leave here tonight following his month-long shuttling
between the Israelis and Palestinians in an effort to conclude
an agreement on the Israeli army's redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that Ross has, in fact, completed his work
as a mediator, and the only outstanding issue, on the further
Israeli redeployment in the West Bank after Hebron, is to be
determined by the two sides themselves.
</P>
<P>
Last week, David Bar-Illan, adviser for Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, said that Israel wanted the third
stage of the redeployment to occur by spring 1999, which would
be timed to coincide with the Oslo deadline for completing talks
on the final disposition of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians immediately rejected the idea, insisting that
the Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank should be
completed by September 7, 1997, in accordance with the Oslo
accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mediating team then proposed a compromise date for
the final redeployment at the end of 1998, but the idea was
reportedly also turned down by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ross traveled to the Egyptian capital of Cairo
to meet with Palestinian negotiators and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak. He said later that he did not win agreement on
"non-Hebron issues."
</P>
<P>
Ross's hour-long meeting with Mubarak came after a meeting
between the Egyptian leader and PNA President Yasser Arafat, who
also traveled to Cairo Saturday to discuss the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu reportedly spoke, during the weekend,
with Mubarak and King Hussein of Jordan, who is due to visit the
Gaza Strip today, on the latest development in the negotiations
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials said the visit of Hussein, who will be
accompanied by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, is
part of Egyptian-Jordanian-Palestinian consultations on the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Planned Arms Sale to Syria Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's proposed
sale of tank firing control systems to Syria has caused
"concerns" from Israel and the United States, the "Sunday Times"
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The contract of three billion Rands (about 638 million US
Dollars) has been conditionally approved by South Africa's
National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Kader Asmal, the NCACC chairman and the Water Affairs
minister, declined to comment on NCACC's recommendation that the
sale be authorized, saying the matter was "not something in the
public domain".
</P>
<P>
In fear of angering the U.S., the South African government,
however, made its support to the proposed sale conditional on the
approval of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was not present
when the issue was discussed.
</P>
<P>
The sale plan would return to the cabinet for reconsideration
if Mbeki thought the deal would contravene the U.S.
Counter-Terrorism Act against countries which provide lethal
military equipment to U.S.-styled "state sponsors of terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Ricky Naidoo, Mbeki's spokesman, confirmed that the matter had
been referred to Mbeki after a cabinet meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
"He is still considering it," said Naidoo, adding the issue
would be discussed again by the government later this month when
a final decision would be expected.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the proposed deal signaled a clear break with
the government's original policies that favored Israel over the
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Victor Harel, Israel's acting ambassador to South Africa, said
yesterday he was not aware of the details, but he would take the
matter up with the Department of Foreign Affairs this week.
</P>
<P>
Harel stressed that any sale of military equipment to Syria
was "a source of concern" for Israel and its security, saying the
Middle East peace process, in general, should be helped by all
friends of such process.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted U.S. official sources as saying that the
arms sale deal would "raise concerns".
</P>
<P>
A source in the U.S. State Department was quoted as warning
that there would be serious trouble if the equipment to be
supplied to Syria contained U.S. technology or components.

<HEADLINE> 2 Parliamentary Members to be Reelected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 12 (Xinhua)-- Kuwaiti Constitutional
Court, the supreme court in the small Gulf country, annulled the
election of two parliamentary members and ordered re-polling
within two months, official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled in a verdict Saturday that the election of
Islamist parliamentary members Khaled Al-Adwalh and Waleed
Al-Jari were illegal as 193 voters unlawfully cast their ballots
in the 21st constituency either because they are not residents
in the area or because they are servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Military servicemen, governmental functionaries, male and
female citizens under the age of 18 are not allowed to vote in
the country which has the only parliament in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
About 110,000 eligible Kuwaiti voters exercised their
franchise on October 7, 1996 to elect the eighth 50-seat National
Assembly from 25 constituencies across the country.
</P>
<P>
The court said that of the 193 illegal voters to have cast
their ballots, 189 were found to be living in areas not included
in the constituency and four other people were found to be active
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the matter, the court said that as it is
impossible to determine to whom these illegal voters have cast
their votes because voting was done through a secret ballot, the
only way out for this is ordering a re-polling.
</P>
<P>
The court ordered that fresh elections be held between
the two Mps and candidate Saadoun Al-Oterbi and no other
candidates can contest. It said fresh elections must now
be held within two months in accordance with the Kuwait elections
law.
</P>
<P>
The Elections Department of the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior
will announce the date for the elections within the coming few
weeks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the parliamentary Interior and
Defense Committee in the Kuwaiti parliament, is likely to reject
a draft law calling for giving Kuwaiti women full political
rights, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that a strong trend within the committee opposes
political rights for women because "Islamic Sharia (law) does not
grant those rights."

<HEADLINE> Booming Economy in Shanghai Pudong New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A large amount of investment
in infrastructure construction in Shanghai's Pudong New Area has
given a greater, fresh impetus to the area's economic development
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During 1996-2000 period, the area is expected to invest more
than 90 billion yuan in infrastructure construction, four times
the figure during the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The area generated 52 billion yuan in GDP in 1996, up 20
percent over 1995, and eight percentage points higher than the
city's average growth rate in GDP.
</P>
<P>
It also won 13 billion yuan in retail sales last year, an
increase of approximately 30 percent over 1996, and added more
than 800 foreign-funded enterprises, bringing the total to 4,265,
with contracted overseas investment exceeding 12 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Construction of many large projects was in full swing last
year, such as the Pudong international airport, the second-phase
Waigaoqiao deep-water harbour, the second subway, and an
information web "harbour".
</P>
<P>
Pudong has now drawn 63 transnational companies to invest in
104 projects, 16 of which were added last year by 12 new
transnational firms.
</P>
<P>
It also added a 1.2-billion-US-dollars project in 1996 to
produce integrated circuit chips, which is the largest item for
the country's electronics industry, and also one of the city's key
projects, apart from the steel complex in Baoshan as well as
petrochemicals in Jinshan area.
</P>
<P>
Pudong also made a big and crucial stride forward on the road
to an international financial, trade and economic center. Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, US's CitiBank, and Japan's
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubish Ltd. and Industrial Bank have got approval
to move their Shanghai branches to Pudong and to pilot RMB yuan
business.
</P>
<P>
Pudong also have been authorized to experiment with
establishment of Sino-foreign joint foreign trade companies.
It has now had 63 foreign trade branch companies set up by
firms from other municipalities, provinces and regions, and
operational ones of them handled more than 100 million yuan worth
of exports in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a growing number of transnational companies as well
as the city's large trading companies plan to move their Chinese
and local headquarters to Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements of the area's developing program in 1997 is being
mapped out.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mola Villagers Live in Fear of Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in Chief Mola's area
of Kariba of north Zimbabwe are living in fear following attacks
by a pride of lions just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail reported today that during the incident,
scores of goats and other domestic animals were killed by part of
a group of lions reportedly relocated into the area by a safari
report.
</P>
<P>
one villager angered by losing 55 goats in a day, last week
allegedly baited the lions with poisoned donkey meat and killed
six of them in an incident set to cause a furore among wildlife
protection groups.
</P>
<P>
Acting district administrator for Nyaminyami rural district
council Chamunorwa Mukondomi confirmed the attacks by lions,
adding that they ''came from nowhere''.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''what we don't know is where the lions came from as
in the past it was difficult for Bumi hills safari lodge to let
its clients view or photograph lions. It is difficult to give a
figure but what we know is that there is evidence that the lions
are killing goats and other domestic animals.''
</P>
<P>
Most of the lions in Kariba were on Forthergill island after
poachers had allegedly snared most of them years before the
launch of the campfire program. Bumi hills safari lodge, about 30
kilometers from Mola communal lands, was understood to have relocated
some lions to retain visitors to the area.

HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A Msasa park family in Harare
recently got the shock of their lives when they received a water
bill for over 120,000 U.S. Dollars for a month's supply of
domestic water, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kays Rushika said his family was astounded by the huge bill as

water in a month. ''Even companies don't pay bills that high for
a month's supply,'' he said.

<P>
Harare Mayor Solomon Tawengwa acknowledged that such problems
were common but that the council of the city was rectifying them
the moment the matter was brought to the city treasurer's
department.

''It is a malfunctioning of the computer at the city treasury
and we really apologize to the ratepayers for such things. We are
investigating and responding to letters on each and every case,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> 6,000-Strong Year Old Skeletons Discovered in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 complete human
skeletons, some 6,000 years old, have been discovered in east
China by a joint archaeological team from the Suzhou Museum and
the Wujiang City Cultural Relics Administrative Committee.
</P>
<P>
The skeletons, including men and women, were buried in an open
graveyard at the Guangfu Village in Taoyuan Town area of Wujiang
City in Jiangsu Province, according to one expert from the team.
</P>
<P>
He noted that each person had been put into a single grave, with
agate brooches found on two of the female skeletons.
</P>
<P>
The radioactive carbon tests made by experts at Beijing
University indicated that the tombs dated from over 6,000 years
ago, with the primeval occupants being people from the period of
the Majiabang Culture of the neolithic age (from 10,000 to 4,000
years ago), he added.
</P>
<P>
The expert held that people at that time had settled in the
area, which must have been very prosperous one with a dense
population.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in China that so many skeletons of
primeval people belonging to the Majiabang Culture period have been
discovered at one time in one area.
</P>
<P>
The skeletons have been sent to the Suzhou Museum for further
studies that will cover ethnology, physiology and pathology, and
this is expected to contribute to the study on the life of people
during the Majiabang Cultural period.

one-fifth the weight of the girl's body, which needed a prompt,
highly-skillful operation to remove.

The growth of the tumor had caused the dislocation of organs
inside the girl's abdominal cavity. Her liver had been pressed
into a one-finger-wide thin slice.

Doctor Jiang had to be especially meticulous and scrupulous
with blood vessels during the six-hour operation because any

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- American Terry Norris
retained his World Boxing Council and International Boxing
Federation junior middleweight titles on Saturday by beating
Canadian Nick Rupa.
</P>
<P>
Norris took the 154-pound titles by flooring Rupa twice in the
10th round held at Nashville, Tennesee. The second knockdown
prompted referee Marty Denkin to stop the fight at 2:34 of the
10th round.
</P>
<P>
Norris, winning his 19th title fight in 23 tries, threw
everything he had against the Canadian challenger.
</P>
<P>
Norris will put his 154-pound titles on the line against Felix
Trinidad of Puerto Rico, who retained his International Boxing
Federation welterweight title by beating British Kevin Leushing at
2:59 of the third round.
</P>
<P>
Leushing knocked down Trinidad in the second round. But the
latter came back later and knocked Leushing down three times in
the following round to retain his 147-pound title.
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 11th title defense for the Puerto Rican
slugger, who has won all 31 of his fights, 27 by knockout.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Fails to Form New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's ruling Socialist Party
(SP) and the opposition today failed to reach agreement on the
formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition blocked the SP plan to form a new government at a
meeting of the National Security Consultation Conference presided
over by President Zheliu Zhelev today.
</P>
<P>
The SP established a coalition government headed by party
Chairman Zhan Videnov after it won the election two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Because of the economic and financial crisis in 1996, Videnov
resigned last December. On January 8, the Supreme Council of the
ruling party nominated Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev as the
prime minister candidate.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Constitution, the prime minister nominee
should, upon the authorization of the president, form a new
government within one week and submit it to the National Assembly
for approval.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition did not want another SP-led government and
demanded an early parliamentary election. They also organized
protest rallies to back their demand.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, the demonstrators assaulted the parliament
building and clashed with police. The opposition parties also
announced a withdrawal from the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that both outgoing President Zheliu Zhelev and the
newly-elected President Petar Stoyanov supported the demand of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
A presidential spokeswoman said that the future negotiations
of the National Security Consultation Conference should set a
specific date for an early general election.

<HEADLINE> China's Household Appliances Market Forecast (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Sales of China-made household
appliances are expected to continue to increase steadily in 1997,
the latest issue of "Economy and Information" reported.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the sales of television sets, refrigerator,
washing-machine, and air-conditioner will grow at about 10 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
Output of Chinese TV sets is expected to report a 12 percent
rise in 1997, 10 percent of which will be color
TVs. Refrigerators, washing-machines, and air-conditioners will
increase by 5, 12, and 28 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Products popular among urban households include large-screen
color TVs, freon- and frost-free refrigerators, automatic
washing-machines, two-room air-conditioners, and microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
The TV sets, refrigerators, and washing-machines owned by most
ordinary families, referred to commonly as the three old main
domestic appliances, are in need of some "updating" or
improvements because most were purchased about ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, this year's marketing of household
appliances will be characterized by an emphasis on modernization
and striving to meet the needs of the rural market. It is expected
that two million refrigerators will need to be replaced a year.
</P>
<P>
Some new types of household appliances have drawn growing
interest, with more technological gimmickry giving consumers
greater delight, one of the most popular of which is the video
compact disc (VCD).

<TEXT>
<P>
The journal further noted that China's rural areas are a good
potential market for household appliances, with the demand for
modern commodities growing as the villagers' income are increasing.
</P>
<P>
The reason that the electrical appliance markets in the country
is hot for urban households is also attributed to their
ever-increasing purchasing power and awareness, and the more
amount of leisure time.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some families are moving into new residence, which
brings with it both a psychological and a practical need for new
household appliances.
</P>
<P>
Newlyweds are also fueling this growing demand, and household
appliances manufacturers are learning how to respond to or even
predict these market trends.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, manufacturers are placing focuses on competitions
by providing higher-quality goods at an even more affordable price.
</P>
<P>
China's TV manufacturers, for example, are looking into
high-resolution TVs, and all manufacturers, both domestic and
overseas, are striving to get into the Chinese market with
promotion activities and improved pre- and after-sale services.

<HEADLINE> Italian Skiers Win World Cup Cross-Country Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian skiers Stefania Belmondo
and Silvio Fauner won their second World Cup cross-country races
in Hakuba, a site of next year's Winter Olympics, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Belmondo, winner of the 5-kilometer classical-style race on
Saturday, again finished first in the women's 10-kilometer
freestyle on Sunday, taking the lead in her sport's World Cup
standings.
</P>
<P>
She completed the 10-kilometer course in 44 minutes 16.6
seconds, beating Katerina Neumannova of the Czech Republic to
second in 45:11.9. Russia's Elena Vaelbe was third in 45:15.2.
</P>
<P>
The three women also took the top three spots in Saturday's
race at the foothills of the Japan Alps.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I have the same great results during next year's Winter
Olympics because it will be the last year of my career as a
cross-country skier" said the 28-year-old Italian woman.
</P>
<P>
Vaelbe, a four-time World Cup champion who fell to second in
the season's standings over the weekend, was one of the many women
who collapsed at the finish line Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As Japan issued its visas late, only several days before the
competition, her late arrival left her with little time to
practice, the Russian skier complained.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Fauner finished first in the 15-kilometer
freestyle race, completing the course in 1 hour six minutes and
22.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
His teammate Giorgio Di Centa was second at 1:06:42.7, and Jari
Isometsa of Finland was third in 1:06:43.4.

<P>
Fauner, also winner of the men's 10-kilometer classical-style

The province approved 130 projects that involved more than 10
million US dollars each last year, with the cost of a number of
them valued at more than 100 million US dollars each.

Shandong has become increasingly selective in setting up joint
ventures in 1996, taking environmental issues more into account, a
provincial official said.

<P>
In the coastal city of Yantai alone, the official added, offers
for 16 pollutive projects were rejected last year and more capital
from overseas was directed into agriculture, infrastructure, new
and high-tech industries, and technological renovations.

NEW DELHI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- inching its way up, India's
annual rate of inflation rose marginally in the last week of 1996
to close the year at 7.65 percent, Press Trust of India said
today.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate went up by 0.07 percentage points for
the week ended December 28, compared to 7.58 percent during the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inflation was mainly due to increase in prices
of commodities such as vegetables, grain mill products and fruits.

<HEADLINE> Some Indian Genes Resemble Those of Japanese, Chinese: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- certain unique genes in
Indians have surprised researchers here for their close
resemblance with those of the Japanese and the Chinese, the Sunday
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers here have indicated that the genes bear close
resemblance to those found only exist in the Japanese and Chinese
populations.
</P>
<P>
This has surprised researchers here. "Asian Indians were
considered to have an ancestral affinity with Caucasoids. now,
they appear to constitute the transition zone between Caucasians
and Negroids on the one hand and Australoids and Mongoloids on the
other," said N.K. Mehra, coordinator of a multi-centric genetic
study in India.
</P>
<P>
The findings, presented at an international conference in Paris
recently, have been the subject of considerable interest.
</P>
<P>
The presence of these unique genes suggests an immense
historical human admixture as well as potential genetic
conversions that took place over centuries in this subcontinent,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The findings of this study may prove helpful for the organ and
bone marrow transplantation programs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Cabinet Discuss Second-Term Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today discussed his second-term strategies with his incoming and
outgoing Cabinet and senior staff.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the strategies including domestic and foreign
policies and a commitment to work closely with the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the seven-hour meeting
at the Blair House, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House, also dealt with issues such as economic and fiscal policies
as well as policies on education, natural resources and
technology.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the meeting came just over a week before Clinton's
January 20 inauguration and less than four weeks before he sends
Congress his balanced budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters there was
unanimous recognition that the strong economy and a strong public
desire make the time ripe for passing a budget that brings the
deficit to zero by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members said the meeting discussed plans for beefing up
foreign policy funds, with a commitment to repaying around 1
billion U.S. dollars of the U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said there was an emphasis on trying to work with the
Congress on the administration's goals.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the working sessions, the president emphasized "the
need for us to work closely with Congress ... to reach out,
especially to the Republican leadership," McCurry said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Blasts PM's Warning of By-polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Saturday resented Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina's warning to go for by-polls to the seats vacated by the
opposition and termed it as a blueprint designed to introduce
one-party rule in this country.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said in a statement
that if his party was compelled to boycott or resign from
parliament, there must be general elections under a caretaker
government, not by-polls under the present one.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina, who is also the chairperson of the ruling Awami
(people's) League, said on Friday that by-polls would be held if
the opposition members of parliament (MPs) remained absent from
parliament for 90 consecutive working days.
</P>
<P>
"We've not boycotted parliament, nor we have resigned. we're
remaining absent from the house to press some of our just
demands," said Mannan Bhuiyan.
</P>
<P>
The BNP had submitted its 10-point demands to the speaker of
the parliament on November 10 last year, the day the party's MPs
started abstaining from attending the parliament session.
</P>
<P>
The demands were narrowed down finally to three -- neutral role
of the speaker, impartial coverage of the parliament proceedings
by the state-run media and release of detained party leaders and
workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is learnt that the government and the BNP have
initiated an informal dialogue to resolve the ongoing impasse in
parliament, but the time of the talks was not yet decided.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Actions Curb Witness Intimidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called for a national effort to fight against gang crimes to
"keep young people safe and criminals off the streets."
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow the voice of justice to be frightened into
silence by the violent threat of gangs," Clinton said in heralding
the Justice Department's 150-page handbook on fighting witness
intimidation by gang members and drug dealers which was prepared
for police officers, prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, addressing the nation in his weekly radio broadcast,
also promised to send Congress broad legislation combating youth
crime and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Noting it would be the top law-and-order priority of his second
term, the president said, "I want every police officer, prosecutor
and citizen in America working together to keep our young people
safe and young criminals off the streets."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department blueprint for investigating and
prosecuting gangs aims to curb the problem of witness intimidation
which was surveyed as a major problem for half the country's
big-city prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"Too many people in too many communities will not testify about
gang crimes because they are afraid of violent reprisal," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration initiated an anti-gang and youth
violence control act last year, which would have allowed juveniles
to be prosecuted as adults for drug conspiracy, violent crimes and
crimes involving guns.
</P>
<P>
The bill also called for stiffer sentences and a national
gang-tracking network for the quicker exchange of investigative
information among federal, state and local law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
The bill died in the Republican-controlled Congress. But the
Republicans today also promised new initiatives to crack down on
juvenile offenders and cleaning up schools.
</P>
<P>
"We want every child to have a chance for a good education, and
a school free from violence and drugs," Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott said in a GOP radio broadcast.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan President to Talk With Opposition FSLN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- New Nicaraguan President
Arnoldo Aleman will hold a dialogue with the country's main
opposition Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) leader
Daniel Ortega, according to FSLN sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, which was the result of the mediation of Spanish
officials Thursday, is expected to solve the country's political
crisis that emerged recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, who is now in Nicaragua,
said he would be willing to assist the peace process in this
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Aleman asked the FSLN Friday during his first press conference
after assuming the presidency "to adopt a prudent attitude" in
those moments, and said that he will visit personally the
Sandinista leader "to make a patriotic call to Ortega."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 36 FSLN deputies abandoned the new National
Assembly inaugural session presided over by the Supreme Electoral
Council, as they required the vote to elect the Parliament board
should be public instead of secret.
</P>
<P>
Ortega has threatened to launch violent protest against the new
government, which was elected last October, after the Supreme
Court overturned on January 7 all the bills approved by the FSLN
and its allies in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The bills include the 1997 budget bill, the tax reform bill and
the procedure bill. They were passed earlier during the last
session of the outgoing National Assembly, which were boycotted by
legislators who supported the president.
</P>
<P>
"The FSLN cannot be an accomplice of a process in which
constitutional order and the dominion of the law are violated,"
said the FSLN leader.
</P>
<P>
Ortega was the president of this Latin American country between
1979-1990.

<HEADLINE> Spectre of Inflation Said to Preclude Deposit Interest Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Another cut in savings deposit
interest rates is unlikely in China since the spectre of inflation
has not been eliminated, according to today's "China Daily" report.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank could make some "minor structural
modifications" in loan interest rates, the report quoted Zhang
Houqi, deputy general manager of the research and development
department of China Securities Co Ltd, as predicting.
</P>
<P>
That opinion is at odds with the forecast of some experts who
believe the central bank will cut interest rates in the first
quarter since the economy has been brought to a soft landing, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The central government estimates China posted nine percent GNP
growth last year with 6.5 percent inflation. For the first time in
18 years, China in the third quarter of last year achieved a
decline in the money supply while maintaining strong economic
momentum.
</P>
<P>
In a recent article in the Shanghai-based Business News, an
expert was cited as saying the central bank will cut interest
rates in the first quarter to support economic growth and
debt-laden state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter last year, economic growth was 9.6
percent, a drop of two percentage points year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang argued the actual interest rate on one-year deposits is
now only 1.27 percent after deducting inflation. The inflation
rate is calculated on the price rise of retail goods. If
calculated on the price rise of consumer goods - which also
include services, the actual interest rate approaches zero, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the central bank twice cut interest rates - in May and
August - slashing one-year deposit rates to 7.47 percent from
1995's 10.98 percent, the lowest point in history.
</P>
<P>
"The effect in easing the money supply from the cuts lags by
several months and is expected to become visible this year," Zhang
said, adding that the pressure of an inflationary rebound remains.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has resolved to continue a moderately tight
money policy this year, showing concern over slowed growth of
saving deposits, excessive increase in fixed-assets investment and
illegal fund raising in some regions.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang added that the possibility of a rise in interest
rates is also slim as inflation is expected to remain in the
single digits this year.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Abdala
Bucaram today condemned the Helms-Burton Law imposed by the United
States against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Enacted in March 1996, the law authorized retribution against
foreign firms doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, who arrived here from Nicaragua where he attended the
Nicaraguan presidential inauguration on Friday, stressed that each
country has the right for self-determination and it is the essence
of authentic sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that Washington, by imposing
the Helms-Burton Law, aimed to scare foreign investment out of
Cuba through applying retaliatory measures against enterprises and
businessmen of third countries who do business with the island
country.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting today with his Panamanian counterpart,
Ernesto Perez Balladares, Bucaram said his country will back the
Panamanian proposal to create the Multinational Center for the War
Against Drug Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He said that drug trafficking must be confronted in a global
way. The Ecuadoran president will leave for home Sunday.

in China in 1996 despite the central bank's two rounds of interest
rate cuts and suspension of deposit interest rate subsidies.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Business Weekly of China Daily, the new
deposits of personal savings between January and November reached
820.19 billion yuan (98.82 billion U.S. dollars), 12 percent up
from 1995's same period.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November last year, the total private savings in
banks came to 3,791.73 billion yuan (456.83 billion dollars),
according to the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haikuan, honorary director of the Research Institute of
Finance and Banking under the People's Bank of China, said the
central bank, believed that lower inflation last year also
contributed to the rise in real profits from deposits, which
became an important factor in the increase of individual savings.
</P>
<P>
He explained that after suspension of deposit interest rate
subsidies and two rounds of interest rate cuts last year, the
nominal interest rate fell but the real interest rate rose
actually.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the interest rate on one-year deposit accounts was
10.98 percent while the inflation rate was 14.8 percent -- meaning
the real interest was negative.
</P>
<P>
While in 1996, the interest rate on deposits of the same term
stood at 7.47 percent, compared to some six percent
inflation. Thus individuals' interest income seemingly decreased
but profits were realized through lower retail prices.
</P>
<P>
So far, the existing securities market still cannot absorb
individuals' idle money.

<P>
BRASILIA, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's coffee bean exports
amounted to 12,736,000 60-kilo bags in 1996, a 6.6 percent
increase over 1995, the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Federation

U.S. dollars, a federation report said. In 1995 the earning was
1.951 billion dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textiles Exports to Maintain Upward Trend: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese textiles exports is
expected to maintain an upward trend this year despite a poor
export performance in 1996, a textiles expert predicted.
</P>
<P>
A favourable element is that domestic cotton prices, which
reached their peak in 1995, have been on the decrease, which will
reduce production costs, Yu Boge, vice-president of China National
Textiles Import and Export Corp, told Business Weekly of the
"China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of interest rate cuts last year, which helped
ease enterprises' burden of paying back interest on bank loans,
were also regarded as cardiac stimulant to the struggling Chinese
exporters, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has promised
to allocate seven billion yuan (843 million US dollars) in new
loans to enterprises to purchase cotton, he added.
</P>
<P>
The pressure last year, namely a drop of 13 percent in
half-finished textile products, has forced enterprises to deepen
reform. Some have successfully improved production efficiency,
lowered export cost and developed high-quality and high-value
added products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Once the number-one export category of China, textiles have
yielded the top position to machinery and electronics products
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, textiles exports in 1996 slid by three to five percent
from the 1995 level, the first time over the past decade, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the poor export performance last year mainly to
soaring domestic cotton prices.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1992 the price of Chinese cotton was 42
US cents per pound, compared with 57 cents per pound, the
international average price. But in 1995, Chinese cotton price
struck 105 cents per pound, exceeding the international price of
101 cents per pound.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, exporters felt great pressure as the
government cut the export tax rebate rate on textiles from 14
percent to 9 percent at the start of last year, after it reduced
the rate from 17 percent to 14 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, international competition intensified with the entry
of such textiles exporters as Pakistan and India and growing trade
protectionism in some regions, Yu added.

LANZHOU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 900,000 rural
residents in northwest China's Gansu Province have benefited from
a drinking water project carried out with loans from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>

<P>
GUIYANG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province is gearing up construction of a thermal plower plant with
total designed installed capacity of 1.2 million KW.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, which will generate electricity by anthracite
fuel, will be the first of its kind located south of the Yangtze
River, in the Anshun Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's key power projects, the plant is estimated
to cost three billion yuan during its first-phase construction,
beginning from April of last year, to build two 300,000-KW
power-generating units by importing some major equipment from the
Unites States.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the first-phase construction in June next
year, the power plant is expected to provide a large share of
power supply to neighboring provinces and regions by fueling 1.8
million tons of anthracite.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou Province, with proved coal reserves exceeding 50
billion tons, has set up and expanded a group of thermal power
plants, giving a greater boost to local economic development.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The newspaper frontpages a story of Wang Qimin, president of
the Daqing Petroleum Exploration and Development Research
Institute, who has contributed tremendously in maintaining annual
petroleum output of over 50 million tons in China's leading
oilfield, for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qimin, who is now commended as the new era "Iron Man," an
honorary title given in honor of Wang Jinxi, the late model oil
worker in the 1960's and 1970s, has evolved 38 major scientific
research programs since his graduation from Beijing Petroleum
Institute in some 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- An accompanying commentary calls on scientists and
technicians nationwide to follow suit and work assiduously for
applying what they have learned to the development of national
economy, as Wang Qimin does.
</P>
<P>
-- China Saturday vetoed a United Nations draft resolution
authorizing military observers for Guatemala after the Central
American country refused to correct its mistakes on Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China will further speed up the pace of of its reforms this
year, especially in restructuring the state-owned enterprises,
said Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress during his inspection tour of east China's
Jiangsu Province from January 4 to 10.
</P>
<P>
-- Hinged mainly on agricultural development, farmers in Hebei,
one of the country's major grain producers in north China, shook
off poverty and became better-off. Some 65 percent of their
per-capita net income came from their production of cereals and
vegetables and processing of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" Business Weekly
</P>
<P>

since the spectre of inflation has not been eliminated, a
financial expert said.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang Houqi, deputy general manager of the Research and
Development Department of the China Securities Co. Ltd. predicted
the central bank could make some "minor structural modifications"
in loan interest rates.
</P>
<P>
-- China's petroleum imports grew 37.5 percent in 1996 as the
gap between domestic supply and demand continues to widen.
</P>
<P>

state firms to export more at a time when trade experts generally
believe the sector will post an annual minimum growth of eight
percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Blamed for Deadlock over Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate has been
blamed for continuing its deadlock with the House of
Representatives over the 1997 national budget, the Philippine Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Rolando Andaya, chairman of the House Committee
on Appropriations, blamed the Senate's "insincerity" for backing
out of an earlier compromise agreement as the bicameral conference
committee Saturday failed once again to solve the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Andaya said the deadlock would not have ensued had Ernesto
Herrera, chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, not made a
sudden change to the agreement forged earlier to earmark at least
40 percent of the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) for hard
infrastructure, livelihood support and skills development.
</P>
<P>
"Senate Herrera, himself, announced this agreement," Andaya
said. "Now, he, in a sudden turnaround, wants to cut 40 percent of
the CDF instead of earmarking the same, contrary to the previous
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Andaya lashed at the Senate stand on the abolition of the CDF
and said it seemed the Senate "does not really mean what it says."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, he also expressed fears that the
476-billion-peso (18.2 billion US dollars) new budget would not be
signed into law this month "if the Senate continues its somersault
from one position to another".
</P>
<P>
If this happens, then the 1997 national budget would be the
longest to be passed by the post-1986 legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that this would not result in a halt of the
government operations because the 1996 budget would be
automatically appropriated until the 1997 budget becomes a law.
</P>
<P>
The budget should be signed into law before Congress adjourned
last Christmas, but failed due to the deadlock of the two
chambers.

WASHINGTON, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Unbeaten Henry Akinwande won
a unanimous decision over Scott Welch to retain his World Boxing
Organization (WBO) heavyweight title in Tennessee on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the bout between two British boxers, Akinwande won the
lop-sided battle as two judges ruled 120-108 and one 119-110, all
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande has improved his records to 31 wins against one draw
in his 32 professional bouts, while Welch lost three of his 22
fights.
</P>
<P>
Fans jeered both boxers as Welch depicted himself not in the
mood of combativeness and Akinwande's failure to floor his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
It was Akinwande's second defence of his crown. He stopped
Russia's Alexander Zolkin in the 10th round last November.

In 1995, 131,624 units were sold but in 1996 the number of

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Sees Big Surplus in Balance of Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela had a surplus of
about 6.3 billion U.S. dollars in the balance of payments last
year, the highest in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade surplus accounted for 10.2 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP), which almost doubled the figure of
3.33 billion dollars in 1991, said the Central Bank of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The favorable balance was attributed to the increase of oil
prices, which generated a 7.35 billion dollar commercial
surplus. The figure was 5.1 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Venezuela reached 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars last year, as a result of the government's efforts to
establish macroeconomic balance in the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Drawing Record Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai attracted a record
more than 11.68 billion US dollars of contractual overseas
investment last year, though the number of foreign-funded projects
in the city went down from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in the China's economic powerhouse has been
up five percentage points annually since 1994, when the amount
exceeded 10 billion US dollars for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the number of overseas-funded projects in the city
has fallen year by year to 2,106 in 1996, but the average spending
for each undertaking rose from 3.7 million US dollars in 1995 to
nearly 5.25 million US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanghai added 220 foreign-funded projects with
investment exceeding 10 million US dollars each, which contributed
approximately 90 percent of the total contractual overseas
investment in the city that year.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent of the foreign-funded projects added in
Shanghai last year was relevant to industry.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign-funded enterprises brought in 200 billion yuan of
sales in 1996, an increase of 43.4 percent over 1995, and paid 9.2
billion yuan in taxes, accounting for 34 percent of the local tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
The output value that was generated in 1996 by local
foreign-funded industrial enterprises reached 17.2 billion yuan,
or 30 percent of the local industrial total.
</P>
<P>
About 4.2 billion US dollars, or 30 percent of local total
export value in 1996, was also brought in by foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
So far, one-third of the investment from overseas in the city
is channeled into the local hot investment spot, the Pudong New
Area, where 63 renowned transnational firms have set up 104
factories.
</P>
<P>
Pudong ratified 802 overseas-funded projects in 1996, with
contractual overseas investment reaching 3.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
All these are resultant from the speedy growth of the
municipality that is China's economic, financial and trade center,
as well as improvement of the local investment environment, which
involves infrastructure, simplified procedure for projects
ratification, and legal systems related to overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Ukrainians Live Under Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 11 (xinhua) -- One third of the Ukrainians, or 17
million residents, are living under the poverty line, a World Bank
survey said today.
</P>
<P>
The other two thirds, though having enough food and clothing,
have no spare money to conduct social or cultural activities, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
According to the current price index in the country, every
person has to spend at least 53 hryvnas (about 29 U.S. dollars) on
food every month to maintain his or her life. But the monthly
pension for a scientific worker who has worked for 30 years is
merely 49 hryvnas (27 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Government figures showed that the average monthly salary for
urban workers was around 133 hryvnas (70 dollars) in 1996, twice
as much as the previous year, while agricultural workers had 59
hryvnas (30 dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
But the government had been in arrears with workers' salaries
of about 2 billion dollars by the end of last September. So the
actual income in 1996 was 24 percent lower than 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the Ukrainian
Research Center of Economy and Politics, only 3 percent of the
1,000 enterprises in the survey had a payment hike last year.
</P>
<P>
Since it became independent in 1991, Ukraine's industrial and
agricultural production ability has dropped by 50 percent, which
affects the people's living standards.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Expand Ties With Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said his country will broaden and deepen its
economic, political and cultural ties with Vietnam in building
future-oriented bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Saturday when meeting with his Vietnamese
counterpart Vo Van Kiet.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived here Saturday on a two-day visit, said
Japan will continue to support Vietnam's reform and opening
up policy.
</P>
<P>
Japan is willing to provide official development assistance and
help Vietnam in improving its investment environment in a bid to
attract more foreign investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Japan's support for Vietnam to become a member of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Japan will establish
new cooperative ties with the member countries of the Association
of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is playing an
increasingly important role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Vo Van Kiet briefed Hashimoto on Vietnam's economic situation,
its foreign policy and the five-year plan which started last year.
</P>
<P>
He said Vietnam will continue to develop friendly relations
with the neighboring countries including Japan.
</P>
<P>
Vo said there were great potentials in cooperation between
Vietnam and Japan, especially in the human resources development
and sharing of know-how in legal system and market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also exchanged views on the hostage
incident in Peru. Hashimoto expressed his thanks for Kiet's
concern about the issue, and pledged to spare no efforts to
promote a peaceful resolution to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Japan and vietnam also signed here three agreements covering
Japan's official development assistance and cultural aid to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also made a courtesy call on Do Muoi,
general-secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Vietnam Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Vietnam's leading trade partner. Vietnamese figures
show that the two countries' trade value stood at 3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is the fourth leg of Hashimoto's eight-day Southeast
Asian tour which also includes Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Ghedina Speeds to Downhill Victory in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Kristian Ghedina clocked
two minutes 1.56 seconds to win the downhill event in Chamonix,
France on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the 27-year-old Italian joined defending champion
and current World Cup downhill leader Luc Alphand at the top of
the standings. Both had 365 points.
</P>
<P>
As Ghedina had a near flawless run on the rollercoaster course
for the top place, Norway's Atle Skaardal was second in 2:01.57
with Werner Franz of Austria third in 2:01.67.
</P>
<P>
"I was really relaxed because after my training runs I gave
myself no chance of finishing in the top ten. I even used a pair
of old skis," said Ghedina.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian said the World Championships in Seistrieres
next month were his top priority instead of the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
Alphand, who nearly fell on the notorious Goulet leap, finished
in fifth spot, 47 hundredths of a second behind the Italian.
</P>
<P>
Alphand was the winner of the downhill title for the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Hans Hauss retained his lead in the World Cup overall
standings.

<HEADLINE> One Goal Scored in Three World Cup Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Three games were kicked off on
Saturday in Africa, but only one goal was scored as the rival
squads were vying for the five tickets for the 1998 World Cup
finals in France.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone scored the lone goal in its meet with Gabon, as
South Africa played a scoreless game with Zambia, and both Namibia
and Liberia followed suit with a 0-0 draw.
</P>
<P>
Played at home turf in Freetown, Abu Gbanaloko Kanu fired home
one minute into the second half, beating Gabon goalie Deckou Shond
with a lob.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the first in the series, Sierra Leone kept alive
its slim chance of making into next year's finals in France as
only the winners of the five four-member groups in league system
will qualify.
</P>
<P>
Early in November, Sierra Leone lost to Morocco 4-0. The other
two teams in Group Five were Ghana and Morocco who will play on
Sunday in Kumasi, Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The match was played on a wet field as the game was delayed for
two hours by the heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
In other games, South Africa held Zambia to a goalless draw in
Lusaka, and Namibia tied Liberia 0-0 in Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, who beat Zaire in the first game, now collected
four points and Zambia, which lost to Conga, scored only one point.
</P>
<P>
A capacity crowd of 30,000 at Lusaka's Independence Stadium saw
Zambia move into the attack in the first half, with striker Dennis
Lota shooting hard at goal in the 25th minute, only to be adeptly
saved by Andre Arendse.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa's midfield dominated the first half. For most
of the second half, Zambia pinned down the South Africans but
failed to pierce their defense, missing several chances.
</P>
<P>
In Windhoek, Namibia and Liberia held each other to a 0-0 tie
characterized by good defense and lost golden opportunities for
both teams.
</P>
<P>
Liberia had the better of the first half where Namibia were
lucky to survive a number of shots at goal.
</P>
<P>
The only time the ball touched the back of the net during the
the game was in the 22nd minute when a Namibian striker was called
off-side.
</P>
<P>
It was Namibia's turn in the second half with some brilliant
football from mid-fielders Silvester "Lolo" Goraseb and Ricardo
Mannetti as well as overseas players.

<HEADLINE> Britain Confident SFOR to Bring Lasting Peace to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Minister
Michael Portillo said Saturday that he was confident the
Stabilization Force (SFOR) would help develop new democratic
institutions and create conditions for lasting peace during its
18-month mandate in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Portillo told a news conference in Serb city Banja Luka in
northern Bosnia that there were many visible signs of improvement
in Bosnia, such as a better functioning of the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He arrived in Bosnia on Saturday to visit British troops
participating in the SFOR and to meet with Bosnian leaders in
Sarajevo. Britain has contributed 5,000 troops to the NATO-led
30,000-strong SFOR which will stay in Bosnia until June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.S. program to train and equip Bosnian
Muslims, Portillo said this was not a threat to peace and that he
could understand the U.S. reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, "Great Britain will not take part in such program for
as long as it had troops in Bosnia," Tanjug news agency quoted the
British minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Brcko, a controversial town in northeastern
Bosnia, Portillo said, "this matter is extremely important to both
sides and extremely sensitive, and had to be settled by
arbitration in which both sides will have just representation."
</P>
<P>
This could not be solved by force, and NATO-led SFOR would
ensure stability and security in this area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb leaders insist that Brcko remain in the Republika
Srpska, as this strategic town is located in the narrowest part of
the Posavina Corridor linking Serb's northwestern part with the
eastern part. The deadline for the arbitration of Brcko has been
postponed to from last December to next February.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Government Agrees to Revise Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 11 (Xinhua) -- Serbian government officials
agreed Saturday to revise the disputed November election results
and honor the will of the people after receiving student leaders
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said that Vice Premiers Nedeljko Sipovac
and Ratko Markovic discused with the student representatives the
demand of the protesters that government settle problems created
with the annulment of elections in some districts in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno, which has organized daily
protests in the past 54 days against the annulment of the election
results, claims it had won 14 out of the 18 largest cities in
November 17 local elections and demands all those victories be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
"The government officials agreed with the need to honor in full
the will of the people as expressed in local elections," said the
government statement which was released by the official news
agency Tanjug.
</P>

Turkish car market, local newspaper Daily News reported today.

Ilhan Cetinkaya, chairman of the Turkish Imported Cars
