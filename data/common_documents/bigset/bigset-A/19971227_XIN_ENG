<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, December 26 (Xinhua) - The Suzhou Industrial Park in
east China's Jiangsu Province has attracted over 3.6 billion US
dollars in foreign funding since its establishment a short three
years ago.
</P>

environmental protection, and development plans, according to
economists attending a Friday symposium in Suzhou sponsored by the
Special Economic Zones Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The average investment for infrastructure construction for the
eight square kilometers completed during the first construction

</P>
<P>
The park, a Sino-Singaporean joint venture, will contribute to
economic cooperation between the two countries and to the
modernization of Chinese industry, according to Ge Hongsheng,

<P>
BAGHDAD, December 25 (Xinhua)-- An Icelandic private plane
carrying gifts and medicine for the Iraqi people arrived at
al-Happaniya military airport near Baghdad this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the second foreign flight to Iraq in two days, which had
been approved by U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
A Russian plane carrying tonnes of medicines arrived in Baghdad
on Thursday, on board of which were also a group of members of the
Liberal Democratic Party opposing sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The gifts and medicine of the Icelandic plane had been
presented from the Reykjavik-based Humanitarian Academy of Peace
2000 Institute, in cooperation with an Italian organization called
Bridge to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
President of the institute, Thor Magnusson, told reporters upon
arrival in Baghdad that the flight was aimed to a call on the
international organizations to work for the lifting of the embargo
imposed on Iraq for more than seven years now.
</P>
<P>
The air flight was accompanied by a delegation from the
Icelandic institute, a journalist from Iceland TV, three members
of the Italian organization Bridge to Baghdad and a photographer.

<HEADLINE> 22 Traffic Accidents in Zambia on Christmas Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Twenty two road traffic
accidents were reported to the police throughout Zambia on
Christmas Day, leaving one person killed and five injured, Zambia
News Agency ZANA reported today.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted a police spokesman as saying that the number of
accidents reported this Christmas almost doubles the figure of
last year which was 12 with two persons killed and three injured.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, two cars were grabbed by armed robbers and
another car was stolen, said the spokesman, adding that no
arrests have been made in connection with the three cars.
</P>
<P>
Christmas is a big occasion in this Christian country. There
used to be many celebrating parties sponsored by the government
agencies in the past years.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no signs to show that parties on council
accounts were held and people consider it as a move to fight
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Zambian government announced that
apart from privately arranged parties, no council-sponsored
Christmas parties shall be allowed this year and the same applies
to new year festivals. The offenders will be surcharged or
penalized, said the government.

<HEADLINE> Aid Flights to Iraq to Continue: Russian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Flights will continue
until the embargo on Iraq is lifted, said the head of a Russian
party delegation in Baghdad today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kostotiken, head of a delegation of the Russian Liberal
Democratic Party made the remarks when meeting with Chairman of
the Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Sadoun Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official came to Baghdad with a delegation of 14
members aboard a Russian plane which arrived in Baghdad Thursday
in attempt to break the U.N. air flight ban imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian plane has brought five tonnes of medicine and
medical appliances to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kostotiken, also a member of the Russian
Duma (lower house of parliament), expressed the happiness for
carrying out this humanitarian flight for the Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed greetings from the Chairman of the Liberal
Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Duma members to the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Hammadi lauded the solidarity step represented
by the coming of the Russian aid plane to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The plane was stopped by Iran on Tuesday as Iran said "sending
the cargo through air would only be possible through special
U.N. authorization."
</P>
<P>
After receiving permission from the United Nations, the plane
landed at Saddam international airport, which saw the first
foreign flight since January 16, 1991 when it received the last
foreign aircraft.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Hammadi called for the lifting of the
seven-year-old U.N. embargo on Iraq as soon as possible and
putting an end to the American hegemony over the activities of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denies Three-way Meeting with Arafat, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu denied today that he would hold a three-way
meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and American
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright next month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was commenting on a media report which quoted senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat as saying that the three-way
meeting would take place in Washington next month, when Netanyahu
and Arafat are scheduled to meet American President Bill Clinton
separately.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat said no date had yet been set for the
Netanyahu-Arafat-Albright meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton intends to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, which has been stalled over Israel's delay in carrying
out the second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet has been holding inner consultations on
mapping out the percentage of the pullback and guidelines on the
final-status talks with the Palestinian National Authority. The
United States is demanding Israel to come out with a final decision
by January 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is proposing creating two security zones
along the 1949 armistice line and the Jordan Valley in order to
protect its safety.
</P>
<P>
Due to big differences between the hardliners and moderates, no
consensus has been achieved despite the intensive deliberations
held within the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In a message delivered on Christmas day in the West Bank city
of Bethlehem, Arafat said he would present Clinton with a
comprehensive plan on reviving the peace process. He reminded
Israel that the important thing is not forgetting the reactions
from the other side.
</P>
<P>
Israel's state television Channel I also reported today that
Arafat plans to call for deploying international peace-keeping
forces along so-call Israeli security zones.

<HEADLINE> Britain Offers Loan to Stave Off Crisis in S.Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to give 300 million
pounds (480 million US dollars) to South Korea as part of an
international emergency package to shore up its collapsing
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The loan was agreed upon at a meeting between Chancellor Gordon
Brown and Bank of England governor Eddie George to discuss the
crisis on Christmas Eve, according to a Daily Mail report today.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of the 13 industrial nations which have agreed
to provide 5 billion pounds (8 billion US dollars) by early next
month to help the South Korean economy meet short-term debts after
drastic falls in its currency and share prices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it will
send an additional 1.5 billion pounds (2.4 billion US dollars) to
South Korea before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said the 6.5 billion pound (10.4 billion US
dollar) international package assembled by the fund should help
keep the country's economic crisis from developing into a
"serious" recession.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis has sparked fears in Britain that the turmoil
could hit job-creating Far Eastern investment.
</P>
<P>
British economic analysts have expressed fears of an imminent
default on South Korea's foreign debt, which is estimated at
around 140 billion pounds (224 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Vietnam Declines in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Vietnam in
1997 declined in comparison with that in the previous year with a
15 percent reduction in the number of projects and a 37 percent
drop in investment capital.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Planning and Investment Minister Tran Xuan Gia
attributed the causes of the decline to several factors.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to be blamed is the policy which encourages
foreign investment in far-off regions and requires a greater
proportion of export volume of their product and greater capital
contribution by local partners in joint venture projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investors are discouraged to invest in hotel and
office complex development projects, which accounted for 40
percent of the total investment in the country in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors also face such obstacles as high land rents
and site clearance fees as well as difficulties in currency
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they also have to spend an excessive amount of
time in conducting surveys to map out investment plans due to the
lack of master development plans in the country.
</P>
<P>
The current monetary crisis in the Southeast Asia also shed
negative impact on the domestic investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Minister Gia said Vietnamese government will make important
decisions soon to improve the investment climate in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam news agency, Vietnam extended a total of
foreign investment licenses to 313 foreign invested projects and
allowed 137 others to increase their investment capital in 1997,
bringing foreign investment capital in the country this year to
over 5 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The South Korea tops the list of foreign investors in
Vietnam. Japan, France, Singapore and Thailand follow behind.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi have taken lead in terms of
the absorption of investment capital.

<HEADLINE> US Retailing Industry Disappointing for Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 26 (Xinhua) -- With stores still filled with
holiday goods, U.S. merchants set out today to make up for
after-Christmas sales by offering deep discounts.
</P>
<P>
Retailers and analysts who watch the holiday sales estimated
that sales in stores open at least one year rose a scant 2 percent
to 3 percent in December from a year earlier -- half the gain some
analysts had been expecting, according to a report of the New York
Times today.
</P>
<P>
This lackluster performance was the third in a row for
retailers, despite the strength of the American economy and gains
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Stores have carried ads or distributed coupons announcing
bargains on everything from clothes to electronic gadgets, with
discounts running as high as 70 percent. They are betting on a
surge of buying after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
From big retailers like Sears and Macy's to small shops,
merchants opened early this morning and cut prices to get shoppers
into the buying mood.
</P>
<P>
Despite a booming U.S. economy and high consumer confidence,
the holidays failed to meet the expectations of many retailers.
</P>
<P>
Even where sales were strong, profit margins were often weak.
"It took stores years to lean that Easter had disappeared as a
selling holiday," a retail analyst was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, retailers reported dismal sales, while 1996 was
a mixed bag.
</P>
<P>
The last blockbuster Christmas for retailers was 1992, when
the biggest merchants' sales rose 8 percent over the previous
year as the economy strengthened, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Ruling Party Accused of Playing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican National Resistant
Movement (Renamo) leader Afonoso Dhlakama said today the ruling
Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo) is playing "Satonic trick"
to win votes for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama made the accusation here in his Christmas speech to
the whole nation, according to the Mozambican News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
He charged that Frelimo is buying over voters for the local
election to be held on May 29 next year, coining and printing
ballots, in order to fool the international community.
</P>
<P>
Frelimo fully knows, he said, that it will be beaten squarely
during the election through fair and democratic polls.
</P>
<P>
But Dhlakama's statement was dismissed by Manuel Tome, General
Secretary of Frelimo as "groundless" aimed at defaming the entire
process of the local election.
</P>
<P>
Tome said Dhlakama started to talk about the so-called tricks
months before the last election in 1994 and that he is imagining
Frelimo's coining of the ballots this time.
</P>
<P>
Renamo is the mainstream opposition party in the country. It
had fought with Frelimo in a civil war soon after Portugal
granted the country independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
In October 1992, this armed group was recognized into a legal
party after a peace agreement it signed with the ruling Frelimo
party.

<HEADLINE> 5 Million Ethiopian Children Suffer From Vitamin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 26 (xinhua) -- Some five million
Ethiopian children suffer from Vitamin A deficiency, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Worede-Work Belayneh, an expert of the ministry of health,
said about one percent of the total population of Ethiopia suffer
from Bitot's Spots, an eye disease caused by Vitamin A
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
A recent study conducted jointly by the United Nations
Children's Fund (unicef) and the Family Health Department of the
ministry reveals that three percent of the population in the
northern Tigray Region are victims of Bitot's Spots. The figure
for the east Hararge Region is 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study discloses that severe deficiency of Vitamin A can
also cause irreversible corneal damage, leading to partial or
total blindness.
</P>
<P>
It shows that supplementation of Vitamin A capsules that cost
only two cents each reduces the risk of death of a child
deficient in Vitamin A by 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Provision of vitamin a capsules can also reduce pregnancy
related deaths by an average of 44 percent among women in areas
where the deficiency is wide spread, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
Worede-Work said the Ministry of Health has drawn short,
medium and long term strategies with a view to curb the effects
of Vitamin A deficiency in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fish liver oil, liver, butter, kidney, egg and milk are among
food stuffs that are rich in Vitamin A, according to the expert.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Justifies Kaunda's Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government today
took time to explain to diplomatic missions to the country the
reasons behind the arrest and detention of former president
Kenneth Kaunda, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Keli Walubita told heads of foreign
missions this afternoon in the capital that Kaunda, also leader
of the country's biggest opposition United National Independence
Party, has been detained as part of the investigations into the
failed October 28 coup.
</P>
<P>
He explained that prior to the abortive military coup designed
to overthrow the incumbent government, Kaunda had been advocating
civil disobedience and violence.
</P>
<P>
Walubita added that in view of this, it is not surprising that
Kaunda has been picked up.
</P>
<P>
He also assured the diplomats that the government will
continue its dialogue with the country's opposition parties and
that the inter-party talks for national harmony will proceed as
planned.
</P>
<P>
The government can not afford to waste all the efforts that
have been put into the preparations of the coming talks, which
aims to break the country's political impasse over, among other
issues, electional provisions in the constitution, said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested and detained by police on Thursday at his
residence in Lusaka four days after he returned home from a world
tour to lobby the international community to freeze aid to
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The 73 year-old veteran statesman was served with a 28-day
detention order under the state of emergency declared by
President Frederick Chiluba one day after the failed coup while
the police did not give the reasons for his detention.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who is said to be sharing a cell with 30 other
inmates, refused to eat anything after his detention and he said
that he will continue with the hunger strike until he is
furnished with reasons for his detention.
</P>
<P>
He told the country's Human Rights Commission which visited
him at Kamwala Remand Prison that the hunger strike is the "only
weapon" he has to press his freedom and rights, according to
ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, father figure of the nation who led Zambia to
independence from British colonial rule in 1964, ruled Zambia for
27 years and was defeated in the country's multi-party elections.
In the second democratic elections held in 1996, he was
disqualified to compete because of his foreign parentage.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: US Preparing Attacks on Its Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 26 (Xinhua)-- There are clear signs that the
United States is making preparations for attacks on Iraqi
presidential palaces, an official Iraqi spokesman warned today
after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, chaired by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, the development of the situation, U.S. attempt to commit
aggression against Iraq and the lifting of the U.N. sanctions were
discussed, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United States is still
manipulating the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which have
conducted thousands of visits to Iraqi sites in the past six and
a half years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. knows very well that Iraq has no prohibited weapons,
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States sticks to their lies and insists
that chemical and biological weapons are hidden in the
presidential palaces, said the spokesman, adding that the U.S. is
making preparations for taking military actions against these
palaces.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that the U.S. should know that its
anti-Iraq attempt will not succeed, saying that Iraq is highly
vigilant against any possible U.S. aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been refusing to grant access to U.N. arms inspectors
to the presidential sites, which Iraq regards as symbols of its
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-Party Dialog to Be Held Ahead of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Co-chairman of the inter-party
talks Micheal Sata announced here today that the proposed
inter-party dialog will be held in Livingstone, southern Zambia,
on December 30 and 31 instead of planned January 10 next year.
</P>
<P>
The government minister without portfolio made the
announcement one day after the United National Independence Party
(UNIP) led by former president Kenneth Kaunda announced its
withdrawal from the inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
Sata also appointed one official of the opposition Zambia
Democratic Congress (ZDC) as co-chairman to replace Mainza Chona,
who quitted from his post after UNIP pulled out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Chona, UNIP Central Committee member, and Sata were chosen
co-chairmen earlier this month when a preliminary meeting of the
inter-party talks was held.
</P>
<P>
UNIP pulled out of the talks after Kaunda was arrested by
police early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three more parties joined in UNIP today by pulling
out of the talks in protest against Kaunda's arrest.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are the National Democratic Party (NDP), the
National Patriotic Alliance and Agenda for Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda returned home on Monday after a marathon overseas trip,
which took him to India, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the United
States and Britain among other countries.
</P>
<P>
He went abroad on the eve of the October 28 abortive coup in
Zambia to seek international pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
After the coup some reports said Kaunda would not return home
for fear of being arrested and would instead seek asylum abroad
but he denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary meeting held early this month 31 parties
drew an agenda for the inter-party dialog. The agenda includes
most contentious issues like constitution, electoral process and
voters' register and fresh registration.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: GA Adopts 270 Resolutions, 77 Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd session of the
UN General Assembly, the so-called "reform assembly" which began
its work on September 16, has so far considered 138 items and
adopted 270 resolutions and 77 decisions.
</P>
<P>
The post of deputy secretary-general, the new scale of
assessment, the 1998-1999 budget and the Anti-terrorism Bombings
Convention are among highlights of the 52nd session.
</P>
<P>
A major outcome of the "reform assembly" was the approval of
establishing the post of deputy secretary-general as an integral
part of the Office of the Secretary-General. The deputy will be
appointed by the secretary-general, with a term of office not
exceeding his own, and will assist the secretary-general in
managing the operations of the Secretariat, ensuring coherence of
activities and programs, and "elevating te profile and leadership
of the United Nations in the economic and social spheres."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general represented his reform proposals to the
assembly in July. On November 12, the assembly, through adoption
of a consensus resolution, endorsed a set of actions described in
the report, including: establishment of the Department of Economic
and Social Affairs, consolidating the work of the Secretariat;
creation of a Vienna-based Office for Drug Control and Crime
Prevention, headed by an executive-director; and the merger of the
Geneva-based programs on human rights into a single office headed
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, the assembly adopted a wide-range, 10-part
reform resolution by which it decided to discontinue the
High-level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development; designated
the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the United Nations
Humanitarian Assistance Coordinator, with responsibility for
coordination of natural disaster relief; and transferred to the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) the responsibilities for
operational activities for natural disaster mitigation, prevention
and preparedness.
</P>
<P>
In the area of peace, security and disarmament, the assembly
asked specific measures to be considered to enhance the rapid
deployment capacity of the United Nations in peacekeeping
operations. The assembly also decided that the Security Council,
in establishing a peacekeeping operation in the future, should
prescribe a time frame for the conclusion of the status-of-forces
agreement between the United Nations and the host government.
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the Fifth Committee (Administration
and Budgetary), the assembly, on December 22, decided the scale of
assessments for 1998-2000, which maintains a ceiling rate of 25
percent, but lower the floor rate to 0.001 percent. The assembly
also approved to appropriate 2.532 billion U.S. dollars for the
1998-1999 budget, which incorporates elements of the
secretary-general's reform proposals.
</P>
<P>
Adoption by the assembly of the Convention for the Suppression
of Terrorist Bombings was the climax to the work of the Sixth
Committee (Legal). Meant to identify, define and punish those who
commit such crimes, the convention provides that states either
prosecute or extradite offenders.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd session of the General Assembly suspended its work on
December 22. The broad discussions on the reform proposals
demonstrated a notable convergence in the aspiration and
intentions of the member states to prepare the organization to
face new realities and challenges.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Condemned by Court for Remarks Over Gas Chamber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- President of the extreme-right
National Front (FN) Jean-Marie Le Pen was condemned today in a
summary procedure by a court in Nanterre near Paris for declaring
on December 5 in Germany that the gas chambers were only a
"detail in the history of World War II."
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal of Grand Instance of Nanterre ordered Le Pen to
pay compensations from one to 5,000 francs (0.17 to 830 U.S.
dollars) to 11 associations which charged him for damages
inflicted with his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen is also ordered to pay 300,000 francs (50,000 U.S.
dollars) to publish the court judgement in 10 national and
regional newspapers and six weeklies.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Le Pen to be condemned for saying
that the gas chambers in Nazi death camps were only "a detail."
He was condemned for similar declarations in 1991.
</P>
<P>
After the court made the verdict, Le Pen denounced it as "a
decision without foundation in law."
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was welcomed by the Union of Jewish Students
of France (UEJF), which said that it would continue to be vigilant
and intensify its fight against the remarks of Le Pen and his
party.
</P>
<P>
The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France
(CRIF) said that it would never compromise with Le Pen and the FN.
</P>
<P>
"The justice has just condemned once more Jean-Marie Le Pen
for having denied the tragic dimension of the Holocaust in a
provocative manner in Munich by the side of a former SS Waffen
Nazi," said the CRIF.

<HEADLINE> ICAO Reports Increase in World Airlines Traffic, Load </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) has reported an increase in world
airline traffic and load factors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures for 1997 which was released today by ICAO
indicate an 8 percent increase over 1996 in total scheduled traffic
in world's airlines, as measured in ton-kilometers performed,
and a 9 percent increase in international scheduled traffic.
</P>
<P>
A ton-kilometer is defined as a combined measure of
passenger, freight and mail traffic which also takes into account
distance flown.
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on statistics supplied by the 185 member
states of ICAO, which was created in 1944 to promote the safe and
orderly development of civil aviation in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, passenger traffic based on
passenger-kilometers performed, rose by 17 percent in total, and
by 8 percent on international service.
</P>
<P>
ICAO says that capacity increase for passenger services reached
their highest annual level of 69 percent in total and 70 percent
for international services. The number of passengers carried
worldwide on scheduled services is now approaching one and a half
billion.
</P>
<P>
ICAO says that freight traffic grew by 11 percent. The number
of freight ton carried is in the order of 25 million.
</P>
<P>
ICAO, which is a specialized agency of the United Nations, sets
international standards and regulations for the safety, security,
efficiency and regularity of air transport. The agency also serves
as the medium for cooperation in all fields of civil aviation
among its Contracting States.

<HEADLINE> 11 Prisoners Escape Custody in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Eleven trial-awaiting
prisoners escaped from police custody this morning in Kokstad, a
city about 180 kilometers southwest of Durban, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The men used a sharp instrument to dig a hole under their cell
and then fled, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Police noticed that the suspects, facing charges ranging from
rape to arson, were missing early this morning while doing
routine morning checks.
</P>
<P>
Today's escape was the second at the Kokstad police cells in
less than two months. Earlier, nine prisoners escaped from the
police holding cells through a hole.
</P>
<P>
Escapes are frequent in South African jails. In the 15 months
till March this year, more than 4,200 prisoners slipped from
their cells.
</P>
<P>
The nation was shocked when six of the most dangerous men in
the country escaped from a Pretoria prison at the beginning of
the month.
</P>
<P>
A large amount of escapes were blamed on corruption of warders
and activities of crime syndicates.

ANKARA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today denied the Greek
claims that Turkish jets violated Greek airspace, describing the
accusation as "baseless."
</P>
<P>
A written statement of Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the
Turkish warplanes were flying in international airspace on

</P>
<P>
"The jets were performing their routine habitual training
flights" and Turkey had always abided by the agreement between
the two countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Ministry Thursday claimed that 12 Turkish F-16
jets violated Greek airspace, saying that Athens would not
tolerate such provocations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over several issues,
including the limits of airspace, rights of sea-bed mineral
resources as well as the protracted Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides has described a decision by the Turkish
Cypriot side to halt the U.N.-sponsored bicommunal talks as an
"extortionist move," a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Taner Etkin, the "foreign minister" of the
self-styled Turkish Cypriot republic in northern Cyprus,
announced that the Turkish Cypriot side has decided to halt the
Cyprus bicommunal talks with the Greek Cypriot side, which is
aimed at reaching a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision will give the Turkish Cypriot side to
study Luxembourg European Council decision, taken earlier this
month, to begin accession talks with Cyprus in spring of 1998.
</P>
<P>
After the European Union Luxembourg summit, Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash announced that the bicommunal negotiations
are "dead," and said that he will no longer discuss the subject
with the United Nations and the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Telling Greek language newspaper Delini (Afternoon), Kasoulides
said when the negotiations between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish
Cypriots start, everyone will undertake their responsibilities. "A
negative policy on the part of Ankara and Denktash will prove
damaging for them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974, when Turkish
troops landed and took over the 37 percent of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peace efforts to solve the Cyprus problem have so far
failed to achieve progress.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct talks held this summer
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash ended in
failure, because Denktash refused to negotiate unless the EU
withholds its decision to start accession talks with Cypriot
government.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Loses Opener in Women's Volleyball League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Shanghai
was defeated by newly-promoted Tianjin 3-0, the biggest and only
upset as the China's volleyball leagues started off on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On their home turf, the Shanghai women rushed to an early lead
of 14-9 in the first set through pierce attacks and solid blocks.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Tianjin, which was promoted to the league from division B,
proved to be hard nut for the reigning champions by ralling back
to win seven points in a row to stun the home fans.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin kept its winning trend through fast attacks and
varified tactics to take the second set 15-12.
</P>
<P>
In the third set, Shanghai squandered its 10-6 lead with a
string of unforced errors before Tianjin achieved its away win for
the day's upset, sealing the competition as ace spiker Lu Chao
displayed her top-class calibre on the court.
</P>
<P>
Cai Bin, coach of Shanghai, blamed his disciples for failure to
adjust for the league on time as defending champions mentally
which resulted in errors in their techniques.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Jiangsu women spikers won their opener
against Sichuan, which was tougher than what the 3-0 scoreboard
suggested.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, runner-up in last season, fielded in the same line-up
including national players Sun Yue, Qu Aihua and Li Julan, while
Sichuan, formed prior to the Eighth National Games in October,
featured the majority of debutants in its roster.
</P>
<P>
However, Sichuan surged ahead 12-9 in the first set before
Jiangsu rallied back to overturn the trend by winning the last six
points in a row under the cheers from thousands of home fans.
</P>
<P>
The home squad continued its dominance in the second set for a
comfortable lead of 12-9 before the Sichuan women capitulized upon
two faults for 12-11.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the home team stopped the visitors from scoring any
more points before sealing the competition 15-12, 15-11 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
In other first round women's matches, two other teams exploited
their home advantages as Zhejiang beat Fujian 15-1, 15-5, 15-11
and the Liberation Army romped Liaoning 15-4, 15-8, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
The men's volleyball league also started on Saturday with all
four home teams winning their openers.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Sichuan defeated visiting Shanghai 15-7,
15-13, 15-13, Zhejiang outscored Henan 16-14, 15-8, 15-9, Liaoning
savored its victory against Hubei 15-12, 15-2, 15-9 while Jiangsu
whitewashed Beijing 15-5, 15-10, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
Both the men's and women's volleyball leagues feature an
identical eight teams competiting in the 28-round tournaments with
two games for each squad on every Saturday and Sunday in 14
weeks which runs to April 5.

<HEADLINE> 1998, Unique Opportunity to Settle Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. envoy to Cyprus today
said the U.N. believes 1998 offers a unique opportunity to settle
the Cyprus problem, but warned of negative consequences if this
opportunity is not seized.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus News Agency today, U.N. Resident
Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel said that "we are
approaching a defining moment after the February presidential
elections (in Cyprus) and 1998 will be a very important year."
</P>
<P>
But if peace talks, scheduled to begin in March 1998, end
inconclusively, as the two rounds of U.N.-led talks in last summer
did, the consequences would be much more serious, the U.N. envoy
noted.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of direct talks held in July and August between
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash ended in failure, because Denktash refused to negotiate
unless the European Union (EU) withholds its decision to start
accession talks with Cyprus in spring next year.
</P>
<P>
Conditions in next year, which would be better than that this
year, would induce everyone to become very focused on the Cyprus
problem, Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
The start of accession talks with the EU is one such condition,
he said, adding that this marks an important factor which should
impel everybody to display the necessary resolve to reach an
overall agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops landed and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens
coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The EU Luexembourg summit earlier this month decided to start
accession talks with the Cyprus Republic in next spring.
</P>
<P>
Feissel, however, refrained from commenting on Turkish views
that accession talks would signal the permanent division of the
island, but noting that neither Turkey nor the Turkish Cypriots
are happy with the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
"If we had significant progress in the Cyprus question, no
doubt their reaction would be very different," the top
U.N. official in Cyprus said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that perhaps the lack of political will would be
the most important hurdle in a settlement in Cyprus. But the
U.N. envoy expressed the hope that this situation would change,
because all parties concerned had realized it was in their
interests to work out a settlement.

PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven civilians were
killed from Thursday night till Friday morning in a village in
Tiaret, 200 kilometers southwest of the Algerian capital of
Algiers, reports from Algeria said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The latest killings took place three days after 48 people were
killed in two other villages in the same region.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was a 21-day-old baby.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian army is launching a new offensive against Islamic

General Kamel Abderrahmane, chief of the Second Military Region
based in Oran, had asked civilians living in villages to take up
arms or take shelter in big cities after the two massacres took
place in Tiaret.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Restructures State-Owned Firms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The province will encourage 130 prosperous state-owned
enterprises and enterprise groups to expand their scale of low
cost production by using capital, technology and the market as the
linkage.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that 160 medium-sized and large state-owned
enterprises will be merged to ensure that 30 billion yuan in idle
assets will be regrouped for effective use.
</P>
<P>
During the process of reform, between 250,000-300,000 redundant
workers will be laid-off by industrial firms in each of the next
three years, said Wen, adding that the figure will climb to
800,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Proper arrangements for laid-off workers is a key to
maintaining rapid and sustained economic development. All
employment agencies and training centers must create more jobs and
offer better services, said Wen.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, a leading industrial base built in the 1950s, once
produced 80 percent of the country's iron and steel and 60 percent
of heavy machinery. The province was the first to practice the
planned economy and the last to shift to the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The province has 926 medium- to large-sized state-owned
enterprises, or about 10 percent of the national total. The
concentration of said enterprises represented a major economic
powerhouse during the years of planned economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the said state-owned enterprises are now facing
unprecedented challenges in the wake of the socialist market
economy, with between 40-50 percent of Liaoning's enterprises
operating in the red.

<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, one of China's
heavy industrial bases, will allow 90 percent of its medium-sized
and large state-owned enterprises merge with firms of different
ownerships over the next three years as part of a strategic
restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
The province will transform a limited small number of large amd
medium-sized enterprises in the primary industrial sector, which
are considered vital to the national economy, into state-owned or
state holding firms, according to Liaoning Governor Wen Shizhen.
</P>
<P>
The program will in turn cultivate and fully support the
development of 60 competitive large industrial firms or enterprise
groups, said Wen, the former director of a large state-owned
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The combined assets of the 60 firms will soar to 400 billion
yuan by the end of the century, with annual sales revenue expected
to hit 280 billion yuan. The ratio of their value-added output to
the total volume for the province will jump from 48 percent in
1996 to 60 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Conditions permitting, profitable enterprises will have the
opportunity to raise funds by floating shares on the stock market
and to acquiring loss-making enterprises through share transferrals
and the acquisition of shares, creditor's and land rights, mergers
and the establishment of joint ventures and associations.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200 small poorly managed lossing-making enterprises
would be allowed to transfer their assets through the property right
market in order to regain their vitality.

<HEADLINE> Chengdu Battles River Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Today's completion of a
project to harness the Jinjiang River has benefited 100,000 people
in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Jinjiang, which traverses the central part of the city,
formerly contributed to the fame and glamor of Chengdu's many
historic and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
However, since the 1950s, the level of pollution in the river
has grown dramatically due to falling water levels in the upper
reaches of the river and increasing discharges of waste from the
city, both of which have created major problems for some 100,000
poverty-stricken people living in the river valley. Some two
million residents living in the lower reaches of the river have
also suffered from the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the city government has invested 2.7 billion yuan
(300 million US dollars) to harness a 19-kilometer section of the
river.
</P>
<P>
A sewer system, and power, water and communications systems have
been completed for the project whose construction takes five
years, with a large number of poverty-stricken people moving into
new housing. The project also included the completion of two main
roads in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
Economists have praised the effort as a first-class project in
urban construction.

PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Le Pen, president of the French
rightest National Front, threatened Saturday to retaliate against
the overseas territories of France after he was rounded up by
protesters in Martinique, a Caribbean island ruled by France.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Le Pen met with a protest by some 50
militants of the independence movement of Martinique at the
airport of Fort-de-France, where he made a stopover before flying
to Porto-Rico for a visit.
</P>
<P>
The protesters attacked Le Pen for his remarks about "racial
inequality" and the gas chamber of Nazi death camps, which he
described as "a point of detail in the history of World War II."
</P>
<P>
"Think it over well that I am a deputy of the European
Parliament and that I know how to take into account this attitude
in the discussions which will involve the interests of these
islands (at the parliament)," said Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place one day after a court in Nanterre near
Paris condemned Le Pen for his remarks on gas chambers, which he
made on December 5 in Germany.

JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, says that Indonesia's external loans, including commercial
papers, stood at 119 billion U.S. dollars in June this year and
not 200 billion dollars as put by some press reports.
</P>
<P>
Some 54 billion dollars of the amount belongs to government
loans and the rest private sector loans, Antara News Agency today
quoted Bank Indonesia Director Boediono as saying in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Boediono said that as of September, the loans went down to 118
billion dollars, with 52.4 billion dollars in government loans and
65.6 billion in private sector loans.
</P>
<P>
He also said Bank Indonesia's record tallied with World Bank
reports.
</P>
<P>
Various domestic valuable papers held by foreigners, such as
Bank Indonesia certificates, bonds, promissory notes, commercial
papers, deposit certificates and medium-term notes, reached 21.2
billion dollars at the end of June and dropped to 15.3 billion
dollars at the September-end, he said.
</P>
<P>
These figures were obtained based on a survey of custodian
banks and have been synchronized with figures from the team of the

</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat announced that he would
present his own plan for peace with Israel when he meets with U.S.
President Bill Clinton next month. The plan includes a proposal to
station international peacekeeping troops between Israel and the
West Bank, maps for the next Israeli withdrawal and a concept for
final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- Iraqi leaders accused the United States of planning air
strikes to plant false evidence of chemical or biological weapons

of weapons of mass destruction. The White House immediately
dismissed the charge as "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Financial markets in the United States and South Korea
registered gains Friday, as investors appeared hopeful that the
latest Korean bailout package will prevent a wider financial
crisis. However, in Japan, where investors raised new questions
about the Tokyo government's handling of its own shaky financial
system, stock prices fell 3.25 percent even as the finance
minister declared his nation's crisis at an end.
</P>
<P>

resolving one of post-Soviet Russia's most intractable conflicts
Friday, convening a Kremlin round table on land reform that
pledged to hammer out a compromise land code over the next three
months.

<HEADLINE> WHO Acts to Tackle Cholera in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) has decided to set up a task force in Addis
Ababa to curb the spread of cholera in east African countries.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here by Tadesse Molla, head of epidemiology
and AIDS department of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The task force to be established in the Ethiopian capital next
month, Tadesse said, will devise strategies through which the
spread of the disease could be curbed alongside the enhancement
of the storage and procurement of medicinal drugs.
</P>
<P>
The task force will review the experience of each country in
the region in preventing diarrhea and draw a three-year plan of
action before it set out to undertake its activities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It also offers trainings to health professionals on how to
tackle the cholera epidemic in the region, Tadesse added.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO announcement, an outbreak of cholera has
killed over 2,600 lives this year in east African countries. The
spread of the infectious disease had been aggravated by heavy
rain, poor sanitation and inadequate medicinal response in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Agrees to Compensate Holocaust Survivors in E. Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The German government has agreed
in principle to set up a special fund to compensate Holocaust
survivors living in eastern Europe, a local newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the German Tageszeitung newspaper, the agreement
was reached by the German government and the Jewish negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the German government will make payments
to the fund three times a year. And the Jewish Claims Conference
will administer the fund and use the money to pay monthly pensions
to east European Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed that about 17,000 to 20,000
people are eligible for the pension payments, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is expected to be finalized in mid-January,
came after months of deadlocked negotiations. The German
government had insisted on a one-time compensation instead of
making the payment on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Germany had paid about 100 billion German marks (55 billion
U.S. dollars) to Holocaust survivors in the West since 1949.
</P>
<P>
But those Jewish survivors living in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union had been excluded from the compensation
programs during the Cold War.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Huajin Chemical Industry
Group, China's third largest chemical industry company, was
established today in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The group, which has total assets of over 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars), is located in a traditional industrial base
which is home to 10 percent of the country's state-owned medium-
to large-sized enterprises with total fixed assets of some 500
billion yuan (60 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Governor Wen Shizhen called the establishment of the
company "a major step in the transformation and adjustment of the
traditional industrial base and in restructuring Liaoning's
state-owned assets."
</P>
<P>
The Huajin Group consists of four former chemical giants in the
province -- the Liaohe Chemical Fertilizer Plant, Jinxi Natural
Gas Chemical Industry Plant, Panjin Ethylene Plant and Jinxi
Chemical Industry Plant.
</P>
<P>
The group's combined sales income this year is expected to
surpass five billion yuan (600 million US dollars), according to
Huajin Chairman Fen Enliang.
</P>
<P>
He said the group plans to invest 14 billion yuan (1.7 billion
US dollars) between 1998-2007 to initiate a series of new
projects, including the respective increase of its annual ethylene
and PVC (polyvinyl chloride) output to 360,000 tons and 200,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The group is expected to become China's largest production base
for caustic soda, PVC, and chemical fertilizers. Huajin's total
assets are expected to hit 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US
dollars), with projected annual sales income set at 10 billion
yuan (1.2 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM Arrives in Saudi Arabia for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of state
for Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh arrived in Saudi Arabia today
to deliver a message from King Hussein to Saudi King Fahd on the
stalled Middle East Peace process and its negative implications
on peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources were quoted by Kuwait News
Agency as saying that the letter also carries fresh ideas on means
of fostering relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Tarawneh is expected to deliver the
message to King Fahd later today and confer with Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Saudi Arabia, Rarawneh would also hold
talks with Saudi leaders on bilateral ties, regional situations,
the Middle East peace process and the Islamic summit held in Iran
recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said the two countries share the same view regarding the
Middle East peace process which is based on the principle of
land-for-peace and U.N. resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Amman and Riyadh hold the Israeli government fully
responsible for the current stalemate in the peace process
and assert that continuing its arrogant policy will only
complicate matters and threaten to undermine the whole peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The visit follows the official visit to Saudi Arabia by
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan in September.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Jordan have been improving
in recent years after several years' strain following the Gulf
War when Amman and Riyadh were on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is Jordan's second largest trading partner after
Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported about 184 million U.S. dollars
worth of goods to Saudi Arabia compared to 99 million U.S.
dollars in 1995, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Under a trade protocol, the two countries are expected to
set up a free trade zone by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein visited Saudi Arabia early this year for
the first time in six years and held talks with Fahd.

(GDP) for Liaoning Province, a leading industrial base in
northeast China, will grow by an annual rate of 10 percent over
the next five years, according to Liaoning Governor Wen Shizhen.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for Liaoning's GDP to range between 680-710
billion yuan by the year 2002, and climb even further to 890-970
billion yuan by 2005, said Wen.
</P>
<P>
The province's total import-export value will hit 23 billion
US dollars by 2002, and will rise to 30 billion US dollars by
2005. The export value for 2002 will stand at 13 billion US
dollars, with the figure rising to 17 billion US dollars in
2005. The import value for 2002 will hit 10 billion US dollars,
and will rise even further to 13 billion US dollars in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The provincial revenue will soar to 35.2 billion yuan in 2002
and hit 46.8 billion yuan in 2005, with the average annual
growth rate standing at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The proportion which scientific and technological achievements
play in economic development will jump from the current 42
percent to 52 percent in 2002, and even further to 56 percent in
2005.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Successful macroeconomic controls and increased overseas
investment channeled into industry will facilitate the
revitalization of Liaoning's traditional heavy industrial base.
</P>
<P>
However, 926 medium- to large-sized state-owned enterprises are
still technologically backward and mismanaged as a result of the
planned economy which was in place for some three decades.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the province will attempt to reverse the
passive situation by promoting successful state-owned enterprises,
establishing enterprise groups and allowing loss-making firms to
go bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has listed the petrochemical, metallurgical,
electronics and information, and machinery industries as pillar
industries for the next five years, said Wen.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the electronics industry, priority will be placed
on the development of computers and software, as well as
on telecommunications and consumer electronics products and new
components.
</P>
<P>
The automobile manufacturing industry will place emphasis on
light-weight vans and bus production. Power generation equipment
manufacturers should strive for development of high-voltage
products.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent of medium- to large-sized state-owned
enterprises, especially pillar industries, will establish joint
ventures or cooperative ties with overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Local governments will allow state firms to either transfer
stock rights or sell operational rights in various forms.
</P>
<P>
Measures will be adopted to encourage foreign banks to open
branches in Liaoning in a bid to facilitate financial
cooperation between the province and other parts of the world,
according to Wen.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's State Govts Urged to Set up Disaster Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian National
Disaster Management and Relief Committee Chairman Mohamed Rahmat
Saturday urged state governments in the country to set up their
own disaster funds to ensure immediate aid to victims.
</P>
<P>
The local governments need to set up disaster funds of their
own because assistance from the Committee would take time due to
the procedures involved, he explained.
</P>
<P>
For instance, any financial aid exceeding 20,000 ringgit (more
than 5,000 U.S. dollars) requires the prior approval of the
cabinet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia comprises 13 states, as well as the capital city of
Kuala Lumpur and Labuan which form a Federal Territory.
</P>
<P>
At a function to provide aid from the National Disaster Relief
Fund to 18 families whose homes and properties were damaged in two
storms in July and August in the northern state of Perak, Mahamed
also urged the people to cooperate with the government in reducing
disasters caused by negligence like accidents in factories, the
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Fund had so far raised 2.2 million ringgit (about
570,000 U.S. dollars) although the target is 4 million ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed also asked the Science, Technology and Environment
Ministry to implement safety status regulations on factories as
quickly as possible to reduce accidents or disasters caused by
negligence.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Slam Ethiopia's Position on Cairo Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Somali military
officers today condemned Ethiopia's move in denying the outcome
of the Cairo declaration by the Somali factions.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ali Hashi Barale, spokesman for 250 former Somali
military officers has described Ethiopia's condemnation of the
Cairo agreement as "unfortunate on Ethiopia's part."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said today in south Mogadishu that Ethiopia has
noted that its diplomacy is still stuck on the previous
traditional hostility between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Barale, a former commandos officer who led a brigade
that participated in the 1977 Somali-Ethiopian war, has warned
Ethiopia against what he called its constant interruption in
Somalia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Let Ethiopia support this agreement if she wanted peace for
Somalia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barale has advised Ethiopia to change its position in the
recent Cairo agreement and pull out its troops from Somalia's
territories, otherwise, he said, this move could have a negative
impact on the future relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This statement by the Somali former army officers came after
the Ethiopian government condemned the Egyptian government for
what they called the hijacking of Somalia peace process by
hosting the recent Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
The position of Ethiopia has also created great anger in the
Somali communities who are now expecting peace after a seemingly
endless civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I think all Ethiopia meant is to take the credibility of
finding a solution to Somalia's long standing crises," said
Muhidin Hashi Nur, a businessman in Bakara market. "But they
failed in bringing all Somalia's sides to the negotiating table,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid has expressed
concern over Ethiopia's stance in the Cairo meeting. However, he
said Ethiopia is independent to make its own evaluations on the
agreement in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Somali factions who signed the pact in Cairo are expected
to send a joint delegation to Ethiopia on Monday. The members of
the delegation include Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Osman Ali Atto and
representatives from Hussein Aidid's side, and they are planning
to meet with the Ethiopian prime minister in Addis Ababa on
Tuesday to brief him on how the meeting in Cairo went on and its
results.

LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- About 70 percent of Nigeria's
agricultural produce are being destroyed by pests, according to
the Pest Control Association of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The destruction is not quantifiable as it is enormous in
monetary value and also amounts to a waste of man-hour as well as
starvation, said Kayode Odogbolu, president of the association,
quoted by the New Nigerian paper today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there would be abundant food for the populace at
low prices if pests were effectively controlled, the president
promised to reinforce the efforts to fight the menace.
</P>
<P>
The association will continue to organize workshops to
peasants in the north, the country's agricultural production
base, to educate them on the application of chemicals on their
farm products.
</P>

Authorities concerned have taken measures to ensure the

<HEADLINE> Japan's Largest Opposition Disbanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Ichiro Ozawa, leader of Japan's
largest opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), announced Saturday the
disbanding of the party to pave the way for the establishment of two
new parties.
</P>
<P>
One party will be based on Komei, a Buddhist-backed political
group, while the other is expected to be formed by members loyal to
Ozawa.
</P>
<P>
Party sources said Ozawa's new party, to be launched around
January, will comprise about 100 Diet (parliament) members, 80
members of the House of Representatives (lower house) and 20 of the
House of Councillors (upper house).
</P>
<P>
The new party aims to eventually ally itself with conservative
members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) when the time
comes for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to step down, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ozawa proposed in a meeting with Tomio Fujii, leader
of the Komei Party, that 19 House of Councilors legislators close to
Komei leave the NFP to fight next summer's Upper House election on
their own.
</P>
<P>
The 19 NFP members formerly belonged to Komeito, one of eight
parties and one group that merged in December 1994 to form the NFP.
</P>
<P>
Komei, which groups Upper House members and local assembly members
formerly belonging to Komeito, unanimously decided at an executive
meeting Friday morning to accept Ozawa's proposal, Fujii said.
</P>
<P>
Fujii said his group plans to hold a meeting to change Komei into a
new party involving the 19 upper house members in late January or
early February.
</P>
<P>
The NFP has 126 members in the 500-seat lower house, of whom 45
members formerly belonged to Komeito.
</P>
<P>
The NFP was the biggest winner of seats by proportional
representation in the July 1995 upper house election, with strong
support from the Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest lay Buddhist group.
</P>
<P>
Since Ozawa became president of the NFP two years ago, the party
has constantly been rocked by internal strife arising from its
creation through the merger of divergent political groups.
</P>
<P>
The wrangling, as well as the sagging popularity of the party, has
resulted in a number of defections from the party, including those of
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata.

<HEADLINE> HK Insurance Premiums Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- After three years of falling
premium income, Hong Kong insurance business reversed the downturn
to achieve a 5.7 percent growth in the first nine months of the
year, according to a local insurance official.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's South China Morning Post quoted Insurance
Commissioner Alan Wong Chi-kong as saying that the rebound was
prompted by double-digit premium growth recorded in motor
insurance and employee compensation business.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, motor insurance achieved premium
growth of 12.7 percent compared with the same period of last year,
the first time motor insurance recorded growth after three
consecutive years of declining premiums.
</P>
<P>
Employee compensation insurance also recorded 14.5 percent
premium growth in the first nine months of the year -- the first
time this type of insurance has shown growth since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wong expected general insurance growth would continue next
year in spite of a forecast economic adjustment for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of public housing estates will increase the need for
fire insurance which will benefit the general insurance
companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Life insurance premiums also enjoyed double-digit growth in the
first nine months, the commissioner revealed, adding that he
expected life insurance to carry the strong momentum into next
year as members of the public become more aware of the importance
of insurance.

<HEADLINE> Good Working Ties Forged Between HKSARG, MFA Office in Handling External Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Regional Government (HKSARG) has, since July 1,
established contacts and frequent communications with the
Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MFA Office) in handling external affairs of the HKSAR, the HKSARG
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Through actual experience, we have established a good and
trusting relationship with the MFA Office," a spokesman from the
Constitutional Affairs Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to press inquiries on remarks made
by Commissioner Ma Yuzhen in an earlier exclusive interview with
Xinhua, during which Ma briefed the news agency on the full
support and assistance given by his office to the HKSARG in the
past six months in handling external affairs on its own with due
authorization.
</P>
<P>
"As Commissioner Ma said, the MFA Office and HKSARG share the
common objectives of upholding sovereignty and fostering the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. Both parties are
committed to work in strict accordance with the Basic Law and to
ensure the full implementation of the principle of 'One Country,
Two Systems'," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law,
the HKSARG has, in the past six months, signed bilateral
agreements in various fields with foreign countries, and
participated actively in international organizations and
activities, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We have, as before, been fully accepted and supported by our
partners in the international community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the period from July 1 to November 30, representatives
from the HKSARG participated as members of the People's Republic
of China delegation in more than 20 international conferences,
most of which were in the fields of communication, civil aviation,
etc., he continued.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out: "The fact that expatriate civil servants have
also taken part as members of the PRC delegation in attending
international conferences clearly demonstrates that the principle
of 'One Country, Two Systems' is being fully implemented in the
HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
In addition, HKSARG representatives also participated in more
than 200 international conferences "on our own" using the name
"Hong Kong, China", he continued.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government (CPG) formally announced on
November 22 that reports on the implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR) in the HKSAR would be submitted to the relevant treaty
monitoring bodies (TMBs) of the United Nations so that TMBs and
the international society will have a better understanding of the
human rights situation in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
This arrangement not only reflects the determination of the CPG
to fully implement the principle of "One Country, Two Systems" but
also demonstrates the CPG's willingness to handle the matters
relating the HKSAR in a flexible way so as to take into account
the practical needs of the HKSAR, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the HKSARG is grateful for the support given by
the CPG and the assistance rendered by the MFA Office. "We will
continue to cooperate closely with the MFA Office and to further
develop and strengthen our working relationship," he added.

believed dead, said the Nepali Tourism Ministry on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Boukreev, 39, was believed to be swept away on Thursday
by an avalanche while he was at 5,900 meters, the Nepali spokesman
quoted Italian climber Simone Moro as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moro was rescued on Friday from the mountain in west Nepal by a

</P>
<P>
Moro and Boukreev were attempting to scale the steep south face
of the 8,091-meter Annapurna I, the world's 10th highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
Boukreev was a noted mountaineer by scaling 11 of the world's
14 peaks over 8,000 meters, including the world's tallest peak of
Qomolangma three times.

<HEADLINE> Macao Inspection on Chicken Farms Finds Nothing Abnormal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Macao has stepped up inspection
of all its chicken farms and nothing abnormal was found, an
official told local television Friday.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, president of the Macao Municipal Council of
Islands, said that an inspection into all 27 farms in the Taipa
and Coloane islands found no evidence of the bird flu.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that farmers should notice the council once
they find dead chickens so that the dead birds could be examined
and dealt with properly.
</P>
<P>
Although the deadly H5N1 virus has killed several patients in
Hong Kong, no case of bird flu was reported in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that it is safe to eat birds that were cooked
thoroughly. It is also advised that people wash their hands clean
before taking food. Doctors believe that the disease is not caused
by eating birds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over the past few days, local authorities have
increased cleaning of bird markets.
</P>
<P>
Sales of birds have dropped considerably in Macao, but
officials said there is no plan to stop importing birds from
China's inland. They insist that current examinations on imported
birds are sufficient.

<P>
PARIS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The tribunal of Nanterre near Paris Friday condemned the
president of the extreme-right National Front (FN) Jean-Marie Le Pen
for his remarks on gas chambers, which he made on December 5 in
Munich, Germany, in company with his friend and former Waffen-SS
Franaz Schoenhuber. That was the second time for Le Pen to declare
that gas chambers in Nazi death camps were only ``a detail in the
history of World War II.'' The civil tribunal of Nanterre condemned
him first, waiting for the judgement by a criminal tribunal.
</P>
<P>
-- The funeral of the 45 Tzotzile Indians killed Monday in
Chiapas took place Thursday evening. Accused by the Zapatist
guerrillas for the massacre, the Mexican government has proposed to
resume peace talks. But the guerrillas are highly sceptical, as some
of the 41 people arrested after the massacre had admitted their
belonging to the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission has asked France to reduce by one
quarter the aid subsidized for regional development, as the European
Union (EU) is preparing for a new sharing of financial aid among EU
countries after the enlargement of the union to central and eastern
European countries. Some opposition politicians are worried that the
French government would obey Brussels, while others are mobilizing
in the regions which are the primary beneficiaries of EU aid, such
as Auvergne and Limousin.
</P>
<P>
-- In 1998, the Disney empire will bump into the competition from
new great cartoon studios such as Fox DreamWorks and Warner. The Fox
will project its first cartoon movie, ``Anastasia,'' which has
already earned 33 million U.S. dollars in the United States, to
France in February.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Suffering From Poisonous Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Vietnamese have
suffered from poisonous chemicals every year, the Vietnamese
newspaper "Lao Dong" Saturday quoted a report of the Ministry of
Health as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many people are regularly exposed to carcinogens and other
toxic substances, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Plant Protection Department under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development said 2,500 to 3,000 tons of
insecticides, herbicides and pesticides are used across the
country every year.
</P>
<P>
Some insecticides, such as methaphos monitor, azodrin, and
methyl parathion are still used in Vietnam, even though they are
banned by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled and illegally manufactured chemicals also add to the
problem, with some 30 companies, 20 factories and nearly 100
foreign firms manufacturing the products.
</P>
<P>
Although the Health Ministry has issued a list of chemicals
barred from food processing, the illegal use of chemicals in food
is still rampant.
</P>
<P>
This has led to a high chemical-related mortality rate,
following major killers like tuberculosis, lung cancer and traffic
accidents.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis Not Likely to Occur in China, Says Top Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top banker Dai
Xianglong said here today that financial crisis that has hit some
of Southeast Asian countries will not likely occur in China. But
the risks hidden in the country's financial sector cannot be
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee at its 29th session here today, Dai said the lessons to
draw from recent financial crisis in some Asian nations include
avoiding a "bubble economy", and maintaining a sound financial
system, a reasonable monetary system and an adequate foreign
exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
"It is also very important to open financial sectors in a very
prudent and step-by-step way," said Dai, governor of the People's
Bank of China (PBC), or the central bank.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a financial crisis in some Asian countries will
not possibly occur in China as its overall economic development is
healthy and financial situation fairly stable.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserve will exceed 140 billion US
dollars by the end of this year and its currency Renminbi remains
stable. By the end of June this year, China attracted 316.5
billion US dollars in foreign capital. Of the total, 197.9 billion
US dollars are direct foreign investment and 118.6 billion are
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the country's foreign debt payment rate and debt
ratio stand at 11.81 percent and 13.97 percent, respectively,
lower than the international standard risk lines.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we should not overlook the problems existing in
our financial sector," cautioned the central bank governor, citing
the high rate of bad loans in the state commercial banks as a
major risk.
</P>
<P>
The very small number of non-banking financial institutions are
operating poorly, and a few of them even have payment problems.
</P>
<P>
To draw money from general public and enterprises, some
central department and government at local levels grant
permissions for setting up quasi-financial institutions which do
not have financial expertises and are not under strict financial
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Other problems, Dai added, include irregularities in stock and
futures markets.
</P>
<P>
"If not promptly addressed, these problems might seriously
undermine our credit and banking system, hamper with the national
economy and social stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dai pledged that the central bank should continue conducting
in-depth financial reform, strengthening its supervision and law
enforcement in the coming 1998 and carrying out a nationwide
inspection in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Bank Helps Support Lebanese Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's largest bank
the National Commercial Bank has lent more than 600 million U.S.
dollars to the Lebanese central bank to help it prop up the
Lebanese pound, local Beirut Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move follows speculations that the Lebanese government will
devalue the Lebanese pound under the current difficult economic
situation, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to bank sources, due to the bank loan, the Lebanese
currency has been strengthened from 1,531 pounds to one dollar to
1,523 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The three-year low-interest loan granted on December 24 will
increase the foreign reserves of Lebanon's central bank to about
6.4 billion dollars, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's central bank has spent 2 billion dollars this year to
support the pound.
</P>
<P>
The report of the Beirut Times said the move will enable the
Lebanese central bank to lower the interest rates in the near
future, and help the government pay back part of the public debt
which stands at about 13 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM Leaves for Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh left here today for a visit to
Saudi Arabia, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The visit will be "very important," especially as it follows
the official visit to the oil-rich neighbor by Crown Prince Hassan
in September, Tarawneh said in a statement released by the Petra
earlier.
</P>
<P>
He said he will discuss with the Saudi side issues concerning
bilateral ties, regional situations, the Middle East peace process
and the summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference held
recently in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with the Gulf giant has improved in recent
years after it distanced itself from Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War
which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan paid his first unofficial visit to Saudi
Arab early this year in six years and held talks with Saudi King
Fahd.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is now Jordan's second largest trading partner
after Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported 130 million Jordanian dinars
(about 184 million U.S. dollars) worth of goods to Saudi Arabia
compared to 70 million dinars (about 99 million dollars) in 1995,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Under a trade protocol, the two countries are expected to set
up a free trade zone by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Bird-to-Human Main Mode of H5N1 Transmission, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Test results related to the
first bird flu case detected in a human suggested that the main
mode of influenza A H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human, it
was known here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Antibody to the virus was found in nine blood samples out of
502 tested in relation to the first avian flu case detected in
Hong Kong. The antibody to the virus was detected mainly among
poultry workers and people directly exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the viral genes shows that they are avian in nature
without evidence of assortment with human influenza virus genes.
</P>
<P>
The results and findings were released today jointly by the
Hong Kong Department of Health, the World Health Organization and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the
United States. They stressed the observations were preliminary and
additional findings are expected by late January next year.
</P>
<P>
The results leave open the possibility of person-to-person
transmission. However, the absence of antibody among the family
members of the ill child and the overall low number of antibody
positive people in contact with the child suggested that such
transmission, if occurring, is relatively inefficient at this
time.
</P>
<P>
The nine persons tested positive of antibody were all from the
502 people in the "exposed group", made up of poultry workers,
people in contact with the boy and people working with the virus,
such as laboratory workers.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, another 419 people in a "comparison group" who had
no history of contact with the ill child were all negative for the
antibody.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up investigation of the nine antibody positive persons
indicated that five were poultry workers, one was a student with
exposure to poultry, one was a laboratory worker and one was a
person whose exposure history was not clear.
</P>
<P>
The remaining antibody positive person was a healthcare worker
who helped take care of the child. The healthcare worker gave no
history of exposure to poultry raising the possibility of
human-to-human transmission.
</P>
<P>
Director of Health Dr. Margaret Chan told the press conference
that the Hong Kong government has already initiated measures to
help make sure that chicken sold in the market are free of avian
flu.
</P>
<P>
"With the cooperation of the authorities of the China's inland,
export of chicken from the inland to Hong Kong has been
temporarily suspended to allow time to put in place a system in
the inland to ensure the health status of chicken exported to Hong
Kong and a system here to conduct rapid tests on chicken imported
again in the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
"So far, surveillance of local farms has not detected any
chicken that are positive for influenza A H5N1. The situation
will be closely monitored by the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the wholesale and retail level, blitz cleaning of chicken
stalls has been started and will continue over the next few days
to improve the hygiene conditions of these places, she went on.
</P>
<P>
The director concluded that "all these public health measures
are taken to ensure that chicken sold in Hong Kong are healthy and
to rebuild consumers' confidence."
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Health, the total number of
Influenza A H5N1 cases has so far reached 11 confirmed and nine
suspected, with three confirmed and one suspected dead.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Increasing Water Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said
here today that China faces worsening water problems in his report
to the on-going session of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Based on the result of inspections over the implementation of
the Water Law, Wang said: "The chances are growing that China
might suffer a possible severe water shortage in the first half of
the 21st century, and the reality will be stark for our nation."
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, groups of NPC Standing Committee members
made inspection tours of Heilongjiang, Henan and Hunan provinces
from September to October.
</P>
<P>
They found most flood-control projects in these provinces
inadequate and these projects will hardly be capable of resisting
big floods.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, large-scale development and construction
projects have either narrowed or blocked the waterway. In
additon, the situation is worsening by land reclamation projects
and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that the gap in water demand and supply
will become even more acute along with the expansion of national
economy and population.
</P>
<P>
"China is estimated to possibly reach its extreme in the
development of its water resource by the year 2030 when its
population reaches 1.6 billion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang noted, soil erosion and water pollution are
"appalling". About 3.6 million sq km of land, or 38 percent of the
country's total, are suffering from soil erosion and the figure is
rising at an average annual increase of 10,000 sq km, he added.
</P>
<P>
Half of the waterways in China's seven water systems have been
polluted to varying extent and one tenth of the water in these
areas is no longer usable.
</P>
<P>
"The situation cannot be resolved in the near future," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
He called for still closer attention to the problems and prompt
action to address the situation.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Exile Outpaces Brindabella </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Exile outpaced
her bigger rival Brindabella to take the lead in the 53rd
Sydney-to-Hobart race on Saturday after heavy weather took its
toll on Swedish contender Nicorette.
</P>
<P>
Race organisers said Warwick Miller's 20-meter Exile was about
two nautical miles ahead of Australian maxi Brindabella when the
boats made their scheduled afternoon position reports.
</P>
<P>
At current speed, Exile was on course to break the record for
the 630 nautical mile race south along Australia's east coast.
However, lighter winds ahead of a southerly front were forecast
overnight as the leaders entered Bass Strait off the southeastern
fringe of the Australian mainland, diminishing Exile's chance of
breaking the record.
</P>
<P>
German maxi Morning Glory set the record last year with a time
of two days 14 hours seven minutes and 10 seconds. To beat that
record, Exile must finish by 3.07 a.m. (1600 GMT) Monday.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Ex V-P Runs for Kenya's Presidency Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Mwai Kibaki, former Kenyan
Vice President and Chairman of the opposition Democratic Party
(DP), is seen as the most serious challenger to incumbent
President Daniel arap Moi in Monday's elections.
</P>
<P>
His popularity has risen from 13.7 percent in the first poll
at the end of November to 20.8 percent in the second after two
weeks of campaign and four days before the voting, second only to
Moi with 40.8 percent in the first poll and 40.2 in the second.
</P>
<P>
In his manifesto, Kibaki says he can transform Kenya into a
land of plenty and free from corruption, creating half a million
jobs every year by emphasising labor-intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
"I see a Kenya with enough to eat and spare, I see a land of
plenty, free from corruption. I promise a government that listens
to Kenyans and responds," said Kibaki.
</P>
<P>
A DP government will treat shelter as a basic human right, he
claimed, adding that his government shall set the ceiling for
mortgage interest rates at 10 percent for rural housing and 15
percent for inexpensive urban houses.
</P>
<P>
In the few months leading to the poll this year, his party has
suffered a number of telling defections, prominent among them is
the departure of Charity Ngilu, who now is also a serious rival
in the race.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Kibaki "has been variously described as a
scholar, technocrat, and one of the most brilliant minds in
Africa," the independent East African Standard newspaper
commented.
</P>
<P>
A member of Kikuyu, the largest tribe making up about 25
percent of Kenya's population, Kibaki is expected to do well in
Central Province.
</P>
<P>
Born in Othaya, Nyeri District, Central Kenya in 1931, little
Kibaki herded goats and cattle like most African children,
although his father, by local standards, was a wealthy man who
made his fortune originally by selling tobacco snuff.
</P>
<P>
The father had two wives with the second borne him five
children, Kibaki being the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki went to Gatuyaine Village School in 1940 from which he
proceeded to board Karima Mission School, then the prestigious
Mangu High School in Thika, before attending Makerere University,
in Kampala, Uganda in 1951 for a BA course in economics, history
and political science.
</P>
<P>
He thereafter enrolled at the London School of Economics in
1956 for a B. Sc. in public finance before returning to Makerere
as an economic lecturer.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki got involved in politics in 1960 as the National
Executive Officer of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and
became a member of parliament since the country's independence
from Britain in 1963.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Assistant Minister for Economic Planning and
Development the following year, and later promoted to Minister
for Commerce and Industry until 1969 when he switched to the
Finance and Planning portfolio.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as Minister for Finance and Planning between
1969-1978, he was constantly accused of employing in his ministry
people from his Kikuyu tribe and in particular residents of
Othaya Constituency which is his home town.
</P>
<P>
When Moi took over from late President Jomo Kenyatta, Kibaki
was elevated as the fourth vice president in independent Kenya in
October, 1978. He had served the post for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, Moi dismissed him from the vice presidency and
demoted him to Health Minister reportedly due to their disputes
over style, minor issues and personality differences.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Kibaki had just won Othaya parliamentary seat for
the third consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
In December 1991, he resigned from the government and in
January 1992 founded the DP. He stood against Moi in the first
democratic multi-party elections in December 1992 but only came
third in the poll after Moi and Kenneth Matiba, winning 19.45
percent of the vote -- a total of 1,035,507 votes.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki is a Christian and the father of three children.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairman on Implementation of Agriculture Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior legislator today
called for more input in agriculture, an improved grain
circulation system, faster spread of agro-techniques, alleviated
burden on farmers, and appropriate use of poverty-relief funds.
</P>
<P>
At a plenary meeting of the ongoing 29th session of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee this morning,
Buhe, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, made the appeal
in his report on inspecting the implementation of Agriculture Law.
</P>
<P>
In October this year, the NPC Standing Committee dispatched
three inspection teams to look into the law's implementation in
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Guizhou and Jiangxi
provinces.
</P>
<P>
That was the fourth time the NPC Standing Committee sent
inspection teams to look into the law's implementation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the standing committees of the provincial
people's congresses in Guangdong, Gansu, Hunan and Liaoning
provinces were asked to make investigations in this regard in
their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Buhe said both the central and local governments have increased
input in the agricultural sector and helped ease the farmers's
burden and improve the grain circulation system despite the
country's relatively-tight monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, there still exist some problems which
"should not be neglected but be resolved in the future work."
</P>
<P>
This year China scored a third consecutive good grain harvest,
which resulted in abundant farm produce and help push the national
economy forward. But there are some new problems that have cropped
up in the post-harvest period, Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he added, a grain circulation system to comply
with the socialist market economy and macro-control of the central
government have to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he urged local governments to take effective measures
to publicize advanced agricultural techniques.
</P>
<P>
With regard to farmers' burden, Buhe noted that the farmers in
some areas are still subjected to illegal fund-raising, random fee
collection and fining. Therefore, he called on local governments
to further increase management and to earnestly safeguard the
farmers' legitimate interests.

Presidential aide Jakes Gerwel said in a statement issued on

"We do trust that the matter of the detention of Dr. Kaunda
will be resolved speedily and in the interest of political
stability and good governance in Zambia and in our region," he
said.
</P>

Gerwel said Kaunda's detention, whatever the substantive
issues at stake, violated the commitment of the members of the

and maintenance of democracy, good governance and human rights
within the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan said here Saturday the foreign policy of his
country is aimed at protecting its national interests as well as
promoting political stability and economic cooperation in the
region .
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address at the Conference of Pakistan's South
Asia Envoys, Gohar underlined the imperatives of a rationally
formulated open foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the backdrop of "hegemony which is still
sought" and the continuation of tensions, Pakistan desires
cooperative relations with all countries for the common benefits
of all peoples.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has to steer a course which fundamentally protects
our national interests as well as promotes rapprochement,
political stability and economic cooperation in South Asia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the region remains mired in mutual suspicions
and distrust and old disputes and resultant tensions continue.
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir remains a major flash-point, large defense
establishments continue to burden our economies, new and more
sophisticated weapon systems are being inducted in our
neighborhood," he said.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament proposals and confidence building measures have
received dismissive responses, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It (Kashmir) continues to bedevil relations between Pakistan
and India, it is the primary reason for instability in South
Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister pointed out that under the leadership of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan has deliberately chosen the
path of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is not a single-point agenda with India, we are prepared
to address all outstanding issues between the two countries in a
meaningful and an integrated manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that resolution of differences between Pakistan and
India, particularly the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir, will
usher in a new era of cooperation and mutually beneficial
interaction in South Asia.

<P>
Dalian, situated at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula
where the Bohai and the Yellow seas meet, has a string of
beautiful islands, scenic spots, beaches and seashore resorts
along its coastline.
</P>
<P>
The city has organized a host of programs, including an annual
garment festival, Bingyu Fireworks and Ice Lantern Festival, to
advance development of tourism industry, Zhang Hongan, director of
the Dalian City Tourism Administration, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
More specialized tourist programs, such as "be a Dalian
resident for one day", "become a farmer in Dalian for one day",
are also being considered, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 150 tourist hotels, of which, 65 are of star
classification. The top ones are the Shangri-La Dalian Hotel,
which started business early this month, and the Ruruma Hotel.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty Zimbabweans, including
two babies, were killed and 106 others injured in 120 road
accidents reported throughout the country on Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day, The Herald daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police press and public relations officer Joe Manyakaidze was
quoted as saying that a total of 101 crashes were reported on
Christmas Day during which 74 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all motorists and road users to help preserve
life on the roads by exercising caution.
</P>
<P>
"The carnage on our roads can only be effectively reduced if
we all play our part," Manyakaidze noted.
</P>
<P>
The figures released so far suggest that the total number of
reported accidents this year is less than last year's 201 over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Christmas Day was relatively quiet throughout the country,
with police attributing this to a reduction on the volume of
traffic on the roads. The capital Harare recorded an unusually
low number of crashes which stood at 31 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As is the case over most holidays, drunken driving, speeding,
fatigue, and general lack of courtesy were the major cause of
accidents on the part of motorists, said the police officer.

<HEADLINE> Strike of Airline Pilots Banned in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Labor Secretary
Leonardo Quisumbing has ordered the ban of any strike or lockout
of Philippine Airlines pilots to prevent a disruption of services
especially during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Philippine Airlines said Saturday that
pilots who defy the order by participating in any illegal protest
action will automatically lose their employment status with the
airlines.
</P>
<P>
In his jurisdiction over the labor dispute between the airlines
and the Air Line Pilots Association of the Philippines assumed on
December 23, Quisumbing cited Philippine Airlines' indispensable
role to the national interest and that any work stoppage would
damage the economy.
</P>
<P>
"A strike at petitioner's work premises will undoubtedly
aggravate the financial woes of the petitioner which is still
reeling under the effects of heavy losses in the past few years,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Any strike or lockout might "choke the country's flag carrier
to death", not to mention its effect on the 14,000 employees and
their dependents and its grave and serious implications on the
national economy and the airline industry in particular, he added.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Airlines' pilots have staged several strikes in the
past two years for wage hike and other reasons, sometime seriously
disrupting the airline's services.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Earn More Despite Natural Adversities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Farmers' per-capita income in
east China's Shandong Province increased by more than 300 yuan
this year despite adverse weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
In late summer and early autumn the province suffered one of
the worst droughts in 80 years and a windstorm. Approximately five
million hectares of crops were affected, leading to losses of 3.3
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
However, diversified economic activities advocated by the
provincial government helped farmers make up for their losses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, by growing fruits and vegetables instead staples such
as wheat and rice, farmers increased their income by more than 100
yuan. Animal husbandry contributed approximately the same amount.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts to industrialize agriculture also provided
opportunities for farmers to earn extra money. The province has
established 25,000 agriculture-related businesses, which increased
more than 20 billion yuan (2.4 billion US dollars) in economic
returns.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou City, capital of east
China's Fujian Province, expects to put to use 1.25 billion
U.S. dollars in overseas funds and receive 2.01 billion
U.S. dollars in exports this year.
</P>
<P>
That would represent a rise of 11.6 percent in overseas funding
and 13 percent in exports over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The city, hometown of many overseas Chinese, now boasts 5,100
overseas-funded enterprises involving a total contractual
investment of over 13 billion U.S. dollars. The industrial output
of the enterprises in operation accounts for more than 60 percent
of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Due to marked improvement in the investment environment, the
city has attracted dozens of overseas-funded companies with
investments of 30 million U.S. dollars each or more.
</P>
<P>
The overseas-funded companies are mainly in the fields of
electronics, machine-building, textiles, chemicals, building
materials and aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The city has been turned into the country's largest center for
producing monitors, and turning out devices and automotive glass
products.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the city will approve 430
overseas-funded projects this year, up 5 percent from last year,
involving 1.18 billion U.S. dollars of contractual investment, up
6.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sales of joint ventures, cooperative enterprises and solely
foreign-funded companies are expected to top 30 billion yuan (3.75
billion U.S. dollars) this year, more than 18 percent more than
1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year these overseas-funded companies received 1.51 billion
U.S. dollars in exports, or 85 percent of the city's total,
according to local statistics.

<P>
HANOI, December 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. citizen wanted for the
alleged murder of five people in the United States has been
arrested in Vietnam as part of an Intepol investigation.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thanh Thang, a 32-year-old American with Vietnamese
origin, was detained on December 22 by Vietnam's investigation
department, said a report in the Vietnam News Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrest at the Bac Lieu Township in the southern
province of Bac Lieu, Thang had been on the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation's (FBI) list of 10 most-wanted criminals.
</P>
<P>
Born in the southern province of Soc Trang, Thang immigrated to
the United States in 1984, where he worked as a cook for Nhung, a
Vietnamese resident living in New York, until he was fired.
</P>
<P>
Thang, together with another U.S. citizen named Thrlomi Ther,
allegedly broke into Nhung's house and murdered Nhung and her
husband and fled to Canada and then to Vietnam in June 1992.
</P>

The FBI informed Vietnam's police about the case last August
via Interpol's Vietnam Office.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Fund for Food Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Saturday an additional government
allocation for the Fund for Food Scheme as part of the
government's efforts to promote and finance new investments in the
food sector to increase domestic food production.
</P>
<P>
after a meeting with local food producers here, Anwar, who is
also Finance Minister, told reporters that the increment of 100
million ringgit (about 3.87 ringgit is equal to one U.S. dollar)
for the Fund for Food Scheme, bringing the total to 700 million
ringgit, was also to contain inflationary pressures, prevent the
erosion of real incomes and reduce the import bill on food to
conserve foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the operational guidelines of the Fund, introduced
in 1993, which provides a minimum borrowing of 50,000 ringgit and
a maximum of three million ringgit per project at an interest rate
of 4 percent per annum to Malaysian-owned companies and
individuals, would remain unchanged and would continue to be
administered by the State Bank.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the decision to expand the Fund
was to tackle the inadequate supply of food from domestic sources
which would contribute to domestic price pressures and increase
the already large food import bill.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of the year, Malaysia imported food
worth 7.9 billion ringgit. According to Anwar, the bill is likely
to increase to 10 billion ringgit or 10 percent higher than last
year's total of 9.0 billion ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Food consumption accounts for slightly more than a third of
Malaysia's average household expenditure, Anwar said, adding that
increases in food prices contributed 56 percent of the increase in
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the first 11 months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Financing under the scheme will be used for primary food
production, including aquaculture, animal husbandry, vegetable and
fruit farming as well as production of related food products,
mainly processed food for which the raw food materials must be
obtained from domestic sources and for local consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Fund can also be used to finance projects that will lead to
more efficient distribution of food and food products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,023 applications involving a sum of 301.3 million
ringgit have been approved since the Fund was introduced in 1993.

<HEADLINE> More Jobs Created by Foreign Projects in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 21,000 new jobs are
expected to be created this year in 363 foreign investment
projects valued at over eight billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 600
million U.S. Dollars) approved by the Zimbabwe Investment Center.
</P>
<P>
According to the center's latest foreign investment
information for January to November of this year, 363 foreign
investment projects are expected to create 21,401 jobs in seven
sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The positive response by the investors from various countries
in Europe, the United States, Africa, Asia and the Middle East,
was a result of the government's massive campaign to market the
country as the best investment place in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The projects approved range from manufacturing to tourism. Of
the 363 projects approved, over 303 were joint ventures between
foreign investors and local business people, in line with the
government's policy which encourages such ventures to ensure that
the local business people acquire skills to enable them to run
the companies when the foreign investors pull out.
</P>
<P>
The other 60 were direct foreign investments involving no
local partners.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accounted for a bigger percentage of the total
investment value, while Britain ranked the second.

buy players.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankans Warned of Tainted Beef Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan medical experts
have warned the locals to be cautious of the Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) agent that causes the "mad cow" disease, the
official newspaper Daily News said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The warning was issued in the wake of reports that said beef
products from Britain had been distributed free to the locals who
bought a Sunday newspaper recently.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tissa Vitarana, an official of the Ministry of
Science, Technology and Human Resources Development, said the
Healthy Ministry should initiate investigations to find out
whether the free beef products distributed with the newspaper were
contaminated with the "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government has banned the import of beef
products from Britain in June in order to keep the fatal "mad cow"
disease, which was first found in Britain, out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world have banned imports of British beef
products to prevent the disease from spreading to their lands.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said that medical experts here also urged the
government to raise public awareness of the disease by launching a
nationwide education program.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Relaxes Material Imports for Feed Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has agreed
to relax its policy on imports of maize, soybean meal and fishmeal
which are used as raw materials in the local animal feed industry
to help reduce its production cost.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet earlier this week lifted the import quota
limits for soybean meal and fishmeal for 1998, according to the
Thai Animal Feed Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
But the government set a quota of 300,000 tons for maize
imports which will be allowed between March 1 and June 30 next
year, the association said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Also, the government will maintain low tariffs on the imports
and allow the imports on conditions that the prices of these
products on the domestic market will not fall below a certain
level.
</P>
<P>
The duty on soybean meal for 1998 will be reduced to five
percent from 10 percent beginning on January 1 next year. Yet if
the soybean prices on the domestic market fall below 8.50 baht per
kilogram, the imports will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Imports of fishmeal will face a duty of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local animal feed producers expressed welcome to the new policy
to help them bring down the rising cost of imported raw materials
after the baht depreciated.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Ukrainian Army to Survive Through Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's armed forces will
survive the country's economic crisis through reorganization and
international cooperation, Defense Minister Alexander Kuzmuk said.
</P>
<P>
"The army needs to be reorganized so it will fit in with
economic realities while remaining capable of protecting the
country's borders," Kuzmuk said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and international cooperation have saved money and
improved the army's efficiency, he said, adding "the armed force
have gradually gained prestige both at home and abroad."
</P>
<P>
Once worked in Angola, Ukrainian peacekeepers have been part of
the United Nations contingent in East Slovenia, the multi-national
force in Bosnia; and served as U.N. observers in Tadjikistan.
</P>
<P>
But due to years of sluggish economy, the armed force have been
severely under-funded. In 1997, the military got from the national
budget about 800 million hryvnas (428 million U.S. dollars), 44
percent of what the Defense Ministry asked for.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to blame the ministry but that won't change
anything," Kuzmuk said. "We've got to find ways of using what
budget we do have efficiently."
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has started to tighten expenditures and
sell off surplus military property, he said. "We've already cut
out more than 500 military structures, which has allowed us to
save considerable sums."
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, another important way out of the
economic difficulties is through disarmament.
</P>
<P>
On December 24, Kuzmuk announced that the number of military
staff will be cut by 75,000 to 400,000 in 1998. Ultimately,
Ukraine's armed forces will number no more than 350,000.

ROME, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Small businesses in Italy Friday
urged commercial banks to cut their lending rates in line with the

"The cut in the discount rate was a good news for small

</P>

"Now other banks should follow and pass on cheaper credit to
business," Casoni said.

<P>
He said commercial banks should act "immediately so as to allow
the Italian economy to make up the excessively large gap that
separates us from the countries we compete with."
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way," he said, "the credit system can match
the courage the businesses have already shown by reducing their
profit margins and thus contributing to the slowing of inflation."

The fishing and livestock exports totaled 301.36 million
U.S. dollars in January-November, or 75 million more than the same
period of last year, the Foreign Trade Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase of sales abroad to the
growth of fishing products exports.
</P>
<P>
The export of fresh, refrigerated and frozen fish went up by
74.4 percent, dried and smoked fish by 41.1 percent, dried shrimp
39.1 percent, and fish filet 57.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the country's meat exports made only 26.7 million dollars,
a 28.26 percent drop, mainly because of the reduction of the
demand in the United States, the main market for Costa Rica.

JAKARTA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Friday announced the establishment of a stock market custodian and
settlement company, and issued new capital market regulations in a
bid to boost and further secure trading activities on the
country's flagging bourses.
</P>
<P>
Basically, the new rules are aimed at bolstering legal bases
and provide new opportunities to capital market players, Minister
of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said when he made the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The new company, which will facilitate scripless stock trading
on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, is expected to start early March,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations introduced asset-backed securities and
Indonesian depository receipts as new instruments in the market.
</P>
<P>
With the issuance of new rules, Mar'ie said, companies wishing
to get fresh funds could sell their nonliquid assets, including
future earnings, to investors through investment managers and
custodian banks.
</P>
<P>
As for investors, asset-backed securities could serve as an
investment instrument alternative.
</P>
<P>
Some of the new regulations are aimed at promoting the
professionalism of stock companies, giving information to the
public, and regulating business mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange composite index, the main price
gauge for the Indonesia stock market, dropped 37.86 percent from

<P>
CARACAS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's economy will
finish 1997 with a registered 5.1 percent growth rate, a big
increase over the 1.6 percent decrease of last year, the Central
Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had run at an annual rate of 38 percent, much less
than last year's 103.2 percent, said the bank's president, Antonio
Casa Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
He said tax revenue increased 24.5 percent this year, the
highest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth was boosted by an 8.8 percent
increase in the oil sector, and a 19 percent growth in fixed gross
investments, with an 11.2 and 11.4 percent increases for oil and
non-oil exports respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, Venezuela registered a trade surplus of 11.4 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997 which was less than last year's, due to an
increase of 12.311 billion dollars in imports.

</P>
<P>
It has exceeded the target of chalking up annual sales of 10

The conglomerate was named to be a national high-tech
enterprise group on Friday by the State Science and Technology
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The group company has an average increase of 86 percent on
sales over the past 13 years. The stunning growth has elevated
Hai'er, which used to be a small factory, into the ranks of the
biggest electrical appliance manufacturers in China.
</P>
<P>
Creation of brand-name Haier is the most important strategy for
the group's quick development, Zhang Ruimin, chairman of the board

</P>
<P>
Haier refrigerators have stayed in the first place for 10
consecutive years in the competitions of national light industrial

conditioners, and washing machines have all come first in terms of

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans working abroad
have remitted 633 million U.S. dollars of foreign exchange to
their home country during the first three quarters this year, the
Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau predicted that total remittances for 1997 will reach
833 million dollars. Last year the remittances stood at 767
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the increase in foreign employment earnings to
the implementation of a policy which requires overseas job seekers
to register with the bureau before proceeding abroad.
</P>
<P>
Job seekers need to provide proper training certificates so as
to obtain a special security stamp from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The stamp indicates that the holder has fulfilled requirements
of the SLBFE and he or she is allowed to obtain an air ticket.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are about one million Sri Lankans working
abroad, of which 60 to 70 percent are in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The SLBFE plans to increase the number of foreign employment
opportunities for locals by 20 percent by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's listed
non-financial companies are expected to suffer dramatic foreign
exchange losses as a result of the weakening Thai currency,
according to the Nation newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The combined foreign exchange losses of the 169 such companies
jumped more 75 percent in baht terms this quarter from the last
quarter when it was about 36 baht to the US dollar, compared with
45 in this quarter.
</P>
<P>
Their total foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter of
the year are estimated at 367 billion baht (8.16 billion US
dollars), as against 207 billion baht (5.75 billion dollars)
during July-September.
</P>
<P>
The losses result from the baht's lower exchange rate against
major foreign currencies, higher funding costs and higher costs in
imported materials.
</P>
<P>
The 169 listed non-financial companies are in all major
industrial sectors, including capital-intensive industries and the
agribusiness.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Government States Strategy for Chiapas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 26 (Xinhua) -- A government envoy arrived
in Mexico's southeastern state of Chiapas on Friday with a
four-point strategy aimed at achieving peace with rebels following
the massacre of 45 indigenous people earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said his mission was to "seek closer
ties (with the rebels) to resume a dialogue".
</P>
<P>
In the Chenalho municipality of the state, a gang of masked
gunmen, wielding assault rifles, on Monday killed 21 women, nine
men, 14 children and one infant who were fleeing violence from
other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
The government believed the assailants were from neighboring
communities that house the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the
country's best-known rebels.
</P>
<P>
One point of the strategy, Coldwell said, was to seek a
rapprochement with the Zapatista rebels to re-open dialogue in the
best conditions.
</P>
<P>
The second point was, with credible investigations, to find and
punish the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Coldwell said the third point was related to the implementation
of preventive actions to avoid the repetition of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
The fourth point was to ratify the political and social
guidelines to remedy the high degree of backwardness and poverty
in the Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatistas rose up on New Year's Day 1994 to demand better
living conditions for the state's impoverished ethnic Maya
majority, and to fight for democratic reform nationwide. Talks
between the government and the Zapatistas broke off in September
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Peru strengthened relations with
the neighboring countries and economic blocs during 1997, the
Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry gave priority to political dialogue, consolidation
of border integration programs, and development of proposals of
economic integration and complementary strategies, said sources in
the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Several integration programs were carried out involving
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, the United
States, Japan, and China.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Brazil were promoted through the Ilo (Peru)-La
Paz (Bolivia)-Cuiaba (Brazil) corridor.
</P>
<P>
With Colombia, Peru gave priority to drafting the plan for the
integral development of the Putumayo River watershed, which
comprises 14 projects in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Peru promoted progress in the talks for other integration
processes at a world level, starting with an expanded market
between the Andean Community of Nations and the Southern Common
Market.
</P>
<P>
Peru joined plans to create a free trade zone in all the
continent for the next century.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also started discussions in the past year on a
cooperation program with the European Union during the 1998-2000
period.
</P>
<P>
Dialogue and cooperation mechanisms were promoted to identify
new interests and modalities in Peru's relations with Russia and
the countries of central and eastern Europe, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
An adequate framework created with China to develop bilateral
relations in the commercial and economic fields had contributed to
the expansion of Peru's commerce. China's investments in Peru's
mining and oil exploration industries amounted to 250 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Peru joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum
in 1997. Its trade exchange with the APEC nations increased 173
percent during the 1990-1996 period.

<HEADLINE> China's New Goal for Oil, Gas Production Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) is expected to produce 16.2 million tons of oil
and four billion cu m of natural gas (equivalent to four million
tons of oil ) this year.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas output will be two million tons equivalent more
than that of last year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yan, president of the corporation, his
company's total sales will be 14.8 billion yuan (1.78 billion US
dollars) this year, and its net profits will total 3.3 billion
yuan (397 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company, with only 28,000 employees on the payroll, has
created high production efficiency and high economic benefits
thanks to careful decision-making and strict management. Its
overall productivity per capita is expected to hit 275,000 yuan
(33,000 US dollars) this year, far higher than that of most
companies in China.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC has reduced its asset-liability ratio to 39 percent
by repaying commercial loans in advance, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
The company invests 1.5 billion yuan (180 million US dollars)
into risk exploration annually, with the purpose of finding more
oil and gas reserves. In this passing year of 1997, it has
verified 176 million tons of oil and 8.6 billion cu m of gas and
has achieved a success ratio of 80 percent for wildcat drilling.
</P>
<P>
Major exploration progress has been made in Pearl River
estuary, the Bohai Bay and the East China Sea, which have paved
the way for CNOOC's new round of large scale development.
</P>
<P>
The company will produce 30 million tons of oil equivalent by
the year 2005 in line with its overrun plan, Wang noted. To better
utilize oil and gas resources, CNOOC is actively developing
several downstream petrochemical projects.
</P>
<P>
Benefiting from successful foreign cooperation, CNOOC has
achieved great development since its establishment in 1982. So
far, it has drawn six billion U.S. dollars of direct foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, CNOOC has participated in four overseas projects in
Indonesia, Myanmar, Mexico and Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government
announced Friday that it would return the properties confiscated
in the 1930's during the civil war period to the former owners --
political parties and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said this indicated that "a historical
account has been settled" on the country's democratization process.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Spain, from 1936 to 1939, was a prelude to the
world war against Fascism in the 1930's and 1940's. The properties
of all the parties and labor unions that joined the anti-Fascism
front during the civil war were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the properties has been an outstanding issue
in the country since political parties were re-legalized in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Communist Party, Socialist Workers Party
and the Basque Nationalist Party will get back their confiscated
properties.
</P>
<P>
The government would establish a special property
administration to handle the confiscation issues, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Village Hires Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Huaxi, a renowned model
village in east China's Jiangsu Province, now has a dozen foreign
experts working in its factories. But village head Wu Renbao still
wants to hire more foreign experts to help them.
</P>
<P>
"We are thinking of hiring more foreign technical and
managerial personnel to meet the needs of local economic growth,"
said Wu. "We need them to help us tap the potential of our village
to the full."
</P>
<P>
As the most prosperous village in China's eastern coastal
regions, Huaxi has about 40 village-run enterprises, ten of which
are foreign-funded ventures involving in iron and steel casting,
paper making, textiles and machine-building. They have so far
hired more than 10 experts from six countries and regions
including Britain, France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
These foreign experts are on good terms with villagers and are
doing good jobs at their posts. "Comrade Peng", as local people
often call one of the two Americans experts who have been working
there since the early last year, said: "Though I have not worked
long enough here, I have already cherished profound feelings for
the village and I'm resolved to work harder still along with
villagers and build up a splendid tomorrow with them."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economic Slowdown to Hurt Banks in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The expected economic slowdown
next year will surely hurt the Philippines' banking industry since
it will result in higher non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Local press Saturday quoted a report by the U.S. investment
bank JP Morgan as saying that the dead loans are expected to move
up to six to seven percent of the total loan portfolio by the end
of 1998 from this year's three percent.
</P>
<P>
This is because more companies will slow down their production
and some others will completely halt expansion as a result of the
currency meltdown and higher interest rates in the country, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"This notable slowdown in economic growth will certainly impair
the banks' performance," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the report pointed out that the impact of
the economic slowdown will be mitigated by the underlying strength
of the local banks.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan considered the Philippine banking industry as one of
the "less vulnerable" when compared with those of Thailand,
Malaysia and other countries in Southeast Asia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
JP Morgan also expected the Philippines' gross domestic
product, total goods and services produced inside the country, to
grow by only 2.5 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, government economic planners and some economic
analysts said the economy will grow steadily next year.
</P>
<P>
Economic Development Secretary Cielito Habito said the
country's gross national product and gross domestic product will
grow by 4.5 and 4 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Increases in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Ibrahim Ferradaz, Cuba's
minister of foreign investment and economic cooperation, said
Friday that more overseas investment flowed into Cuba in 1997 than
before.
</P>
<P>
He described it as a failure of the United States Helms-Burton
law to scare investors away.
</P>
<P>
Ferradaz said Cuba is finishing 1997 with about 300 foreign
capital associations and 160 foreign operators in the duty-free
zones, a big growth over last year's.
</P>
<P>
After the three duty-free zones entered into operation, the
number of requests by new operators continued to increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba signed 30 agreements with other countries in 1997
to promote investments, including 15 signed after the promulgation
of the Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the United States hardened its embargo imposed on
Cuba with the Helms-Burton law, which intends to scare foreign
investments by imposing sanctions against companies and
businessmen who would do business with this Caribbean nation.

<HEADLINE> Gaza Beats West Bank in Palestinian Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The Gaza Strip defeated the
West Bank in the first game of the first-ever Palestinian Football
Championships in Jericho, West Bank on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The club from the Gaza town of Rafah beat the West Bank's
al-Bira club 3-2 in the first match of the two-game championship,
which has been plagued by Israel's control over movement between
the two territories.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the Gaza team received the necessary permits
to enter the West Bank, Israel had held up the permits for three
of the players, including the starting goalie for the winners,
said Palestinian Football union official Badr Mekki.
</P>
<P>
The three finally arrived in Jericho during the final minutes
of the game, too late to play but in time to celebrate the victory.
</P>
<P>
A contingent of around 200 Gazan students and Palestinian
Authority employees were on hand to cheer on their team.
</P>
<P>
But since permit restrictions prevent the bulk of fans from
attending the championship, a second game is planned to be held in
the Gaza Strip at a later date. The winner -- on goals if the
teams split the games -- wins the first ever Palestine Cup.
</P>
<P>
The Gaza Strip match had been scheduled for last Friday, but
heavy rains scuttled the match and the West Bank players had to
return home immediately since their permits allowed them to stay
in Gaza only 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians are required to obtain a permit from Israel to
move from the West Bank to the Gaza Strip and vice versa, but
permits are frequently rejected for the slightest "security
reason."
</P>
<P>
The Palesitnians have been unable to field a unified national
team because of difficulties getting players from the two areas on
the same field for practice, union officials say.
</P>
<P>
So now all games abroad are played either by a fully Gazan or
West Bank team.

Friday in an effort to avoid a drug scandal when the country hosts
next year's World Cup in June and July.

The testing is part of a intensified crackdown when officials
confirmed several new doping cases in October. Several players
have tested positive for steroids or illegal drug use.
</P>

The French Football Federation (FFF) at the time backed a
get-tough plan to fight doping by establishing new guidelines with
clubs, players, trainers and doctors ahead of the 1998 World Cup.

GRONINGEN, Netherlands, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian
Viswanathan Anand and Englishman Michael Adams settled for half a
point each in the first of their four-game FIDE World Chess
Championship match here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The winner will go on to challenge FIDE world champion Anatoly
Karpov over six games in Lausanne, Switzerland starting New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
Adams, playing white, responded to Anand's Sicilian Defense by
sacrificing a central pawn on move 7 for a slight advantage in
space and a kingside attack.
</P>
<P>
But Anand defended diligently and though Adams won back his
pawn during a burst of exchanges, the game transposed into a
drawish endgame with rooks and pawns.
</P>
<P>
The two grandmasters agreed a draw on move 55. There was a
single white pawn remaining on the board, but Anand's black king
was about to pounce on it.
</P>
<P>
It will be Anand's turn to play with the white pieces when the
two grandmasters return to the Martinihal for game two Saturday.

<HEADLINE> France Spends Christmas Full of Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 26 (Xinhua) -- In France, this year's Christmas
was marked by a series of accidents, some of them very bizarre,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
A 61-year-old woman was devoured by 10 dogs in a small town
called Chanteheux in Meurthe-et-Moselle, eastern France, said
police. The body of Micheline Brindel was discovered by her
husband in her sleeping room this evening.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old girl riding a motorcycle was killed by a running
train on a railtrack in Albertville, Savoie in eastern France.
Emilie Louvet died instantly after bumping with the train which
threw her to a wall nearby, said reports.
</P>
<P>
A woman falsely accused an employee of a record library in
Avignon, southern France, of raping, because the man, who played
Santa Claus during the Christmas, ordered her out of the shop for
her drunkenness the day before.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified 32-year-old woman reported to police at four
o'clock this morning that she was raped in a restroom by a Santa
Claus, but several witnesses and a doctor's report countered her
statement before she was forced to withdraw the accusation.
</P>
<P>
The traffic of buses in the southcentral city of Dijon came to
a standstill today after a bus driver was beaten with baseball bat
by a man who came up to his bus. The unions appealed for a strike
to protest the attack.
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old man was arrested today after biting a policeman
and kicking several others in Strasbourg. The accident took place
after Ismail Kaoulal quarrelled with police who blamed him for not
parking his car the right way.
</P>
<P>
A man who tried to commit suicide with gas severely burned
himself and put his house in flame in Belfort in eastern France
Thursday night. Explosion was heard from the garage of the victim
who was staying in his car with gas bottles and had kept the motor
running.
</P>
<P>
A man was found lying dead on a road in Dordogne, southwest
France. Police said he was apparently crushed by a car which had
fled afterwards, said reports.
</P>
<P>
A dozen vehicles were burnt down by unknown people on the
Christmas eve on Wednesday and today in Strasbourg, reports quoted
police as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses Iraq's Accusation as "Ridiculous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday dismissed as "ridiculous" the Iraqi accusation that
Washington was planning air strikes with chemical or biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We term this ridiculous," said a White House spokesman. "We
do not have these weapons in our operational inventory."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council and the regional Command
of the ruling Baath party held a meeting earlier on Friday,
discussing any possible reprisals from the United States after
Iraq refused to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to enter
presidential areas for checking whether there hide any weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi official spokesman told the Iraqi news agency INA
after that meeting that Washington was likely to "launch
military strikes on these sites and others, using mass
destruction weapons which contain chemical and biological
elements, so that it can say, after the strikes, that its
allegations were right."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the United States was planning to take air strikes on
Iraq with conventional weapons, without any chemical or biological
component, the White House spokesman said he would have "no
comment on that."
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly warned Iraq that it would
not rule out the use of force if Baghdad does not comply with
U.N. inspections regime.
